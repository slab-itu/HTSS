A cell-autonomous tumour suppressor role of RAF1 in hepatocarcinogenesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer deaths, but its molecular heterogeneity hampers the design of targeted therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, the only therapeutic option for advanced HCC is Sorafenib, an inhibitor whose targets include RAF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, RAF1 expression is reduced in human HCC samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modelling RAF1 downregulation by RNAi increases the proliferation of human HCC lines in xenografts and in culture; furthermore, RAF1 ablation promotes chemical hepatocarcinogenesis and the proliferation of cultured (pre)malignant mouse hepatocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phenotypes depend on increased YAP1 expression and STAT3 activation, observed in cultured RAF1-deficient cells, in HCC xenografts, and in autochthonous liver tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus RAF1, although essential for the development of skin and lung tumours, is a negative regulator of hepatocarcinogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This unexpected finding highlights the contribution of the cellular/tissue environment in determining the function of a protein, and underscores the importance of understanding the molecular context of a disease to inform therapy design.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the commonest primary liver malignancy and the fifth most frequent cancer death cause in men.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incidence is highest in developing countries but cases in the Western World are increasing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 5-year survival rate is poor, biomarkers and molecule-based therapies are lacking, and resistance to currently used chemotherapies is common.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HCC correlates with hepatitis virus B or C infection, but also with exposure to aflatoxin B, alcohol abuse and obesity1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Liver injury is a strong proliferative stimulus for surviving hepatocytes, which re-enter cell cycle to maintain organ mass and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Injury/regeneration cycles favour the accumulation of genetic alterations and thus oncogenic hepatocyte transformation, ultimately leading to liver cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of the Wnt/catenin pathway combined with oxidative stress metabolism and RAS/ERK pathway, loss of tumour suppressor genes, and mutations in chromatin regulators are most frequently observed; overexpression or activation of receptor tyrosine kinases such as ERB2 and MET, of the mTOR pathway, as well as CMYC (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2) and the transcriptional co-activator YAP1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3), are observed with varying frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activating mutations of the interleukin 6 (IL6) receptor subunit GP130 and of the transcription factor STAT3 are frequent in inflammatory HCC4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Hepatocarcinogenesis can be recapitulated in the mouse, allowing functional analysis of specific signalling pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic manipulation of JNK and p38 MAPK or the NF-kB pathway induce hepatocarcinogenesis or accelerate chemically driven tumorigenesis by increasing hepatocyte apoptosis, compensatory proliferation and/or inflammation6; pathways converging on STAT3 promote the progression of premalignant cancer progenitor cells7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the Hippo pathway and its target YAP1 are key regulators of hepatocyte differentiation in tumourigenesis3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'RAF1 is a kinase best known as the effector linking RAS to MEK/ERK activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional essential functions of RAF1 rely on proteinprotein interaction-based cross-talk with other pathways including Hippo, whose function is antagonized by RAF1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the mouse, Raf1 ablation causes liver apoptosis9,10, suggesting an essential function in this organ and a potential role in liver cancer development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to this expectation, patient data show reduced RAF1 expression in human HCCs; based on this, we have investigated the role of RAF1 in HCC using two different mouse models: (1) HCC xenografts and (2) hepatocarcinogenesis induced by the alkylating agent diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and promoted by Phenobarbital (Pb), which mimics human disease in terms of gene expression profiles and critically depends on inflammation11,12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both models have revealed a tumour suppressor function of RAF1 in HCC, consistent with the reduced RAF1 expression in HCC patients.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Loss of RAF1 promotes HCC development', 'We analysed RAF1 expression in paired tumour and non-tumour tissue of each of 31 human HCC specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RAF1 expression in tumours was significantly lower compared with the matched surrounding non-tumour tissue, and the degree of RAF1 expression in tumour (defined as the ratio of RAF1 expression in matched tumour/non-tumour tissues) negatively correlated with tumour grade (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was surprising for us but it is backed up by the data in the protein atlas, showing that RAF1 expression is low or undetectable in HCC samples probed with two different antibodies (http://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000132155-RAF1/cancer/tissue/liver+cancer).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "Figure 1: RAF1 is expressed at low levels in human HCC and suppresses the growth of both HCC xenografts and chemically induced tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) RAF1 expression in a cohort of 31 HCC patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Left panel, representative IHC image (T, tumour; NT, non-tumour).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 50 m.

Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of doxycycline to the medium strongly increased the proliferation of Hep3B RAF1 KD cells (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, a tremendous increase in tumour mass was observed in HCC xenografts in nude mice when RAF1 was knocked down in vivo by adding doxycycline to the drinking water (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, we examined the role of RAF1 in the development of autochthonous liver tumours using conditional RAF1 ablation in hepatocytes (parenchymal cells) and bile duct cells (AlfpCre;Raf1F/F mice, heretofore referred to as hep) as well as global deletion of RAF1 by injecting MxCre;Raf1F/F mice with Poly I:C (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15) (termed p/np; RAF1 ablated in parenchymal and non-parenchymal liver cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion was efficient and did not affect the expression of other RAF kinases (Supplementary Fig 1a and b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mice did not develop spontaneous liver tumours but were more sensitive than controls to DEN/Pb-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A significant increase in macroscopic tumours was obvious in hep livers 30 weeks after DEN treatment; liver:body weight ratio, tumour numbers and tumour-occupied area were significantly higher in hep mice than in controls (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most lesions were adenomas comprising hepatocytes with a high nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio and compressing the surrounding liver parenchyma; however, 4 out 6 hep animals developed HCC (showing trabecular growth patterns, high cellularity and low nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio), compared with 1 out of 6 controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the survival rate of hep mice was decreased (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In p/np mice, liver:body weight ratios and tumour-occupied areas were only slightly increased; however, RAF1 ablation increased tumour multiplicity (Fig 1e) and malignancy (7 out of 10 p/np animals developed HCC, compared with 3 out of 8 F/F mice).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, RAF1 suppresses chemical hepatocarcinogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Analysis of both models revealed low, similar numbers of apoptotic cells in control and hep or p/np tumour-bearing livers (Supplementary Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mitotic indexes were similar in tumours of all genotypes (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, more cycling cells, mostly non-parenchymal (Np cells), were present in the non-tumour tissue of hep, but not p/np livers (Fig 1f, Supplementary Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dominant non-parenchymal cell type in livers of all genotypes were F4/80+ cells, mostly concentrated around portal veins; hep livers contained more macrophages, granulocytes and CD3+ cells than controls (Fig 1g), while this increase was not observed in p/np livers (Supplementary Fig 1h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numbers of F4/80+ cells were similar in tumours of all genotypes (Supplementary Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, RAF1 ablation in parenchymal cells led to increased inflammation in tumour-bearing livers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, the monocyte chemoattractant CCL2 was elevated in the blood of hep animals (Fig 1h), and hep livers contained increased amounts of chemokines (CCL2, 4, 5 and 7; CXCL1) and cytokines (IL2, IL4, IL5, IL6, IL10, IL27, TNF, IL1, IFN; Fig 1i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the levels of both serum chemokines and liver chemokines/cytokines detected in p/np mice were comparable to those of controls, except CCL2 which was slightly elevated (Supplementary Fig 1i and j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in most chemical models of hepatocarcinogenesis16, fibrosis or cirrhosis were not detected (Supplementary Fig 1k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, RAF1 ablation in hepatocytes increased tumour multiplicity, whereas lack of RAF1 in non-parenchymal cells restrained inflammation leading to reduced tumour size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Carcinogenesis in the DEN model critically depends on the interplay between hepatocytes and inflammatory macrophages13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells express FSP1, a protein involved in macrophage recruitment and chemotaxis in vivo17, as well as high amounts of chemokines and cytokines18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FSP1+ cells increased during carcinogenesis in livers of all genotypes; however, the increase in hep organs was significantly higher than in control and p/np livers (Supplementary Fig 2a and b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the slightly elevated CCL2 levels in tumour-bearing p/np mice, RAF1-deficient hepatocytes expressed higher basal and LPS-induced levels of this chemokine (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, RAF1-deficient macrophages failed to migrate into matrigel plugs containing CCL2 in vivo (Supplementary Fig 2c) or in a transwell assay in culture (Supplementary Fig 2d); treatment with low concentrations of a chemical inhibitor of the RAF1 interaction partner ROK (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8) restored migration (Supplementary Fig 2d and e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RAF1-deficient and proficient macrophages produced similar amounts of chemo- and cytokines (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data imply that widespread RAF1 ablation impairs the recruitment of macrophages to the tumour-bearing p/np livers, limiting the inflammatory reaction and restraining the growth, but not the onset of DEN/Pb-induced tumours originating from RAF1-deficient hepatocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'RAF1 ablation increases the number of cancer progenitor cells', 'We next determined the impact of RAF1 on the early stages of chemical hepatocarcinogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Liver damage and the number of apoptotic and cycling cells following DEN administration were indistinguishable in hep, p/np and F/F organs (Supplementary Fig 3ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Later during tumourigenesis, however, more cycling hepatocytes could be detected in RAF1-deficient livers (8 weeks after carcinogen application in hep and 12 weeks in p/np livers; Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, foci of altered hepatocytes19 (http://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/resources/liverpath/hyperplast/index.cfm#focicellular) were observed in all genotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These foci contained Ki67+ cells and cells expressing the liver cancer progenitor marker CD44 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7), and increased YAP1, a key negative regulator of hepatocyte differentiation20 (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The foci were more frequently observed in RAF1-deficient than in F/F livers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, conditional ablation of RAF1 by two different Cre transgenes accelerates hepatocarcinogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The faster proliferative reaction of hep mice is likely due to increased inflammation (exemplified by macrophage recruitment, Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the role of hepatocyte RAF1 in an inflammatory environment similar to that of F/F mice (Supplementary Fig 2b, Supplementary Fig 1j), we concentrated on the p/np model and quantified the number of liver cancer progenitor cells 16 weeks after DEN treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Progenitors express high levels of the adhesion molecule CD44, which promotes cellcell adhesion, and are therefore mostly found in aggregate-containing liver fractions7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of liver cancer progenitor cells (defined as CD44+/CD31 Ter119 CD45) was significantly increased in RAF1-deficient organs (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: RAF1 ablation increases the number of cancer progenitor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Quantification of Ki67+ liver cells 8 (top panel) or 12 weeks (bottom panel) after DEN treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Foci of altered hepatocytes (FAH) in F/F and hep or p/np livers isolated 12 weeks after DEN injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were stained with H&E or with the indicated antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FAH are delimited by dotted circles (n=3 per genotype).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars, 50 m.

this was surprising for us but it is again consistent with the data in the protein atlas, showing that STAT3 expression is weak in cancer in general and undetectable in 4083% of HCC samples with 4 out of 5 antibodies used (http://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000168610-STAT3/cancer/tissue/liver+cancer).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As previously shown for pSTAT3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25), STAT3 nuclear staining was restricted to few cells in most of the samples; however, the ratio of RAF1/YAP1 expression in the same tumour negatively correlated with the presence of medium to large clusters of STAT3 nuclear staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, tumours with low RAF1, high YAP1 expression contain larger clusters of nuclear STAT3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'RAF1 knockout cells have a competitive proliferation advantage', 'Hep3B cells in which RAF1 was silenced by shRNA proliferated better than control cells (Fig 1b) and showed increased YAP1 and GP130 expression as well as STAT3 activation when grown as xenografts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained by silencing RAF1 in cultured Hep3B, HuH-7 and HepG2 cells with siRNAs targeting regions distinct from the one targeted by the shRNA (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, RAF1 silencing impacts the proliferation and signalling in transformed liver cells in vivo (Fig 1c) and in culture (Figs 1b and 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether RAF1 ablation confers a competitive proliferation advantage to premalignant liver cells, we established DEN-induced hepatocyte (DIH) lines from Raf1F/F and MxCre;Raf1F/F mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following immortalization, both lines were treated with IFN, leading to RAF1 deletion in the MxCre;Raf1F/F DIH (/ DIH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As already observed in livers, RAF1 deletion was efficient and did not affect the expression of A- or BRAF (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RAF1-deficient and control DIH were much smaller than primary hepatocytes (P-HEPS) and expressed CD44 and -fetoprotein (AFP) instead of albumin (ALB) (Fig 4c and d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  / DIH had a clear proliferation advantage, particularly in media with low serum (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also attracted macrophages and produced CCL2 and CXCL1 more efficiently than F/F DIH (Supplementary Fig 5a and b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Molecular characterization of RAF1-deficient cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) siRNA-mediated RAF1 silencing promotes the proliferation of Hep3B (n=6), HuH-7 (n=5) and HepG2 (n=4) cells and increases the expression of YAP1 and GP130 as well as STAT3 phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  siRAF1#1 targets the region around nucleotide 721, while siRAF1#2 is a mixture of siRNAs targeting the region from nucleotide 692 to 1,093 in the RAF1 mRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) PCR and immunoblotting analysis of F/F and RAF1/ DIH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Morphology (x200 magnification) and molecular characterization (d) of primary hepatocytes (P-HEPS) compared to DIH (AFP, -fetoprotein;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our study defines a tumour suppressor role of RAF1 in hepatic carcinogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Firstly, RAF1 is found downregulated in a non-selected cohort of human HCC samples; secondly, modelling RAF1 downregulation in human HCC cells, in culture or in xenografts, increases cell proliferation; and thirdly, the same results are obtained in two independent genetic models (AlfpCre and MxCre-induced RAF1 ablation in the DEN/PB-treated mice) and in premalignant hepatocytes derived from these models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This consistency is remarkable given the molecular heterogeneity of human HCC as well as of the human cell lines studied30 and the transgenic models used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finding was entirely unexpected as the existing literature unanimously points to pro-tumourigenic functions of RAF1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RAF1 antagonizes apoptosis in both embryonic9 and adult liver10, and is required to promote proliferation in RAS-driven skin and lung carcinogenesis31,32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The molecular correlate of RAF1 ablation/downregulation is also remarkably consistent: lack of RAF1 results in the increased expression of YAP1 and GP130 and in STAT3 phosphorylation/activation in all models tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include P-HEPS treated with IL6, showing that the defect is directly related to RAF1 deletion and does not arise during the transformation of RAF1-deficient cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phenotype is in line with the role of the IL6 pathway in the development and progression of cancer progenitor cells7 and of YAP1 as antagonist of hepatocyte differentiation20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In contrast to models of transgenic YAP1 expression or of YAP1 activation by Hippo pathway disruption3, RAF1 ablation does not lead to spontaneous hepatocarcinogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This milder phenotype may be due to the Hippo pathway, which is functional in RAF1-deficient livers and cells and can counteract hepatocyte proliferation driven by mitogens34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the autochthonous tumour models, the severity of the phenotype also correlates with the extent of liver inflammation, being stronger in hep than in p/np animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the fact that increased YAP1 expression promotes hepatocyte proliferation in vivo only upon liver injury or inflammation, that IL6 cooperates with YAP1 in this setting35, and that GP130 is necessary for full-fledged DEN-induced tumourigenesis in the mouse14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The ERK activation status, on the other hand, did not correlate with proliferation in autochthonous tumours, xenografts, or cultured cells, implying that in the absence of RAF1 proliferative signalling is rewired to rely on the activation of YAP1 and STAT3 rather than ERK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While ERK activation is widely regarded as pro-tumourigenic, it was recently shown to inversely correlate with stem cell self-renewal in mammary tumours36 and with the maintenance of stem cell identity in mouse intestine37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also noteworthy in this context, activation of the STAT3 pathway by IL6 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38) or EGFR/SFK (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39) can render BRAF mutant cancer cells resistant to RAF/ERK inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mechanistically, our data are consistent with a model in which RAF1 ablation promotes the expression of YAP1 and GP130, which in turn supports the activation of STAT3 by JAK, engendering a positive feedback loop supported by the inflammatory environment in which hepatocarcinogenesis occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased GP130 expression selectively supports the activation of STAT3 by proinflammatory cytokines of the IL6 family, but not by those of the IL10 family, broadly speaking anti-inflammatory in nature; the importance of the GP130/STAT3 axis in epithelial inflammation and gastrointestinal tumourigenesis22 and of GP130 in liver tumours4,7,14,40,41 has been amply documented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides the cell-autonomous proliferation phenotype, RAF1-deficient DIH are much more efficient than controls in attracting macrophages; they also produce higher amounts of CCL2, a STAT3 target gene42, and of CXCL1, upregulated by YAP1 in breast cancer cell lines43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the increased numbers of inflammatory cells and the rich chemokine/cytokine milieu observed in hep tumour-bearing livers, and is reminiscent of the inflammation and macrophage accumulation caused by liver-restricted Hippo pathway inactivation44,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In p/np animals, the failure of RAF1-deficient macrophages to migrate in response to chemokines and infiltrate the tumour-bearing livers correlates with limited inflammation and tumour load.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the tumour-promoting role of inflammation in the DEN/Pb model, and implicates the immigrant macrophages as source of inflammatory mediators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The competitive advantage of RAF1-deficient initiated hepatocytes is still evident in the p/np animals in the form of increased tumour multiplicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One key question is how RAF1 ablation increases YAP1 and GP130 expression at the protein level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  YAP1 turnover is regulated by at least two ubiquitylation-dependent mechanisms: degradation by the TrCPSCF ubiquitin ligase complex, promoted by the Hippo pathway46; or by Elongin B/C/Cullin5, antagonized by oncogenic RAS47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RAF1 is a Hippo pathway antagonist and a RAS effector; therefore, if its ablation impinged on one of these mechanisms, it should decrease, not increase YAP1 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  YAP1/TAZ are also integral components of the catenin destruction complex, to which they recruit TrCP, promoting catenin degradation in the absence of Wnt signals48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that catenin expression and nuclear localization are not altered by RAF1 ablation (Fig 3a, Supplementary Fig 4a, Fig 5a), it is unlikely that RAF1 regulates this complex; alternatively, RAF1 may regulate YAP1 turnover by ubiquitin-independent mechanisms, such as autophagy49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GP130 degradation is less well investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of IL6, basal turnover of GP130 is mainly maintained by the proteasome system, whereas after IL6 stimulation GP130 is monoubiquitinated by the E3 ligase c-Cbl and undergoes internalization, endosomal sorting and lysosomal degradation50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RAF1 can be recruited to endosomal membranes51 and may therefore affect GP130 turnover by controlling either GP130 internalization or endosome trafficking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Irrespectively of the precise mechanism, our data consistently show that reduced RAF1 expression confers on liver cells the double selective advantage of higher STAT3 activation (by GP130-dependent stimuli) and higher YAP1 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This two-birds-with-one-stone mechanism can apparently cooperate with a range of oncogenic mutations.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
