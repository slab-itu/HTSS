Arctic cut-off high drives the poleward shift of a new Greenland melting record  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Large-scale atmospheric circulation controls the mass and energy balance of the Greenland ice sheet through its impact on radiative budget, runoff and accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, using reanalysis data and the outputs of a regional climate model, we show that the persistence of an exceptional atmospheric ridge, centred over the Arctic Ocean, was responsible for a poleward shift of runoff, albedo and surface temperature records over the Greenland during the summer of 2015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  New records of monthly mean zonal winds at 500 hPa and of the maximum latitude of ridge peaks of the 5,700±50 m isohypse over the Arctic were associated with the formation and persistency of a cutoff high.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unprecedented (19482015) and sustained atmospheric conditions promoted enhanced runoff, increased the surface temperatures and decreased the albedo in northern Greenland, while inhibiting melting in the south, where new melting records were set over the past decade.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Atmospheric circulation affects the energy and mass budgets of the Greenland ice sheet1,2,3,4,5 by controlling cloud coverage and optical depth6, and by driving the spatial distribution, and amount of surface melting and accumulation7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Improving our understanding of the impact of atmospheric circulation on the Greenlands surface mass balance is, therefore, crucial for the refinement of climate and ice-sheet models, and will ultimately enable improved estimates of current and future contributions to sea level, by the largest ice body in the Northern Hemisphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we show that a poleward shift of melting record over the Greenland ice sheet in 2015 was driven by the exceptional atmospheric conditions characterized by new records in mean zonal winds and jet stream wave amplitude associated with the formation and evolution of a Arctic cutoff high.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Atmospheric conditions and indicators', 'Our analysis of the geopotential height at 500 hPa (Methods) shows that during July 2015 a persistent atmospheric ridge was centred over the Arctic Ocean (Lincoln Sea, north of Greenland), with geopotential height anomalies being up to 3.7 s.d.s (,150 m) above the 19812010 long-term mean (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO; Methods) and Greenland Blocking Index (GBI, defined as the 500 hPa geopotential height area averaged between 6080° N and 2080° W (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9); Methods) have been associated with extreme melting events over the Greenland9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The summer average (June-July-August) value for NAO in 2015 of 1.61 was close to the summer value in 2012 of 1.59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differently from 2015, however, the atmospheric ridge in 2012 was centred over the Greenland ice sheet2,10 (Supplementary Figs 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The July monthly averaged NAO value set a new record low of 1.23 (since 1899), being 3.2 below the 19812010 mean (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concurrently, the GBI also set a new record for the month of July (Fig 1c; Supplementary Fig 3b), being 2.8 above the 19812010 mean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The June and August conditions in 2015 were not as exceptional in 2012, with mean June and August NAO values in 2015 being higher than the same quantities in 2012 (Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Atmospheric conditions and selected quantities over the Arctic and over the Greenland ice sheet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) 500 hPa geopotential height composite anomaly (m) for the month of July 2015, with respect to the 19812010 baseline period (using NCEPNCARv1 reanalysis);

Supplementary Fig 4), as simulated by the Modèle Atmosphérique Régionale1,3,7 (MAR; Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The monthly averaged record setting values for simulated albedo and surface temperature in northwest Greenland for July 2015 were, respectively,2.5 below and above the 19812010 mean, while runoff was up to 3 above the mean (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spatial distribution of the 2015 surface albedo anomaly simulated by MAR (Supplementary Fig 5ac) indicates that the July 2015 negative anomaly was driven by an albedo decrease at relatively high elevations, promoted by the reduced summer snowfall (associated with anticyclonic conditions) and by increased surface melting and runoff.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same atmospheric conditions that promoted these new records over the northern Greenland also inhibited melting in the south, where enhanced melting and new records have been occurring over the past recent years1,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This had implications for the surface mass balance of Greenland at both regional and ice-sheet scales (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The summer exposure of bare ice and the presence of surface impurities have been suggested to be driving the enhanced melting observed over the past 20 years1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the 2015 summer atmospheric conditions promoted the flow of cold air from the Arctic Ocean (Fig 1b), favouring the accumulation of fresh new snow with a high albedo along western Greenland, hence offsetting the effects of bare ice exposure (Supplementary Figs 57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Spatial and temporal evolution of the jet stream conditions and wave amplitude.Jet stream is here characterized through the 5,700±50 m 500 hPa isoheights13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (af) Five day average geopotential height (m) at 500 hPa for the period 18th June to 22nd July 2015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each day, the daily averaged values for the 2 days before and after were averaged with the daily average value of that day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crosses show the locations where geopotential height values are 5,700±50 m.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The mechanisms that created and maintained the 2015 observed ridge may be linked with forcing from very strong extratropical cyclones14, to forcings from southern regions15 or to latent heat release16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another possibility is the local forcing related to Arctic amplification13,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although recent melt records over the Greenland have been linked to exceptional mid-tropospheric atmospheric conditions, with episodes of atmospheric blocking ridges being associated with Greenlands melting extremes9,12, little or no attention has been given to the impact of the anticipated effects of Arctic amplification on the surface mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, the 2015 records for both the 500 hPa zonal winds and the maximum ridging latitude are consistent with the proposed effects on upper level atmosphere characteristics associated with Arctic amplification13,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The 2015 poleward shift of the surface melting record in 2015, clearly indicates that improving our understanding of the impact of exceptional atmospheric conditions on the spatial distribution of extreme melting is crucial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides modulating the contribution of Greenland to sea level through the volume of meltwater production, the location of enhanced melting can influence ocean/ice interaction processes and ocean circulation18, and bio-productivity, by altering salinity and temperature profiles of the surrounding ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the evolution of surface melting strongly impacts the Greenlands hydrological system, with implications for the englacial and subglacial systems, as well as ice discharge and dynamics19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, several general circulation global climate models and Earth System models do not properly capture summer Arctic atmospheric forcing8, limiting our capability to properly project the evolution of the surface mass balance and melting under future warming scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work presented here demonstrates a strong need to identify the mechanisms that create and maintain strong cutoff highs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new atmospheric records, and the trends of mean zonal winds and wave amplitude of the jet stream are consistent with the suggested effects of Arctic amplification13,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies provide theoretical arguments that slowing zonal winds might be associated with larger planetary wave amplitudes20 and that Arctic amplification and/or sea-ice loss do intensify existing ridges, thereby contributing to their persistence21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the event studied here, however, the exceptional melting followed the ridging, rather than preceding it in alignment with other studies, indicating that observations and models results do not support the above mentioned expected effects of Arctic amplification23,24,25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Be that as it may, understanding the impact of cutoff highs on the Greenlands surface mass balance, and studying the mechanisms driving the trends and extremes of the anticipated effects of Arctic amplification are crucial tasks in view of the potential regional and global impacts long-time effects of enhanced melting over Greenland.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
