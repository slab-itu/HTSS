Natural variation of macrophage activation as disease-relevant phenotype predictive of inflammation and cancer survival  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Although mouse models exist for many immune-based diseases, the clinical translation remains challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most basic and translational studies utilize only a single inbred mouse strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, basal and diseased immune states in humans show vast inter-individual variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, focusing on macrophage responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), we use the hybrid mouse diversity panel (HMDP) of 83 inbred strains as a surrogate for human natural immune variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since conventional bioinformatics fail to analyse a population spectrum, we highlight how gene signatures for LPS responsiveness can be derived based on an Interleukin-12 and arginase expression ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared to published signatures, these gene markers are more robust to identify susceptibility or resilience to several macrophage-related disorders in humans, including survival prediction across many tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study highlights natural activation diversity as a disease-relevant dimension in macrophage biology, and suggests the HMDP as a viable tool to increase translatability of mouse data to clinical settings.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Clinical and pharmaceutical researchers are concerned with the lack of relevance and low reproducibility of findings obtained in standard mouse models1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The translation of mouse data from bench to bedside is challenging4,5,6,7,8 and clinical trial success rates continue to be low1,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the possible reasons, the large inter-individual variation of immune system variables in human populations is cited10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This natural variation has been shown to broadly impact on pathophysiology, for example, disease resilience, tolerance12,13,14 and vaccination responses10,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  System level analyses of identical twins find both environmental and genetic components of variability16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, inbred mouse strains were placed in a more natural, dirty environment leading to greater variation of immune cell populations17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we focus on how introducing genetic diversity into mouse research reveals a much broader spectrum of innate immune responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Macrophages are widely distributed throughout the body and are hence one of the first cells to react to a perturbation of homoeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their functional programs are highly context-dependent and mostly influenced by pathogens, cellular origin (monocyte-derived or embryonic) and tissue cues (including cytokines)18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among a continuum of stimulus-dependent polarization states18,20,21,22,23, most with unknown function, M1 reflects a pro-inflammatory phenotype with pathogen killing abilities and can be induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and M2 reflects the default state of tissue macrophages that promotes homeostasis and wound healing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These macrophages metabolize arginine to citrulline and nitric oxide through inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS, Nos2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The production of the macrophage cytokine Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a hallmark of M1 and promotes a Th1 response24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M2 macrophages can metabolize arginine to ornithine, a precursor of polyamine and hydroxyproline, and urea through Arginase (Arg1), which promotes wound healing, angiogenesis and tissue homoeostasis24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  iNOS is a crucial regulator in mouse M1 macrophages, but its relevance in human macrophages is still debated26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, genetic variation has been shown to affect macrophage activation by hierarchical functions of lineage-determining transcription factors28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While significant differences in Th1/2 polarization propensity in healthy individuals has been shown29, little is known about natural diversity of macrophage polarization in health and disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The hybrid mouse diversity panel (HMDP) is a panel of about 100 inbred mouse strains developed for performing association studies with adequate statistical power and resolution for mapping of complex traits30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been successfully used for investigating gene-environment interaction in activated macrophages32, insulin sensitivity33, and susceptibility to atherosclerosis34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we employ the HMDP as a surrogate model for human immune diversity and investigate how meaningful gene signatures of macrophage activation can be extracted from a heterogeneous population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that these signatures are highly robust in predicting disease susceptibility and outcomes in humans, suggesting that immune diversity is a critical parameter in translational medicine.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Natural variation of LPS activation in macrophages', 'LPS is found in gram-negative bacterial membranes and elicits strong inflammatory immune responses, mainly via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 that induces activation of the NF-B pathway35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To estimate the inter-individual variation of macrophage LPS responses in a diverse population we compared the transcriptional activation patterns in humans and mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In human alveolar macrophages exposed to LPS in vivo we observed large intrinsic variation in inter-individual genetic responses, for example, NF-B and TLR pathway activities (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages of HMDP strains exposed to LPS, we found a similarly large range of pathway activations (Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, LPS incubation was short (4 h), and reflects an early state of macrophage activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variation of gene expression in technical and biological replicates was low and did not explain the observed findings (Supplementary Fig 1, and Orozco et al.32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, RNA deconvolution indicates that the peritoneal cavity was repopulated with inflammatory macrophages after thioglycollate treatment in all strains (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Natural variation of macrophage activation in response to LPS in humans and inbred mouse strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Human alveolar macrophages were RNA sequenced after intrabronchial instillation of LPS or saline in seven healthy individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fold change gene expression between LPS and control of key genes (columns) of the Toll-like receptor- (total 69 genes) and NF-B signalling (total 155 genes) pathways are plotted for each volunteer (rows) using Ingenuity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data derived from GSE40885.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Activity score (z score) was calculated by Ingenuity based on matched and predicted induction of downstream gene expression after LPS treatment in the NF-B and TLR pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data sorted ascendingly by NF-B activity score.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c,d) Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages of 11 mouse strains of the hybrid mouse diversity panel were treated with LPS or PBS and their transcriptome was analysed by Affymetrix Array.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pathway analysis similar to a+b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Arginase (Arg-1), iNOS (Nos-2) and IL-12 (p40) gene expression as RMA (robust multi-array average: quantile normalized, background-corrected, log2 transformed intensities) of human alveolar macrophages of 23 healthy human volunteers at baseline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The induction of gene expression (log2 fold change) after LPS treatment is shown in the bar chart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dashed lines indicate the median.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Baseline data from GSE27002, LPS-data from GSE40885.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages (baseline and LPS-treated) of 26 classical recombinant mouse strains were analysed as described in e.Full size image', 'We analysed the gene expression levels of key polarization genes in human alveolar macrophages and found considerable variation among healthy volunteers under homoeostatic conditions (Fig 1e, left column; an additional data set of 70 humans is shown in Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After LPS treatment, iNOS, arginase and IL-12 were variably upregulated among individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, IL-12 showed a wide range of upregulation between 1.4-fold and 64-fold (Fig 1e, bottom right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, using 26 classical inbred strains of the HMDP, we found a comparable diversity in peritoneal macrophage transcriptome data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At baseline, arginase expression showed a large variation across all strains, whereas iNOS and IL-12 were expressed at low levels (Fig 1f, left column).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After LPS treatment, the range of IL-12 upregulation between strains was large (0.4-fold to 64-fold).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other key macrophage genes such as MRC1 (CD206), MGL1, MGL2, FIZZ1 and IL-10 as well the housekeeping gene ACTB (-actin) did not change in response to LPS (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-6 was variably upregulated across the HMDP, and highly correlated with IL-12 (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed expression differences between strains at the protein level showing great variation in IL-12 p70 levels in supernatants of LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages and varying iNOS and arginase induction patterns using intracellular flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the protein level data, we developed a representative panel of 13 strains that largely resemble gene expression profiles of the entire HDMP with regard to Arg1, iNOS and IL-12 transcription (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these data suggest that inter-individual differences in macrophage activation responses can be found both in human populations and strains of the HMDP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Global map of LPS responsiveness in 83 mouse strains', 'Most bioinformatics tools are not designed to dissect a spectral distribution in a heterogeneous population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of commonly regulated genes after LPS treatment among all 83 strains fails (Supplementary Fig 6), suggesting inter-strain variations of the macrophage LPS response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome this problem, we established a gene expression based factor that represents the degree of LPS-induced polarization (polarization factor).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Historically, the LPS-induced polarization was defined by the arginine metabolism: M2 is Arg1high iNOSlow; M1 is Arg1low iNOShigh36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated polarization factors based on both iNOS and IL-12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By dividing iNOS or IL-12 by arginase-1 gene expression values averaged to the mean of the HMDP (for details see Method section), 83 mouse strains were ranked to show their LPS responsiveness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that there is a continuous spectrum of LPS-induced activation strength; thus, identifying inherent LPS non/low- and -high responders (for example, FVB/NJ, CE/J and KK/HIJ, PL/J, respectively) (Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-12- and iNOS-based rankings of mouse strains are highly correlated (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with this ranking, analysis of amino acid levels in supernatant before and after LPS stimulation showed LPS high-responder strains producing less ornithine and more citrulline (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the IL-12 based polarization factor has a higher resolution due to a more robust upregulation (Fig 2c,d; Supplementary Fig 7) and iNOS relevance is controversial in human macrophages26,27, the IL-12 based polarization factor was used in subsequent analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Inter-strain differences of LPS-induced macrophage activation across 83 mouse strains of the HMDP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were harvested from 83 mouse strains of the HMDP without (baseline, cyan) and with LPS (purple) treatment for 4 h in vitro and the genome-wide transcriptome was analysed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The polarization factor is based on the iNOS (a,c) or IL-12 (b,d) divided by Arg-1 gene expression ratio and determines the overall polarization state of each mouse strain in response to LPS (see Method section for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vertical dashed line indicates the median at baseline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ranking details and strain names are provided in Supplementary Data 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c,d) Frequency histogram of LPS-induced macrophage polarization factor across 83 mouse strains at baseline (cyan) or after 4 h LPS (purple).Full size image', 'Gene signatures correlated with LPS responsiveness', 'Next, genes of the peritoneal macrophage transcriptomes of all HMDP strains were correlated with the polarization factor, resulting in a ranked list of 1,276 LPS-positive responder genes and 2,619 LPS negative-responder genes at a false discovery rate (FDR)  less_than 5% (Benjamini Hochberg) and P less_than 0.0001 (Pearson) (Fig 3a,c;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Here, we showed how a spectrum of macrophage phenotypes in many different inbred strains can be used to extract gene signatures of LPS responsiveness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the analysis of commonly LPS regulated genes in all strains failed, we established a surrogate marker based on IL12 and Arg1 gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared to published signatures, the resulting gene lists are unique, yet more robustly predictive of many human inflammatory and malignant disorders, suggesting that accounting for immune diversity in a heterogeneous population increases the translatability of mouse data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The robust correlation of a large number of genes with the polarization factor across the HMDP reveals that the M(LPS) axis is a major player in macrophage biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Out of 12,980 genes expressed, 1,276 (9.8%) and 2,619 (20.2%) are positively and negatively correlated with the IL-12b/Arg1 polarization factor, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is not surprising per se.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is surprising that only three M(LPS)+ genes (Dpep1, Gkn2 and Hoxd4) are found in resting (thioglycollate-elicited) peritoneal macrophages, and only 11 M(LPS) genes (Arg1, Tpi1, Gpi1, Mif, Pkm, Zmynd8, Pcbp4, Myo6, Grk6, Egln1, Slc44a2) suggesting that the LPS challenge exposes the activation propensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is more accurate to speak of individuals with an M1-skewed response to TLR challenge, rather than a priori M1-skewed individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Inter-individual variability of the LPS response in healthy human PBMCs has been linked to profoundly different cytokine responses47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that mice and human macrophages evolved to either fight (LPS positive responders) or tolerate and heal (LPS negative responders) infections48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TLR polymorphisms49 and differences in TLR signalling pathways are candidates for a genetic basis underlying M(LPS)+ and M(LPS) macrophage phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of course, this is an oversimplification, because it is well known that macrophage polarizations also vary along the time axis of the infection or disturbance18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, myocardial infarctions are characterized by an initial abundance of M1 macrophages, followed by an M2-dominate healing phase50,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data could implicate that M(LPS)+ individuals may be susceptible to autoimmune diseases and M(LPS) individuals may have unfavourable outcomes if afflicted with cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, individual differences in T helper cell differentiation in healthy individuals has been linked to disease susceptibility29,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple susceptibility genes and loci to infectious disease12, autoimmunity53,54 and cancer55,56 have been described and our data suggest that inter-individual variation of macrophage activation propensity might be a confounding variable involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While the human immune system is shaped by both environmental factors and genetics16, only the latter plays a role in laboratory inbred mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains to be investigated what exact mechanisms account for the inter-strain differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HMDP consists of 29 classic parental inbred strains, and about 80 recombinant inbred strains (BXD, CXB, BXA/AXB and BXH panels) that are crosses between C57BL/6J, C3H/HeJ and DBA/2J31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TLR4-insensitivity of the C3H/HeJ strain is therefore represented to variable degrees in its recombinant progeny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inter-strain differences in the Interleukin-6/Interleukin-10/STAT3 pathway may also affect macrophage activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After thioglycollate, inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages dominate the cellular content of the peritoneal cavity in all mouse strains (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies on peritoneal and other tissue-resident macrophages in response to various stimuli will more fully characterize macrophage immune diversity in mice and humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The polarization factor tool developed here will be useful for such studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A striking finding of this study is that the M(LPS)+/ signatures are robust enough to predict cancer survival or death from mixed-cell biopsy material, containing cancer, stromal and inflammatory cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This makes these gene panels well suited for predictive tests in personalized medicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particularly, with new generation cancer treatments that manipulate tumour-associated macrophage polarization, new diagnostics are necessary to monitor treatment efficacy43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A simple multiplex PCR or RNA-sequencing run could harbour enormous predictive value, matching or exceeding the value of traditional biomarkers, for example, prostate specific antigen or BRCA1/2, or histopathological cancer staging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, in contrast to an increasing number of disease-specific genetic tests that were developed by gene-outcome association statistics, for example, in breast cancer57, we extracted genes in a bottom-up approach centring around macrophage biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the ubiquitous disease-relevant role of macrophages18, this yielded transcriptomic signatures with predictive value in a number of different disease entities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in contrast to conventional flow cytometry- or PCR-based estimations of macrophage polarization in ordinal scale, the developed gene panels allow a gradual classification, thus enabling a population-based assessment in high resolution necessary for clinical applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Picking as few as 13 mouse strains is sufficient to qualitatively represent the diversity in macrophage activation responses to LPS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Re-evaluating the robustness of a new biological finding in a selected, representative panel of HMDP strains may be cost effective and prudent before embarking on a clinical drug development programme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, all HMDP strains are fully inbred (homozygous at all loci) and commercially available30,31, providing immediate access for research facilities and allowing reproducibility studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, this approach shows great promise to improve the translation of immunological research findings from mice to humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, our population-based approach yields (1) improved gene signatures with higher predictive power; (2) a methodological framework to extract meaningful signatures of data sets from heterogeneous populations, and demonstrates (3) the usefulness of the HMDP as a valuable surrogate for human diversity
