Blood-based biomarkers of age-associated epigenetic changes in human islets associate with insulin secretion and diabetes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Aging associates with impaired pancreatic islet function and increased type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we examine whether age-related epigenetic changes affect human islet function and if blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect these changes and associate with future T2D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyse DNA methylation genome-wide in islets from 87 non-diabetic donors, aged 2674 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aging associates with increased DNA methylation of 241 sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These sites cover loci previously associated with T2D, for example, KLF14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related methylation changes in 83 genes identified in human islets (for example, KLF14, FHL2, ZNF518B and FAM123C) and some associate with insulin secretion and T2D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA methylation correlates with islet expression of multiple genes, including FHL2, ZNF518B, GNPNAT1 and HLTF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Silencing these genes in -cells alter insulin secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, we demonstrate that blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related DNA methylation changes in human islets, and associate with insulin secretion in vivo and T2D.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Aging is an important risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D)1,2 and the increasing age of the worlds populations contributes to the rapidly growing prevalence of T2D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elderly people often exhibit insulin resistance and progressive decline in glucose tolerance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Euglycaemia is initially sustained by an adaptive increase in insulin secretion from the pancreatic -cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, aging -cells may eventually fail to adapt to increasing demands for insulin production, which manifests in hyperglycaemia and T2D1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Why aging -cells fail is unclear, and understanding this pathogenetic process could contribute to understanding the roots of T2D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possible factor may be that aging causes epigenetic changes that affect gene expression and thereby potentially insulin secretion in pancreatic islets3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Epigenetic alterations, such as changes in DNA methylation, have been linked to several diseases, including T2D2,3,4,5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously identified increased DNA methylation and decreased expression of the insulin gene5 and PDX1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6), a key transcription factor for -cell development and function, in pancreatic islets from subjects with T2D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, we analysed DNA methylation genome-wide in islets from diabetic subjects and non-diabetic controls and identified multiple genes with altered methylation and expression in diabetic islets3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These epigenetic changes were further associated with perturbed islet hormone secretion, and likely contribute to hyperglycaemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Epigenetic variation in human islets seems to also contribute to sex differences in insulin secretion9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We and others have also identified some age-related DNA methylation changes in human islets, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, brain and blood cells3,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, epigenetic changes are associated with islet dysfunction and hyperglycaemia in aging rats19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it remains unknown if aging is associated with genome-wide changes in DNA methylation of human islets and if these changes have any effect on islet function and development of T2D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The possibilities for following pancreatic islet health non-invasively are so far largely limited to nutrient-stimulation of hormone secretion, and analysing epigenetic modifications in human islets in vivo/non-invasively remains impossible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a great translational scientific and public health potential in identifying novel biomarkers in blood that mirror protective or causal disease associated changes in human islets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such biomarkers could potentially be used to predict and/or to monitor disease progression in T2D21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we investigate epigenetic modifications and find that age associates with increased DNA methylation in human pancreatic islets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These epigenetic changes correlate with expression of numerous genes and silencing these genes in -cells alters insulin secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we show that age-associated methylation changes in blood reflect the changes seen in islets, suggesting that blood may be used as a marker for islet DNA methylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we investigate prospective cohorts and show that DNA methylation of some of these genes associates with future capacity to secrete insulin and T2D risk.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Indeed, methylation in gene promoters can result in diminished expression by inhibiting the binding of transcription factors or recruiting methyl CpG-binding proteins together with HDACs and co-repressors2,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, expression of FHL2 and HLTF correlated positively with the methylation of CpG sites in respective gene, despite the sites being situated in promoter regions

stretches of DNA that contain these CpG sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This showed that the significant CpG sites in both FHL2 and HLTF promoters are situated within binding sites for repressive transcription

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our study shows that aging associates with specific changes of DNA methylation in human pancreatic islets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include loci in genes previously associated with diabetes risk and islet function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we show that some age-related DNA methylation changes in pancreatic islets were similar in blood, suggesting that DNA methylation in blood may be used as a biomarker of DNA methylation in human islets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, some of these blood-based epigenetic markers correlated with current and future insulin levels measured in vivo and were associated with lower risk of future T2D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As the possibilities to monitor pancreatic islet function in vivo are limited, blood-based biomarkers for pancreatic islet function could have great clinical utility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that almost 60% of age-associated changes in DNA methylation in human islets occur also in blood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our functional experiments further show that altered expression of some of these genes affects insulin secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, we show that methylation of FHL2 associates with age, both in human islets and blood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the methylation level correlated with FHL2 expression in islets and silencing Fhl2 decreased insulin secretion in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, methylation of FHL2 in blood was associated with lower T2D risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional genes showing increased methylation in both pancreatic islets and blood during aging included KLF14, FAM123C and ZNF518B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KLF14 encodes a transcriptional regulator and polymorphisms within this gene have been associated with T2D37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FAM123C encodes an activator of Wnt signalling38, a pathway important for -cells39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two recent studies have shown that ZNF518B encodes a protein that regulates histone methyltransferases40 and that a SNP in ZNF518B associates with blood glucose in patients with gout41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identified associations between DNA methylation and future insulin secretion or T2D risk demonstrate, for example, that 1% higher DNA methylation of cg08097417 in KLF14 is associated with 47.3 mU l1 higher insulin secretion during an OGTT 10 years later, while 1% higher DNA methylation of cg16764848 in GNPNAT1 is associated with an 8% lower risk for diabetes 11 years later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that these analyses were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, HbA1c and family status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'DNA methylation was initially thought to be a silencing mark where increased methylation results in decreased expression23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, emerging data show that the effect of DNA methylation depends on the genomic location and methylation may also affect transcriptional elongation, transcription of non-coding RNAs, alternative splicing and genomic stability23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While methylation of some of our identified sites in, for example, FHL2, ZNF518B, GNPNAT1 and HLTF was associated with altered expression, the other identified CpG sites may affect other biological processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interestingly, DNA methylation of all significant sites in human islets increased with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is in line with age-associated methylation changes of sites found in other human tissues where methylation of the majority of sites increased with age16,18,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, increased age was found to decrease the global methylation level in human blood, several rodent tissues and cultured fibroblasts15,43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although tissue-specific methylome alterations take place, methylation of genes such as FHL2, KLF14, ELOVL2 and GLRA1 seems to change in multiple tissues with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The different mechanisms behind the tissue specific and more general methylation changes during a lifetime remain largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, whether cells are replaced (for example, most blood cells) or remain throughout life may affect the impact of age on the methylome45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Age-associated effects on the activity of methyltransferases in different tissues may also contribute to alterations in the methylome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As it has been proposed that CpG sites close to each other show a similar degree of methylation within a tissue and individual30, it is worth mentioning that 37 of the identified genes in our study had more than 1 site with age-associated changes in methylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, when we used pyrosequencing to analyse methylation of sites in FHL2, KLF14, FAM123C, ZNF518B and GNPNAT1, several surrounding sites showed altered methylation with age, suggesting that methylation in genomic regions rather than individual sites change with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To investigate if genes with age-associated methylation changes identified in pancreatic islets may contribute to altered insulin secretion1, we analysed the effects of Fhl2, Zfp518b, Gnpnat1 and Hltf knockdown in clonal -cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While knockdown of Zfp518b and Gnpnat1 mimics the age-associated decline in expression seen in human islets, knockdown of Fhl2 and Hltf represents expression changes in the opposite direction of that seen in aging islets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, all four genes affected insulin secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, our functional experiments in -cells suggest that the age-associated changes in methylation of FHL2, ZNF518B and GNPNAT1 in human islets may be protective and compensatory changes to cope with increased demands of insulin due to insulin resistance in peripheral tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, age-associated changes in methylation and expression of HLTF may increase the risk of T2D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that FHL2 through its LIM domains interacts with more than 50 partners involved in many signalling pathways46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, changing FHL2 expression could affect different intracellular pathways and overexpression of Fhl2 in -cells, that is, replicating the changes associated with aging, may therefore also reduce insulin secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GNPNAT1 encodes an enzyme involved in N-linked glycosylation which is likely important for normal cellular function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HLTF is believed to have both DNA helicase and ubiquitinylating properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, this is the first time these genes have been implicated in pancreatic -cell function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that these functional experiments were performed in a rodent -cell line and differences between rodent and human -cells may affect our results47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did try to perform functional experiments in a human -cell line (EndoC-H1), but transfection with a control siRNA diminished the glucose-stimulated insulin secretion to levels where interpretation of the effects of knockdown was not feasible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also wanted to investigate the effects of KLF14 and FAM123C knockdown in -cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, although both KLF14 and FAM123C were clearly expressed in human islets and EndoC-H1, the expression of these two genes was too low for reliable detection in the rat -cell line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, it was impossible to silence these two genes in rat -cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Aging is a risk factor for T2D, a disease characterised by chronic hyperglycaemia resulting from impaired insulin secretion in combination with peripheral insulin resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies suggest that before insulin secretion fails and diabetes manifests, -cells in elderly subjects try to compensate for insulin resistance with increased insulin secretion to prevent disease1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, age was associated with elevated HbA1c in donors of pancreatic islets and participants in the Danish Family Study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, both cohorts include non-diabetic individuals with a wide age span.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in vivo insulin secretion in absolute terms was elevated in elderly individuals of the Danish Family Study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we found no significant association between age and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in human pancreatic islets cultured in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that -cells in islets from these elderly subjects are still able to respond to elevated glucose with increased insulin secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, eventually aging -cells may fail to adapt to the increasing demands for insulin production and T2D will develop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, our functional experiments suggest that several age-associated epigenetic modifications and corresponding expression changes may compensate for the increasing demands for insulin during aging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, epigenetic changes in three out of four investigated genes in clonal -cells seem to have compensatory and protective roles in the human islets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this hypothesis, age-associated methylation changes of KLF14 and ZNF518B in blood correlated with both current and future insulin levels measured in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, methylation of KLF14, FHL2 and GNPNAT1 was associated with lower diabetes risk in the Botnia prospective study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, this does not exclude an age-related -cell defect in islets as deficient insulin secretion in elderly individuals is not always evident when analysed in absolute numbers, but rather when analysed in relation to insulin resistance1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line, aging was associated with decreased DI in the Danish Family Study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a recent study found that age-related epigenetic changes in -cells of old mice correlate with increased insulin secretion48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We and others have previously published data from casecontrol studies, where we identified differential DNA methylation of numerous genes in islets from subjects with T2D versus controls3,4,5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in contrast to the present study where we found increased methylation of 241 sites with aging, diabetes was associated with decreased methylation of the majority of the significant sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also there was only a minor overlap between the genes identified in the present study and previous islet casecontrol cohorts, suggesting that different biological pathways underlie age- and diabetes-related DNA methylation changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also worth mentioning that many of the hypomethylated sites identified in diabetic islets are located in intergenic regions3, while a large part of hypermethylation identified in aging islets take place in promoter regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results in our different studies are in line with data presented in a review by Jones et al.49, showing that methylation of CpG sites that are located in CpG islands and promoter regions generally increase with age while the methylation of intergenic CpG sites often decrease with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is possible that aging is associated with changes in islet-cell composition and that this could affect our results50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we used electron microscopy to analyse the cellular composition of pancreatic islets and found no significant impact of age on - or -cell content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another confounding factor could be an age-related increase in inflammatory cells in the islets, but comparison with a publicly available data set on human pancreatic islets51 showed that the expression of only 2 (JAG2 and IGFBP2) out of 51 inflammation-related genes expressed in islets were nominally associated with age in our data set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result supports that inflammation is not a prominent feature in islets from elderly subjects of our cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, a large number of the 241 identified CpG sites remained significant if the analysis was limited to donors with an age span of 20 years, making it unlikely that our identified age-associated methylation changes are due to altered islet-cell composition or inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also methylation data from blood samples may be affected by changes in cellular composition as aging has been found to associate with such changes31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, data from the study by Reinius et al.33 presented here, together with a recent study by Yuan et al.52 that shows that most of the age-associated epigenetic drift seen in blood is independent of changes in blood cell composition, suggest that our methylation results are not caused by changes in cell composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data support that the age-associated epigenetic changes we identified in human islets and blood are unlikely to be influenced by altered cell composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Notably, the age-associated changes we observed in DNA methylation in the human islets are of quite large magnitude compared with data from some previous studies related to metabolic disease4,5,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, absolute differences in DNA methylation larger than 20% between young and old donors were found for many sites in the human islets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the identified differences in islet methylation between young and old donors were comparable to previously published results in blood15,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the impact of DNA methylation on future risk of diabetes was of a similar magnitude to some of the top T2D SNPs identified by GWAS55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The interest in dissecting the impact of epigenetic variation on human diseases has increased over the last decade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for numerous diseases and epidemiological studies only blood is available and it is not always possible to get access to the pathogenic tissue of interest from humans56,57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, it is important to understand if epigenetic variation in human blood cells mirrors epigenetic patterns in tissues central to the pathogenesis of disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, our study demonstrates the value of blood for analysis of DNA methylation in relation to disease since we were able to replicate our age-related epigenetic findings from human islets in blood from large published studies10,12,13,15 and our own cohorts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It would be interesting to also replicate these findings in blood from the islet donors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we do not have access to other tissues from the included donors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, methylation data analysed in blood and pancreas from the same donors in the study by Slieker et al.30 support our findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We conclude that age-related epigenetic alterations in blood partially reflect DNA methylation changes in human pancreatic islets and associate with increased insulin secretion in vivo, as well as lower diabetes risk.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Insulin released into the buffer was measured with a rat insulin ELISA (Mercodia) and normalized to the total amount of protein in each well as measured with the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Statistics', 'The association between age and methylation in pancreatic islets was analysed with a linear regression model using methylation M values with the limma package in bioconductor63,64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sex BMI, HbA1c, bisulfite treatment, days in culture and islet purity were included as covariates in the analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FDR analysis was performed to correct for multiple testing70.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Linear regression models were used to test associations between age and HbA1c, BMI or glucose-stimulated insulin secretion including the same covariates as above except for days in culture, islet purity, HbA1c or BMI when appropriate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correlation between age and islet-cell composition was analysed with Spearman correlation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genomic distribution of significant sites was analysed with a 2-test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Associations between age and DNA methylation measured by pyrosequencing were analysed with linear mixed effects models for the Danish Family Study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here age, sex, BMI and HbA1c were included as fixed factors, whereas family number/pedigree was included as a random factor in all models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incident T2D was analysed with a Cox regression model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were treated as left truncated and right censored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The covariate measurements were made at entry time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All regression analyses were performed with a robust variance estimate to adjust for within-family dependence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correlation between  values of DNA methylation and gene expression was analysed with Spearmans rank test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional studies were analysed with MannWhitney test or Wilcoxon signed rank test as indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analyses were performed with R (http://www.r-project.org/) and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
