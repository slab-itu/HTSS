Simultaneous enhancements in photon absorption and charge transport of bismuth vanadate photoanodes for solar water splitting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'n-Type bismuth vanadate has been identified as one of the most promising photoanodes for use in a water-splitting photoelectrochemical cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The major limitation of BiVO4 is its relatively wide bandgap (2.5 eV), which fundamentally limits its solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that annealing nanoporous bismuth vanadate electrodes at 350 °C under nitrogen flow can result in nitrogen doping and generation of oxygen vacancies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gentle nitrogen treatment not only effectively reduces the bandgap by 0.2 eV but also increases the majority carrier density and mobility, enhancing electronhole separation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of nitrogen incorporation and oxygen vacancies on the electronic band structure and charge transport of bismuth vanadate are systematically elucidated by ab initio calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to simultaneous enhancements in photon absorption and charge transport, the applied bias photon-to-current efficiency of nitrogen-treated BiVO4 for solar water splitting exceeds 2%, a record for a single oxide photon absorber, to the best of our knowledge.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The major challenge for solar hydrogen production is the reduction of hydrogen production cost comparable to that of fossil-based fuels1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To make solar hydrogen production a reality, a significant cost reduction for the construction of a photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) is critical1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among various semiconductor electrodes (photoelectrodes) for use in PECs, oxide-based photoelectrodes have the possibility of significantly lowering the materials and processing costs while being stable in aqueous media5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n-Type bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) has recently emerged as one of the most promising photoanodes for use in water-splitting PECs8,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It absorbs a substantial portion of the visible spectrum (bandgap energy, 2.5 eV) and has a favourable conduction band edge position, which is very near the thermodynamic H2 evolution potential8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, it demonstrated the most negative photocurrent onset potential for water oxidation among all n-type semiconductors (photoanodes) having bandgaps in the visible region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, it appears to be fairly stable against chemical and photoelectrochemical corrosion9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent report shows that photoanodes composed of only oxide components, nanoporous BiVO4 electrodes coupled with FeOOH and NiOOH as oxygen evolution catalysts11, can achieve an applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) for water splitting as high as 1.7% in a stable manner (equation for ABPE is shown in Supplementary Information)12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result demonstrated the possibility for constructing a PEC for water splitting using only inexpensive and easy-to-process oxide components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One of the major limitations of BiVO4 for further improving the solar energy conversion efficiency is its bandgap (2.5 eV), which fundamentally limits photon absorption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that there are a substantial number of photons in the 2.02.5 eV region of the solar spectrum, a reduction in bandgap by even 0.10.3 eV can result in a significant efficiency increase13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, if a bandgap is reduced from 2.5 to 2.3 eV, the maximum photocurrent (Jmax) will increase from 6.47 to 9.12 mA cm2 assuming 100% incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for the photons that enable bandgap transition13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, most previous doping studies of BiVO4 were to increase carrier densities15,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies reporting the change in photon absorption of BiVO4 have been scarce and no clear elucidation of the effect of the dopants on the electronic band structures has been reported19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that the valence band maximum (VBM) of BiVO4 is significantly more positive than water oxidation potential, but the conduction band minimum (CBM) of BiVO4 is very close to the reduction potential of water8,9,21, the reduction in bandgap of BiVO4 will be the most advantageous if it is achieved by raising the VBM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we report that mild annealing treatment of nanoporous BiVO4 under N2 flow results in nitrogen incorporation into the oxygen sites, which effectively decreases the bandgap while also improving carrier mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we discover that the same N2 treatment generates oxygen vacancies that can increase the majority carrier density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of nitrogen incorporation and oxygen vacancies on the electronic band structure and charge transport of BiVO4 are systematically elucidated by ab initio calculations, which corroborate well with the experimental results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to concurrent enhancement in photon absorption, carrier density and carrier mobility, the N2-treated BiVO4 electrode, when paired with oxygen evolution catalysts, breaks the wall of 2% ABPE for solar water splitting, a first for a single oxide photoelectrode.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Synthesis and characterization', 'Nanoporous BiVO4 electrodes were first prepared by the method described in a recent study, which involves electrochemical deposition of BiOI followed by thermal and chemical conversion to BiVO4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nitrogen doping of BiVO4 was achieved by annealing the BiVO4 electrodes at 350 °C for 2 h while flowing N2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is an exceptionally gentle procedure for nitrogen doping considering that nitridation or nitrogen doping of oxides is generally achieved by annealing with a flow of NH3 at much higher temperatures (500 °C)22,23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Annealing under N2 flow may create oxygen deficiencies in oxide compounds but is usually considered insufficient for nitrogen doping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe that the nanoparticulate nature of the BiVO4 electrodes played a role in enabling nitrogen doping under such mild conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The scanning electron microscopy images and X-ray diffraction studies of N2-treated BiVO4 electrodes do not show noticeable changes from those of untreated BiVO4 (Fig 1ad; Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first indication of nitridation was observed when a drop of water was placed on the surface of these electrodes to compare their hydrophilicities (Fig 1e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the BiVO4 sample showed a high affinity to water, as any oxide surface would, the N2-treated sample showed strong hydrophobicity, suggesting the possibility of nitridation, which can considerably change the hydrophilicity of the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

microanalyzer (EPMA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For charge-balanced incorporation of nitrogen, three O2 ions need to be removed for every two N3 ions, creating one oxygen vacancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the formula of nitrogen-doped BiVO4 can be written as BiVO41.5xNx if no other types of oxygen vacancies are present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The EPMA result showed that x is 0.31±0.05 (that is, BiVO3.54N0.31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  XPS study also confirmed the presence of nitrogen in the BiVO4 lattice by showing a N 1s peak (Fig 2a) with the nitrogen content, x, estimated to be 0.34±0.02, which is comparable to the value obtained by EPMA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The location of the N 1s peak (397402 eV) agrees well with that of nitrogen incorporated into the oxide lattice25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incorporation of N into the BiVO4 lattice was further confirmed by Raman spectra that show significant broadening of various VO stretching and VO43 deformation modes of the bulk sample (Supplementary Fig 2)27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that unlike other oxides, nitrogen incorporation into BiVO4 can occur using N2 as the N source at mild temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, there exist two previous studies reporting nitrogen incorporation into vanadium oxides by annealing under N2 flow29,30, suggesting relatively easy nitrogen incorporation into vanadium-based oxides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: XPS of BiVO4 and N2-treated BiVO4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) 1s peaks of N, (b) 4f peaks of Bi and (c) 2p peaks of V for BiVO4 (black) and N2-treated BiVO4 (red).Full size image', 'The XPS study also revealed that the Bi 4f and V 2p peaks of N2-treated BiVO4 were shifted to the lower binding energy (Fig 2b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This should be due to the changes in local coordination environments of Bi and V ions, including a change in ligand type (O to N) and a decrease in coordination number due to oxygen vacancies compensating the charge difference between O2 and N3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the possibility that the N2 treatment created additional oxygen vacancies31,32, which would result in partial reduction of Bi3+ and V5+ ions, cannot be excluded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The ultravioletvisible spectra of BiVO4 and N2-treated BiVO4 electrodes are shown in Fig 3a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The N2-treated sample clearly showed a shift of the bandgap absorption to lower energy compared with untreated BiVO4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This agrees well with the darker yellow colour of the N2-treated BiVO4 (Fig 3a, inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The N2-treated BiVO4 also shows a significant absorption before the absorption edge (wavelength 550 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is most likely due to N2 treatment generating significant disorder in the atomic arrangement (for example, O defects) on the surface of the high surface area nanoporous BiVO4 electrode while incorporating nitrogen, creating interband states in the bandgap region33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absorption due to these interband states makes it difficult to accurately assess the onset for the bandgap transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Optical and photoelectrochemical

image', 'Photo-oxidation of sulfite', 'To determine the onset of photon absorption that contributes to the photocurrent generation, wavelength-dependent photocurrent was measured using monochromatic light for the photo-oxidation of sulfite and the IPCE was calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the oxidation kinetics of sulfite is fast, surface electronhole recombination is negligible during photo-oxidation of sulfite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, photo-oxidation of sulfite enables a more precise estimation of photocurrent onset compared with photo-oxidation of water which typically suffers from slow oxidation kinetics and surface recombination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The IPCE result obtained at 0.6 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) shows that the photocurrent onset of the N2-treated sample lies between 540 and 550 nm (2.27 eV) while that of the untreated sample lies between 500 and 510 nm (2.46 eV), which indicates a bandgap reduction of 0.2 eV for the N2-treated sample (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The JV plots of BiVO4 and N2-treated BiVO4 obtained using AM 1.5G illumination for sulfite oxidation are also shown in Fig 3c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The N2-treated BiVO4 electrode shows a significantly higher photocurrent than the BiVO4 electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the N2-treated sample generated a photocurrent density of 4.16±0.41 mA cm2 at 0.6 V versus RHE while BiVO4 generated 3.27±0.31 mA cm2 at the same potential, corresponding to a 27% increase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the first example showing the generation of photocurrent higher than 4 mA cm2 for any photo-oxidation reaction by any photoanode reported to date at a potential as low as 0.6 V versus RHE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'If the photocurrent enhancement is due only to the enhanced photon absorption by the bandgap reduction, the N2-treated sample should show an increase in IPCE but not in the absorbed photon-to-current conversion efficiency (APCE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the N2-treated sample showed a considerable enhancement in APCE, particularly between 470 and 550 nm (Fig 3d), indicating that the N2 treatment also improved electronhole separation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the electronhole separation yield, sep, of the N2-treated sample, which was calculated from the JV plots obtained for sulfite oxidation, shows about an 810% increase at E0.45 V versus RHE (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the electronhole separation yields at 0.6 V versus RHE are 0.70±0.04 and 0.76±0.07 for untreated and N2-treated BiVO4, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that the 27% photocurrent enhancement observed at 0.6 V for the N2-treated sample is partially due to an increase in photon absorption and partially due to an increase in electronhole separation (see the Methods section and Supplementary Table 1 for detailed calculations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One plausible mechanism for N2 treatment to increase sep is to increase the carrier density by creating extra oxygen vacancies, which can serve as donors, in addition to the oxygen vacancies created for charge-balanced substitution of N3 with O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can result in an improvement in electron transport and, therefore, in electronhole separation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The carrier densities in BiVO4 and N2-treated BiVO4 electrodes were compared by obtaining MottSchottky plots (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For nanoporous films, since the regions that contribute to space-charge layer capacitance and the corresponding surface area cannot be precisely quantified, accurate quantitative analysis of carrier density using MottSchottky analysis is not possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, since the samples compared in this study have exactly the same morphologies (particle sizes, aggregations and connectivities), relative qualitative comparison of carrier densities should be possible by comparing the magnitude of the slopes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result shows that the slope of N2-treated BiVO4 is 1/7 of the slope of BiVO4, indicating that the N2-treated BiVO4 electrodes possess extra oxygen vacancies that serve as electron donors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the record-high photocurrent shown in Fig 3c is due to improved electron transport properties as well as bandgap reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An increase in n-type carrier density should result in a shift of flatband potential (EFB) to the negative direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, both the photocurrent onset and the EFB of the N2-treated sample are more positive than those of BiVO4 (Fig 3c; Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because the Helmholtz layer potential drop (VH) of the N2-treated BiVO4 electrode, which is another factor that affects the position of EFB (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  35), is more positive than that of BiVO4, which is indicated by zeta potential measurements (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The change in VH of the N2-treated sample appears to cancel out the effect of an increased donor density on EFB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Density functional theory calculations', 'The effect of charge-balanced N incorporation (that is, replacing three O2 with two N3) and of oxygen vacancies on the electronic band structure of BiVO4 were studied using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, to gain insights into the changes occurring in BiVO4 upon nitridation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experimental results show that in the N2-treated BiVO4, both N substitution and O vacancies are present at the same time, yielding a complex, combined effect on the electronic structure of BiVO4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before investigating such combined effect, we discuss the electronic properties of N substitution and oxygen vacancies separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We first performed spin-polarized calculations without addressing the charge imbalance between O2 and N3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the PerdewBurkeErnzerh (PBE)36 exchange correlation functional for pure BiVO4 and BiVO4 with 12.5% neutral O replaced with neutral N (1:1 substitution).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that in the presence of N the bandgap of BiVO4 was reduced by 0.5 eV (Supplementary Fig 5), mainly because of the hybridization of N and O 2p states close to VBM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of extra holes due to N substitution leads to two localized empty bands (level labelled a in Supplementary Fig 5b) inside the bandgap of BiVO4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These bands will no longer be present when N substitution accompanies charge-balancing O vacancies, which will serve as electron donors and compensate for excess holes from N substitution, as discussed below (see also Supplementary Fig 6 for the effect of artificially adding an electron per nitrogen to compensate for the excess holes from N substitution).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To understand the effect of O vacancies separately, we performed spin-polarized calculations at two different vacancy concentrations of 6 and 1.5%, using PBE and PBE with Hubbard U-corrections37 (PBE+U, effective U(V)=2.7 eV)17, to verify the robustness of our results with respect to the functional adopted in our calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both at the PBE and PBE+U levels of theory, at the two concentrations, we found that the presence of O vacancies, which were created by removing neutral O atoms, did not lead to any modification of the bandgap of BiVO4 (for details see Supplementary Figs 7 and 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed the formation of localized, filled states inside the bandgap of pristine BiVO4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the spin density of the gap states is localized on V, as shown in Supplementary Fig 8, causing local lattice distortions (in addition to those induced by missing O atoms), and indicating the formation of small polarons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, small polarons are likely to form in oxides such as BiVO4 that exhibit strong electronphonon interaction, as indicated, for example, by the large difference between the high frequency and static dielectric constants  (the high frequency and static , averaged over the three lattice directions, are 6.9 and 52, respectively, as computed by density functional perturbation theory38 for pure BiVO4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results on the formation of small polarons are consistent with recent mobility measurements on single crystal n-type BiVO4, which reported very low electron mobilities39 (0.2 cm2 V2 s1) and suggested that the conduction of electrons is dominated by small polaron hopping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous calculations showed that O vacancies lead to shallow donor levels in BiVO4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31), with negative ionization energies for E(V0/V2+) and that the only stable charged state for an O vacancy in BiVO4 is q=+2 due to the spontaneous ionization of two electrons, regardless of the Fermi level position40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with our finding that the two electrons present at an O vacancy site are ionized and localized at V atoms, thus forming small polarons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar findings for SrTiO3 have also been discussed in a recent study by Janotti et al.41 We also computed the small polaron binding energy42, that is, the energy difference between bound small polarons and free carriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a non-negligible value of 0.50 eV indicating that the formation of small polarons is energetically favourable (see Methods for calculation details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Having established the separate effects of N substitution and O vacancies on the electronic structure of BiVO4, we now turn to analyze their combined effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of charge-balanced N substitution (9% O replaced with 6% N and 3% O vacancy) we found that no states are formed in the bandgap of BiVO4, as shown in Fig 4a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because the electrons ionized from O vacancies compensate for the holes generated by N substitution, thus balancing the charge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No small polaron is formed at the vanadium sites in this case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The important finding is that the bandgap is still lowered by 0.30.4 eV (depending on the location in the lattice of the substituted N) compared to that of pure BiVO4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The computed projected density of states (as shown in Supplementary Fig 9) showed that the VBM has contributions from both O and N 2p states, similar to the case of N substitution discussed earlier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With lower doping concentration (4.5% O replaced with 3% N and 1.5% O vacancy), the VBM moves upward by 0.2 eV compared with that of pure BiVO4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In sum, we found that in the presence of N substitution and charge-compensating O vacancies, the bandgap decrease is similar to that obtained in the case where only substitutional N is present, and the bandgap decrease is more pronounced with increasing N concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure

provided by band structure calculations is insufficient to investigate light absorption efficiency of BiVO4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we also computed the optical transition probabilities from valence to conduction states for pristine and charge-balanced N-doped BiVO4 (9% O replaced with 6% N and 3% O vacancy) and simulated absorption spectra using the random phase approximation including local field effects43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this approximation neglects excitonic effects, we expect it to be accurate to account for changes in absorption spectra when N is added to the sample44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated the change of the exciton binding energy before and after doping by using a hydrogen-like model and we found it is of the order of 0.05 eV (see Methods for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectra were averaged over three lattice directions to compare with experimental results obtained from polycrystalline samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting simulated absorption spectra show that the absorption edge of N-doped BiVO4 is lower than that of the pristine BiVO4 by about 0.3 eV (Fig 4b), confirming that charge-balanced N substitution can indeed enhance visible light absorption at lower energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result agrees well with our experimental observation that incorporating 8% N results in a 0.2 eV reduction of the bandgap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our experimental results suggest that in addition to the O vacancies caused by charge-balanced replacement of O2 with N3, additional oxygen vacancies are present serving as electron donors in

balance the charges of substitutional N atoms, and the other half provide extra electrons to form polarons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed both a reduction of the bandgap by 0.3 eV (Fig 5a), compared

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Annealing of nanoporous BiVO4 at 350 °C under N2 flow resulted in substitutional incorporation of nitrogen and the formation of O vacancies, which simultaneously enhanced photon absorption, carrier density and carrier mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of N incorporation and O vacancies in the BiVO4 lattice were thoroughly examined experimentally and computationally to provide new understanding of the electronic band structures and photoelectrochemical properties of BiVO4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Charge-balanced N-doping (that is, 9% O replaced with 6% N and 3% O vacancy) reduced the bandgap of BiVO4 by elevating the VBM without introducing mid-gap states in the bandgap region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  N-doping also decreased the static dielectric constant of BiVO4 and improved the mobility of electrons, which are small polarons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the O vacancies required for charge-balanced N-doping, the N2-treated BiVO4 contained additional oxygen vacancies, which served as electron donors in N2-treated BiVO4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the major carrier density as well as the major carrier mobility of BiVO4 could be increased by the simple N2 treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimental and theoretical studies reported herein may serve as guidelines to further improve photon absorption and charge transport of BiVO4-based photoanodes for more practical and efficient solar water splitting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, predicting and incorporating a dopant that can simultaneously improve photon absorption and charge transport may serve as an effective strategy to improve photoelectrochemical performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies should also include identifying OECs that can optimally interface with BiVO4 electrodes with modified compositions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

magnitude of 1 Å, and it can be approximately computed as , where  is the number of centres per unit volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The computed  and 0 are 6.9 and 52, respectively, for undoped BiVO4 and we obtain rp=1.73 Å from our DFT calculations (at the PBE level of theory), which gives a polaron binding energy of 0.52 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model adopted here yields a lower bound for the polaron binding energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The polaron binding energy is non-negligible compared with kT; hence the formation of small polarons at V sites is energetically favoured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recent resistivity () measurements39 on single crystal n-doped BiVO4 show that between 250 and 400 K, the resistivity data perfectly fit to the adiabatic small polaron model42: , where T is the absolute temperature, k is the Boltzmanns constant and WH is the polaron hopping activation energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WH may be approximated by , where p and rp have been defined above42,54, in the formula

N substitution and 3% O vacancies) and 0 changed from 52 (pristine BiVO4) to 27 (doped BiVO4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significant lowering of 0 stems from the presence of several higher phonon vibrational frequencies present after N-doping (0 is inversely proportional to the square of the phonon vibrational frequencies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the WH is lowered by 1.1% upon doping, which leads to an improvement in the mobility  by 25% according to .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'DFT calculations for charge-balanced N-doped BiVO4', 'Projected density of states of BiVO4 with charge-balanced N-doping (9% O replaced with 6% N and 3% O vacancy) obtained within DFT-PBE+U is shown below (Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, due to the relative proportion of substitutional N atoms and O vacancies, electrons from O vacancies compensate for extra holes generated by N substitution, balancing the charge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the charge-balanced N-doping, we have also carried out calculations to study the stability of an N dopant and O vacancy complex, by comparing the total energy of a configuration where the O vacancy is far away from a N dopant (at a 710 Å distance) to that of a configuration where the O vacancy is close to a N dopant (at a 2 Å distance) in which case N dopants and O vacancies interact strongly to form a complex; we used a super cell with two N dopants and one extra O vacancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the total energy is lowered by 0.26 eV when forming a N dopantO vacancy complex, which means that the complex defect is thermodynamically preferred; however, the formation of this complex may be kinetically limited, as the N dopant or O vacancy have to migrate towards each other to form the complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the band structure of the sample where the N dopantO vacancy complex is present is more dispersive than that where the N dopants and O vacancies are far apart and the bandgap is 0.2 eV higher.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

necessary to charge N-substituted centres (doping concentration of 6% N and 6% O vacancies, see Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Supplementary Fig 10, the N 2p states lie at the top of valence band and are mixed with O 2p states; the presence of N leads to an increase of the VBM energy and a decrease of the bandgap of BiVO4 by 0.3 eV, (The bandgap here is defined as the energy difference between the bottom of the conduction band above the Fermi level and the top of the valence band (mixed O and N 2p states)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, there are filled gap states due to excess electrons from additional O vacancies, which are localized around V atoms, even with U=0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is probably due to lattice distortions occurring in the presence of N and favouring localization of electronic states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The major findings in different doping cases are summarized in Supplementary Table 2.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
