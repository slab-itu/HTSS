Hypoxia regulates global membrane protein endocytosis through caveolin-1 in cancer cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Hypoxia promotes tumour aggressiveness and resistance of cancers to oncological treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identification of cancer cell internalizing antigens for drug targeting to the hypoxic tumour niche remains a challenge of high clinical relevance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that hypoxia down-regulates the surface proteome at the global level and, more specifically, membrane proteome internalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that hypoxic down-regulation of constitutive endocytosis is HIF-independent, and involves caveolin-1-mediated inhibition of dynamin-dependent, membrane raft endocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Caveolin-1 overexpression inhibits protein internalization, suggesting a general negative regulatory role of caveolin-1 in endocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to this global inhibitory effect, we identify several proteins that can override caveolin-1 negative regulation, exhibiting increased internalization at hypoxia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate antibody-mediated cytotoxin delivery and killing specifically of hypoxic cells through one of these proteins, carbonic anhydrase IX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data reveal that caveolin-1 modulates cell-surface proteome turnover at hypoxia with potential implications for specific targeting of the hypoxic tumour microenvironment.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cancer cells thrive within a complex milieu characterized by hypoxia that plays a fundamental role in tumour development1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, hypoxic stress-induced signalling select for tumour cells that will successfully adapt to their hostile microenvironment and drive disease progression by inducing, for example, angiogenesis, immune cell evasion, coagulation and cancer cell stemness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These responses further result in resistance to conventional cancer therapies, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An increased understanding of cancer cell adaptive mechanisms to hypoxia is critical for the development of improved strategies in the fight against cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Abnormal trafficking of cell-surface receptors is involved in malignant transformation, and several endocytosis associated proteins are deregulated in cancer cells4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, overexpression of huntingtin-interacting protein 1, an adaptor for clathrin coat assembly, alters epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) trafficking during tumour development; mutant variants of hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR) exhibit increased endocytosis, resulting in enhanced tumour progression; and ras protein (RAS)-induced macropinocytosis of platelet derived growth factor receptor beta can promote tumour progression5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, accumulating evidence indicates that cellular responses to the extracellular environment are regulated by the spatial coordination of cell-surface proteins and further uptake and sorting into vesicular compartments of the endocytic systems4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, in some cases these mechanisms have been related to hypoxia, thereby contributing to an enhanced tumorigenic signalling7,8,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, cell-surface receptors with endocytic transport activity emerge as attractive targets for tumour-specific delivery of therapeutic substances, most importantly antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) that are currently approved in the treatment of breast cancer and lymphoma12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The overall effects of hypoxia on the cellular transcriptome, proteome and metabolome have been extensively studied, pointing at a diverse and relatively conserved response in malignant tumours of different origins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we were interested in elucidating how hypoxia at a functional level regulates the plasma membrane proteome and its endocytic activity to better understand how to target the microenvironment of aggressive tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have implemented a widely applicable method that integrates reversible membrane protein labelling with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), confocal microscopy imaging and quantitative proteomics analyses for the comprehensive visualization, quantification and identification of internalizing cell-surface proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data reveal that hypoxia modulates global cell-surface proteome endocytosis through caveolin-1 dependent mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings have potential implications for the spatial regulation of the receptor signalling pathways in tumour biology as well as for the development of treatment strategies specifically targeted at the tumour microenvironment.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Hypoxia down-regulates global membrane proteome endocytosis', 'To comprehensively study the dynamics of cell-surface proteome internalization at various treatment conditions, we initially established optimized procedures for reversible protein labelling on HeLa cells using a cell membrane impermeable and cleavable biotinylation agent integrated with FACS, confocal microscopy imaging and quantitative proteomics analyses (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell-surface proteome internalization was visualized by live cell confocal microscopy imaging, showing clearly visible translocation of cell-surface protein biotinylation to intracellular vesicles already at 5 min that continuously increased during 60 min (Supplementary Movie 1; representative images are shown in Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FACS experiments were performed to quantitatively investigate the fraction of the biotinylated membrane proteome that is endocytosed at various conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, treatment with the membrane impermeable reducing agent MesNa under optimized conditions reduced the residual cell-surface biotinylation signal to only 2% of the total signal (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the residual surface signal was virtually undetectable by confocal microscopy, while there was a significant intracellular signal from internalized, biotinylated proteins both by FACS and confocal imaging (Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this approach, we could demonstrate a time-dependent increase of membrane protein internalization; at 2 h 15% of the total cell-surface proteome was internalized, and then showed a decline at 8 h to 10% probably due to protein degradation (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further corroborate that the biotinylation signal was intracellular and associated with an endocytic process, cells were co-stained for biotin and EEA1, showing a clear co-association by confocal microscopy (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we pre-treated cells with established inhibitors of the major endocytic pathways including dynamin-dependent (Supplementary Fig 1a) and membrane raft-dependent endocytosis (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Constitutive protein internalization was significantly perturbed on treatment with the small molecule dynamin inhibitor dynasore14 as well as by disruption of cholesterol-rich membrane domains using methyl--cyclodextrin (MCD) (Fig 1g,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, cellular cholesterol pre-loading with low-density lipoprotein resulted in significantly increased constitutive protein internalization (Fig 1i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we found no major role of PI3K-dependent macropinocytosis (Fig 1j and Supplementary Fig 1c) or intact ERK1/2 signalling (Fig 1k and Supplementary Fig 1d) in constitutive internalization under these conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Dynamics of constitutive membrane protein endocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic outline of procedures for the quantification and encoding of cell-surface proteome endocytosis, as described in Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Representative confocal microscopy images of cell-surface and internalized biotinylated proteins in HeLa cells at the indicated time points (see also, Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 20 m.

three independent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  *P less_than 0.05 (Students t-test).Full size image', 'Our findings may reflect a general inhibitory effect of hypoxia on the endocytic machinery; we thus determined the activity of the major endocytic pathways, including clathrin-dependent uptake of transferrin, macropinocytic dextran uptake and membrane raft-dependent uptake of Cholera Toxin subunit-B (binds strongly to GM1, monosialotetrahexosylganglioside) uptake in normoxic and hypoxic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At odds with this idea, we found a significant increase of both transferrin and cholera toxin uptake at hypoxic as compared with normoxic conditions, whereas dextran uptake was not significantly affected by hypoxia (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that hypoxic stress reduced the overall membrane protein internalizing capacity through mechanisms that apparently were not associated with a general down-regulation of the major endocytic pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, this finding was not restricted to HeLa cells, as comparable results were obtained with additional cancer cell-lines from human glioblastoma multiforme (U87-MG), breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) and lung cancer (A549) (Fig 2gl).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Hypoxic down-regulation of endocytosis depends on caveolin-1', 'To elucidate the mechanisms of hypoxic effects on membrane protein internalization, we performed gene array studies with cells from normoxic and hypoxic conditions, specifically focusing on proteins that may be involved in the regulation of membrane protein trafficking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both HeLa (Fig 3a) and U87-MG (Fig 3b) cells, we found significant hypoxic induction of caveolin-1 mRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was of interest as caveolin-1 has previously been implicated in tumour development, and as a major regulator of endocytosis16,17,18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, loss of caveolin-1 may increase the mobility of membrane raft components, and caveolin-1 has been shown to negatively regulate the endocytosis of, for example, autocrine motility factor, toxins, pathogens as well as exosomes21,22,23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found significantly enhanced expression of caveolin-1 protein in hypoxic regions of glioblastoma patient tumours (Fig 3c), as determined by co-staining for the well-established hypoxia marker glucose transporter-1 (Glut-1)26 as well as increased levels of caveolin-1 in hypoxic as compared with normoxic HeLa and U87-MG cells in vitro, as shown by immunoblotting (Fig 3d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there was only a weak co-association between internalized membrane proteins and caveolin-1 (Fig 3f), indicating that caveolin-1 positive endocytic vesicles are not directly involved or have only a minor role in constitutive protein internalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This did not, however, exclude that caveolin-1 may stabilize and negatively regulate membrane protein internalization as caveolin-1 can inhibit endocytosis through an indirect mechanism that is not necessarily caveolae-associated17,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate this possibility, stable caveolin-1 knock-down HeLa cells were generated by lentiviral transduction, showing maintained reduction of caveolin-1 also at hypoxic conditions (Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In normoxic cells, caveolin-1 deficiency did not significantly alter the total biotinylated surface proteome as compared with control cells stably transduced with a scrambled shRNA sequence (Fig 3g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At hypoxic conditions, there was a significant but limited reduction (15%) of surface proteins in caveolin-1 deficient as compared with control cells (Fig 3g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that caveolin-1 deficiency significantly increased surface protein internalization in normoxic cells (by 10%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, this effect was substantially greater at hypoxic conditions with an 75% increase as compared with hypoxic control cells (Fig 3h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these results suggested that loss of caveolin-1 could reverse the inhibitory effect of hypoxia on global surface proteome internalization, and that this effect was not due to an overall increase of protein sorting to the cell-surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conclusion was supported by imaging studies, showing clearly enhanced protein internalization in caveolin-1 deficient as compared with control cells at hypoxic conditions (Fig 3i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we found that global protein internalization was increased by almost two fold at hypoxia (Fig 3j and Supplementary Fig 3b) while slightly decreased at normoxia (Supplementary Fig 3c) in caveolin-1 knockout (KO) as compared with wild-type (WT) mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells, showing that loss of caveolin-1 increases protein internalization preferentially at hypoxia also in a well-defined system of caveolin-1 deficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate whether this effect could be reversed, caveolin-1 was reintroduced into hypoxic caveolin-1 knockdown (KD) HeLa as well as MEF caveolin-1 KO cells by transfection with a caveolin-1 encoding plasmid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results revealed that caveolin-1 overexpression dramatically inhibits global protein internalization (Fig 3k,l and Supplementary Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these findings provide evidence that caveolin-1 has a significant role as a negative regulator of surface protein internalization at conditions of hypoxic stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Caveolin-1 regulates

addressed which of these major pathways are affected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that dynamin inhibition in normoxic cells results in a reduction of global protein internalization that is similar to the reduction induced by hypoxia, and that combined treatment with hypoxia and dynamin inhibition did not result in additive reduction of membrane protein internalization as compared with the respective treatments alone (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, in both HeLa and MEF cells, the increased protein internalization in hypoxic cells on caveolin-1 deficiency was reversed by dynamin inhibition

Scale bar, 20 m.Full size image', 'The above data (Fig 2df) show an effect also of acute hypoxia (2 h) on endocytosis, and the induction of total caveolin-1 even at prolonged hypoxia was significant but limited (Fig 3d,e), that is, it remained unclear how hypoxia could have such a rapid impact on endocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been reported that hypoxic induction of caveolin-1 depends on hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 and HIF-2 and that HIF promotes the formation of caveolae8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that HIF-1 is substantially induced both at acute (2 h) and prolonged hypoxia (20 h) (Fig 4d), whereas hypoxic induction of HIF-2 is virtually absent at 2 h and limited at 20 h of hypoxia (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus further explored the potential role of HIF-1 in hypoxic regulation of membrane protein endocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated HIF-1 KD using two different siRNA sequences (see Supplementary Fig 3e for KD validation results) showed no effect on endocytosis in hypoxic cells (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicated a HIF-1-independent mechanism and, accordingly, total caveolin-1 levels were not increased in acute hypoxia (Fig 4g,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies on how caveolin-1 can negatively regulate endocytosis independently of caveolae through the formation of stable, oligomerised microdomains or scaffolds at the membrane17,27 suggested that hypoxia may affect the cellular distribution of caveolin-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, using fluorescence microscopy and quantitative image analysis, we found that the fraction of peripheral, membrane associated caveolin-1 is significantly increased in short term hypoxic (2 h) as compared with normoxic cells (Fig 4i,j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This changed pattern of caveolin-1 distribution by hypoxia was also consistently found in MEF cells (Supplementary Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To corroborate these results and to exclude the possibility of an immunostaining artefact, we next introduced caveolin-1-mCherry into caveolin-1 KD cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Real-time confocal imaging clearly showed increased peripheral caveolin-1-mCherry in acute hypoxia (2 h) as compared with normoxic cells (Supplementary Movies 2 and 3; Supplementary Fig 3g and h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these data show that acute hypoxia inhibits endocytosis in a HIF-independent manner, and distributes caveolin-1 to the cell periphery with effects on the dynamics and endocytic capacity of cell-surface proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Encoding the hypoxic internalizing proteome', 'We were interested to explore the existence of unique surface antigens that, in contrast to the global trend, may display enhanced internalization at hypoxia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such proteins should represent interesting candidates for targeting of the tumour microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further improve the separation of internalized biotinylated proteins from residual, surface-resident proteins we introduced another blocking step with free streptavidin before isolation of internalized proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Supplementary Fig 4ad, using this approach we achieved a complete eradication of remaining surface biotin labelling without affecting labelling of internalized proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For proteomic analyses, biotinylated proteins either at the cell-surface or following 2 h of endocytosis from hypoxic and normoxic cells were isolated by streptavidin affinity chromatography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we again took advantage of the cleavable biotin-protein linker to release biotinylated proteins from streptavidin by the reducing agent MesNa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peptides from eluted proteins were then separated by hydrophobic liquid chromatography and analyzed by tandem mass spectroscopy (LC/MSMS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein identities were selected for further quantitative analyses primarily on the basis of: 1) Their relative absence in negative control cells, 2) Reproducible identification of at least two unique peptides between replicates and 3) Their expected subcellular localization from available literature and open-source protein databases (PubMed and neXtProt) (Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using these criteria, candidate proteins of interest were subjected to MS1 filtering protocol using the publicly available software Skyline (http://proteome.gs.washington.edu/software/skyline)28, which has been established as a sensitive approach for high throughput label-free quantification of peptides29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, these techniques show variation in peptide signal intensities depending on protein abundance30, which is also common for other protein quantification assays31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Raw data generated within Proteome Discoverer was imported into Skyline for quantitative analysis on the basis of extracted ion chromatograms from multiple experiments (Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these analyses, we obtained a mapping of relative levels of cell-surface and internalized proteins in hypoxic versus normoxic cells (Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When classified according to function by ConsensusPathDB interaction database32, most of the candidate proteins were associated with cell signalling and carbohydrate recognition as well as macromolecular binding, in addition to virus receptor activity and extracellular matrix binding (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 5b, the majority of hypoxia regulated proteins were induced 1.5- to 10-fold as compared with normoxia, both at the surface and following internalization, but we also found proteins induced  greater than 10-fold or that were exclusively detected in hypoxic

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The general principle of targeted cancer therapy is to achieve tumour-specific drug delivery and to reduce unwanted side-effects in healthy tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Until now, this concept is best exemplified by the growth factor receptor HER2, that is an established target of the ADC ado-trastuzumab-emtansine in the treatment of breast cancer patients13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Improved strategies for the comprehensive analysis of surface protein expression and uptake activity in cancer cells should thus have important clinical implications37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we have implemented a widely applicable method for the comprehensive visualization, quantification and identification of internalizing cell-surface proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this strategy, we provide new insights into how hypoxia at the global level down-regulates the capacity of cancer cells to endocytose membrane proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide first evidence that hypoxia down-regulates constitutive membrane protein internalization through mechanisms involving caveolin-1, that is, a key player in clathrin-independent endocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that hypoxia regulates both the total expression and the cellular distribution of caveolin-1 to inhibit endocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic loss of function experiments revealed that hypoxic down-regulation of membrane protein internalization depends on intact caveolin-1 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further demonstrate that caveolin-1 overexpression profoundly restricts the internalizing capacity of hypoxic cells at the global level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Caveolin-1 is a major structural component of caveolae, which are small (50100 nm) membrane compartments associated with the plasma membrane39 where they play important pathophysiological roles related to signalling transduction and endocytosis with documented implications in tumour development16,17,18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of relevance for the present investigation, caveolin-1 has been shown to attenuate the uptake of a wide variety of ligands, both through the dynamin-dependent and -independent membrane raft pathways16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,27,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that dynamin inhibition at normoxia mimics the hypoxic inhibition of protein internalization, and that there is no additive reduction of endocytosis by dynamin inhibition in hypoxic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, dynamin inhibition attenuated the increased protein internalization in caveolin-1-deficient cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show that caveolin-1 negatively regulates dynamin-dependent endocytosis in hypoxic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies suggest that caveolin-1 may have direct modulatory effects on plasma membrane lipid and protein organization that is not directly related to caveolae formation17,27,41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain was linked to perturbed diffusion within membrane lipid microdomains, resulting in decreased membrane protein mobility43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The previous and present investigations point at the interesting possibility that cellular uptake of microbes, exosomes and other macromolecular ligands is governed by local oxygen availability and hypoxia-mediated regulation of caveolin-1 expression and cellular distribution with general relevance in pathophysiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cellular adaptation to hypoxia is largely executed by HIFs, which are heterodimeric transcription factors composed of a constitutively expressed -subunit and one of three hypoxia inducible HIF--subunits44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Wang et al.8, reported that ligand-independent activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) EGFR, that is, one of the candidate proteins showing enhanced internalization at hypoxia (Fig 5), was enhanced due to HIF-mediated caveolin-1 and caveolae induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, in the context of ligand-dependent EGFR internalization, hypoxia was shown to maintain EGFR signalling to promote cell survival by decelerating Rab5-mediated fusion of early endosomes7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we found that hypoxia can inhibit global protein internalization independently of HIFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional RTKs associated with tumour development may be hypoxia-regulated9, such as the hepatocyte growth factor receptor MET10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, we identified several RTKs, including MET, as candidate proteins exhibiting increased constitutive internalization under hypoxic conditions (DDR1, IGFR1, IGF2R and ROR2; see Fig 5 and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, while causing a general down-regulation of membrane protein expression and internalization, hypoxia may selectively induce constitutive RTK internalization and signalling in a situation of poor ligand availability, thereby promoting tumour progression and development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also identified several members of the integrin family (ITGA1, -2, -3 and -5; ITGB1 and -5) among our candidate proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Endosomal sorting and recycling of integrins have been shown to regulate cancer cell adhesive and migratory behaviour45 with important implications for tumour development and metastasis3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How caveolin-1 may act in concert with additional regulators of membrane protein mobility to regulate the spatial distribution of, for example, integrins and RTKs in the hypoxic tumour microenvironment should be an interesting area of future investigations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The first established example of direct targeting of the hypoxia-induced pathways in clinical oncology is represented by anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody therapy with bevacizumab; however, the success of anti-angiogenic agents may be limited by the selection of malignant cells that adapt to an even more hypoxic microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results support the concept that the adaptive response of cancer cells to hypoxic stress provides opportunities for tumour-specific drug delivery via hypoxia-induced internalization of specific membrane proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, we show that CAIX induction can override the negative regulation by caveolin-1 on protein internalization in hypoxic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As proof of principle of this concept, we show that an ADC complex targeted at CAIX is efficiently and specifically internalized at hypoxic conditions, resulting in highly selective toxin delivery to and killing of hypoxic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, our data show that hypoxia and caveolin-1 at a functional level regulates the internalizing activity of the membrane proteome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings have potential implications for the spatial regulation of the receptor signalling pathways in tumour biology as well as for the development of treatment strategies specifically targeted at the tumour microenvironment.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
