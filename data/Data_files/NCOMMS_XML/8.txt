Standards and figure-of-merits for quantifying the performance of triboelectric nanogenerators  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Triboelectric nanogenerators have been invented as a highly efficient, cost-effective and easy scalable energy-harvesting technology for converting ambient mechanical energy into electricity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four basic working modes have been demonstrated, each of which has different designs to accommodate the corresponding mechanical triggering conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A common standard is thus required to quantify the performance of the triboelectric nanogenerators so that their outputs can be compared and evaluated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report figure-of-merits for defining the performance of a triboelectric nanogenerator, which is composed of a structural figure-of-merit related to the structure and a material figure of merit that is the square of the surface charge density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structural figure-of-merit is derived and simulated to compare the triboelectric nanogenerators with different configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A standard method is introduced to quantify the material figure-of-merit for a general surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study is likely to establish the standards for developing TENGs towards practical applications and industrialization.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'With the rapid growth of portable and wearable electronics, more attentions have been focused on the development of mobile power sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current approach for powering these electronic devices is to use batteries, which usually have the limited lifetime and inevitable environmental issues caused by the disposed batteries1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Managing, replacing and monitoring the power levels of the batteries that are vastly and dispersedly distributed in almost every corner becomes a huge and impossible task, since it is estimated that the world will have trillions of connection nodes and sensor units by 2020.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, instead of using batteries, nanogenerators2 have been developed to harvest energy from the working environment to make the devices self-powered, including triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG)1,3,4,5, piezoelectric nanogenerators6,7,8 and pyroelectric nanogenerators9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TENG, which is based on the coupling of triboelectrification and electrostatic induction, has shown advantages such as high output, high energy-conversion efficiency, abundant choices of materials, scalability and flexibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To improve the performance and broaden the applications of TENG, numerous efforts have been made with focus on both enhancement of the surface charge density  (refs 10, 11) and development of new structures/modes12,13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, without a common standard it becomes difficult to evaluate the performance of a TENG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison with its counterparts, standards have been established for alternative power generators, such as Carnot efficiency for heat engines17,18 and pyroelectric nanogenerators19,20, figure of merit (ZT) for thermoelectric materials21,22 and energy-conversion efficiency for solar cells23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Currently, four basic modes of TENG have been developed1,4, including vertical contact-separation (CS) mode3,10,25, lateral sliding (LS) mode12,13,26, single-electrode (SE) mode15,27 and freestanding triboelectric-layer (FT) mode14,16,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each mode has its own structure and choice of materials as well as specific mechanical triggering configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking the CS mode as an example, it is triggered by a vertical periodic driving force that causes a repeated CS of two dissimilar materials that have coated electrodes on the top and bottom surfaces, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As for the LS mode, it is triggered by a LS motion between two dissimilar materials in parallel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate and compare the performance of the TENGs in different structures/modes, a universal standard has to be introduced to quantify the performance of the TENG, regardless its operation mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we propose a standard method to quantitatively evaluate TENGs performance from both structures and the materials points of view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starting from the plot of built-up voltage Vtotal transferred charges Q, we first propose the TENG operation cycle with maximized energy output.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of this cycle, we propose a performance figure-of-merit (FOMp) for TENG, which consists of a structural FOM (FOMS) related to the design of the TENG and a material FOM (FOMM) as the square of the surface charge density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To characterize and compare different structures of TENGs, the structural FOM for each configuration of TENG is derived and simulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A standard method is proposed to quantify the material FOM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proposed standards will set the foundation for the further applications and industrialization of the TENGs.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cycles for energy output of TENG', 'The fundamental working principle of the TENG is a conjugation of triboelectrification and electrostatic induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a basic TENG, there is at least one pair of triboelectric layers (two pairs for FT mode and one pair for all other modes) that are facing each other for creating opposite triboelectric charges via physical contacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides the triboelectric layers, there are two electrodes (for SE mode, the ground is considered as the second/reference electrode27) that are carefully insulated from each other, which are required for the free electrons to be transferred between them through an external load.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Triggered by the external mechanical force, there is a periodical relative motion between the triboelectric layers that breaks the balanced distribution of electrostatic charges; as a result, free electrons are driven to flow between the electrodes to build a new equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the governing equations of TENG can be developed on the basis of the relationship among the transferred charges between the electrodes Q, the built-up voltage V and the relative displacement x between the triboelectric layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detailed definitions of x for different structures of TENG are illustrated in Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use the most commonly utilized minimum achievable charge reference state (MACRS)28; therefore, both the absolute short-circuit transferred charges QSC(x) and the absolute open-circuit voltage VOC(x) at x=0 position are set to be 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The definitions of the displacement x and the two electrodes for an LS-mode TENG are illustrated in Fig 1a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maxima of QSC,max and VOC,max are expected to be reached at x=xmax for these basic-mode TENGs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Operation cycles of TENG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic diagram of the LS-mode TENG with displacement x=0 and x=xmax.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) The CEO with load resistance R=100 M.

step 2, turn the switch on to enable Q=QSC,max and then turn the switch off; step 3, triboelectric layers displace relatively from x=xmax to x=0 at switch off; step 4, turn the switch on to enable Q=0, and then turn the switch off.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the maximized total cycling charge QC=QSC,max was enabled by the instantaneous short-circuit conditions in steps 2 and 4, as controlled by the switch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulation results with respect to various external load resistances were plotted as Fig 1e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cycles can be named as cycles for maximized energy output (CMEO).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, benefited from the maximized total cycling charges, the output energy per cycle of the CMEO was always higher than that of the CEO with the same load resistance R, as observed in the encircled areas in Fig 1c,e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We noticed that for the CMEO, higher output energy per cycle can be achieved with larger external load resistance R (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the maximized output energy per cycle can be achieved at R=+, which is the open-circuit condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We simulated this maximized output energy by simply removing the external load and operating the remaining part of the circuit the same as that for the steps in the CMEO case as stated above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding VQ curve was plotted as the CMEO with infinite load resistance as shown in Fig 1e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This CMEO has a trapezoid shape, the vertices of which are determined by the maximum short-circuit transferred charge QSC,max, the maximum open-circuit voltage VOC,max and the maximum achievable absolute voltage Vmax at Q=QSC,max.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be easily proven that the VQ plots for all kinds of the TENG operations are limited inside the four edges of this trapezoid (Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, with the largest encircled area, this cycle has the largest possible output energy per cycle, which can be calculated using the following equation:', '', 'This Em can also be derived theoretically as the largest possible output energy per cycle in any operations of the TENG, as shown in the Supplementary Note 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Experimental demonstration of cycles of TENG', 'Here we also demonstrated that the CEO and the CMEO can be easily achieved experimentally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An LS-mode TENG with parameters close to that in Table 1 was fabricated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An aluminium (Al) foil was used as one electrode and the motion part.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The copper (Cu) layer deposited on the fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) film was utilized as the other electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Al foil and the FEP film are the pair of triboelectric layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the VQ plot of CEO was demonstrated by using an external load resistance of 250 M, as shown in Fig 2a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We noticed that the steady state of the CEO was achieved only after a few periods of operation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  And then, controlled by a switch in series, the VQ plot of CMEO with external load resistances of 250 M and infinite was also demonstrated, as shown in Fig 2b,c, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the features of the three VQ plots are very consistent with the simulated results as shown in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also measured and plotted the VQ plots of CEO and CMEO with various external load resistances as Supplementary Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the trends of the characteristics with the varied resistances of these plots are very consistent with that of the simulated results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can easily conclude from the encircled areas that the output energy per cycle of the CMEO with infinite external load resistance was the highest one in that of these cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each output energy per cycle was calculated using equation (1), as shown in Table 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrated and further confirmed that the experimentally achievable CMEO can harvest the maximized output energy per cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the instantaneous discharging TENG with a switch triggered by the motion of TENG, which was actually operated in CMEO, has been demonstrated to have gigantic enhanced instantaneous power compared with the traditional TENG operated in CEO29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Experimental results of the CMEOs and the CEO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The VQ plot of the CEO with external load resistance of 250 M.

to the triboelectrification area A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, to exclude the effect of the TENG size on the output energy, the area A should be placed in denominator of this term.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

of the paired-electrode TENGs is dramatically better than that of SE TENGs with the same size and materials because of the limited transferred charges and suppressed built-in voltages in SE TENG, which has been reported previously27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the performance of TENG triggered by CS action is better than that of TENG triggered by sliding (assuming that the triboelectric charge densities created by CS and sliding are the same) because, to achieve the same VOC,max, a much higher xmax of TENG triggered by sliding is required compared with that of TENG triggered by CS, resulting in a smaller FOMS,max.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the freestanding configuration enhances the performance by dramatically decreasing the capacitance between electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high FOMS,max of CFT structure is also benefited by the large transferred charges induced by the double-side triboelectrification of the middle dielectric layer during operation (as shown in Supplementary Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The measurement of  and the dimensionless FOMM', 'The triboelectric surface charge density  is the only material-related parameter in FOMP as shown in

by the triboelectric performance of the materials in contact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the existing triboelectric series is a qualitative measure of the materials triboelectric performances4, a quantitative measuring matrix is required for TENGs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Current studies of the triboelectric performance are influenced by the low contact intimacy induced by the nanometre-to-micrometre-level surface roughness in solid materials31,32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the measured surface charge density by solid-solid contact was not able to reach its highest possible value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome this limitation of the solid surface and to build the measuring matrix for triboelectric performance of materials, we can utilize liquid metals such as liquid gallium (Ga, melting point: 29.8 °C), galinstan (a eutectic alloy consisting of 68.5 wt% gallium, 21.5 wt% indium and 10 wt% tin, melting point: 19 °C) and mercury (melting point: 38.8 °C) as one triboelectrification material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is expected that, by using these liquid metals, the contact intimacy could be greatly enhanced since the liquid metals are shape-adaptive to the solid surfaces34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here the non-toxic liquid gallium and galinstan were utilized in our experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prevent them from being oxidized that would happen very fast for all the liquid metals containing gallium34,35,36,37, the experiments were performed in a glove box with argon environment and the fixed condition of room temperature, 1 atm and 0.006% in relative humidity (RH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The set-up of the measurement experiment is shown in Fig 4a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the tested material was deposited with Cu thin film as one electrode, and the liquid galinstan (from rotometals) or liquid gallium (from VWR) was used as the other electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the material surface was contacted with the liquid metal surface, the charges were created on both the material and liquid metal surfaces by triboelectrification effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  And then, after the material along with the Cu electrode was lifted above the liquid metal surface for a height much larger (over 100 times) than the thickness of the materials, the charges induced by triboelectrification would be approximately fully transferred to the Cu electrode in short-circuit condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transferred charges were measured as the triboelectric charges, and then the charge density was calculated by the charges over the area of the triboelectrification surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To make comparisons, solid gallium was also utilized to replace liquid metals as one electrode for charge density measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The good repeatability of charge transfer was observed during multiple CS processes (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tested materials included FEP, Kapton, polarized polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF),

densities can be achieved33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The varied charge densities measured by contacting the same material with different liquid metals might be because of the different capabilities of the

'Fabrication and operations of the LS-mode TENG', 'The static part of the TENG was fabricated by depositing copper (Cu) film as electrode on a 50-m-thick FEP film, and then the Cu/FEP film was attached on an acrylic board with the Cu side facing to the acrylic board.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The aluminium (Al) foil attached on another acrylic board was used as the motion part.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To operate the TENG, the motion part was mounted on a linear motor and the static part was mounted on a three-dimensional stage, and the FEP surface and the Al foil were placed to face to each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The linear motor was controlled to move periodically with displacement of 3.5 cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the CEO, the linear motor was controlled to move continuously with a period of 0.34 s, with an external resistor with resistance of 250 M used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the CMEO, after each sliding motion in one direction, the motor was hold with a wait time of 5 s, and the switch was triggered right at the beginning and the end of the 5-s wait time period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resistor was either used or not used to make the external load resistance of 250 M and infinite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The voltage and transferred charge were measured using a Keithley 6514 system electrometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'FEM simulation methods', 'The simulation process includes electrostatic simulation and load-circuit simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For electrostatic simulation, the COMSOL electrostatic module is utilized to calculate VOC(x), C(x) and QSC(x) under MACRS; therefore, all the information required for the largest possible energy output per cycle Em can be obtained and the structural FOM can be calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'If a TENG is connected with a load resistance, the governing equation combining the resistive load and TENG is shown as:', '', 'The voltage output is calculated as:', '', 'As an example of typical mechanical motion, we utilize the harmonic mechanical motion in which the x(t) is defined as', '', 'To calculate the steady-state output for CEO, we can simply apply the periodic boundary condition of Q (t=0)=Q (t=T), where T is the period of external periodic mechanical motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To calculate the output for CMEO, we need to solve the differential equation for each half cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the first half cycle, when the electrostatic potential is balanced, the boundary condition is: (under MACRS) Q (t=0)=0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the second half cycle, when the electrostatic potential is balanced again, the boundary condition is Q (t=T/2)=QSC,max.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Measurement of surface charge density with liquid metals', 'The cantilever was made by an acrylic block (with area of 19 × 19 mm) attached to an acrylic board.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tested material was cut to be 19 × 19 mm and was deposited with copper (Cu) film as the electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This tested material was attached on the acrylic block in the cantilever with the Cu electrode facing to the surface of the block.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This whole cantilever was mounted on a three-dimensional stage, and the cantilever can be lifted and pushed down manually.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  And then this structure along with a plastic Petri dish and the liquid metals was moved to a glove box with argon environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The environmental condition was fixed at room temperature, 1 atm and 0.006% RH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For liquid gallium, the unpacked bottle was heated on the hot plated in 50 °C for 5 min before moving into the glove box.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the glove box, the liquid metal was poured to the Petri dish, which was placed right below the tested material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two copper wires were connected on the Cu film and the liquid metal as two electrodes, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lowest position of the cantilever was carefully adjusted to make sure precisely right contact between the tested material and the liquid metal; therefore, there is actually very minimum pressure applied on the liquid metal while contacting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  And then the cantilever was lifted and pushed down periodically by hands to achieve CS process, with the period of 412 s. The transferred charge was measured using a Keithley 6514 system electrometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The charge density measurement with the solid gallium was performed after the solidification of liquid gallium.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
