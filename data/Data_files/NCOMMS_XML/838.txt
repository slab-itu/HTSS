Colossal negative thermal expansion in reduced layered ruthenate  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Large negative thermal expansion (NTE) has been discovered during the last decade in materials of various kinds, particularly materials associated with a magnetic, ferroelectric or charge-transfer phase transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such NTE materials have attracted considerable attention for use as thermal-expansion compensators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report the discovery of giant NTE for reduced layered ruthenate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total volume change related to NTE reaches 6.7% in dilatometry, a value twice as large as the largest volume change reported to date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a giant negative coefficient of linear thermal expansion =115 × 106 K1 over 200 K interval below 345 K. This dilatometric NTE is too large to be attributable to the crystallographic unit-cell volume variation with temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highly anisotropic thermal expansion of the crystal grains might underlie giant bulk NTE via microstructural effects consuming open spaces in the sintered body on heating.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Rapid advances in modern technology require industrial materials that can adapt to severe conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One means of adaptation is controlled thermal expansion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although thermal expansion is typically a 105 to 106 change in length, even such a minute change fatally degrades the performance of devices and instruments in many fields of industry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, negative thermal expansion (NTE) materials1,2,3,4,5, materials that contract during heating, have been attracting great attention because NTE materials can be used to tune the overall thermal expansion of materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkable development in the field of NTE materials was provoked by the discovery of large, isotropic NTE over a wide range of temperatures T in ZrW2O8 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This NTE originates from a characteristic crystal structure called a flexible network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This class of NTE materials reaches an extremely large NTE of =34 × 106 K1 in Cd(CN)2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7), where  is the coefficient of linear thermal expansion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In recent years, new materials in this category, such as ScF3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8), have been identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Another avenue towards discovery of giant NTE is the utilization of a phase transition accompanied by large volume contraction on heating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effectiveness of this approach was recognized widely by the giant NTE of the antiperovskite manganese nitrides Mn3AN, where A represents a metal or semiconducting element9, which use volume change caused by a magnetic transition (that is, magnetovolume effects).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The giant NTE of Mn3AN strongly influenced subsequent NTE research, leading to the discovery of many phase-transition-type NTE materials such as La(Fe, Si, Co)13 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10) and MnCo0.98Cr0.02Ge (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11), which use magnetovolume effects, SrCu3Fe4O12 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12) and Bi0.95La0.05NiO3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13), which use intermetallic charge transfer, and 0.4PbTiO30.6BiFeO3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14), which uses a ferroelectric transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One promising mother compound for NTE materials is layered ruthenate Ca2RuO4 (refs 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It undergoes a metalinsulator (MI) transition, which is apparently accompanied by volume expansion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using dilatometry, we discovered giant NTE of large total volume change V/V=6.7% and =115 × 106 K1 (T of 210 K) in reduced Ca2RuO4 (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gigantic volumetric NTE is too large to be attributable to the unit-cell volume NTE estimated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discuss microstructural effects that enhance the bulk NTE of sintered samples.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Thermal-expansion properties', 'First, the present NTE of Ca2RuO4 is compared with NTE that are presently known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1 shows linear thermal expansion L(T)/L of Ca2RuO4 and Ca2Ru1xMxO4 (M: Mn, Fe and Cu) in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vertical (cylindrical, z) and horizontal (radial, r) expansions of the Ca2RuO4 sintered pellets are identical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is isotropic and volumetric NTE (inset of Fig 1, see Methods section for conditions of linear thermal-expansion measurements).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parameters related to NTE for recently discovered giant NTE materials are presented in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest V/V related to NTE reported until now is 3.2% for MnCo0.98Cr0.02Ge (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data of L/L for this alloy are presented for comparison in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data for Pu23 and YMn2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24) are also included in Table 1 for comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These reference materials exhibit large volume contraction on heating at the phase transition, but they exhibit abrupt volume changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, these materials are not categorized as NTE materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extreme volume contraction on heating of Pu is 5.4% in successive  phase transitions23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  V/V reaches 6.7% at most for the present Ca2RuO4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a large total volume change produces gigantic NTE of =115 × 106K1 at T=135345 K. The present Ca2RuO4 possesses greater volume contraction on heating at ambient pressure than all the listed materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, it exhibits giant NTE over a wide T range, including room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Linear thermal expansion L/Lof reduced layered ruthenates.The data were collected on a warming process using a laser-interference dilatometer (the y values are presented in Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reference temperature: 500 K. The reduced Ca2RuO3.74 exhibits giant negative thermal expansion (NTE) of =115 × 106 K1 (: coefficient of linear thermal expansion) over 200 K interval below 345 K. The vertical (z) and horizontal (r) expansions measured using a thermomechanical analyzer were found to be identical (inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, this NTE is volumetric.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total volume change V/V related to NTE reaches 6.7% at most.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Substituting the transition-metal elements for Ru reduces the total volume change, but increases the onset of NTE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particularly, the Fe-doped ruthenate exhibits temperature-linear behaviour below 500 K, which is favourable for practical applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, data of MnCo0.98Cr0.02Ge11 are also shown.Full size image', 'Table 1 Parameters related to negative thermal expansion for recently discovered giant negative thermal-expansion materials.Full size table', 'Earlier studies have revealed that Ca2RuO4 undergoes a Mott MI phase transition from a high-T metallic to a low-T insulating state at TMI of 360 K (refs 15, 16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this transition, the crystal structure also changes from the high-T L phase with a longer c axis to the low-T S phase with a shorter c axis while preserving the orthorhombic crystal structure of the Pbca symmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some earlier studies have also found the appearance of NTE in Ca2RuO4 because the unit-cell volume v of the S phase is greater than that of the L phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed structural analysis17 has revealed volume contraction V/V of 1% during heating from 100 to 400 K. Qi et al.20 reported successive phase transitions with V/V of completely 0.9% of volume contraction on heating for Ca2Ru0.933Cr0.067O4 and NTE of =10 × 106 K1 at T=120400 K (V/V of 0.8%) for Ca2Ru0.90Mn0.10O4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total volume change of the present Ca2RuO4, V/V=6.7%, is much greater than those previous results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Partial replacement of Ru by other elements alters the thermal-expansion properties of Ca2RuO4 such as the operating-temperature window T, negative slope , and the total volume change V/V.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigated the effects of three dopants, Mn, Fe and Cu (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dopants Mn, Fe and Cu increase the onset of NTE, Tonset, although they decrease the respective total volume changes: Tonset=470 K and V/V=3.1% for Ca2Ru0.90Mn0.10O4 (Mn0.10), Tonset=500 K or higher and V/V=2.8% for Ca2Ru0.92Fe0.08O4 (Fe0.08), and Tonset=430 K and V/V=4.4% for Ca2Ru0.90Cu0.10O4 (Cu0.10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particularly, the Fe-doped ruthenate exhibits T-linear expansion in almost the entire range of T below 500 K, which is favourable for practical applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thermal expansion exhibits almost T-linear behaviour, even near the lowest temperature (95 K) used for the present dilatometry measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, NTE apparently continues down to the lower temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In that case, the total volume change V/V might become greater than the present estimate of 2.8% (T=95500 K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Effects of oxygen deficiency', 'We can examine the differences between the present materials showing giant NTE and previous materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2 shows linear thermal expansion L(T)/L of reduced (#1), oxidized (#2), and re-reduced (#3) Ca2RuO4 in the present experiments (see Methods section for sample preparation conditions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The giant NTE of the reduced sample is suppressed dramatically by high-pressure oxidizing procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When this oxidized sample is reduced again, the giant NTE is recovered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results presented above imply that differences in oxygen contents produce a striking difference in thermal-expansion properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evaluations of the oxygen contents by thermogravimetric analysis are y=0.26(1), 0.03(1) and 0.31(1), respectively, for the reduced, oxidized and re-reduced samples in the notation of Ca2RuO4+y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reports of an earlier study described that y fell within the range of 0.01(1) to +0.07(1)15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present reduced ruthenates are regarded as having larger amounts of oxygen deficiency than the previous ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hereinafter, we use Ca2Ru1xMxO4+y notation as the present materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The y values are presented in Table 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Linear thermal expansion L/L of Ca2RuO4+y.The data were collected on a warming process using a laser-interference dilatometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reference temperature: 500 K.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Some materials are reported to have dilatometric NTE greater than the crystallographic unit-cell volume NTE in sintered ceramics1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One well known example is -eucryptite26,27, which has been widely used as a practical thermal-expansion compensator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On cooling from 1,073 to 293 K, the a axis in the hexagonal unit cell contracts by 0.62%, whereas the c axis expands by 1.39%, which yields net unit-cell volume NTE of 0.15%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the dilatometric NTE observed in sintered -eucryptite reaches 1.7%, which is greater than 10 times of the crystallographic NTE (Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a remarkable enhancement of thermal expansion has been ascribed to the characteristic microstructure of the sintered body, and particularly to spontaneous microcracking that originates from extremely anisotropic thermal expansion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar effects should be considered for Ca2RuO4+y because it also exhibits extremely large anisotropic thermal expansion in the lattice parameters when the giant NTE appears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 3 Parameters related to negative thermal expansion for materials with highly anisotropic structural distortion.Full size table', 'However, the NTE of the reduced ruthenates is not accompanied by pronounced hysteresis: a characteristic of microcracking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations do not confirm microcracking, but confirmed voids (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The preliminary measurements of specific gravity using Archimedes method suggest that the density of the present ceramic samples is 8090%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with materials such as -eucryptite and MgTi2O5 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28), for which microcracking effects have been considered, the onset temperature of the anisotropic thermal expansion is much lower (around room temperature).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, cumulated inner stresses are expected to be much smaller for the reduced ruthenates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even without generating microcracks, a porous sintered body might exhibit bulk NTE if extremely anisotropic thermal expansion of the grains produces deformation, consuming open spaces (voids) on heating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More detailed micrographic observations must be done to clarify the microstructural effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5:

the NTE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thermal-expansion properties of Ca2RuO4 show some scattering among results reported by different research groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Qi et al.20 reported no NTE of the unit-cell volume v in pure Ca2RuO4, although Braden et al.15 reported NTE of v/v=1%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discrepancy might be explained by differences in oxygen contents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effects of oxygen deficiency might become remarkable for the doped ruthenates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present Fe-doped ruthenate exhibits almost constant unit-cell volume, whereas the sample of Qi et al.21 preserved NTE of v/v=0.8%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SEM observation (Fig 5) shows that the morphology changes from #1 to #2 despite heat treatment at much lower temperatures (773823 K) than the sintering temperature (1,5731,623 K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, thermal expansion of a sintered body consisting of grains with highly anisotropic thermal expansion and voids might depend on the elastic properties of the grains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NTE behaviour of the ruthenates is sensitive to the oxygen contents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oxygen deficiency might affect the bulk thermal expansion via the alternation of elastic properties and morphology as well as intrinsic crystallographic parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further structural analyses are expected to be useful to elucidate the roles of oxygen deficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This study provides a strategy for realizing giant NTE, elaboration of sintered-body structure by combining grains having extremely anisotropic thermal expansion and moderate amount of voids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control of thermal expansion using specific characteristics of materials, particularly in a negative  region, is highly limited in an operating temperature and/or a magnitude of  because of the severe constraint of available materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome these difficulties, designated structures consisting of two materials having different (positive) thermal expansions and voids are proposed as an artificial material showing NTE29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present result is expected to stimulate those activities as a natural counterpart of the artificial structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The capability of thermal-expansion compensation is related directly to dilatometric NTE measured in a finite size of materials, not necessarily to unit-cell volume thermal expansion, as might be apparent in the case of -eucryptite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A high-performance thermal-expansion compensator will be realized by optimizing the microstructure of a material, such as amount of voids, micrograin orientation, and binding state of grains, as well as intrinsic characteristics of materials such as anisotropic thermal expansion and
