Transform-limited single photons from a single quantum dot  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Developing a quantum photonics network requires a source of very-high-fidelity single photons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An outstanding challenge is to produce a transform-limited single-photon emitter to guarantee that single photons emitted far apart in the time domain are truly indistinguishable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is particularly difficult in the solid-state as the complex environment is the source of noise over a wide bandwidth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A quantum dot is a robust, fast, bright and narrow-linewidth emitter of single photons; layer-by-layer growth and subsequent nano-fabrication allow the electronic and photonic states to be engineered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This represents a set of features not shared by any other emitter but transform-limited linewidths have been elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report transform-limited linewidths measured on second timescales, primarily on the neutral exciton but also on the charged exciton close to saturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The key feature is control of the nuclear spins, which dominate the exciton dephasing via the Overhauser field.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A key goal in quantum communication is to create highly indistinguishable photons that are separated in space by more than 100 km for device-independent quantum key distribution and for a quantum repeater1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is potentially possible using a solid-state source, a semiconductor quantum dot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single quantum dot mimics a two-level atom and single photons are generated either by spontaneous emission from the upper level2,3,4 or by coherent scattering of a resonant laser5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The radiative lifetime is typically r=800 ps (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is evidence that on this timescale and at low temperature, there is negligible pure upper level decoherence5,6,7,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photons emitted subsequently are close to indistinguishable3,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (At higher temperatures9,11,12,13, equivalently at low temperature but at high Rabi couplings14,15, phonons dephase the upper level.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A key remaining issue concerns the wandering of the centre frequency over times much longer than r (refs 16, 17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This wandering is highly problematic in any quantum photonics network: the quantum dot detunes from the common optical frequency and becomes dark; equivalently, the indistinguishability of quantum dot single photons generated far apart in the time domain is reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Active single-quantum-dot stabilization is possible but is presently limited to correcting for very slow drifts and in any case comes at the expense of complexity18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eliminating the spectral wanderings would be highly advantageous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The spectral wanderings can be conveniently probed simply by measuring the optical linewidth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measured on millisecond or even second timescales, the quantum dot optical linewidth  is larger than the transform limit 0=/r (refs 16, 17, 20, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact single-quantum-dot linewidths have remained stubbornly 50100% above the transform limit even under the most favourable conditions (high-quality material, low temperature, charge control via Coulomb blockade and resonant excitation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report here two regimes in which we observe transform-limited quantum dot optical linewidths even when measured on second timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One regime applies to the neutral exciton, X0, the other to the charged exception, X1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The X0 transition is split into two linearly polarized transitions by the electronhole exchange, the so-called fine structure, corresponding to an admixture of the spin ±1 states (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The splitting between the two transitions increases in an applied magnetic field, quadratically initially (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnetic field is applied externally or it arises from a net polarization in the nuclear spins, which acts on the electron spin via the Overhauser field, BN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The X1 exhibits a single line at zero magnetic field (Fig 1b) splitting linearly in magnetic field, again via an external field or Overhauser field (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both excitons exhibit large and similar d.c. Stark shifts (dependence of energy on electric field F), 25 eV cm kV1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Charge noise leads to an inhomogeneous broadening of both X0 and X1 transitions via the d.c. Stark shift.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This determines the inhomogeneous broadening for quantum dots in poor-quality material or quantum dots in high-quality material but with non-resonant excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, both excitons are sensitive to spin noise, that is, fluctuations in the Overhauser field, but with different sensitivities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For X0, the sensitivity is second order as the hole shields the electron from the spin noise; for X1 the sensitivity is first order on account of the unpaired electron in the X1 ground state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, a typical Overhauser field of 20 mT (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23) (arising from incomplete cancellation of the 105 nuclear spins24,25) leads to a linewidth contribution in the case of X1 of 0.51.0 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimentally, there is strong evidence that in this cold, clean limit, spin noise and not charge noise is responsible for the X1 inhomogeneous broadening18,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the different sensitivity to spin noise the X0 and X1 linewidths are very similar16,17,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Neutral and charged excitons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Energy levels of the neutral exciton X0 at zero magnetic field B=0, showing the fine structure splitting .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Energy levels of the charged exciton X1 in an Overhauser field BN, introducing an electron Zeeman splitting Ze.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c,d) X0, X1 energy levels versus BN with =11.5 eV and electron g-factor g=0.5.Full size image', 'The approach here is to suppress the effects of charge noise by working in the ideal limit (high-quality material at low temperature, resonant excitation on a quantum dot in the Coulomb blockade regime), to compare X0 and X1 on the same quantum dot and to suppress the effects of spin noise by a search of the available parameter space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The improvement in the optical linewidth arises as a consequence of improved optical control of the nuclear spins associated with the quantum dot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that the hyperfine interaction26,27 limits also the entanglement in the biexciton cascade28,29.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Stark coefficient and  vary from quantum dot to quantum dot yet there is no correlation between the two (Supplementary Note 6 and Supplementary Fig 4), pointing also to the unimportance of charge noise in the optical linewidth.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, the noise power of the high-frequency component decreases on detuning both lasers from =0 to =/2, identifying it as spin noise (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, noise spectra measured at =0 but with a single laser tuned to one of the X0 transitions show that the low-frequency noise, the charge noise, is similar for all three biases yet the high-frequency noise, the spin noise, increases with increasing bias (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This confirms that the high-frequency noise, the spin noise, is responsible for the inhomogeneous linewidth: the integrated spin noise is vanishingly small at the sweet spot, increasing at the centre of the plateau, and increasing further at the positive-bias edge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In general, the X0  versus  curve does not follow exactly the textbook result for a two-level system (Supplementary Note 7 and Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The  dependence of NQD(f) is highly revealing (Fig 4a, Supplementary Note 8 and Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the centre of the plateau, as  increases the X0 spin noise also increases (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  increases roughly linearly with  reaching at the highest couplings extremely high values, 300 mT (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ( is determined by a Monte Carlo simulation of NQD(f) including an ensemble of fluctuating nucleithis is robust as X0 is sensitive only to the vertical component of BN (Supplementary Note 3).)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large  would appear to prohibit transform-limited linewidths on X0 at all but the very lowest optical couplings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at the sweet spot, this mechanism is clearly suppressed:  reduces to  less_than 50 mT and approaches the value for a quantum dot in the ground state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Spin noise power dependence(a) NQD(f) on X0 for a series of Rabi couplings  with Vg at the centre of the Coulomb blockade plateau at B=10.0 mT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimental data for =0.46 eV (black curve) is accompanied by the Monte Carlo fit (red dashed curve).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) NQD(f) on X1 for a series of Rabi couplings  taken at B=10.0 mT to enhance the sensitivity to spin noise (Supplementary Note 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c,d) BN,r.m.s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  versus  for X0, X1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each Rabi coupling, the error bar in c represents an uncertainty of 10% on the determination of BN,r.m.s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  from the Monte Carlo fit;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The experiments reveal a remarkable dependence of the spin noise on charge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the centre of the plateaus, resonant excitation of X0 enhances spin noise yet resonant optical excitation of X1 suppresses spin noise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concomitant with the different BN,r.m.s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  values are the associated BN-correlation times, much shorter for X0 (5 s) than for X1 (100 s)21,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the scanning frequency dependence (Fig 2c) reveals a 100-s noise correlation time for both X0 and X1: at higher enough scanning frequencies, X0 is driven too briefly for any nuclear noise enhancement to be active.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This points to the fact that the reduced correlation time and increased amplitude of the spin noise as measured on X0 is related to the constant optical driving.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fortunately, at a particular bias, the nuclear spin shake-up on driving X0 can be turned off and transform-limited linewidths can be achieved: the charge noise is too small to matter and the electronhole exchange shields the exciton from the remaining nuclear spin noise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Once the charge noise has been suppressed by using clean devices and the nuclear spin effects have been bypassed, the fidelity of the photons is limited by the phonons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The zero phonon line (ZPL) accounts for 95% of the emission12,19, a very high ratio for a solid-state emitter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 5% non-ZPL photons can be filtered out without too much trouble but at the cost of a slight increase in shot noise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phonon-related broadening of the ZPL is however very small at low temperature9,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once the device engineering described here has been combined with photonic mode engineering to boost the extraction efficiency34, there are excellent prospects for creating a fast and efficient source of indistinguishable photons using a semiconductor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The mechanisms by which the nuclear spin noise respond to resonant optical excitation are unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For X1, the data are compatible with a narrowing of the nuclear spin distribution, perhaps caused by continuous weak measurement via the narrowband laser35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correlation time is compatible with the nuclear spin dipoledipole interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For X0 it is unlikely that the standard electron spinnuclear spin contact hyperfine interaction can offer an explanation; it is also unlikely that the bare dipoledipole interaction can account for the short correlation time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility is that the hole in the X0 is important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, a hole has a complex hyperfine interaction, containing a term (I+Jz+IJz), exactly the structure required to shake-up the nuclear spins on creation of a hole (I is the nuclear spin and J the hole pseudo-spin)36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the coefficient of this term is likely to be small, it can have significant consequences should the dark X0 state be occupied for times far exceeding the radiative lifetime36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second possibility is that the hyperfine interaction renders the X0 sensitive to the nuclear spins by altering the phase effects that account for the electric field dependence of the fine structure splitting37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hope that our results will stimulate a refinement in understanding of the excitonnuclear spin interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we report transform-limited optical linewidths from a single semiconductor quantum dot even when measured on second timescales on both X0 and X1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generally speaking, controlling spin noise is key to operating a quantum dot-based spin qubit24,25,38,39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same factor turns out also to be a key feature in creating a quantum dot-based high-fidelity single-photon source.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
