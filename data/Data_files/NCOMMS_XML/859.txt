Atmospheric oxygen regulation at low Proterozoic levels by incomplete oxidative weathering of sedimentary organic carbon  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'It is unclear why atmospheric oxygen remained trapped at low levels for more than 1.5 billion years following the Paleoproterozoic Great Oxidation Event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we use models for erosion, weathering and biogeochemical cycling to show that this can be explained by the tectonic recycling of previously accumulated sedimentary organic carbon, combined with the oxygen sensitivity of oxidative weathering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate a strong negative feedback regime when atmospheric oxygen concentration is of order pO20.1 PAL (present atmospheric level), but that stability is lost at pO2 less_than 0.01 PAL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within these limits, the carbonate carbon isotope (13C) record becomes insensitive to changes in organic carbon burial rate, due to counterbalancing changes in the weathering of isotopically light organic carbon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can explain the lack of secular trend in the Precambrian 13C record, and reopens the possibility that increased biological productivity and resultant organic carbon burial drove the Great Oxidation Event.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Atmospheric oxygen (pO2) rose from  less_than 105 present atmospheric level (PAL) at the Great Oxidation Event, as constrained by the disappearance of mass-independent fractionation of sulfur isotopes1 (MIF-S) 2.452.32 Ga.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxygen levels were sufficient to oxygenate some deep ocean basins2,3 and deposit gypsum4,5 during the Lomagundi carbon isotope excursion2,3,4,5,6,7 2.222.06 Ga.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, paleosol oxidation state8 at 1.85 Ga and 1.1 Ga indicates pO2 greater than 0.01 PAL, the absence of detrital pyrite and uraninite after 2.1 Ga suggests9 pO2 greater than 0.05 PAL, and redox proxies of widespread deep ocean anoxia suggest pO2 less_than 0.5 PAL (assuming present ocean nutrient levels) until at least the latest Neoproterozoic10 and probably the mid-Palaeozoic Era11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transient Proterozoic pO2 excursions cannot be ruled out by sparse data, and it has recently been suggested from a lack of chromium isotope fractionation in iron-rich sedimentary rocks14 that pO2 less_than 0.001 PAL during 1.80.8 Ga.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This challenges previous inferences10,15,16,17 that Proterozoic pO2 was 0.010.1 PAL, themselves based on models of paleosol oxidation8 and of benthic sulfide oxidation18 that can be questioned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is in turn challenged by subsequent work inferring pO2 greater than 0.04 PAL at 1.4 Ga from a lack of vanadium retention in marine sediments19,20,21, and work showing chromium isotope fractionation in carbonates 1.1 Ga onwards22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atmospheric oxygen eventually approached modern levels6,11 during 0.60.4 Ga, with the first compelling evidence for pO20.6 PAL from the appearance of Palaeozoic fossil charcoal23 at 0.4 Ga.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, despite uncertainty about the precise levels, it is clear that atmospheric oxygen was somehow trapped at much lower levels than today for  greater than 1.5 Gyr following the Great Oxidation Event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Identifying the mechanisms responsible for stabilizing oxygen well below present levels poses an outstanding puzzle24,25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the residence time of atmospheric oxygen (8 Myr at pO21 PAL), is short relative to geological timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, to explain the long-term stability of pO2 requires negative feedback operating on the oxygen source(s) and/or sink(s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Phanerozoic, the major oxygen source is organic carbon burial (derived from oxygenic photosynthesis) and the largest sink is oxidative weathering of uplifted sedimentary organic carbon (kerogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Models for Phanerozoic oxygen regulation11,28 tend to focus on strong negative feedbacks on organic carbon burial29 (that is, that the production rate of oxygen decreases as oxygen rises), and any negative feedback on oxidative weathering is estimated to be relatively weak30,31 (or non-existent28,32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because near modern pO2 (1 PAL), uplifted organic carbon is completely oxidized in slowly eroding soil environments32, meaning oxidative weathering is transport-controlled by the supply of reduced material, rather than kinetically controlled by the pO2 level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at high erosion rates, oxidative weathering is incomplete and detrital kerogen is preserved in marine sediments33,34,35, meaning that the global oxidative weathering flux is somewhat sensitive to pO2 variations even at the present day30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we argue that the balance of mechanisms that regulated atmospheric oxygen at much lower Proterozoic levels was quite different, and that incomplete oxidative weathering played a key role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we show that this mechanism makes the carbonate carbon isotope (13C) record insensitive to changes in organic carbon burial rate, thus explaining the lack of secular trend in the Precambrian 13C record.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Sedimentary reduced matter cycling', 'Our model for the regulation of atmospheric oxygen at low Proterozoic levels hinges on an explicit consideration of the accumulation and tectonic recycling of sedimentary reduced matter over Earth history (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the recycling of sedimentary rocks through erosion, sedimentation and uplift, is quantitatively greater than their conversion by metamorphism, with a ratio of bulk rock fluxes for the modern Earth36 of 3.5:1 (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Estimates of the potential sink of oxygen from oxidative weathering (based on the organic carbon, total sulfur and total iron content of sediments) are much larger than the sink from oxidizing volcanic/metamorphic reduced gases (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Schematic of

1d), much of the sedimentary organic carbon that is uplifted is oxidized32, with the remainder returning to the sediments as detrital organic carbon37 (indicated by the thin looped black arrow going from and to the sediments in Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus today, organic carbon burial (and corresponding oxygen production) is balanced mostly by oxidative weathering of sedimentary organic carbon (3.75 × 1012mol yr1) with a smaller contribution (1.25 × 1012mol yr1) from oxidation of reduced metamorphic and volcanic gases11,38 (and an uncertain but potentially comparable contribution from oxidation of thermogenic methane; Table 1, addressed below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxidation of sulfides and ferrous iron in sediments and the upper crust are smaller sinks at present, because less than half of the sedimentary iron and sulfur are in reduced form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Prior to the Great Oxidation Event under pO2 less_than 105 PAL (Fig 1b), the oxidation of reduced sedimentary organic carbon would have been negligible, with oxygen stabilized instead by the oxygen sensitivity of reactions with reduced gases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, reduced sediments would have been recycled repeatedly until they were deeply buried and metamorphosed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The size of the sedimentary organic carbon reservoir would then have been determined by the balance between input from the burial of newly generated organic carbon, and output via metamorphism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the relatively low rate of metamorphic conversion, even a modest rate of new organic carbon burial would have allowed a large sedimentary organic carbon reservoir to accumulate during the Archaean6,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'After the Great Oxidation Event (Fig 1c), the rise of atmospheric oxygen would have enabled the oxidative weathering of uplifted sediments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assume by this time the majority of organic carbon was produced by oxygenic photosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Great Oxidation Event itself was triggered by a secular evolution from net reduced to net oxidized atmospheric inputs27,40,41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the oxygen source required to trigger it need only have been slightly greater than the supply of reduced gases to the atmosphere and only a fraction of the tectonic supply of reductant in uplifted sediment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regime, redox balance requires that oxidative weathering of uplifted sediment is incomplete (limited by global oxygen supply), and the atmospheric oxygen level is determined by the land-surface integrated oxygen-sensitive kinetics of oxidative weathering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Oxidative weathering', 'Atmospheric oxygen in the aftermath of the Great Oxidation Event should therefore have been stabilized by the oxygen sensitivity of oxidative weathering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting oxygen level and negative feedback strength would have depended on the kinetics of oxidative weathering at low pO2, which are determined by oxygen transport and reaction in soils and regolith, integrated over the continental surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify this, we used an existing reaction-transport model32,43 for oxidative weathering of organic carbon and pyrite and ran it repeatedly to span the wide range of erosion rates observed across the continental surface today44 (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then we obtained a global oxidative weathering flux by weighting these results by the observed fractional areal contributions of different erosion rates across the continental surface44.

erosion rates today; 50 cm kyr1 (dominated by large islands of the Western Pacific) and 25 cm kyr1 (dominated by the Himalayas) (Fig 2a, see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with observations of detrital organic carbon from these regions reaching marine sediments34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It confirms that there is a negative feedback dependence of oxygen removal on pO2 near 1 PAL,

Proterozoic atmospheric oxygen regulation).Full size image', 'As pO2 declines, the oxidative weathering flux declines and becomes more sensitive to pO2 variations, because oxidative weathering becomes kinetically-limited in a wider range of regions with progressively lower erosion rates (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially, this amounts to a strengthening of the negative feedback on pO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At pO20.1 PAL, there is still a significant oxidative weathering flux which is a strong function of oxygen concentration (Fig 2a,b), giving the potential to provide strong negative feedback on pO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as pO2 declines further, below pO2 0.03 PAL, although oxidative weathering remains sensitive to pO2 the potential negative feedback becomes weaker as this sink becomes relatively small (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall a dependency of oxidative weathering on pO20.5 (Fig 2a, dashed line), consistent with coal oxidation kinetics45 and as assumed in some previous biogeochemical models11,25, provides a reasonable fit to the results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We performed a sensitivity analysis increasing shale oxygen diffusivity (controlled by porosity) and removing the contributions of high-uplift regions to global sediment discharge rates (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can weaken the sensitivity of the global oxidative weathering flux to oxygen variation near pO2=1 PAL and shifts the region of strong negative feedback to somewhat lower pO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Oxygen regulation', 'The relative strength of the oxidative weathering feedback is determined by its size relative to other sinks (Table 1), especially atmospheric sinks, which would have been insensitive to pO2 at levels after the Great Oxidation Event40,42 (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Including the additional sink from metamorphic/volcanic reduced gases demonstrates the dependence of pO2 on organic carbon burial rate (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we first consider parameterizations for the modern Earth and a minimum estimate for atmospheric reductant inputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming negligible burial of terrestrial organic matter in the Proterozoic, which comprises 50% of total burial today11,13,46, and assuming modern ocean nutrient levels, marine organic carbon burial could have been comparable to the modern level of 2.5 × 1012 mol C yr1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining this with minimum estimates for volcanic and metamorphic inputs, the model predicts pO2 0.1 PAL (Fig 3a) with oxygen stabilized by the negative feedback from oxidative weathering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Varying the distribution of continental erosion rates between plausible limits then causes pO2 to vary by a factor of 2, with low global erosion and/or increased shale porosity, and therefore more complete oxidation, producing lower pO2 (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Varying organic carbon burial can cause larger variations in pO2 within the same stable state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if organic carbon burial drops below 25% of present (1.25 × 1012mol C yr1), corresponding to pO2 less_than 0.01 PAL, this state loses stability and a Great Deoxygenation is predicted, because the oxygen source to the atmosphere is insufficient to counterbalance the volcanic input of reduced matter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, an increase in organic carbon burial from lower values to  greater than 25% of present is sufficient to trigger the Great Oxidation Event in the model, as the net biological source of oxygen exceeds the volcanic input of reduced matter.

the long-term average carbon burial rate (black line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other lines show the response with a constant metamorphic methane flux, fixed at 38% of initial burial rates of 8.1 ×

perturbations because we presume that on long timescales the metamorphic flux of methane must be proportional to the organic carbon flux previously deposited.Full size image', 'This means that to increase atmospheric oxygen toward modern levels (1 PAL) requires a factor of 4 larger increase in organic carbon burial flux than needed for the Great Oxidation Event (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This second transition is not as abrupt, but still represents a fundamental change in oxygen regulation regime, in which reductant burial exceeds the reductant supply via sediment recycling and the predominant negative feedback control shifts from the oxygen sink to the oxygen source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A major uncertainty in atmospheric reductant input is the contribution of thermogenic methane from organic carbon metamorphism (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If this is assumed to be controlled by overall sedimentary organic carbon content independent of organic carbon burial rate, then this provides a large additional oxygen-independent sink (Fig 3b, blue line), reducing the relative strength of the oxidative-weathering feedback.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, thermogenic methane is more plausibly linked to a low temperature metamorphic pathway primarily associated with relatively recently buried organic carbon (age 100 Myr, but longer than the oxygen residence time of 10 Myr).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case it scales with the organic carbon burial rate and hence has a greatly reduced influence in the Precambrian (Fig 3b, black line), although it still reduces the stability domain of Proterozoic pO2 with respect to short-timescale perturbations (green line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Secular changes in tectonic (and solar) forcing will modify this picture40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an illustrative case, an episodic continental growth model47 assumes 80% of present continental area at 2.5 Ga, and predicts global heat flux Q1.5 of present, and ocean crust formation rate and high-temperature hydrothermal heat loss scaling with Q22.25 of present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metamorphic fluxes plausibly scale proportional to global heat flux (Q) and continental area, hence would be 1.2 of present (increasing both chemical weathering of phosphorus hence oxygen source, and reductant input hence oxygen sink).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mantle inputs scale as Q2 increasing both CO2 input and the seafloor hydrothermal oxygen sink (primarily serpentinisation in the low-sulfate Precambrian48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall sign of the combined effect on oxygen level will therefore be model-dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Effects on the carbon isotope record', 'Our proposed mechanism for Proterozoic oxygen regulation changes the interpretation of the Precambrian carbonate carbon

oxidative-weathering-limited regime, persistent changes in organic carbon burial result in large counterbalancing changes in oxidative weathering of organic carbon (via changes in pO2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detail of the transient adjustment process and return to steady-state for an arbitrary decrease (and later increase) in organic carbon burial is illustrated in Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially there is a drop in 13Ccarb as oxidative weathering exceeds organic carbon burial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, after 10 Myr, atmospheric oxygen and oxidative weathering decrease to a new steady state,

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'As our focus is on oxygen regulation after the Great Oxidation Event (rather than long-term controls on organic carbon accumulation) we have assumed that the Proterozoic rock cycle was in overall redox balance51 (as in Phanerozoic carbon cycle models including GEOCARB38 and COPSE11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have also assumed that atmosphere-ocean reduced input flux is dominated by that from metamorphic sedimentary volatiles, as for the modern Earth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher inputs of reductant relative to todayeither due to higher mantle fluxes52, ongoing crustal oxidation during metamorphism hence more reduced metamorphic fluxes40 or greater submarine volcanism resulting in more reduced volatiles53would affect the stability of an oxygen-sink-controlled feedback regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we suggest these increased reductant inputs had largely declined by the Great Oxidation Event or at latest the end of the Lomagundi excursion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, assuming crust oxidation (resulting in a present Fe3+ excess54 of 2 × 1021 mol O2 eq) is linked to continental growth, an episodic continental growth model55 with rapid growth from 10 to 80% of present area 3.22.5 Ga would imply a net oxidation rate of 2 × 1012 mol O2 eq yr1 (balanced by a combination of hydrogen escape and organic carbon accumulation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would drop after 2.5 Ga to a net oxidation rate of 1.6 × 1011 mol O2 eq yr1, which is small relative to sediment and metamorphic redox transformations (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the iron oxidation state of shales only changes after the Great Oxidation Event, suggesting significant ongoing oxidization of crustal iron6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have assumed that any increase in oxygen source triggering the Great Oxidation Event was modest, but if the oxygen source increased a lot, for example, in the Lomagundi event, then the oxidative weathering sink might have been temporarily overwhelmed leading to high oxygen levels2,3,4,5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Either way by 1.85 Ga oxygen levels were low again.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our proposed Proterozoic oxygen regulation mechanism requires that marine organic carbon burial remained at least 25% of todays total organic carbon burial flux after the Great Oxidation Event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Marine-derived organic carbon is estimated to comprise half11,13 to two-thirds56 of todays total organic carbon burial flux (the remainder being derived from land plants).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, marine organic carbon burial must have remained at least 4050% of its present value since the Great Oxidation Event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This in turn requires at least 4050% of modern ocean nutrient concentrations, or if they were lower, a more efficient biological carbon pump and/or more efficient sedimentary preservation of organic carbon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several studies have suggested that nutrient levels were low25 or the biological pump was less efficient57 in the Proterozoic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if total organic carbon burial was  less_than 25% of present, corresponding to pO2 0.01 PAL, our model predicts a reversal of the Great Oxidation Event, because although the oxidative weathering of ancient organic carbon would have become negligible, the oxygen source to the atmosphere would have been insufficient to counterbalance the volcanic/metamorphic input of reduced matter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atmospheric oxygen then drops until the oxidation of these gases becomes kinetically-limited (that is, oxygen concentration limited) at pO2 less_than 105 PAL (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the lack of MIF-S1 after 2.32 Ga constrains pO2 greater than 105 PAL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, if recent inferences14 of Proterozoic pO2 less_than 0.001 PAL are correct, they require an as yet unidentified oxygen regulating mechanism, which operates somewhere in the range 105 less_than pO2 less_than 102 PAL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The sulfur cycle could not have provided an equivalent negative feedback on pO2 at lower levels, even though oxidation and subsequent reduction of sulfur were more important fluxes in the Proterozoic surface redox budget than they are today15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because the Precambrian sulfur cycle was dominated by a reduced sedimentary reservoir (pyrite), which after surface oxidation in weathering was soon reduced again and buried, whereas the carbon cycle consists of a primarily oxidized reservoir that is available for biotic burial of the reduced form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This burial of reduced carbon is nutrient (rather than carbon) limited whereas the burial of reduced sulfur only requires a redox gradient generated by the much larger carbon export production flux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The oxidative weathering model predicts that beneath the upper soil layers, the weathering environment was essentially anoxic and reducing for Proterozoic oxygen levels pO2 less_than 0.1 PAL (for example, Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has important implications for interpreting redox-sensitive proxies, namely that they are controlled by fluvial transport times and corresponding oxygen exposure9, not by time spent in the weathering environment (as has erroneously been assumed in previous simpler models14,58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For pyrite this means oxidation in soils becomes kinetically-limited at pO2 less_than 0.1 PAL (Fig 2b), starting in the most rapidly eroding terrains, and implying a supply of detrital pyrite to fluvial systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Existing work9 estimates that for rivers with short transport distances, often found in the most rapidly eroding terrains (for example, on volcanic arc islands), some of this pyrite would survive oxidation at pO2 less_than 0.05 PAL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed some detrital pyrite survives oxidation today in the most rapidly eroding settings59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore recent inferences14 of pO2 less_than 0.001 PAL appear inconsistent (by orders of magnitude) with the absence of detrital pyrite in Proterozoic sediments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, the one-box model behind these very low pO2 inferences14 can be questioned because it assumes that manganese can be oxidized in the weathering environment imparting Cr-isotope fractionation above pO20.001 PAL, when instead the soil is predicted to be anoxic and reducing up to pO20.1

practice49,50,51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead there could have been large Precambrian changes in new organic carbon burial that may not show up in long-term 13Ccarb, reopening the possibility that, for

#@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be explained by redox exchanges with sedimentary sulfur and iron reservoirs, shifting electrons from sedimentary sulfide and siderite to reduced organic carbon (and back again) on the sedimentary recycling timescale6,60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such 13Ccarb excursions can also arise from changes in the inorganic carbon cycle or in 13C fractionation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The carbon isotope decoupling observed in the Neoproterozoic 13C record61 (where 13Ccarb varies but 13Corg is near constant) can, as previously proposed49,61,62, be explained by the recycling of detrital organic carbon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the spatially-variable mixing of detrital and marine sources implies that the 13Corg signature will be location-dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The mechanism we describe provides a potential explanation for the overall stepwise evolution of atmospheric oxygen on Earth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recycling of sedimentary organic carbon and its kinetically limited oxidation could have sustained low Proterozoic atmospheric oxygen levelsalbeit not as low as has recently been inferred14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rise of oxygen to present levels simply required an increase in organic carbon burial rate, which may have begun in the Neoproterozoic Era10, but in our model was not completed until the mid-Palaeozoic Era with the colonization of the land by plants and fungi, liberating nutrient phosphorus from rocks and producing high C/P material for burial11,13.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Land-surface oxidative weathering model', 'Oxidative weathering of organic carbon and pyrite was simulated using an existing 1D reaction-transport model32,43 (Table 2), integrated over the observed distribution of uplift rates estimated from river sediment budgets44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 2 Parameters for the land-surface oxidative weathering model (from Bolton et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32 default model run except where noted).Full size table', 'The 1D shale model represents the steady-state balance between downwards oxygen diffusion in a porous shale and reaction with organic carbon and (optionally) pyrite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It thus quantifies the local transition between a supply-limited regime (where a diffusive oxygen supply exceeds reduced matter supply, a reaction front forms in the shale column, and all supplied reduced matter is consumed), and a kinetic-limited regime where reduced material is incompletely oxidized with the remainder eroded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model has been calibrated against laboratory measurements constraining local kerogen45 and pyrite32,63 oxidation kinetics, and a field study constraining oxygen transport through porous shale43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shale model was run repeatedly to span the present-day global distribution of erosion rates across the continental surface44 and the results weighted by the observed fractional areal contributions of these different erosion rates to obtain a global oxidative weathering flux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The estimated total oxidative weathering flux was then scaled to the present day value at pO2=1 PAL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Model parameters (summarized in Table 2) are taken from the default parameter set of Bolton et al.32 (their Table 1 and Figs 35), which generate a reaction front at depth 10 m for oxidative weathering of organic carbon at global-mean values for TOC (1 wt%) and erosion rate (5 cm kyr1) (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For given shale properties (organic matter content, porosity, temperature) the reaction front depth is proportional to atmospheric oxygen level and inversely proportional to supply rate (=erosion rate).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the reaction front reaches the surface, organic matter oxidation is incomplete and detrital organic matter is eroded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The dependency of the land-surface integrated oxidation rate on pO2 is therefore sensitive to oxygen transport, controlled by shale porosity (n*), and reduced matter supply, controlled by organic carbon and pyrite content and the distribution of uplift rates (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As demonstrated by Bolton et al.32, at pO21 PAL organic carbon is completely oxidized for uplift rates  less_than 10 cm kyr1 and even conservative (low porosity;
