Multifocal clonal evolution characterized using circulating tumour DNA in a case of metastatic breast cancer  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Circulating tumour DNA analysis can be used to track tumour burden and analyse cancer genomes non-invasively but the extent to which it represents metastatic heterogeneity is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we follow a patient with metastatic ER-positive and HER2-positive breast cancer receiving two lines of targeted therapy over 3 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We characterize genomic architecture and infer clonal evolution in eight tumour biopsies and nine plasma samples collected over 1,193 days of clinical follow-up using exome and targeted amplicon sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutation levels in the plasma samples reflect the clonal hierarchy inferred from sequencing of tumour biopsies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Serial changes in circulating levels of sub-clonal private mutations correlate with different treatment responses between metastatic sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This comparison of biopsy and plasma samples in a single patient with metastatic breast cancer shows that circulating tumour DNA can allow real-time sampling of multifocal clonal evolution.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Intra-tumour clonal heterogeneity limits efficacy and duration of response to targeted treatments in metastatic cancer1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evaluating heterogeneity to guide choice and sequence of therapy could be achieved by multiregional and repeated metastatic tumour biopsies but this is impractical due to associated risk of complications and costs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, analysis of circulating tumour DNA in plasma (ctDNA) is a less-invasive approach that could provide a summary of somatic alterations contributed by distinct metastases4,5, potentially circumventing the problem of spatial heterogeneity1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Serial analysis of ctDNA has been shown to track tumour burden6,7,8 and to correlate with treatment-driven clonal evolution3,4,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most studies of concordance between tumour and plasma samples have compared individual mutations or relied on single tumour biopsies9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, direct evidence comparing plasma with multiregional tumour samples to establish the extent of clonal heterogeneity captured in ctDNA is extremely limited5,10,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we present extensive analysis of eight tumour biopsies and nine plasma samples collected from a patient with oestrogen receptor-positive (ER+) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) metastatic breast cancer treated with sequential targeted therapies (tamoxifen and trastuzumab, followed by lapatinib) over a 3-year clinical course.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed whole-exome followed by deep amplicon sequencing to validate and quantify several hundred somatic mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that ubiquitous stem mutations (common to all tumour biopsies) have the highest circulating levels in plasma followed by metastatic-clade and private mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, serial changes during treatment in circulating levels of private somatic mutations correlate with disease progression in their respective tumour lesions on imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results, from a single patient with metastatic breast cancer, suggest that ctDNA reflects clonal tumour hierarchy and captures sub-clonal dynamics in real time.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Clinical case', 'A 42-year-old woman presented with a right breast lump, lower back pain, loss of height, marked kyphosis and hepatomegaly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Core biopsies from the breast lump showed ductal carcinoma in situ (sample labelled P1.1; Supplementary Fig 1 and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional biopsy from an ipsilateral axillary lymph node (P1.2) revealed metastatic ductal adenocarcinoma (ER+ (8/8) and HER2+ (3+)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Computed tomography scan revealed widespread metastatic disease in bones, pleura and liver (Supplementary Fig 2 and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The patient was started on treatment with trastuzumab and taxane-based chemotherapy, with a significant partial response (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After induction chemotherapy, she was maintained on tamoxifen and trastuzumab.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 19 months on treatment, she presented with seizures and head computed tomography revealed a large metastasis in the left frontal lobe (Supplementary Fig 4), which was resected (M2.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therapy with tamoxifen and trastuzumab was continued and collection of plasma samples was initiated (samples T1T9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four months after surgery, she had enlarging liver lesions and a new metastatic deposit in the left ovary (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment was switched to a combination of lapatinib and capecitabine, resulting in stable disease for 12 months (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  General deterioration then occurred, with disease progression in the chest (new pulmonary nodules, bilateral pleural effusions and posterior chest wall mass, Supplementary Fig 7; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

deep sequencing in all samples for orthogonal validation and accurate measurement of allele fractions (AFs, Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 362 candidate non-synonymous SNVs identified

transplanted tumour xenografts14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also inferred tumour phylogeny using clonal ordering of high-confidence mutations (with 2% allele fraction in a tumour sample).

126 private mutations were detected at AF 2% only in one of the tumour samples (tumour clusters 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most parsimonious pathway of evolution in this cancer together with mutation clustering results is presented in Fig 1d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stem and metastatic-clade mutation clusters inferred using PyClone were identical to the results from clonal ordering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

at low levels in the lymph node biopsy samples (P1.2), consistent with a common ancestor for metastasis as a minor clone at the axillary lymph node site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inferred phylogenetic structure was stable using 5 and 10% allele fraction cutoffs for high-confidence mutations (Supplementary Figs 8 and 9) and allele fractions for stem mutations were highly correlated between all

response across distinct metastatic sites during targeted treatment, the relative plasma abundance of high-confidence private mutations originating from each tumour site was calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During lapatinib treatment, a rapid increase in the circulating abundance of several mutations private to the chest mass was observed in plasma samples T4T9 (Fig 2c), coinciding with significant disease progression seen on imaging at this site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was also reflected in plasma-based PyClone mutation clusters; plasma cluster 5 increased in circulating prevalence with disease progression on lapatinib treatment and 10/11 mutations in this cluster are private to M3.1 (and correspond to tumour clusters 4 and 5; Fig 2b and Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the time of lapatinib resistance, the most abundant private mutation in plasma was in the tyrosine kinase domain of ERBB4 (p.H809G; plasma cluster 5; Fig 2b,d and Supplementary Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mutation was private to the chest wall mass (28.2% AF) with its levels in plasma DNA increasing during lapatinib treatment up to an AF of 12.2% at the time of disease progression on imaging (compared with average stem and metastatic-clade AFs of 34.9 and 19.1% in the same plasma sample).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The predicted functional effect of this mutation17,18 and its exclusive molecular detection in the chest wall mass (the main site of disease progression on treatment) suggest it was a key determinant of resistance to lapatinib.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interestingly, 11 non-synonymous high-confidence SNVs were identified and validated in plasma but not detectable at 2% AF in any of the analysed tumour biopsies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amongst these was an actionable hotspot mutation in PIK3CA (p.E542K), identified in plasma with an AF of 3.5% at the time of progression on trastuzumab and tamoxifen (tumour cluster 8 and plasma cluster 4; Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After lapatinib treatment was started, the plasma levels dropped to AF of 1.1% and then became undetectable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mutation was only marginally detectable (AF 1%) in two tumour biopsies (axillary lymph node and vertebral metastasis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest this PIK3CA mutation originated from a minor tumour sub-clone that increased in size during treatment with tamoxifen and trastuzumab, and then regressed on treatment with lapatinib.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway has been associated with resistance to both endocrine therapy and trastuzumab19,20.'

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this paper, we have presented an extensive comparison of biopsy and plasma samples collected from a metastatic breast cancer patient over a 3-year clinical course.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that circulating tumour DNA provides a dynamic sampling of somatic alterations reflecting the size and activity of distinct tumour sub-clones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of ctDNA reflects the clonal hierarchy determined from multiregional tumour sequencing and tracks different treatment responses across metastases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike previous reports, our results qualify tumour-plasma concordance of each somatic mutation in context of the tumour phylogeny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Truncal mutations that represent the majority of tumour lesions in a patient have higher circulating levels and therefore, are more likely to be detected in plasma, than clade or private mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These results were obtained from deep analysis of a single patient and need to be confirmed in a larger cohort of patients with multiregional biopsies and serial plasma samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If confirmed, our observations have important implications for future ctDNA studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For monitoring tumour burden using ctDNA, our results suggest that truncal mutations are the best candidates, as they are highest in circulating levels and least likely to drop out during follow-up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For molecular treatment stratification, our results suggest that if multiple actionable somatic mutations, or alterations that are known to confer resistance to specific therapies, are identified in tumour analysis, their relative circulating levels in pretreatment plasma samples may inform the choice of targeted treatments for individual patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The potential of using plasma DNA for molecular stratification and tracking of resistant clones in patients treated with targeted therapies heralds a new era for precision cancer medicine.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
