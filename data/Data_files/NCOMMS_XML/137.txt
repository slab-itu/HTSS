A redox signalling globin is essential for reproduction in Caenorhabditis elegans  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Moderate levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are now recognized as redox signalling molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, thus far, only mitochondria and NADPH oxidases have been identified as cellular sources of ROS in signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we identify a globin (GLB-12) that produces superoxide, a type of ROS, which serves as an essential signal for reproduction in C. elegans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that GLB-12 has an important role in the regulation of multiple aspects in germline development, including germ cell apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further describe how GLB-12 displays specific molecular, biochemical and structural properties that allow this globin to act as a superoxide generator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, both an intra- and extracellular superoxide dismutase act as key partners of GLB-12 to create a transmembrane redox signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that a globin can function as a driving factor in redox signalling, and how this signal is regulated at the subcellular level by multiple control layers.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-based redox signalling is involved at all levels of cellular organization, from cell differentiation to cell death1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this type of signalling, low levels of ROS act as biological messengers by inducing reversible oxidative modifications in downstream proteins and thereby influencing signalling pathways3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These ROS are enzymatically generated by cells to serve this signalling function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the majority of the reported redox-sensitive signalling pathways, it is often not known which proteins are responsible for generating the redox signal and how cells spatially and temporally link ROS production to specific signalling pathways and so achieve desired cellular outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Globins are increasingly hypothesized to play a role in redox biology5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These proteins are characterized by a common tertiary structure and the presence of a haem group, whereby their function is largely determined by how this haem group is incorporated in the surrounding globin fold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The best-characterized function of globins is in oxygen diffusion and transport, as exemplified by vertebrate haemoglobin and myoglobin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The haem iron in these globins is pentacoordinated, leaving the sixth coordination site of the iron free for reversible binding of diatomic ligands, such as O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a second type of globins, named hexacoordinated globins, all six positions of the haem iron are bound6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since their initial discovery two decades ago, these hexacoordinated globins are now recognized to be broadly present in plants and animals7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the hexacoordinated nature of the haem iron, ligand binding/transfer becomes more complex8 or even absent9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, this hexacoordinated state of the iron seems to favour electron transfer9,10,11, indicating that redox reactions involving the haem iron could be a key element in the physiological function of these globins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, increasing attention has been placed on the potential roles of hexacoordinated globins and globin-like proteins in signalling and redox chemistry, such as protection against ROS and electron transfer to molecular partners7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, even though a fairly detailed understanding on the structure and biochemistry of hexacoordinated globins is now present, it has thus far been extremely difficult to understand what their possible physiological roles are.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  elegans has thirty-three globin-like proteins, which display different sizes, are differently located and are likely to be functionally diverse12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This makes C. elegans an attractive model to study the potential roles of globins and globin-like proteins in redox metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A genome-wide RNAi screen in C. elegans reported abnormal egg laying and embryonic lethality following RNAi for GLB-12 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13), providing a clear phenotype for this so far uncharacterized globin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we analyse the role of GLB-12 in more detail and show that this protein is hexacoordinated, functions as a redox signalling protein and has an essential role in the reproduction of C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  elegans.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'GLB-12 is essential for reproduction', 'To characterize the role of GLB-12 in reproduction, we analysed the effect of reduced GLB-12 levels on the brood size of C. elegans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that glb-12 RNAi reduced fecundity and increased embryonic lethality in wild-type (WT) worms and caused sterility in the majority of worms in the RNAi-hypersensitive strain rrf-3 (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression analysis showed that GLB-12 is present in distinct parts of the somatic reproductive system (Fig 1b,c; Supplementary Fig 1a)the distal gonadal sheath, the proximal part of the spermatheca, and the uterusand in several head and tail neurons and the vulva.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GLB-12 does not appear to be directly present in the germline: integration of the GLB-12::GFP reporter, which is necessary to allow expression in the germline, showed no visible expression in this tissue (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, GLB-12 appears to act directly from the somatic gonad to regulate reproduction: glb-12 RNAi only had an effect on reproduction in a soma-specific, but not in germline- or neuronal-specific RNAi strains (Supplementary Fig 1b), while glb-12 RNAi in the GLB-12 reporter strain reduced reporter levels in the somatic gonad only (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: GLB-12 is essential for reproduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) glb-12 RNAi in the WT (n=16 biological replicates) and RNAi-hypersensitive strain rrf-3 (n=3) caused a decreased fecundity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  **P less_than 0.01 (two-sided Student t-test);

Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hexacoordinated globins are present in prokaryotes, plants and animals, but their function is largely unclear7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They can potentially bind diatomic ligands such as O2, CN and CO to their haem iron, thereby replacing the endogenous HisE7 ligand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, even though GLB-12 was able to bind CN and CO in vitro (Fig 2a), both reactions proceeded very slowly, requiring several minutes (reaction kinetics not shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, upon exposure to air, GLB-12 is spontaneously oxidized to the ferric state (Fe3+) (Fig 2a) and is thus incapable of binding O2 under physiological conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results argue against a role for GLB-12 in reversible ligand binding and/or transport, the best known function for globins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the spontaneous oxidation of air-exposed GLB-12 is in line with the observation that hexacoordination appears to lower the redox potential and promotes electron transfer of the haem iron9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using cyclic voltammetry to study the electrochemical properties of GLB-12 in more detail, we indeed observed a relatively low reduction potential for the GLB-12 redox couple Fe2+/Fe3+ (0.244 V versus saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE)), which is largely stable within the physiological pH range (Fig 2b; Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether GLB-12 could transfer electrons to other molecules, we included cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP) in this experimental setup as an electron acceptor and subsequent catalyst for H2O2 reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that CCP by itself shows no electrocatalytic activity under these conditions14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When H2O2 was added to GLB-12 and CCP, the reduction current increased and the oxidation peak disappeared, indicating very fast GLB-12 oxidation (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shows that GLB-12 can donate electrons to CCP in a continuous manner, allowing the latter to reduce H2O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared to other tested globins, GLB-12 showed a 10-fold higher electron transfer rate to CCP (Supplementary Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined, these results support a role for GLB-12 in electron transfer reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: GLB-12 is a hexacoordinated globin with redox properties and is capable of producing O2..(a) UVvis spectra of different GLB-12 forms, with their absorption maxima.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absorption spectrum of purified GLB-12 showed that it is spontaneously oxidized to the ferric state (Fe3+) upon exposure to air.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reducing GLB-12 (Fe2+) resulted in an absorption spectrum that is typical for a hexacoordinated haem iron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Absorption spectra of CN- and CO-bound GLB-12 could be obtained after exposure of GLB-12 to an excess of KCN or CO.

To test this hypothesis, we used an in vitro enzymatic reduction system for haem proteins16 and included lucigenin, which emits light upon reaction with O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Supplementary Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of GLB-12 and glucose-6-phosphate, the driving force of this system, led to increased luminescence, showing that GLB-12 can convert O2 to O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 2d; Supplementary Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  levels are proportional to GLB-12 concentration, indicative of a 1:1 stoichiometry (Supplementary Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also validated this in vitro method using haem proteins with a reduction potential higher and lower than the O2/O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  couple (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noteworthy, O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  production rate of cytochrome P450 was 40-fold higher than that of GLB-12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We subsequently hypothesized that in vivo O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  produced by GLB-12 could act as a redox signalling molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decreasing GLB-12 levels by RNAi would thus decrease this O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  signal, and exposing worms to O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  scavengers could potentially even further reduce the O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or ascorbic acid, scavengers of O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and other ROS, indeed further aggravated the reduction in brood size by glb-12 RNAi (Fig 2f), providing a first indication that GLB-12 generates O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  as a signalling molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The crystal structure of the GLB-12 globin domain, refined to 1.65 Å resolution (Table 1), further supported our current findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It confirmed haem hexacoordination, with strong Fe-N bonds with the distal His92 and the proximal His127 residues (Fig 3a; Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the hexacoordinated GLB-12 globin domain is closely related to the 3D structures of human and murine neuroglobin10,17,18,19, human cytoglobin20, non-symbiotic rice haemoglobin21, C. elegans GLB-6 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9) and Geobacter sulfurreducens globin-coupled sensor22, although GLB-12 possesses several unique structural features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proximal His127 is highly exposed to the solvent, which is the result of a hydrogen bond between the A-propionate of the haem to Ser126 OH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, two water molecules are hosted at the entrance of the proximal site (hydrogen bonded to Ser126 OG and to Gln130 NE2, respectively), and four additional water molecules and one acetate ion fall next to the propionate (Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This exposure to a polar aqueous environment would favour oxidation of the ferrous haem, which is consistent with the low GLB-12 redox potential reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the distal site of the haem cavity, the D-propionate stabilizes the location of the E-helix N-terminal region through hydrogen bonding (Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, residues Phe89 and Phe96 (surrounding the distal His92) are part of a wide cluster of aromatic/hydrophobic residues (Val54, Phe58, Leu59, Val62, Phe73, Phe152) (not highlighted).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These could restrict E-helix movements required to achieve a pentacoordinated haem and would thereby limit ligand binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This explains the slow CN and CO binding we observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, this aromatic/hydrophobic residue cluster creates a tunnel of about 50 Å3 in the globin domain, nestled among the B-, E-, and G-helices (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, this otherwise apolar tunnel shows a strong negative charge distribution at the solvent exit (resulting from residues Asp48, Asp49, Asp52 and Glu165) (Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the crystal structure the tunnel exit to the solvent appears rather narrow; however, structural fluctuations may vary its diameter, providing a direct connection between the haem distal site and the solvent region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given this, it is possible that the negative charges located at the tunnel exit would help to remove small and negatively charged species such as O2., produced by redox reactions at the distal site, from the protein core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, while the haem pocket in globins usually prevents haem iron oxidation by creating a hydrophobic environment, in GLB-12 three polar amino acids (Lys88, Arg95 and Arg129) are located at the edge of the haem cavity (Fig 3c), possibly to enhance solvent access to the haem and stimulate haem iron oxidation and O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutation of these three polar amino acids to the hydrophobic leucine indeed reduced or prevented O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  production (Fig 3d), while other biochemical characteristics remained largely unaffected (Supplementary Fig 3bd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, transgene animals bearing these mutations in an RNAi-resistant glb-12 gene (Supplementary Fig 3e,f) failed to show rescue of the reduced brood size following glb-12 RNAi (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also the K88L mutant, even though it can still produce some O2., failed to rescue the reduction in brood size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these results show that GLB-12 possesses specific structural properties associated with a role in redox biology and further support that GLB-12 produces O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  as a signalling molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 GLB-12 crystal structuredata collection and refinement statistics.Full size table', 'Figure 3: GLB-12 produces O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  as a signalling molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Ribbon representation of the GLB-12 globin domain, with helices labelled according to the canonical globin fold (green).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GLB-12-specific pre-A helix and F-helix are highlighted in red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The terminal residues visible in the electron density (19215) are labelled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein electrostatic surface (see also panel (b)) is displayed in semitransparent colours, allowing the view of underlying secondary structure elements and a distal apolar tunnel (magenta mesh) located between the B-, E- and G-helices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acidic residues, localized where this apolar tunnel reaches the protein surface, are shown in stick representation (yellow) and labelled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Electrostatic surface of the GLB-12 globin domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The blue and red colours highlight positively and negatively charged surfaces, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The haem moiety, with the propionate groups fully exposed to the solvent region, is shown as stick representation (yellow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Detail of the GLB-12 haem cavity, showing the presence of two histidines and three additional polar amino acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) The GLB-12 K88L mutant is less capable of O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  production, while R95L and R129L mutants are incapable of O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) These three mutants, when expressed as RNAi-resistant (RR) genes, are not capable of rescuing the glb-12 RNAi reduction in fecundity (n=5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Percentages show control RNAi compared with glb-12 RNAi within a strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  *P less_than 0.05;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this study, we identified a novel role within the globin superfamily by showing that GLB-12 of C. elegans functions as a redox signalling protein in the reproductive system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our findings, we propose a model whereby GLB-12 acts as a superoxide generator in the somatic gonad, after which this O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  signal is modulated directly or indirectly by an intracellular and an extracellular SOD, creating a transmembrane H2O2 gradient that acts as a redox signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This signal then modulates reproduction, including p38/JNK MAPK-dependent germ cell apoptosis (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 8: GLB-12 working model.GLB-12 is expressed in the somatic gonad and is capable of converting O2 to O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (1) after which this signal is modulated by an intracellular SOD (2) and influenced by an extracellular SOD (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined, GLB-12, SOD-1 and SOD-4 influence germline functioning, including p38 and JNK MAPK-mediated apoptosis (45).Full size image', 'The role of GLB-12 in redox chemistry is supported by its biochemical characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that GLB-12 shows a hexacoordinated haem, extremely low ligand affinity, a relatively low redox potential and the ability to transfer electrons to other molecules in a continuous manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Haem hexacoordination in globins has previously been associated with increased redox kinetics for the haem iron9,10,11, and, as a result, hexacoordinated globins have been hypothesized to function in redox biology7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, hexacoordinated globins have been proposed to function in electron transfer33,34, to work as redox sensors to control behaviour9, to regulate lipid oxidation35 or to function as NO scavengers36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it has thus far been very difficult to link these observations to the biochemical mechanisms used by these globins in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We found that, by using structural, biochemical and mutational approaches, GLB-12 actively converts O2 to O2., which in turn is used as a redox signalling molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As this hexacoordinated globin can actively support redox signalling, it provides a reference model for the function of globins and globin-like proteins in other organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is already well appreciated that redox signals can originate from endogenous sources, such as membrane-bound NADPH oxidases or mitochondria, but the control mechanisms on ROS as endogenous signalling molecules are still poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ROS signal specificity can be achieved by strict compartmentalization: by tightly controlled spatio-temporal expression of the ROS generators in proximity to the downstream target, efficient signal transduction can be realized4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This specificity in spatial expression is indeed observed for GLB-12: (1) at the tissue level, GLB-12 is only present in a specific part of the somatic gonad, wherefrom it acts to regulate germline reproduction; (2) at the subcellular level, GLB-12 is bound to the plasma membrane by myristoylation and palmitoylation, whereby this localization increases the effectiveness of the GLB-12 signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, these types of protein acylation localize proteins to dynamic membrane subdomains that have been associated with specific redox signalling events26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that GLB-12 produces O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and that O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  is diffusible and short lived, we therefore reason that the location of GLB-12 serves as a spatial determinant for downstream signals, both on a tissue and intracellular level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, our observation that GLB-12 shows a 40-fold lower O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  production rate compared with cytochrome P450 might indicate that high ROS levels are not required when the redox signal is strictly localized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On top of localizing the enzymatic source of a redox signal with its potential downstream target, an additional layer of regulation can be achieved by alterations in the local reduction/oxidation capacity4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that GLB-12 acts together with the main cytoplasmic SOD-1, whereby the latter enhances the spontaneous oxidation of O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  into O2 and H2O2, and this interaction indeed increases the effectiveness of the H2O2 redox signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our surprise, also the extracellular SOD-4 appears to influence the GLB-12 signal and this in an opposite manner compared to SOD-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results clearly show that SODs have essential roles in the regulation of redox signalling and are not merely generic antioxidants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that H2O2, produced by GLB-12/SOD-1, influences ligand release from the somatic gonad, while H2O2 produced by SOD-4 could either influence ligand release or affect receptor activity on the germline plasma membrane (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations are in line with the increasing amount of evidence that the intra- and extracellular redox states work in concert to influence cell signalling38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the interaction between GLB-12 and these two SODs adds a surprising third level of regulation in this redox signal, whereby the amount of O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and H2O2 on the intra- and extracellular side of the plasma membrane are important determinants of the downstream signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is interesting to note that, while plasma membranes form a physical barrier to ROS, ROS transport across membranes could occur via selective membrane channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has been observed for both O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and H2O2 with certain classes of anion channels29 and aquaporins4,40,41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ROS transport across membranes has therefore been hypothesized to participate in the regulation of redox signalling and could also be involved in GLB-12-mediated signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, our results show that redox signalling by GLB-12 is regulated by multiple control layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interesting to note is that NADPH oxidase, a known ROS generator, also displays a very specific subcellular localization that is related to its function, and also appears to interact with SOD enzymes26,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These shared characteristics between GLB-12 and NADPH oxidases indicate that redox signalling proteins function according to similar principles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the presence of a transmembrane redox gradient in GLB-12-mediated signalling presents a fascinating additional principle in how redox signalling can be further modulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We linked the redox signalling function of GLB-12 with C. elegans reproduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduction of GLB-12 levels causes decreased fecundity, smaller gonads, increased germline apoptosis levels and several defects during oocyte development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further showed that GLB-12 has antiapoptotic effects by inhibiting the p38/JNK MAPK pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These highly conserved pathways have been shown to be sensitive to environmental stress, including oxidative stress, in several organisms44,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also in C. elegans, their combined role in modulating germ cell apoptosis in response to stressors such as oxidative and heavy metal toxicity has been demonstrated31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results presented here provide a link between a redox signalling protein and p38/JNK MAPK-mediated germline apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, GLB-12-based redox regulation of the p38/JNK MAPK pathways, using low local levels of superoxide, is opposite from the effects of excessive oxidative stress on this pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because GLB-12 acts specifically from the somatic gonad and not from the germline, it likely influences the release of ligands and/or the activation of receptors of the p38/JNK MAPK pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other organisms, it has indeed been observed that ROS can influence receptor activation upstream of the p38/JNK MAPK pathways44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results presented here indicate that, when p38/JNK MAPK ligands and receptors in the C. elegans reproductive system will be identified, they could form an interesting model to study how GLB-12-mediated redox signalling can influence the activity of downstream signalling cascades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, in C. elegans, about half of all germ cells die by p53-independent physiological apoptosis, and it is thought that this process increases the quality of the surviving germ cells by the relocation of cytoplasmic components46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As fecundity is further reduced by combining glb-12 RNAi with p38/JNK pathway inhibition, GLB-12 may be required to generate or allocate this cytoplasmic material via modulation of germline apoptosis levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of GLB-12, apoptosis is then increased as a compensatory measure to sustain reproduction, albeit at lower levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would explain why preventing the increase in cell death during GLB-12 depletion leads to a further decrease in brood size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we have identified a globin that acts as a source of redox signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specific biochemical characteristics of GLB-12 show how a globin can fulfil this function, while the precise subcellular localization and the interaction with the SOD antioxidant enzymes increase the effectiveness of the redox signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The opposite effect of the intra- and extracellular SOD on GLB-12 signalling is particularly intriguing; it indicates the importance of transmembrane redox gradients and further deepens the concepts of redox signalling compartmentalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The notion that highly localized ROS gradients influence important biological processes such as reproduction could open up a new area of redox biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, given the widespread occurrence of globins, the majority with unknown function, our results add an important member to the group of proteins that drive redox signalling.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
