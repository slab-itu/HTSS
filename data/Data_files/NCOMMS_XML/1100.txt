Genetic diagnosis of Mendelian disorders via RNA sequencing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Across a variety of Mendelian disorders, 5075% of patients do not receive a genetic diagnosis by exome sequencing indicating disease-causing variants in non-coding regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although genome sequencing in principle reveals all genetic variants, their sizeable number and poorer annotation make prioritization challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate the power of transcriptome sequencing to molecularly diagnose 10% (5 of 48) of mitochondriopathy patients and identify candidate genes for the remainder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find a median of one aberrantly expressed gene, five aberrant splicing events and six mono-allelically expressed rare variants in patient-derived fibroblasts and establish disease-causing roles for each kind.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Private exons often arise from cryptic splice sites providing an important clue for variant prioritization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One such event is found in the complex I assembly factor TIMMDC1 establishing a novel disease-associated gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, our study expands the diagnostic tools for detecting non-exonic variants and provides examples of intronic loss-of-function variants with pathological relevance.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Despite the revolutionizing impact of whole-exome sequencing (WES) on the molecular genetics of Mendelian disorders, 5075% of the patients do not receive a genetic diagnosis after WES1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The disease-causing variants might be detected by WES but remain as variants of unknown significance (VUS, Methods section) or they are missed due to the inability to prioritize them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of these VUS are synonymous or non-coding variants that may affect RNA abundance or isoform but cannot be prioritized due to the poor understanding of regulatory sequence to date compared to coding sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, WES covers only the 2% exonic regions of the genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, it is mostly blind to regulatory variants in non-coding regions that could affect RNA sequence and abundance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the limitation of genome coverage is overcome by whole genome sequencing (WGS), prioritization and interpretation of variants identified by WGS is in turn limited by their amount2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'With RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), limitations of the sole genetic information can be complemented by directly probing variations in RNA abundance and in RNA sequence, including allele-specific expression and splice isoforms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At least three extreme situations can be directly interpreted to prioritize candidate disease-causing genes for a rare disorder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the expression level of a gene can lie outside its physiological range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes with expression outside their physical range can be identified as expression outliers, often using a stringent cutoff on expression variations, for instance using the Z-score5 or statistics at the level of whole gene sets6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genetic causes of such aberrant expression includes rare variants in the promoter8 and enhancer but also in coding or intronic regions5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, RNA-seq can reveal extreme cases of allele-specific expression (mono-allelic expression (MAE)), whereby one allele is silenced, leaving only the other allele expressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When assuming a recessive mode of inheritance, genes with a single heterozygous rare coding variant identified by WES or WGS analysis are not prioritized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, MAE of such variants fits the recessive mode of inheritance assumption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detection of MAE can thus help re-prioritizing heterozygous rare variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reasons for MAE can be genetic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A pilot study validated compound heterozygous variants within one gene as cause of TAR syndrome, where one allele is deleted and the other harbours a non-coding variant that reduces expression9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MAE can also have epigenetic causes such as X-chromosome inactivation or imprinting on autosomal genes, possibly by random choice10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, splicing of a gene can be affected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aberrant splicing has long been recognized as a major cause of Mendelian disorders (reviewed in refs 12, 13, 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the prediction of splicing defects from genetic sequence is difficult because splicing involves a complex set of cis-regulatory elements that are not yet fully understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of them can be deeply located in intronic sequences15 and are thus not covered by WES.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, direct probing of splice isoforms by RNA-seq is important, and has led to the discovery of multiple splicing defects based on single gene studies: skipping of multiple exons (exon 4555)16 and creation of a new exon by a deep intronic variant in DMD17, intron retention in LMNA caused by a 5 splice site variant18, and skipping of exon 7 in SMN1 caused by a variant in a splicing factor binding site19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, RNA-seq promises to be an important complementary tool to facilitate molecular diagnosis of rare genetic disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no systematic study to date has been conducted to assess its power.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We considered investigating the power of RNA-sequencing for molecular diagnosis with a panel of patients diagnosed with a mitochondrial disorder for three reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, mitochondrial diseases collectively represent one of the most frequent inborn errors of metabolism affecting 2 in 10,000 individuals20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the broad range of unspecific clinical symptoms and the genetic diversity in mitochondrial diseases makes molecular diagnosis difficult and WES often results in VUS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence of the bi-genomic control of the energy-generating oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system, mitochondrial diseases may result from pathogenic mutations of the mitochondrial DNA or nuclear genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More than 1,500 different nuclear genes encode mitochondrial proteins21 and causal defects have been identified in 300 genes and presumably more additional disease-associated genes still awaiting identification22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, since the diagnosis often relies on biochemical testing of a tissue sample, fibroblast cell lines are usually available from those patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, for many patients, the disease mechanisms can be assayed in epidermal fibroblast cell lines even though the disease may manifest in different tissues23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allows rapid demonstration of the necessary and sufficient role of candidate variants by perturbation and complementation assays24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This also indicates that disease-causing expression defects, if any, should be detectable in these cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we establish an analysis pipeline to systematically detect RNA defects to complement genome-based molecular diagnosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find a median of one aberrantly expressed gene, five aberrant splicing events and six mono-allelically expressed rare variants in patient-derived fibroblasts and establish disease-causing roles for each kind.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This leads to the molecular diagnosis of 10% of undiagnosed mitochondriopathy patients (5 out of 48) and yields candidate genes for 36 other patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Systematic analysis of private exons shows that these often occur at locations where splicing is detectable at basal level in the population, providing an important clue for variant prioritization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, our study expands the tools for interpreting non-exonic variants and accelerating the genetic diagnosis of rare disorders.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'RNA sequencing on patient-derived fibroblasts', 'We performed RNA-seq on 105 fibroblast cell lines from patients with a suspected mitochondrial disease including 48 patients for which WES based variant prioritization did not yield a genetic diagnosis (Fig 1, Methods section, Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After discarding lowly expressed genes, RNA-seq identified 12,680 transcribed genes (at least 10 reads in 5% of all samples, Methods section, Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We systematically prioritized genes with the following three strategies: (i) genes with aberrant expression level6,7,8, (ii) genes with aberrant splicing17,25 and (iii) MAE of rare variants9 (Fig 1) to estimate their disease association.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All strategies are based on the comparison of one patient against the rest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assumed the causal defects to differ between patients, which is reasonable for mitochondrial disorders with a diversity of 300 known disease-causing genes (Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the patients serve as good controls for each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Strategy for genetic diagnosis using RNA-seq.The approach we followed started with RNA-seq of fibroblasts from unsolved WES patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three strategies to facilitate diagnosis were pursued: Detection of aberrant expression (for example, depletion), aberrant splicing (for example, exon creation) and MAE of the alternative allele (for example, A as alternative allele).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Candidates were validated by proteomic measurements, lentiviral transduction of the wild-type (wt) allele or, in particular cases, by specific metabolic supplementation.Full size image', 'Aberrant expression', 'Once normalized for technical biases, sex and biopsy site (Supplementary Method 1 and Supplementary Fig 1), the samples typically presented few aberrantly expressed genes (median of 1, 90% of the samples with  less_than 10, Fig 2a, Supplementary Data 3) with a large effect (|Z-score| greater than 3) and significant differential expression (Hochberg adjusted P value less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the most aberrantly expressed genes across all samples, we found 2 genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, MGST1 (one case) and TIMMDC1 (two cases) to be significantly down-regulated (Fig 2bd and Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both genes, WES did not identify any variants in the respective patients, no variant is reported to be disease-associated and no case of potential bi-allelic rare variant is listed in our in-house database comprising more than 1,200 whole-exomes from mitochondrial patients and more than 15,000 whole-exomes available to us from different ongoing research projects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the consequences of diminished RNA expression at the protein level, we performed quantitative proteomics in a total of 31 fibroblast cell lines (including these three patients, and further 17 undiagnosed and 11 diagnosed patients, Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Data 4 and 5, Supplementary Methods 25) from a second aliquot of cells taken at the same time as the RNA-seq aliquot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Normalized RNA and protein expression levels showed a median rank correlation of 0.59, comparable to what has been previously reported26,27 (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patient #73804 showed 2% of control MGST1 level whilst the lack of detection of TIMMDC1 in both patients (#35791 and #66744) confirmed an even stronger effect on protein expression, indicating loss of function (Fig 2e and Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MGST1, a microsomal glutathione S-transferase, is involved in the oxidative stress defense28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the loss of expression of MGST1 is not only a likely cause of the disease of this patient, who suffers from an infantile-onset neurodegenerative disorder similar to a recently published case with another defect in the reactive oxygen species defense system (Supplementary Fig 4, Supplementary Note 1)29, but also suggests a treatment with antioxidants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both TIMMDC1 patients presented with muscular hypotonia, developmental delay and neurological deterioration, which led to death in the first 3 years of life (Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the described function of TIMMDC1 as a respiratory chain complex I assembly factor30,31, we found isolated complex I deficiency in muscle (Supplementary Fig 2), and globally decreased levels of complex I subunits in fibroblasts by quantitative proteomics (Fig 2e and Supplementary Fig 2) and western blot (Fig 2f, Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Re-expression of TIMMDC1 in these cells increased complex I subunit levels (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results not only validate TIMMDC1-deficiency as disease causing but also provide compelling evidence for an important function of TIMMDC1 in complex I assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: RNA aberrant expression detection and validation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Aberrantly expressed genes (Hochberg corrected P value less_than 0.05

aberrant splicing events by testing for differential splicing in each patient against the others, using an annotation-free algorithm able to detect splice sites de novo (Methods section, median of 5 abnormal events per sample, 90% with  less_than 16, Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the 175 aberrant spliced genes detected in the undiagnosed patients, the most abundant events were, apart from differential expression of isoforms, exon skipping followed by the creation of new exons (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, TIMMDC1 and CLPP, which were among the 20 most significant genes, caught our attention (Supplementary Data 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Out of 136 exon-junction reads overlapping the acceptor site of CLPP exon 6 for patient #58955, 82 (per cent spliced in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32, =60%) skipped exon 5, and 14 (=10%) showed a 3-truncated exon 5, in striking contrast to other samples (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The likely genetic cause of these two splice defects is a rare homozygous variant in exon 5 of CLPP affecting the last nucleotide of exon 5 (c.661G greater than A, p.Glu221Lys 1.2 × 105 frequency in the ExAC database33, Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both detected splice defects result in truncated CLPP and western blots corroborated the complete loss of full-length CLPP (Supplementary Figs 5 and 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our WES variant filtering reported this variant as a VUS and classified CLPP as one among 30 other potentially bi-allelic affected candidate genes (Supplementary Data 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the variant was of unknown significance, the patient remained without genetic diagnosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loss of function found by RNA-seq and confirmed by western blotting now highlights clinical relevance of the variant within CLPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CLPP encodes a mitochondrial ATP-dependent endopeptidase34 and CLPP-deficiency causes Perrault syndrome35,36 (OMIM #601119) which is overlapping with the clinical presentation of the patient investigated here including microcephaly, deafness and severe psychomotor retardation (Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, a study recently showed that Clpp/ mice are deficient for complex IV expression37, in line with complex IV deficiency of this patient (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Aberrant splicing detection and

distribution indicated that both TIMMDC1-deficient patients expressed almost exclusively a TIMMDC1 isoform with a new exon in intron 5 (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This new exon introduces a frameshift yielding a premature stop codon (p.Gly199_Thr200ins5*, Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, this new exon contained a rare variant (c.596+2146A greater than G) not listed in the 1,000 Genomes Project2,3 (validated by Sanger sequencing, Supplementary Fig 2, Supplementary Method 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WGS demonstrated that this variant is homozygous in both patients (Fig 3e, Supplementary Method 7), the only rare variant in this intron and close to the splice site (+6 of the new exon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We could not identify any rare variant in the promoter region or in any intronexon boundary of TIMMDC1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, when testing six prediction tools for splicing events, this deep intronic rare variant is predicted by SpliceAid2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38) to create multiple binding sites for splice enhancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with the correctly predicted new acceptor and donor sites by SplicePort39 (Feature generation algorithm score 0.112 and 1.308, respectively) this emphasizes the influence of this variant in the creation of the new exon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides, the four other tools predicted no significant change in splicing40,41,42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further discovered an additional family in our in-house WGS database (consisting of 36 patients with a suspected mitochondrial disorder and 232 further patients with unrelated diseases) carrying the same homozygous intronic variant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this family three affected siblings presented with similar clinical symptoms although without a diagnosis of a mitochondrial disorder (Fig 3e, Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two siblings died before the age of 10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A younger brother (#96687), now 6 years of age, presented with muscle hypotonia, failure to thrive and neurological impairment (Supplementary Note 1), similar to the patients described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot analysis confirmed TIMMDC1-deficiency (Fig 2f, Supplementary Fig 10) and impaired complex I assembly, which was restored after re-expression of TIMMDC1 (Fig 2g, Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discovery of the same intronic TIMMDC1 variant in three unrelated families from three different ethnicities provides convincing evidence on the causality of this variant for the TIMMDC1 loss-of-function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In almost all non-TIMMDC1-deficiency samples, we noticed a few split reads supporting inclusion of the new exon (Fig 3d), consistent with an earlier report that many cryptic splice sites are not entirely repressed but active at low levels44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We set out to quantify this phenomenon and to interrogate the frequency of private exons originating from weakly spliced exons, independent of their possible association with disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, we modelled the distribution of  for the 1,603,042 splicing events detected genome-wide in 105 samples as a mixture of three components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model classified splicing frequencies per splice site as strong (20%, with  greater than 5.3%), weak (16%, with 0.16% less_than  less_than 5.3%), or background (64%, with  less_than 0.16%, Methods section, Fig 3f and Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, the majority (70%, 4.4-fold more than by chance) of the 17 discovered private exons originated from weak splice sites (Fig 3f, bottom).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data confirm that weakly spliced cryptic exons are loci more susceptible to turn into strongly spliced sites than other intronic regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These weak splicing events are usually dismissed as noise since they are only supported by few reads in a given sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis shows that they can be detected as accumulation points across multiple individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, these results suggest that the prioritization of deep intronic VUSs gained through WGS could be improved by annotating weak splice sites and their resulting cryptic exons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mono-allelic expression', 'As a third approach, we searched for MAE of rare variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In median per sample, 35,521 heterozygous SNVs were detected by WES, of which 7,622 were sufficiently covered by RNA-seq to call MAE (more than 10 reads), 20 showed MAE (Hochberg adjusted P value less_than 0.05, allele frequency 0.8), of which 6 were rare variants (minor allele frequency less_than 0.001, Methods section, Fig 4a, 90% of the samples had  less_than 12 MAE of rare variants).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amongst the 18 rare mono-allelic expressed variants in patient #80256 was a VUS in ALDH18A1 (c.1864C greater than T, p.Arg622Trp, Fig 4b), encoding an enzyme involved in mitochondrial proline metabolism45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This VUS had been seen in WES compound heterozygous with a nonsense variant (c.1988C greater than A, p.Ser663*, Fig 4b and Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variants in ALDH18A1 had been reported to be associated with cutis laxa III (OMIM #138250)46,47, yet the patient did not present cutis laxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of this inconsistent phenotype and the unknown significance of the non-synonymous variant, the variants in ALDH18A1 were not regarded as disease causing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, RNA-seq-based aberrant expression (Supplementary Fig 7) and MAE analysis prioritized ALDH18A1 again.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Validation by quantitative proteomics revealed severe reduction down to 2% ALDH18A1 (Fig 4c), indicating that the rare MAE variant affects translation or protein stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metabolomics profile of blood plasma was in accordance with a defect in proline metabolism (Fig 4d, Supplementary Method 8) and the following changes in urea cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patient fibroblasts showed a growth defect that was rescued by supplementation of proline, validating impaired proline metabolism as the underlying molecular cause (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experimental evidence strongly suggests that the two observed variants are pathogenic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, a recent report48 on ALDH18A1 patients extended the phenotypic spectrum to spastic paraplegia without cutis laxa (OMIM #138250).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spastic paraplegia resembles the symptoms of our patient (Supplementary Note 1), which validates these ALDH18A1 mutations as disease-causing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Detection and validation of MAE of rare variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Distribution of heterozygous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) across samples for

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Altogether, our study demonstrates the utility of RNA-seq in combination with bioinformatics filtering criteria for molecular diagnosis by (i) discovering a new disease-associated gene, (ii) providing a diagnosis for 10% (5 of 48) of undiagnosed cases and (iii) identifying a limited number of strong candidates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We established a pipeline for the detection of aberrant expression, aberrant splicing and MAE of rare variants, that is able to detect significant outliers, with a median of 1, 5 and 6, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, for 36 patients our pipeline provides a strong candidate gene, that is, a known disease-causing or mitochondrial protein-encoding gene, like MGST1 (Fig 5a, Supplementary Data 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This manageable amount, similar to the median number of 16 genes with rare potentially bi-allelic variants detected by WES, allows manual inspection and validation by disease experts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While filtering by frequency is highly efficient when focusing on the coding region, frequency filtering is not as effective for intronic or intergenic variants identified by WGS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loss-of-function character observed on RNA level thus improved interpretation of VUS identified by genotyping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Characterization of diagnoses and variants causing aberrant splicing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

(bottom, intron retention).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variants are depicted by a red star.Full size image', 'We focused our analysis on one sample preparation pipeline, which has several advantages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our experience, expression outliers can only reliably be detected after extensive normalization process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This needs information about all technical details starting from the biopsy, growth of the cells, to the RNA extraction and library preparation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Usually not all this information is available in published data sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For detecting aberrant splicing such as new exons, we would recommend not to mix different tissues because splicing can be tissue-specific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MAE is the most robust of all criteria in this respect because it only relies on read counts within a sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, we recommend not relying on a single sample being compared to public RNA-seq data sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, RNA-seq should be included in the pipeline of diagnostic centres to generate matching controls over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The situation is similar for whole exome and WGS, where the control for platform-specific biases is important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To our surprise, many newly diagnosed cases were caused by a defective splicing event, which caused loss of function (Fig 5b), confirming the increasing recognition of the role of splicing defects in both Mendelian49,50 and common disorders25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of TIMMDC1, the causal variant was intronic, and thus not covered by WES.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even when detected by WGS, such deep intronic variants are difficult to prioritize from the sequence information alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we showed that RNA-seq of large cohorts can provide important information about intronic positions that are particularly susceptible to affect splicing when mutated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed that private exons often arise from loci with weak splicing of 1%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that rare variants affecting such cryptic splice sites are more likely to affect splicing and that these can be detected as positions with low yet consistent splicing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reason that analysis of a RNA-seq compendium of healthy donors across multiple tissues such as GTEx (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  51) could provide tissue-specific maps of cryptic splice sites useful for prioritizing intronic variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Genetic disorders typically show specificity to some tissues, some of which might not be easily accessible for RNA-sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore natural to question whether transcriptome sequencing of an unaffected tissue can help diagnosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we performed RNA-seq on patient derived dermal fibroblast cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fibroblast cell lines are the byproducts of muscle biopsies routinely undertaken in the clinic to biochemically diagnose mitochondrial disorders with enzymatic assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using fibroblast cell lines we overcome the limited accessibility of the affected tissues, which in the case of mitochondrial disorders are often high energy demanding tissues like brain, heart, skeletal muscle or liver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It turns out that many genes with a mitochondrial function are expressed in most tissues52, including fibroblasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, extreme regulatory defects such as loss of expression or aberrant splicing of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins can be detected in fibroblasts, even though the physiological consequence on fibroblasts might be negligible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This property might be true for other diseases: the tissue-specific physiological consequence of a variant does not necessarily stem from tissue-specific expression of the gene harbouring the variant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In many cases, tissue-specificity might be due to environmental or cellular context, or from tissue-specific expression of further genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, tissue-specificity does not preclude RNA-seq of unaffected tissues from revealing the causative defect for a large number of patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, non-affected tissues have the advantage that the regulatory consequences on other genes are limited and therefore the causal defects are more likely to stand out as outliers53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Parallel to our effort, another study systematically investigated the usage of RNA-seq for molecular diagnosis with a similar sample size, using muscle biopsies from primary muscle disorder patients50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analogously to our approach, not only exome sequencing-based VUS candidates were validated, but also new disease-causing mechanisms identified using RNA-seq data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite a few differences in the approach (expression outliers were not looked for, only samples of the affected tissues were considered and using samples of healthy donors as controls), the results are in line with ours whereby aberrant splicing also turns out to be a frequent disease-causing event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The success rate was even higher (35%), possibly because the diagnostic rate of primary muscle disorders is higher than for mitochondrial disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, in this case the affected tissue was always accessible and could be profiled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore the chances were higher that the affected gene is expressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, this complementary study confirms the relevance of using RNA-seq for diagnosis of Mendelian disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we predict that RNA-seq will become an essential companion of genome sequencing to address undiagnosed cases of genetic disease.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
