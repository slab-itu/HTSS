Multivalent contacts of the Hsp70 Ssb contribute to its architecture on ribosomes and nascent chain interaction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Hsp70 chaperones assist de novo folding of newly synthesized proteins in all cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In yeast, the specialized Hsp70 Ssb directly binds to ribosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structural basis and functional mode of recruitment of Ssb to ribosomes is not understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present the molecular details underlying ribosome binding of Ssb in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interaction is multifaceted, involving the co-chaperone RAC and two specific regions within Ssb characterized by positive charges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C-terminus of Ssb mediates the key contact and a second attachment point is provided by a KRR-motif in the substrate binding domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, ribosome binding of Ssb is not essential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Autonomous ribosome attachment becomes necessary if RAC is absent, suggesting a dual mode of Ssb recruitment to nascent chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose, that the multilayered ribosomal interaction allows positioning of Ssb in an optimal orientation to the tunnel exit guaranteeing an efficient nascent polypeptide interaction.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The folding of newly synthesized polypeptides is a delicate and error-prone process that needs the guidance of molecular chaperones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A specialized group of ribosome-associated chaperones directly acts at the ribosomal exit tunnel where nascent chains enter the cytosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These factors promote initial protein folding, control targeting and prevent misfolding and aggregation of newly synthesized proteins1,2,3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In eukaryotes, ribosome-associated chaperones include the nascent-polypeptide associated complex (NAC) and a specialized Hsp70/40 system (Ssb-RAC in yeast).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both systems bind transiently to the ribosome in close proximity to the polypeptide tunnel exit and interact with nascent chains7,8,9,10,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The ribosome-bound Hsp70 Ssb is only present in fungi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Saccharomyces cerevisiae it exists in two functionally interchangeable versions, Ssb1 and Ssb2, differing in four amino acids (referred to as Ssb hereafter).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to its domain structure Ssb represents a canonic Hsp70, consisting of a conserved 42 kDa N-terminal nucleotide binding domain (NBD), a 18 kDa substrate binding domain (SBD) and a 6 kDa flexible lid at the C-terminus (C-terminal domain, CTD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It transiently binds to ribosomes in a 1:1 stoichiometry, migrates with translating ribosomes and binds in a RAC-controlled manner to nascent chains14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ssb binding to vacant ribosomes is salt-sensitive and its ribosomal interaction is not affected by ATP11,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ribosome-associated complex (RAC), a stable hetero-dimer of the Hsp40 Zuotin (Zuo1) and an Hsp70 Ssz1, acts as a co-chaperone for Ssb by stimulating its ATPase activity and the interaction with nascent polypeptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RAC is conserved in higher eukaryotes and assumed to recruit cytosolic Hsp70 to nascent polypeptides19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RAC is tethered to the ribosome via Zuotin that contacts both ribosomal subunits, 60S and 40S, thereby bridging two important functional regions, the peptidyltransferase centre and the ribosomal exit, which may allow to link protein translation with early nascent chain folding21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exact role of the Ssb-RAC system during protein biogenesis remains elusive but a regulatory role not only in protein folding but also in the control of translation is hypothesized17,22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loss of Ssb-RAC enhances read through of stop codons, while the overexpression of Ssb allows their efficient recognition25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, deletion of Ssb-RAC leads to inhibition of -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifts likely due to impaired chaperoning, which provokes backup of the nascent chain within the tunnel and aa-tRNA mispositioning27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, cells lacking individual components or the whole Ssb-RAC system show a similar pleiotropic phenotype including slow growth, sensitivity towards salt, aminoglycosides, translation inhibitory drugs, protein folding stress and low temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of Ssb many proteins, including ribosomal proteins and ribosome biogenesis factors, aggregate resulting in decreased amounts of ribosomal subunits and reduced translation activity11,16,28,29,30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The mechanism by which Ssb binds to the ribosome is enigmatic, while ribosome attachment of other chaperones such as bacterial Trigger Factor or eukaryotic RAC and NAC are well characterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, it is unclear whether ribosomal interaction of Ssb is a prerequisite for its in vivo function, as it is the case for Trigger Factor or NAC (refs 31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An earlier study using domain chimeras of Ssb and another Hsp70, Ssa, revealed that neither the NBD nor the SBD of Ssb are essential for ribosome attachment14, but there is so far no detailed molecular understanding of Ssb binding to the translation machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study we clarify this long-standing open question by identifying the elements of Ssb that mediate ribosomal interaction and by analysing the functional consequences for a ribosome-binding mutant of Ssb in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interaction of this Hsp70 with the ribosome involves two Ssb-specific positively charged regions, one in the SBD and one in the CTD that mediate direct contacts to the translation machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cooperation of Ssb with RAC represents a further layer of interaction and the presence of this co-factor becomes essential if a ribosome-binding mutant of Ssb is analysed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These multilayered ribosomal interactions may position Ssb in an optimal orientation at the tunnel exit to allow efficient interaction with the nascent chain.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Ssb contains basic regions that are not conserved in Hsp70s', 'The four Hsp70 subfamilies of S. cerevisiae (Ssa14, Ssb12, Sse12 and Ssz1; refs 33, 34) show a high degree of conservation and especially the abundant Ssa and Ssb chaperones are more than 60% identical35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, they fulfil different tasks within the cell; Ssb is the major Hsp70 interacting with ribosomes14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking this into account, we aligned the sequences of Ssa1 and Ssb1 and screened for differences between both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since it is known that bacterial Trigger Factor32, as well as eukaryotic NAC (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31) and RAC (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24) mainly involve positive charge to contact the ribosome, we focused on differences in positively charged residues, which might be involved in the direct interaction between Ssb and the ribosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified two regions in the SBD and CTD (Fig 1a, grey boxes), which differ between Ssa and Ssb and show an accumulation of basic residues in Ssb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first region KRR42830 lies within a beta-sheet of the SBD, facing to the outside, not to the putative substrate-binding pocket of a modelled Ssb structure (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This KRR-stretch is conserved within all Ssbs but not present in other Hsp70s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a net charge of +3 this region clearly differs from the corresponding KSE421-3 residues of Ssa1 with a net charge of ±0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second region we identified is located at the very C-terminus of Ssb (603613) and includes 4 positively charged residues (K603, R604, K608, R613; Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analogous residues within Ssa1 (595605) include a negatively (D596) as well as one positively (K604) charged amino acid, resulting again in a net charge of±0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Two positively charged regions that differ between the yeast Hsp70s Ssa and Ssb might be involved in ribosome binding of Ssb.

binding and deleted 13 residues from the CTD, resulting in the Ssb160113 mutant (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This Ssb variant, when expressed from plasmid under control of the authentic Ssb promoter, fully complemented growth of ssb1,2 cells under all conditions tested (cold, salt, translational or protein folding stress; Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude, that the expression of Ssb160113 supports growth of yeast cells similarly well as wt Ssb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Mutations that influence ribosome binding of Ssb do not hamper growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic overview of

binding of Ssb1_KRR428AAA mutant.Full size image', 'Next, we did a ribosome sedimentation assay to directly investigate the association of Ssb160113 with ribosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rpl17A served as ribosomal and Pgk1 as cytosolic marker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of chromosomally or plasmid encoded Ssb1 was found in the ribosomal pellet (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, the mutant Ssb160113 shifted completely into the cytosolic fraction indicating the loss of its ribosome binding capability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To investigate whether deletion of all 13 C-terminal amino acids is necessary to abolish ribosome binding, we C-terminally truncated Ssb progressively, by deleting only four (Ssb161013) or eight (Ssb160613) residues (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All Ssb1 mutants complemented growth of ssb1,2 cells, as well as wt Ssb1 (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysing association of these deletion variants with ribosomes revealed that the deletion of only four residues already hampered ribosome binding and the loss of eight amino acids enhanced this defect even further (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the incubation of lysates with puromycin reduced the level of all Ssb1 versions that bind to ribosomes even more, indicating that an interaction with the nascent chain plays a role in all cases (Supplementary Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To test ribosome binding in vitro, recombinantly purified wt Ssb1 and Ssb160113 protein was incubated with puromycin stripped and high salt washed yeast ribosomes (Supplementary Fig 2a) that were almost completely devoid of exit site associated factors like NAC or RAC (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full length Ssb1 showed a ribosomal interaction as it shifted from the supernatant into the pellet fraction (Supplementary Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Ssb160113 did not bind to purified ribosomes, even when incubated in eightfold excess and under physiological salt conditions (Supplementary Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, deletion of the 13 C-terminal residues of Ssb completely abolishes ribosomal interaction in vivo and in vitro supporting the assumption that this C-terminal lid element is essential for ribosome binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of yeast Hsp70s showed in the case of Ssa a clear interaction between the SBD and the CTD, and a lid closing movement of the C-terminus with time (Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interaction was not that significantly detectable for a wt Ssb model, which did not show a strong interaction between the SBD and the CTD (Supplementary Fig 3b), supporting the hypothesis that this region in Ssb might directly be involved in ribosome binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, MD simulations also suggest that deletion of the 13 C-terminal residues of Ssb even more weakens the interaction of the helical lid with the beta-sheet domain (Supplementary Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we cannot exclude that local misfolding of the helical CTD also contributes to the loss of ribosome binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this further, we introduced point mutations in the C-terminal domain instead of deleting this region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since we speculated that the interaction of Ssb with ribosomes is mediated via electrostatic interactions, we substituted the four positively charged lysine and arginine residues within Ssb60313 by alanines (Ssb1_KR603AA-K608A-R613A) creating the mutant Ssb1_KRKR-AAAA (Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alanine substitutions not only diminish the positive charge but are also known to have high helix propensity and thus should prevent potential unfolding of the lid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression of this Ssb1 variant with a replacement of positive to neutral charge within the C-terminus complemented the growth defects of ssb1,2 cells (Supplementary Fig 4b), but led to a shift of Ssb1 from translating ribosomes into the soluble fraction (Supplementary Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we conclude that electrostatic interactions of the Ssb CTD are crucial for ribosome attachment and that the ribosome-binding defect of Ssb160113 is mainly due to the lack of positive charges rather than local unfolding of the CTD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the C-terminal truncation of Ssb1 lacking only one (Ssb161013) or two (Ssb160613) basic amino acids already strongly influenced ribosome binding we assume that at least two out of four basic residues are crucial to mediate the ribosomal contact (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The KRR-motif contributes to ribosome binding', 'Next, we focused on the second region KRR42830, which we identified as a second potential ribosomal contact site of Ssb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypothesizing, that again electrostatic interactions play a role in this putative contact we exchanged the three lysine and arginine residues to alanines creating the Ssb mutant Ssb1_KRRAAA (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mutant fully complemented the growth defect of ssb1,2 cells under normal and stress conditions (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a ribosome sedimentation assay Ssb1_KRR-AAA migrated with ribosomes, but ribosome attachment was clearly reduced in comparison to wt Ssb1 (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the KRR-region of Ssb seemingly contributes to ribosome binding but is not sufficient for this interaction since the loss of 13 C-terminal amino acids abolishes ribosome association of this Hsp70.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To provide further evidence that the KRR-motif and the C-terminus of Ssb are directly involved in targeting to the ribosome, we created a FLAG-tagged version of Ssa1 (Ssa1_RB) carrying the two ribosome binding (RB) sites of Ssb1: residues 60113 and the KRR-motif (Supplementary Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As controls we designed a FLAG-tagged variant of wt Ssa1 and Ssa1C (corresponding to Ssb160113).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of these Ssa1 versions in ssb1,2 cells did not complement growth under the conditions tested (Supplementary Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, introduction of the two Ssb ribosome-binding regions enhanced binding of Ssa1_RB to ribosomes compared with wt Ssa1 and even more pronounced to Ssa1C (Supplementary Fig 5c; note that the Ssb-specific antibody detects the Ssb1 residues in Ssa1_RB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a small proportion of wt Ssa1 could be detected in the pellet fraction, Ssa1_RB showed an enhanced migration with ribosomes in the sedimentation assay, which was reduced again under higher salt conditions (Supplementary Fig 5d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that the two Ssb ribosome-binding regions promote targeting of other Hsp70s to the translation machinery suggesting that these Ssb regions directly interact with ribosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we identified two Ssb specific regions within the SBD and CTD of Ssb that are characterized by a basic net charge, and that are involved in the interaction with ribosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest, that the C-terminus of Ssb represents an essential site that mediates the key contact to anchor Ssb on ribosomes while interaction via the KRR-region in the SBD is non-essential but may support the correct positioning of the domain for an efficient interaction with nascent polypeptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A ribosome-binding mutant of Ssb is functional in vivo', 'Loss of ribosome binding is detrimental for nascent chain binding chaperones such as bacterial Trigger Factor and eukaryotic NAC, leading to a loss of function phenotype in both cases31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we wondered how strongly Ssb is impaired in the folding of newly synthesized proteins, as well as in ribosome biogenesis and translation when ribosome binding is abolished.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address these important questions, we investigated the Ssb160113 mutant that completely lost its intrinsic ability to autonomously bind to ribosomes (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we monitored the cellular localization of wt or mutant Ssb1 N-terminally fused to yEGFP in ssb1,2 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both Ssb1 versions complemented growth (Fig 3b) and showed a homogenous cytosolic distribution in the cell, and neither mislocalization nor aggregation of the constructs could be observed (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we performed polysome profiling to investigate whether loss of ribosome attachment of Ssb has any influence on the level of mature and translating ribosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total lysates were prepared from different yeast cells and loaded on a sucrose density gradient to separate ribosomal species by centrifugation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent fractionation of the gradient reports about the 40S, 60S, 80S and polysome contents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells lacking Ssb show a decrease of ribosomal subunits, especially of the 60S resulting in reduced translation as evident by a reduction of 80S and polysome peaks (Fig 3d, left;31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These defects were complemented by plasmid encoded Ssb1 expressed under its authentic promoter (Fig 3d, middle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot analysis of the fractions resulting from polysome profiling detected Ssb as expected in the soluble part, as well as bound to ribosomal subunits, translating monosomes and polysomes (Fig 3d middle, bottom;14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, cells expressing the ribosome-binding mutant Ssb160113 showed a profile similar to that of wt cells with a restored 60S peak, as well as normal monosomes and polysomes (Fig 3d, right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As anticipated, Ssb160113 did not migrate with ribosomes and was only detectable in the soluble fractions (Fig 3d right, bottom).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure

pre-treated Ssb with ATP to force the open conformation (SsbATP) or with apyrase that hydrolyses ATP to ADP/AMP, leading to lid closure of the Hsp70 (SsbADP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After that, we added APPY peptide and in the case of SsbATP we incubated with apyrase subsequently, to stabilize the Hsp70peptide complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses upon gel filtration showed that more APPY shifted into the Ssb

interaction was reduced to 71% in the case of SsbADP (Supplementary Fig 6b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This proves that the nucleotide state of Ssb is critical for an efficient peptide binding and that the

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this study we elucidated the molecular details underlying ribosomal interaction of the specialized Hsp70 Ssb and investigated the importance of ribosome association for the chaperoning function of Ssb in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings resolve long-standing open questions, as ribosome binding of Ssb remained enigmatic until now.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ssb shows a high degree of identity to the cytosolic Hsp70 version Ssa and lacks obvious ribosome-binding domains or elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in contrast to other ribosome-associated chaperones such as Trigger Factor in bacteria or the yeast Hsp40s Zuo1 or Jjj1, which involve discrete ribosome-binding domains40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Ribosome binding of Ssb is multilayered involving direct interactions mediated by two basic regions and its contact with the ribosome-associated co-chaperone RAC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both regions are characterized by an enrichment of positively charged amino acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The key contact to ribosomes is mediated via 13 residues of the C-terminal lid (60313, KRKR) and a second contact with lower affinity is provided by a KRR-motif (residues 42830) within the SBD (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion or substitution of positive charges in the C-terminus of Ssb showed the strongest impact on ribosomal interaction, qualifying this region as a major contact of Ssb to ribosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, this region is highly conserved in all Ssb homologues and thus may act as a general ribosome-docking site for this Hsp70 subfamily.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The additional attachment via the KRR-region, which showed mild effects on mutation, expands this interaction and likely serves for correct positioning of the SBD in close proximity to the ribosomal tunnel exit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both ribosome-binding regions of Ssb involve positively charged amino acids, which is in excellent agreement with earlier studies showing that Ssb, bound to non-translating ribosomes, could be stripped off by high salt treatment11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests mainly electrostatic interactions between Ssb and the ribosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 8: Model of the multifaceted interactions of the yeast Hsp70 Ssb at the ribosomal exit site.Ssb possesses two intrinsic ribosome-binding sites: basic amino acid side chains within residues 60313 of the C-terminal domain (KRKR) mediate a strong key contact to the ribosome, KRR (residues 42830) of the substrate-binding domain represents a second attachment point which might serve for correct positioning of Ssb at the ribosomal exit site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further indirect ribosomal contacts of Ssb are mediated via binding of the nascent polypeptide and by transient J-domain interaction with Zuotin (Zuo) that forms the ribosome-associated complex RAC together with the Hsp70 Ssz.Full size image', 'We thoroughly characterized the ribosome-binding mutant Ssb160113 in vitro and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro we found that wt and mutant Ssb1 similarly well bind canonical Hsp70 peptide substrates albeit we were not able to determine Kd values for this interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One explanation for this observation might be a much lower affinity of Ssb towards peptide substrates compared with other Hsp70 chaperones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a scenario would exclude stable binding of Ssb to substrates in the cytosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, the interaction with RAC and ribosomes might be important for high affinity substrate binding of Ssb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Surprisingly, loss of autonomous ribosome binding of Ssb did not affect its functions in vivo including de novo protein folding, ribogenesis and translation activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in contrast to other ribosome-associated chaperones, as ribosome-binding deficient Trigger Factor no longer supports nascent polypeptide folding and an analogous NAC mutant provokes growth defects and protein misfolding in ssb1,2 cells31,32,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Trigger Factor and NAC act autonomously, while Ssb activity involves the ribosome-associated co-factor RAC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests a RAC-mediated interaction of Ssb with ribosome-nascent chain complexes, even for mutant Ssb that is not able to directly bind to the translation machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the Ssb ribosome-binding mutant pictures the scenario of higher eukaryotes, where the mammalian mRAC recruits cytosolic Hsp70 to promote co-translational protein folding19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assumption is strongly supported by our finding that Ssb160113 is no longer functional in the absence of RAC, while wt Ssb maintains residual activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, overexpression of the mammalian Zuotin homologue Mpp11 complements the phenotypes of zuo1 cells but acts together with cytosolic Ssa, not with Ssb (refs 9, 19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that also in the yeast S. cerevisiae ribosome association of RAC is sufficient to target cytosolic Hsp70 to the ribosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The residual functionality of Ssb observed in the absence of RAC might be due to two reasons, which are not mutually exclusive: First, Ssb possesses a comparably high intrinsic ATPase activity in comparison to other Hsp70s (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  43), which could be even higher at the ribosome, that might allow efficient nascent chain binding also without the additional stimulation by RAC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second explanation could be that Ssb is able to cooperate with other Hsp40 co-chaperones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although earlier experiments did not detect in vitro ATPase stimulation of Ssb by other yeast Hsp40s like Ydj1 or Sis1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  43), it could be shown that overexpression of the ribosome-associated Hsp40 Jjj1 partially substitutes for Zuo1 in a RAC strain28,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests a possible cooperation of the Hsp70 Ssb with other ribosome-attached or cytosolic Hsp40 co-chaperones in the absence of RAC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Still, the question remains why ribosomal interaction of Ssb is evolutionarily conserved in fungi, albeit clearly not essential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can only speculate that for unicellular yeast with a high translation rate and fast cell division it might be beneficial to optimize its co-translational protein folding capacity by tethering an Hsp70 directly to the ribosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in contrast to Ssb, RAC is substoichiometric to ribosomes12, demanding a RAC-independent mode of ribosome binding for Ssb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that the multivalent ribosomal contacts via the CTD and SBD of Ssb in combination with its interaction with ribosome-tethered RAC position Ssb in an optimal orientation to the ribosomal tunnel exit to guarantee an efficient interaction with the nascent chain (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On the basis of findings of this study, further important questions can be addressed: (i) which are the contact sites of Ssb at the ribosome?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ssb likely binds in close proximity to the co-factor RAC and the nascent chain; (ii) how does Ssb detach from the ribosome upon nascent chain interaction?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is tempting to speculate that substrate binding and ATP hydrolysis induce conformational changes of Ssb that promote ribosome detachment for example by movement of the lid towards the substrate binding pocket.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar mechanism is described for Hsp70s of cellular organelles like the endoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases Hsp70s interact with the translocation machinery and detach from these complexes upon nascent polypeptide interaction and in dependency of their specific co-factors45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest a similar mechanism leading to ribosome detachment of Ssb upon nascent polypeptide interaction and RAC-stimulated ATP hydrolysis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
