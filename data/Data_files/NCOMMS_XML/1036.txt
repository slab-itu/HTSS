Skilful prediction of Sahel summer rainfall on inter-annual and multi-year timescales  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Summer rainfall in the Sahel region of Africa exhibits one of the largest signals of climatic variability and with a population reliant on agricultural productivity, the Sahel is particularly vulnerable to major droughts such as occurred in the 1970s and 1980s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rainfall levels have subsequently recovered, but future projections remain uncertain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that Sahel rainfall is skilfully predicted on inter-annual and multi-year (that is, 5 years) timescales and use these predictions to better understand the driving mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moisture budget analysis indicates that on multi-year timescales, a warmer north Atlantic and Mediterranean enhance Sahel rainfall through increased meridional convergence of low-level, externally sourced moisture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, year-to-year rainfall levels are largely determined by the recycling rate of local moisture, regulated by planetary circulation patterns associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings aid improved understanding and forecasting of Sahel drought, paramount for successful adaptation strategies in a changing climate.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The Sahel, which we define as the region between 16° W to 36° E and 10° N to 20° N, extends across the African continent, transitioning between two distinct climatological regimes: the Sahara desert to the north and the lush tropical rainforests to the south.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dry conditions pervade the Sahel throughout most of the year, with a wetter period between July and September associated with a northward shift of the main tropical rainfall band1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Sahel summer rainy season exhibits one of the largest signals of global climatic variability3, reflected in the fragility of agricultural productivity in north Africa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prolonged drought ravished the region in the early 1980s, shattering crop and livestock farming and resulting in an estimated 100,000 deaths in rural communities from starvation, malnutrition and disease4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sahelian summer rainfall has since recovered to the levels of the 1960s3, but future projections are uncertain5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Superimposed on this multi-decadal change are substantial swings in inter-annual rainfall levels2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding the physical drivers of both inter-annual and multi-year Sahelian rainfall variability is crucial to gain confidence in future predictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Climate models vary widely in their ability to capture Sahel rainfall anomalies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is some statistical evidence of multi-year predictability, especially using multi-model means, for timescales greater than about 4 years and in the Western Sahel (Supplementary Table 1)6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No previous studies have documented predicting summer Sahelian rainfall from the previous winter, although seasonal predictions with lead times of 03 months have had considerable promise10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model initialization is reported to improve both the amplitude and predictability of Sahel summer rainfall anomalies, although the results are model dependent7,9,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Improved skill is also noted for models, which better simulate teleconnections between Sahel rainfall and sea-surface temperatures (SSTs)20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to our knowledge, no studies have clearly demonstrated skilfull predictions of the mechanisms by which global SSTs influence the moisture budget of the Sahel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present improved understanding and prediction of Sahel rainfall variability on both multi-year and inter-annual timescales for lead times 8 months, using a comprehensive set of retrospective forecasts (hereafter hindcasts) from the latest Met Office Decadal Climate Prediction system, DePreSys3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Covering the period since 1960, DePreSys3 uses a much higher resolution (60 km in the atmosphere and 0.25° in the ocean) than previous versions23,24, enabling better representation of the key physical processes25 (Methods).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Skilfull prediction of Sahel summer rainfall', 'The DePreSys3 hindcasts skilfully predict post-1960 summer (that is, the mean of July, August and September) rainfall levels across the Sahel on both inter-annual and longer timescales (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For linearly de-trended mean summer rainfall averaged over the 25 year period after initialization (Year 25), correlations with observations are 0.73, 0.75 and 0.63 for the whole, west and east Sahel regions, respectively, and all are significant to the 95% level (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The west and east Sahel are delineated by 10° E. At shorter, 8 month leads, the skill of DePreSys3 for predicting the upcoming summers (Year 1) is more modest, yet still significant: r=0.48, 0.50 and 0.33 for the whole, west and east Sahel regions, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The drought period of the 1980s and the subsequent recovery are particularly well captured by the model, alongside some of the major inter-annual peaks and troughs in rainfall: for example in 199798 and 2012 (Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accounting for ensemble size, DePreSys3 shows high skill compared with other initialized models and even the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) multi-model mean hindcasts, in particular on inter-annual timescales (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, understanding the physical mechanisms that modulate Sahel rainfall patterns is key for gaining further confidence in future predictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We now assess these in detail using DePreSys3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Skilful predictions of summer rainfall in the Sahel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) Spatial distribution of anomaly correlation coefficient between DePreSys3 hindcasts of summer rainfall and equivalent GPCC observations on a 1° × 1° grid for 19602014.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Boxes outline the Sahel region and delineate the west and east Sahel at 10° E.

dominated by atmospheric levels below 400 hPa, reflecting the higher humidity content here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On both inter-annual and multi-year timescales, wetter summers are associated with increased moisture from the following: stronger northward winds between 600 and 850 hPa along the southern Sahel boundary; increased humidity carried by the Mediterranean sourced surface winds (even though they actually weaken slightly)this is particularly important in the east of the region31 Supplementary Fig 7; and a stronger WAWJ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moisture flux anomalies associated with the mid-altitude African Easterly Jet32 shows a much stronger modulation on multi-year timescales and mostly counteract those from the lower level westerlies (Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4:

column integrated moisture fluxes, , highlights the role of meridional circulations in modulating Sahel rainfall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The humidity of southward flowing surface winds from the Mediterranean and the strength of the northward monsoon flow dominate the overall moisture convergence in the Sahel, whereas little convergence is associated with the zonal WAWJ and African Easterly Jet components (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in moisture convergence between wet and dry periods are similar on multi-annual and inter-annual timescales (0.17 and 0.16 mm per day, respectively, Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the total rainfall change is higher on inter-annual timescales (0.28 mm per day compared with 0.23 mm per day for multi-year timescales).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference is accounted for by a stronger contribution from evaporation (0.12 mm per day compared with 0.06 mm per day for multi-year timescales).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'External moisture supply versus local moisture recycling', 'The relative roles of moisture advected into the region Pa versus the recycling of local moisture Pm are further assessed by computing timeseries of recycling ratios =Pm/P, where P=Pa+Pm is the total rainfall (see Methods)33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sahel recycling ratios in DePreSys3 range from 0.3 to 0.4, suggesting that recycled water typically contributes just over a third of the total summer Sahel precipitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we find a distinct contrast between the character of rainfall variability on different timescales: multi-year precipitation rate anomalies are weakly anti-correlated with the recycling ratio, whereas inter-annual fluctuations show a strong positive relationship: r=0.77(0.62, 0.88), where numbers in brackets represent the 595% confidence intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These relationships suggests the dominant role for dynamically driven local moisture recycling on inter-annual timescales, with external moisture supply being more important on multi-year timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To further investigate the apparently different mechanisms driving Sahel rainfall change on different timescales, we compute the moist static energy (MSE), which enables the relative roles of moisture and temperature changes to atmospheric stability (and hence ascent) to be assessed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MSE represents the sensible, latent and geopotential energy, such that MSE=cpT+Lq+g z, where cp is the specific heat of air at constant pressure, T the temperature, L the latent heat of vapourization of water, q the specific humidity, z the height and g the acceleration due to gravity34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An increasing MSE with altitude denotes a stable atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On multi-year timescales, increased moisture content (Lq) during wet years reduces the vertical stability throughout the atmosphere, but most intensely below 500 hPa (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparison, on inter-annual timescales, it is the upper atmosphere (above 500 hPa), which is de-stabilized by cooler upper atmospheric temperatures (cpT) and therefore ascent in the deep convection cell enhanced, whereas at lower levels cooler temperatures counteract the increased moisture content (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with the apparent changes in circulation patterns and moisture fluxes between wet and dry Sahel summers on different timescales (Figs 3 and 4): meridional shifts in the circulation and moisture transport govern rainfall change on multi-year timescales, whereas upper-atmosphere temperature changes impact upper-atmosphere moisture ascent on inter-annual timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Drivers of atmospheric stability in DePreSys3.Anomalies between

gain further confidence in the skill of the forecasts, we now assess the global drivers of moisture flux and local recycling that were found to be important on the two timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several studies discuss the high sensitivity of the Sahel rainy season to the tropical and north Atlantic, the tropical Pacific, the Indian Ocean Dipole, the Mediterranean and the Saharan Low3,18,20,31,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results are found in DePreSys3: on multi-year timescales, a strong relationship exists between north Atlantic and Mediterranean SSTs and Sahelian summer rainfall (Fig 6a), whereas the eastern tropical Pacific, eastern equatorial Atlantic and Indian Ocean are significantly correlated with Sahel precipitation inter-annually (Fig 6b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering these teleconnections, we now return to consider the source of the skill in the year 25 and year 1 lead-time hindcast sets (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DePreSys3 is able to skilfully predict north Atlantic and Mediterranean SST on multi-year timescales, and that of the tropical Pacific (that is, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)) and the western Indian Ocean (but not Indian Ocean Dipole) for year one hindcasts (Fig 6c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we do not find significant skill in predicting the Saharan Low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we conclude that the north Atlantic and the Mediterranean on multi-year timescales, and the equatorial east Pacific and west Indian ocean on inter-annual timescales, are the fundamental sources of Sahel rainfall skill in

maximum (see orange rectangle in d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f,g) As for d,e but for hindcasts with a one year lead time.Full size image', 'We investigate the lack of rainfall in DePreSys3 by analysing the first empirical orthogonal function (EOF1) for Sahel precipitation, which accounts for 30% of the variance in both the observations and DePreSys3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis highlights that peak precipitation variability in DePreSys3 is about 2.5 (2) degrees too far south for hindcasts with year 25 (year 1) lead times (Fig 10d,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These EOF1 patterns also explain the sharp drop-off in correlation to the south of the Sahel (Fig 1), which corresponds to opposite signs in the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) and DePreSys3 EOF1 patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate whether the southward displacement of rainfall variability in DePreSys3 could account for the low mean and variance in modelled rainfall levels in the Sahel region, we re-compute rainfall timeseries for a box shifted by the appropriate degrees latitude, as evaluated using EOF1 patterns (Fig 10d,f, orange boxes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that this shift accounts for the low climatological Sahel rainfall levels in DePreSys3, but does not wholly account for the low modelled variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, for lead times of 25 years, the mean of each ensemble member standard deviation, , is 0.16 for the shifted box compared to 0.31 for the Sahel GPCC timeseries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the ratio of predictable components51 in observations relative to the model is greater than one (1.18) for DePreSys3, in agreement with results from CMIP5 multi-model ensemble51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that Sahel rainfall is constrained too weakly by the predictable signal relative to the noise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar issues are seen for seasonal forecasts of the North Atlantic Oscillation52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the discrepancy in climatological rainfall levels is potentially explained by the main rainbelt in DePreSys3 not extending far enough north.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, even after correcting for this, the variability and signal to noise ratio of the model remains too low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that other factors, such as the Saharan Low, act to amplify Sahelian rainfall36 in reality but are not represented properly in DePreSys3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resolving these issues is beyond the scope of the this study, but could potentially lead to better skill in future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, this study demonstrates the ability of initialized climate models to skilfully predict and better understand both periods of sustained multi-year Sahel drought and year-to-year summer rainfall variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Skilfull predictions of the underlying driving mechanisms increases our confidence that the high statistical skill represents physically realistic processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On multi-year timescales, meridional moisture convergence plays a leading role in regulating Sahelian rainfall levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prolonged droughts are the result of equator-ward migration of the tropical rainbelt, weakened southerly monsoon winds and reduced low-level moisture content, in response to a cooler north Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On inter-annual timescales, the imprint of ENSO and western Indian ocean SSTs on tropospheric temperatures and zonal circulation modulates the ascent and recycling of local Sahel moisture through changes in upper-atmospheric stability and upper troposphere meridional wind divergence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings may also have implications for how the character of the Sahelian summer rains respond to global climate patterns: since tropical Pacific temperatures predominantly regulate the vertical stability and rate of local moisture recycling or threshold for deep convection, their impact may be largely manifest in the frequency of rainy days in the Sahel; north Atlantic and Mediterranean SSTs, on the other hand, may be expected to affect the median intensity of rainfall events through their modulation of moisture supply.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, data from Senegal indicates that the persistent droughts of the 1970s and 1980s, and the subsequent recovery, are associated with changes in the median intensity of daily rainfall events as opposed to number of rainy days29,53, consistent with our expectations from multi-year changes driven by north Atlantic and Mediterranean SSTs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of Sahel rainfall change and show that skilful predictions are possible months to years ahead.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such results are paramount to building resilience for adaptation to climate variability and change, improving future food security and economic stability in this vulnerable region.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'DePreSys3', 'DePreSys3 is based on the Hadley Centre Global Environment Model version 3, HadGEM3-GC2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  54) and is initialized by relaxing towards observed analyses of: ocean temperature and salinity from global covariance analysis55 (nudged monthly with a 10-day relaxation timescales); sea-ice concentrations from the HadISST data set56 (monthly with 24 h relaxation); and ERA-interim57 atmospheric temperature and winds (nudged 6 h with 6 h relaxation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are assimilated from the surface and ramped up to 1 km altitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The atmospheric resolution is 60 km with 85 quasi-horizontal atmospheric levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oceanic resolution is 0.25° with 75 levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hindcasts are fully influenced by external forcings (for example, greenhouse gases, aerosols, ozone, solar radiation and volcanoes) as per the CMIP5 protocol58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten ensemble members are run up to 16 months from initiation, for every year since 1980, and roughly every 23 years between 1960 and 1981 (1960, 1962, 1965, 1968, 1970, 1972, 1975, 1978 and 1980): 42 start dates in total.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A smaller subset of these ten ensemble member model runs were continued to 5 years from intialization (1960, 1962, 1965, 1968, 1970, 1972, 1975, 1978, 1980, 1982, 1985, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1995, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2005, 2008 and

variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that DePreSys3 precipitation estimates in the Sahel show deficiencies in capturing multi-decadal trends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A posteriori adjustment of trends is therefore required to make real-time predictions59,60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No other pre-processing was performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Multi-year and inter-annual variability', 'The multi-year component of year one lead-time hindcasts is extracted by smoothing time series with a 5-year running mean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The residual is used as the inter-annual signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time series are shown in Supplementary Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decomposing the Year 1 hindcasts in this way provides a fair comparison, because both multi-year and inter-annual time series have the same lead time and number of data points (this would not be the case if we compared the inter-annual component of the year 1 lead-time data with the hindcasts averaged 25 years from initialization).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We do however note that moisture budget analysis performed on hindcasts averaged 25 years from initialization, is largely consistent with that from the multi-year component of the Year 1 hindcast data (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resultant timeseries are divided into wet and dry Sahel composites by grouping wetter/dryer than average years and using a weighted average with weights determined by the absolute values of Sahel precipitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, all data points are included in wet and dry composites but very wet or dry years contribute more.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

use of re-analysis precipitation and evaporation estimates, due to the large to uncertainties associated with these variables (Supplementary Fig 3)66.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, we found that the moisture budget in the Sahel did not close in the re-analysis data (PEDIV), stressing the limitations of diagnostic variables relating to the hydrological cycle in re-analysis products and the utility

resample and shuffle the resulting ensemble mean timeseries using block bootstrapping with a length of 4 years, being careful to account for irregular hindcast start times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding observational data points are reshuffled in the same way.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Step 3: we compute the correlation between the re-shuffled ensemble mean and observational time series.
