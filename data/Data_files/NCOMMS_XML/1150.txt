Enantioselective decarboxylative chlorination of -ketocarboxylic acids  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Stereoselective halogenation is a highly useful organic transformation for multistep syntheses because the resulting chiral organohalides can serve as precursors for various medicinally relevant derivatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though decarboxylative halogenation of aliphatic carboxylic acids is a useful and fundamental synthetic method for the preparation of a variety of organohalides, an enantioselective version of this reaction has not been reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report a highly enantioselective decarboxylative chlorination of -ketocarboxylic acids to obtain -chloroketones under mild organocatalytic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present method is also applicable for the enantioselective synthesis of tertiary -chloroketones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conversions of the resulting -chloroketones into -aminoketones and -thio-substituted ketones via SN2 reactions at the tertiary carbon centres are also demonstrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results constitute an efficient approach for the synthesis of chiral organohalides and are expected to enhance the availability of enantiomerically enriched chiral compounds with heteroatom-substituted chiral stereogenic centres.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Organohalides are a fundamentally important class of compounds not only because the carbon-halogen bond is found in many biologically active compounds but also because a broad range of pharmaceutical and agrochemical agents are synthesized from organohalides, owing to the good leaving ability of halogen atoms1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chiral halides are especially attractive building blocks because following the enantioselective introduction of the halogen atom onto a chiral carbon atom, subsequent substitution of the halogen atom via an SN2 reaction, for example, generates a variety of chiral compounds with retained enantiopurity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decarboxylative halogenation of aliphatic carboxylic acids is a useful organic transformation that directly replaces carboxyl groups with halogen atoms (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon the initial discovery of this reaction by Borodine4 and Hunsdiecker and Hunsdiecker5, the transformation required the use of stoichiometric quantities of expensive transition metals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of improved methods, including the catalytic activation of carboxylic acids, have been developed over the past few decades6,7,8,9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in 1997, Chowdhury and Roy6 reported the first example of a catalytic decarboxylative halogenation reaction using lithium acetate as the catalyst, but this route was applicable only for cinnamic acid derivatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, in 2012, Li and colleagues developed a catalytic method for the decarboxylative chlorination and fluorination of general carboxylic acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The visible-light-promoted decarboxylative halogenation has recently attracted much attention as a mild method to create carbonhalogen bonds9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2014, Sammis and Paquin initially revealed the visible-light-mediated decarboxylative fluorination of 2-aryloxyacetic acids in the presence of a Ru(II) photoredox catalyst9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, MacMillan and colleagues succeeded in expanding the substrate scope of this reaction to a wide range of aliphatic carboxylic acids10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As these decarboxylative halogenation reactions can efficiently produce highly substituted alkyl halides, it was expected that an enantioselective version could be developed by employing a chiral catalyst in the reaction (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to the best of our knowledge, this reaction has not been successfully adapted for asymmetric synthesis even though it was initially discovered over a century and a half ago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, we considered the unique reactivity of -oxocarboxylic acids, which have an additional carbonyl functionality at the -position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As these carboxylic acids serve as an enolate equivalent involving the decarboxylation, mediation of decarboxylation step by a chiral catalyst is expected to result in reaction of the formal enolate with electrophiles in an enantioselective manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus several groups have reported the enantioselective decarboxylative aldol-type reactions and 1,4-addition reactions of -oxocarboxylic acids13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An elegant example has recently been reported by Saadi and Wennemers14, in which decarboxylative aldol reactions of -fluorinated malonic acid half thioesters and aldehydes yield the corresponding adducts in high diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity in the presence of a chiral amine catalyst.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inspired by these previous studies, we envisaged that an enantioselective decarboxylative chlorination could be achieved by the chiral amine-mediated formation of enolates from racemic -ketocarboxylic acids and subsequent electrophilic chlorination to yield enantiomerically enriched -chloroketones via the ionic reaction pathway (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method would therefore be useful as an alternative to the direct -chlorination of ketones for the synthesis of chiral -chloroketones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, although the development of methods for the enantioselective -halogenation of carbonyl compounds has progressed rapidly in the past decade15,16 since Hintermann and Togni17 reported pioneering studies on the enantioselective halogenation of active methine compounds, only a single catalytic method has been reported for the enantioselective chlorination of unactivated ketones18, and to the best of our knowledge, no catalytic method is available for asymmetrical ketones19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show a highly enantioselective decarboxylative chlorination of -ketocarboxylic acids to obtain -chloroketones with a chiral primary amine catalyst.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SN2 reactions of the resulting -chloroketones at a tertiry carbon are also described20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Decarboxylative halogenation of aliphatic carboxylic acids and development of an enantioselective reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a)

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Reaction optimization', 'Our synthetic study began with the preparation of -ketocarboxylic acid 1a as the starting material for the subsequent decarboxylative chlorination using known chiral amine catalysts, such as cinchona alkaloid derivatives and diarylprolinol derivatives (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, although the desired -chloroketone 2a was obtained in good yield, the resulting enantioselectivity was poor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also examined the reaction with a chiral Lewis acid catalyst prepared from a spiro pyridyl monooxazoline ligand L1 and copper(II) trifluoromethanesulfonate because it is known to catalyse electrophilic halogenation of -ketoesters with high enantioselectivity22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the decarboxylative chlorination of 1a using this catalyst also proceeded with poor enantioselectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, we have reported the synthesis of a 1,1-binaphthyl-based chiral amino ester C1 and successfully applied it for enantioselective fluorination of -branched aldehydes25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fortunately, the use of C1 catalyst in the decarboxylative chlorination of 1a to give 2a was highly enantioselective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of similar amino esters with smaller substituents on the 3,3 position of the binaphthyl backbone significantly decreased the enantioselectivity of the reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following optimization of the reaction conditions, we found that the highest enantioselectivity was obtained using toluene as the solvent with N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS) as the chlorinating reagent (Supplementary Table 1, entries 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction was highly enantioselective even with a lower catalyst loading, even though the reaction rate significantly decreased when 5 or 2.5 mol% of the catalyst was used (Supplementary Table 1, entries 6 and 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the reaction could be carried out with high enantioselectivity even in the presence of an additional aliphatic carboxylic acid (cyclohexane carboxylic acid) although the yield was slightly decreased (Supplementary Table 1, entry 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Screening of chiral catalysts for enantioselective decarboxylative chlorination.-Ketocarboxylic acids were treated with NCS (3.0 equiv.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in the presence of chiral catalyst (30 mol%) and the mixture was stirred for 24 h in the dark, unless otherwise noted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reactions with C5 and C6 were carried out for 3 h while the reaction with C8 was carried out for 1 h. The reaction using the complex of Cu(OSO2CF3)2 (10 mol%) and L1 (12 mol%) (Cu(OSO2CF3)2/L1) was performed in the presence of MS 4 A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cases, the yield of 2a corresponds to the isolated yield of the purified compound, and the e.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  for each compound was determined by chiral high-performance liquid chromatography (Et=ethyl group, tBu=tert-butyl group).Full size image', 'Substrate scope', 'With the optimized conditions in hand, a range of -ketocarboxylic acids were subjected to enantioselective decarboxylative chlorination to yield the corresponding -chloroketones in good-to-excellent enantioselectivities (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A particularly high asymmetric induction was observed in the reaction of tetralone-derived -ketocarboxylic acids 1a1e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction tolerated the presence of nitrile, allylic and benzylic moieties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, this method was applicable not only to the synthesis of tertiary -chloroketones but also to the preparation of secondary -chloroketones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the latter case, a preliminary experiment yielded significant amounts of the undesired ,-dichloroketones 3 (Supplementary Table 2, entry 1), likely due to chlorination of the -monoalkyl--ketocarboxylic acids and subsequent decarboxylative chlorination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, generation of 3 could be suppressed to  less_than 5% yield through the slow addition of NCS during the reaction, to afford the desired product in good yield and high enantioselectivity (Supplementary Table 2, entry 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Substituents on the benzoyl moiety of 1k slightly diminished the enantioselectivity of the reaction and the cyclic -monoalkyl--ketocarboxylic acid 1s resulted in the corresponding product 2s with moderate enantioselectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absolute configurations of products 2a and 2k were confirmed to be S and R, respectively, by single crystal X-ray analysis of 2a and comparison with the specific rotation of a derivative of 2k with the reported value (see Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Scope of the catalytic enantioselective decarboxylative chlorination of -ketocarboxylic acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) -Ketocarboxylic acids were treated with NCS (1.21.5 equiv.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in the presence of catalyst C1 (10 mol%) and the mixture was stirred according to the conditions indicated in the figure in the dark.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cases, the yield of 2 corresponds to the isolated yield of the purified compound, and the e.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  for each compound was determined by chiral high-performance liquid chromatography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Enantioselective decarboxylative chlorination of ,-dialkyl--ketocarboxylic acids (Me=methyl group, Ph=phenyl group).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Enantioselective decarboxylative chlorination of -monoalkyl--ketocarboxylic acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the reaction, a solution of NCS in toluene was added slowly to a stirred solution of C1 and 1 in toluene over 1 h (0.5 h for the synthesis of 2r) using a syringe pump.Full size image', 'Reaction mechanism', 'As shown in Fig 4, we propose that the reaction proceeds via the base-mediated decarboxylation and subsequent chlorination of the resulting enolate (or enol) intermediate 4 (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As no protonated products were observed, it appeared that chlorination of the enolate proceeded more rapidly than the competitive protonation to yield simple ketones 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, an alternative reaction mechanism could involve an initial decarboxylative protonation to afford the corresponding ketone 5, followed by amine-catalysed chlorination to yield -chloroketones via the formation of enamine intermediate 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To discard the latter mechanism, we confirmed that ketone 5a did not react with NCS in the presence of C1 (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction also failed upon the addition of 1 equiv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of cyclohexane carboxylic acid (c-Hex-CO2H) as a Brønsted acid source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was also found that the primary amine moiety of catalyst C1 was chlorinated to give C1 in 68% yield during the course of the reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C1 could be isolated by silica gel column chromatography along with 24% of C1 (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we confirmed whether or not C1 works as the chlorination reagent or catalyst in the reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enantioselective decarboxylative chlorination of 1a with C1 instead of NCS as the chlorinating reagent gave 2a in only 5% yield with poor enantioselectivity (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction without either NCS or C1 afforded the protonated product 5a in 78% yield with 64% enantiomeric excess (e.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ; Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that NCS could chlorinate the enolate intermediate in the reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the chlorinated amine C1 was used as the catalyst instead of C1, the reaction afforded 2a with decreased enantioselectivity in lower yield (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it was found that C1 is also an active catalyst in the reaction, it is assumed that the reaction was mainly catalysed by C1 under the optimized conditions due to the lower concentration of C1 in the reaction mixture and its lower catalytic activity than C1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also confirmed that the reaction of 5a with C1 as the catalyst or chlorination reagent does not proceed at all (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Proposed reaction pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) A general mechanistic scheme for the decarboxylative chlorination of -ketocarboxylic acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Neither C1 nor C1 mediated the chlorination of ketone 5a even in the presence of c-Hex-CO2H (c-Hex=cyclohexyl).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) C1 was chlorinated during the course of decarboxylative chlorination to yield C1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Control experiments to identify the catalytic species and chlorination species.Full size image', 'Derivatization of -chloroketones', 'We then explored the synthetic utility of these -chloroketones 2 to demonstrate the applicability of our novel process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recently revealed that the SN2 reaction of -chloro--ketoesters proceeds smoothly to give the corresponding -heteroatom-substituted--ketoesters with retained enantiopurity, despite the reaction taking place at a tertiary carbon atom23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Encouraged by this result, we examined the nucleophilic substitution of -chloroketone 2a (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the reaction with NaN3 proceeded smoothly to yield the corresponding -azidoketone 7 in good yield without loss of enantiopurity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compound 7 was then further converted into protected primary amine 8 under hydrogenolysis conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, 2a was converted into -sulfenylketones 9a and 9b in a stereospecific manner by treatment with the corresponding sodium thiolates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These smooth SN2 reactions were assumed to be facilitated by a carbonyl function adjacent to the reaction centre26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed that the absolute configuration of 9a was inverted from that of 2a by single crystal X-ray analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result strongly suggested that these nucleophilic substitutions proceeded in an SN2 fashion with a Walden inversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although -aminoketones and -thio-substituted ketones are important molecules in the synthesis of a wide range of biologically relevant compounds, few catalytic methods for the enantioselective -amination27,28,29 or -sulfenylation30 of unactivated tertiary ketones are currently available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our proposed method would constitute an efficient alternative to direct amination or sulfenylation procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we applied our novel method for the natural product synthesis (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -Chloroketone 2k was initially converted into azide 10 by an SN2 reaction with NaN3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent hydrogenolysis of 10 accomplished the asymmetric synthesis of the N-carbamate-protected Cathinone 11 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31), which is a biologically active natural product that acts as a central nervous system stimulant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enantiomeric purity of 11 was improved to be 94% e.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  after a single recrystallization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Stereospecific derivatization of -chloroketones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) SN2 reaction of 2a with either sodium azide or sodium thiolates as the nucleophiles (DMSO=dimethyl sulfoxide, EtOAc=ethyl acetate, Boc=tert-butoxycarbonyl group).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Enantioselective synthesis of the N-protected Cathinone (DMF=N,N-dimethylformamide).Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'This work describes the highly enantioselective decarboxylative halogenation of carboxylic acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this reaction, a chiral primary amine exhibiting an axial chiral 1,1-binaphthyl backbone efficiently catalysed the decarboxylative chlorination of -ketocarboxylic acids under mild organocatalytic conditions in high enantioselectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting -chloroketones acted as synthetic intermediates in the preparation of -aminoketones and -thio-substituted ketones via SN2 reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our method therefore constitutes an efficient approach to the simple preparation of multiple optically active compounds from a single intermediate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore expect that this method will allow the synthesis of a wide variety of enantiomerically enriched -heteroatom-substituted ketones and will be applicable in the preparation of novel pharmaceutical compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies into the application of this method to enantioselective fluorination reactions and to reactions with other types of aliphatic carboxylic acids bearing electron-withdrawing substituents are ongoing.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
