Whole-brain 3D mapping of human neural transplant innervation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'While transplantation represents a key tool for assessing in vivo functionality of neural stem cells and their suitability for neural repair, little is known about the integration of grafted neurons into the host brain circuitry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rabies virus-based retrograde tracing has developed into a powerful approach for visualizing synaptically connected neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we combine this technique with light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) to visualize transplanted cells and connected host neurons in whole-mouse brain preparations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined with co-registration of high-precision three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (3D MRI) reference data sets, this approach enables precise anatomical allocation of the host input neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data show that the same neural donor cell population grafted into different brain regions receives highly orthotopic input.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicate that transplant connectivity is largely dictated by the circuitry of the target region and depict rabies-based transsynaptic tracing and LSFM as efficient tools for comprehensive assessment of hostdonor cell innervation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Transplantation of cells into the central nervous system has developed into a major avenue for replacing neurons lost to neurodegenerative disease1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The suitability of neural transplants for restoring or modulating neuronal function critically depends on the ability of donor cells to engage in synaptic interaction with the host brain circuitry, and appropriate model systems are required to assess this integration process in a preclinical scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conventional electrophysiological methods such as patch clamp analysis are limited in that they require tedious identification of pairs of connected cells, which restricts their applicability to small numbers of neurons per brain3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While optical methods such as calcium imaging or voltage-sensitive reporters can extend resolution to entire neuronal ensembles, they require close proximity between the recording device and the recorded cells, for example, via prior sectioning of the tissue or direct access to localized brain regions through cranial windows4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a comprehensive assessment of transplant integration should ideally enable coverage of all transplanted cells and host connection partners throughout the recipient brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Rabies virus (RABV)-based systems exploit the property of this virus to undergo retrograde transsynaptic transport6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetically modified RABV variants carrying fluorescence reporter genes have been used successfully to visualize synaptically connected neurons7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, optical tissue clearing methods in combination with light sheet microscopy have emerged as highly useful techniques for microscopic analysis of tissue fragments and even entire organs without the need for mechanical sectioning8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we set out to design an approach combining RABV-based transsynaptic tracing, tissue clearing, light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) co-registration to enable qualitative and quantitative assessment of human transplant innervation in the context of an entire mouse brain.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Transsynaptic tracing of graft innervation', 'To trace synaptic innervation of human neurons in a mouse background, we employed long-term self-renewing neuroepithelial stem cells (lt-NES cells) derived from human embryonic stem cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lt-NES cells represent a stable neural stem cell population, which can be extensively propagated while maintaining a stable neurogenic potential yielding fully functional neurons both in vitro and following transplantation into the rodent brain16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to their robust proliferation and differentiation potential, lt-NES cells lend themselves particularly well to genetic modification and have been successfully used for lineage tracing, disease modelling and cell-mediated gene transfer18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They exhibit a posterior phenotype with an anterior hindbrain identity, and mostly give rise to GABAergic interneurons as well as glutamatergic neurons, a differentiation pattern maintained after transplantation into neonatal and adult hosts16,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the present study we generated lt-NES cells ubiquitously expressing mRFP1 to label all transplanted cells, and a synapsin promoter-driven combination of the avian TVA receptor, the B19 rabies glycoprotein and a H2B.EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) fusion protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter construct enables infection of the transfected cells by pseudotyped, glycoprotein-deleted RABV, replication of the virus and tracing of infected cells as well as first order synaptically connected neurons (Fig 1)22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lt-NES cells were stereotaxically delivered to the striatum or the hippocampal dentate gyrus of adult unlesioned immunodeficient Rag2/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The immunodeficient host background was chosen in order to enable long-term survival of the transplanted xenogeneic cells23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten weeks later the human graft (Supplementary Fig 1a) was infected by stereotaxic injection of recombinant pseudotyped, glycoprotein-deleted EGFP-expressing RABV (RABVG-EGFP(EnvA))6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were killed 10 days following injection of the virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This 10-day time span is sufficient for replication of the virus in the grafted human cells and its retrograde propagation to afferent neurons24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To enable whole-mount visualization, fixed entire brains were cleared in a benzyl alcohol/benzyl benzoate-based solution (FluoClearBABB) that enables long-term preservation of fluorescent proteins15 and subsequently subjected to LSFM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Experimental procedure for tracing host-graft connectivity.Lt-NES cells were transduced with two lentiviral vectors expressing mRFP1, and an H2B.EGFP fusion protein coupled via 2A peptides to the TVA receptor and the RABV B19 glycoprotein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten weeks after transplantation the grafts were infected with RABVG-EGFP(EnvA), which enables monosynaptic retrograde tracing of afferent host neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parts of the schematic were produced using Servier Medical Art (http://www.servier.com).Full size image', '3D imaging of neural grafts and afferent host neurons', 'Human grafts labelled with mRFP1 were clearly discernible in the two target sites (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EGFP fluorescence revealed a large fraction of double labelled cells reflecting RABVG-EGFP(EnvA)-infected donor neurons (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, numerous EGFP-only-positive cells were detected in the vicinity of the grafts as well as in more remote regions of the recipient brains, indicating retrograde labelling of synaptically connected host neurons projecting onto the transplant-derived neurons (Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, analysis of traced neurons revealed localization of the cells predominantly in orthotopic projection areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice with hippocampal grafts showed numerous EGFP+ cells in the entorhinal cortex and the septum (Fig 2c), that is, two predominant input regions of the hippocampus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EGFP-only-positive neurons were also found inside the hippocampal formation, in particular within the pyramidal cell layer of the CA1 region and the stratum oriens, indicating innervation of the graft by resident hippocampal neurons (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, mice with striatal grafts contained numerous EGFP-only-positive cells with projection neuron morphologies in the cortex, a major input area of the striatum (Fig 2d;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our data demonstrate that RABV-based transsynaptic tracing in combination with LSFM of cleared brain samples and co-registration with MRI reference data enables qualitative and quantitative assessment of the afferent connectome of transplanted human neurons in a single whole-mount specimen with high anatomical and morphological resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a biological point of view, the high degree of orthotopic innervation of lt-NES cell grafts in both hippocampus and striatum is remarkable, in particular since lt-NES cells are known to exhibit a posterior phenotype corresponding to an anterior hindbrain location16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observations are reminiscent to an earlier study, which demonstrated that lt-NES cells grafted into the adult unlesioned hippocampus or cortex develop region-specific efferent projections onto orthotopic host brain targets21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, the results of these studies suggest that establishment of afferent and efferent connections between host brain and grafted human neural stem cells is largely dictated by the topology of pre-existing, endogenous fibre tracts and circuitries rather than the regional identity of the donor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We expect the experimental system presented here to serve as a useful tool for a number of biomedical applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Striatal transplantation of dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons is intensely pursued as therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Parkinsons and Huntingtons disease, respectively31,32,33, and the approach presented here could enable efficient assessment of different donor cell populations with respect to their ability to integrate synaptically into the host brain circuitry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also anticipate that our system will become useful for studying the phenotype of patient-derived neurons in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since their first description by Shinya Yamanaka34,35, iPS cells have become a major tool for modelling human diseases in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in vitro studies are limited with respect to follow-up time and questions relating to cell-tissue interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The approach reported here could tackle some of these challenges and enable the assessment of synaptic integration of patient-specific iPS cell-derived neurons in an in vivo setting, thereby facilitating mechanistic studies into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As for the latter, transsynaptic spread of disease has become a major topic of research36,37,38, and visualization of synaptic connections onto grafted patient-derived neurons may provide a formidable tool to mechanistically dissect this phenomenon in an experimental in vivo scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, our system might also be helpful for benchmarking the synaptic integration potential of novel synthetic cell sources such as neural precursors and neurons generated by direct transcription factor-based cell fate conversion39,40,41,42.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
