A somatic piRNA pathway in the Drosophila fat body ensures metabolic homeostasis and normal lifespan  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In gonadal tissues, the Piwi-interacting (piRNA) pathway preserves genomic integrity by employing 2329 nucleotide (nt) small RNAs complexed with argonaute proteins to suppress parasitic mobile sequences of DNA called transposable elements (TEs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although recent evidence suggests that the piRNA pathway may be present in select somatic cells outside the gonads, the role of a non-gonadal somatic piRNA pathway is not well characterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report a functional somatic piRNA pathway in the adult Drosophila fat body including the presence of the piRNA effector protein Piwi and canonical 2329 nt long TE-mapping piRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The piwi mutants exhibit depletion of fat body piRNAs, increased TE mobilization, increased levels of DNA damage and reduced lipid stores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mutants are starvation sensitive, immunologically compromised and short-lived, all phenotypes associated with compromised fat body function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings demonstrate the presence of a functional non-gonadal somatic piRNA pathway in the adult fat body that affects normal metabolism and overall organismal health.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Transposable elements (TEs) parasitize the DNA of their hosts and account for a large portion of eukaryotic genomes1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To combat the invasion and expansion of TEs, small RNA (smRNA) silencing pathways have evolved to suppress TEs across species from plants to humans3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The short interfering RNA pathway suppresses TEs in all tissues of plants and animals, whereas the activity of the Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway is thought to be primarily restricted to the gonads of metazoans4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss or decline of these pathways results in genomic instability and cellular dysfunction caused by TE reactivation and transposition6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The piRNA pathway is best known for its role in gonadal tissues where it protects against genomic damage caused by TE reactivation4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pathway silences TEs by employing complementary small RNAs called piRNAs, generated from large TE-rich genomic regions called piRNA clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In flies, these clusters transcribe long single-stranded RNA precursors that are then further processed into smaller 2329 nucleotide (nt) piRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These piRNAs partner with argonaute effector proteins (Piwi, Aubergine or AGO3) that are then able to silence TEs via their homology to TE transcripts4,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process is accomplished by one of two silencing mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the primary piRNA pathway, active in both the germline and ovarian somatic follicle cells, Piwi represses TE transcription by establishing heterochromatin5,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the secondary piRNA pathway, active only in the germline, Aubergine and AGO3 silence TEs post transcriptionally in the cytoplasm via messenger RNA cleavage4,5,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the role of the piRNA pathway was previously thought to be restricted to the gonads, recent evidence in a diversity of organisms suggests that this pathway may also be present in somatic cells outside of the gonad12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Over the past decade, new evidence has begun to reveal non-gonadal examples of the piRNA pathway including a role for the piRNA pathway in stem cell function12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In planaria, piRNA pathway proteins are essential in maintaining stem cell pluripotency as well as the regenerative capacity of these animals13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  piRNA pathway components are active in multiple types of cancer12, including specific cancers in mammals and flies12,14,15,16,17,18, and in flies piwi has been shown to contribute to malignant tumour growth19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Less information is available for a role of the piRNA pathway in normal differentiated somatic tissues, although evidence for the activity of the secondary piRNA pathway in specific neurons of the adult fly brain has been reported20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As more non-gonadal examples of an active RNA interference system are discovered, it appears that the piRNA pathway may have other important roles beyond its known functions in gonadal tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we show the presence of a functional somatic piRNA pathway in the adult fly fat body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The piRNA pathway in the fat body exhibits all the canonical characteristics of a primary piRNA pathway and actively suppresses TE mobilization in this tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe that loss of this pathway correlates with compromised fat body function and shortened lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings demonstrate a novel role for the piRNA pathway outside of the gonads in a fully differentiated somatic tissue.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The fat body exhibits components of an intact piRNA pathway', 'Given the recent evidence that the piRNA pathway may also be active in select non-gonadal somatic cells12, we examined the expression of piRNA pathway genes outside of the gonads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that examination of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries from adult fly eviscerated abdomen, but not heads or thorax, had significant enrichment of piRNA pathway genes relative to other somatic body segments (Fig 1a, Supplementary Fig 1, and Supplementary Dataset 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunofluorescent microscopy demonstrated specific localization of the Piwi protein to the nuclei of adult abdominal and pericerebral fat body cells, but not to nuclei of cells from other tissues outside of the gonads or in fat bodies of homozygous piwi null mutants (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoblotting of isolated purified fat body, thorax and head also demonstrated the presence of Piwi protein in the fat body (Fig 1c and Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of Piwi protein in the fat body suggests the possibility of an intact piRNA pathway in this tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Canonical signatures of a piRNA pathway in the adult fly fat body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Expression of primary and secondary piRNA pathway genes generated from total RNA-seq libraries of head, thorax, eviscerated abdomen and ovary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  piRNA pathway genes are more highly expressed in the eviscerated abdomen than in the head or thorax.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data values for ovary libraries that exceed the range of the plot are shown above each relevant bar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RPKM, reads per kilobase per million.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars represent s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ; n=3 replicate libraries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparing the eviscerated abdomen with head and thorax controls, 10 of 11 genes (excluding tj) are statistically significant (P less_than 0.0001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Supplementary Dataset 1 for statistics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Piwi protein localizes to the nuclei of abdominal fat body cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DAPI labels fat body nuclei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Staining in the membrane is autofluorescence typical of fat body cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars represent 20 m.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Here we have shown evidence for a fully functional piRNA pathway in a non-gonadal somatic tissue, the adult fly fat body, that is likely to be necessary for proper tissue function and overall organismal health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that the adult fat body piRNA pathway exhibits canonical characteristics found in gonadal somatic cells, and its activity likely positively affects the function of a tissue important to metabolic homeostasis and physiological health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we are not able to entirely rule out a contribution of the gonadal piRNA pathway to fat body function, many of the phenotypes we observe are opposite to those typically seen in animals with compromised gonadal tissue function and therefore likely represent the effect of a loss of the fat body piRNA pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the shortened lifespan and reduced lipid stores in piRNA pathway mutants demonstrates that the piRNA pathway is essential in the health and functioning of non-gonadal somatic tissues, as reduction or ablation of gonadal function in flies often extends lifespan and increases lipid stores rather than decreasing lifespan and fat storage31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies in wild-type flies have also demonstrated an important link between TE activity and longevity9, and our studies demonstrating partial rescue of the shortened lifespan in flamenco mutants upon administration of a reverse transcription inhibitor further support this association.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interest in a function for the piRNA pathway in the soma has increased recently as new roles for this pathway are being illuminated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The piRNA pathways association with tissues that maintain a degree of immortalization similar to that exhibited in the germline is of particular interest12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the somatic stem cell niches of Hydra maintain an active piRNA pathway that represses TEs, possibly contributing to this organisms remarkably long lifespan33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies, together with our findings, suggest that the presence of a piRNA pathway in normal somatic tissues may offer an additional cellular defence against TE reactivation and possible somatic genomic damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding of a role for the piRNA pathway in preserving metabolic homeostasis and the overall health of the fly suggests the potential importance of the piRNA pathway in other somatic tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, interventions specifically augmenting the piRNA pathway may provide significant benefits to maintaining genomic integrity, tissue function and healthy lifespan.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
