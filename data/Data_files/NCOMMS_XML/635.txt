Sensing surface mechanical deformation using active probes driven by motor proteins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Studying mechanical deformation at the surface of soft materials has been challenging due to the difficulty in separating surface deformation from the bulk elasticity of the materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we introduce a new approach for studying the surface mechanical deformation of a soft material by utilizing a large number of self-propelled microprobes driven by motor proteins on the surface of the material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Information about the surface mechanical deformation of the soft material is obtained through changes in mobility of the microprobes wandering across the surface of the soft material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The active microprobes respond to mechanical deformation of the surface and readily change their velocity and direction depending on the extent and mode of surface deformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This highly parallel and reliable method of sensing mechanical deformation at the surface of soft materials is expected to find applications that explore surface mechanics of soft materials and consequently would greatly benefit the surface science.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The self-propelled micromotors offer great potential for diverse practical applications, including targeted drug delivery, bio-imaging and monitoring of surroundings1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Probing surrounding environment using a large number of active probes provides robust sensing and monitoring, as well as high spatial resolution and acquisition rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the self-propelled micromotors, motor protein systems, for example, actin/myosin9, microtubule/kinesin10 and microtubule/dynein11, offer unique features which are particularly suitable for sensing and monitoring11,12,13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an in vitro gliding assay, cytoskeletal filaments (for example, microtubules or actin filaments) are propelled by their associated motor proteins (for example, kinesin, dynein or myosin), which are adhered to a substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the propulsion, the free end of the leading tip of a gliding cytoskeletal filament undergo thermal fluctuations until it binds to a motor protein; the remaining part of the filament is anchored to the other motor proteins17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This anchored search-and-catch mechanism provides a potential means for sensing the local environment of a submicrometer region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, motor protein systems have been employed as active probes to examine the topographical features and chemical properties of a surface12,13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we pursue the potential of utilizing gliding cytoskeletal filaments as active probes, and extend the concept for sensing mechanical stress at the surface of a soft material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescently labelled microtubules are propelled by kinesins adhered to the surface of a stretchable substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The response of the gliding microtubules to mechanical deformation of the substrate is monitored using fluorescence microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gliding velocity of the microtubules is found tightly correlated to the extension or compression of the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding enables measurements of the extension or compression of the substrate through measurements of gliding velocity of the microtubules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The randomly wandering microtubules become oriented depending on the direction of deformation of the substrate, enabling us to determine the direction of the stress field experienced by the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work introduces a new concept for characterizing surface mechanical deformation of soft materials by employing motor protein-driven cytoskeletal filaments, and at the same time offers valuable insights in the dynamic behaviour of motor protein systems under mechanical stress.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'In vitro gliding assay on a stretchable substrate', 'The in vitro gliding assay of microtubules was performed on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) which is a soft and stretchable elastomeric material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A stretch chamber equipped with a computer-controlled stepping motor was developed to stretch the substrate of the in vitro gliding assay (Fig 1a; Supplementary Fig 1)18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A sheet of PDMS was fixed horizontally at the movable stretcher of the stretch chamber (Fig 1a; Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anti-GFP antibodies were deposited on the PDMS surface; then, green fluorescent protein fused kinesin-1 (GFP-kinesin) motor proteins were applied to the PDMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, paclitaxel-stabilized fluorescent dye-labelled microtubules were deposited on the kinesin-coated PDMS surface, and these microtubules worked as active probes (Fig 1a; Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the sample preparation, the stretch chamber was closed, and humid nitrogen gas was kept passing through the chamber to remove oxygen from the chamber, which allowed performing the in vitro gliding assay of the active probes on the PDMS surface in an inert atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inert atmosphere prevents oxidative damage of microtubules and kinesins and thereby can significantly prolong the lifetime of the gliding assay20 (Supplementary Note 1; Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the gliding assay of the active probes was initiated by adding adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the assay system (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Elongation and compression of the gliding assay substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic diagram showing the design of the stretch chamber and the in vitro gliding assay system of active probes (microtubules) on an elastic substrate polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Representative fluorescence microscopy image of gliding active probes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tensile or compressive strain was applied to the PDMS substrate along the x axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  is the angle between the track of the front end of the active probe (yellow arrow) and the stretch axis (red arrow) (range of  is from 0° to 360°);

then, the substrate was compressed back to its initial length at the same strain rate (note: in this work the term strain indicates the strain applied to the PDMS substrate (Fig 1c)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The velocity of the active probes increased by the elongation of the substrate and decreased by the compression of the substrate (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highest velocity of the active probes (300±6.0 nm s1) was observed at the strain of =130%, and this value was larger than twice the initial velocity (140±4.0 nm s1) observed in the absence of applied strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The velocity of the active probes decreased by the compression of the substrate, finally reached to the initial velocity observed in the absence of applied strain to the substrate and remained unchanged over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus changing the mode of deformation of the substrate it is possible to reversibly regulate the velocity of the active probes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also investigated the repeatability of the reversible regulation of velocity of the probes by applying tension and subsequent compression at the substrate in a cyclic manner, and found that the velocity of the active probes can be regulated repeatedly by using the stretch chamber (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Change of the velocity of probes upon substrate deformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Time course of the active probe velocity after elongation and compression of the gliding assay substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Reversible changes in the active probe velocity after the repeated application of tensile and compressive stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gliding assay substrate was elongated and compressed at a strain rate of 0.6% s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Standard curve showing the relationship between the stretching strain and the velocity of active probes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bar: s.e.Full size image', 'To understand the origin of the velocity change of active probes upon deformation of the gliding assay substrate, we monitored the fluorescence intensity of GFP-kinesins on the substrate during this process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that as the tensile strain at the substrate increased, the fluorescence intensity of GFP-kinesins gradually decreased, whereas the velocity of the active probes increased (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the fluorescence intensity depends on the kinesin density on the substrate surface, at this stage it seems that the change in velocity of the active probes is correlated to the kinesin density on the substrate surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm the relationship between the velocity of the active probes and the kinesin surface density, we performed in vitro gliding assays on PDMS substrate by varying the concentration of GFP-kinesin solution fed into the gliding assay system and measured the velocity of the active probes and fluorescence intensity of GFP-kinesins for each case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), we estimated kinesin density on the PDMS surface for each of the kinesin concentrations fed into the gliding assay system18,19, which was finally correlated to the measured fluorescent intensity of GFP-kinesins (Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this estimation, we prepared a standard curve that correlated the velocity of the active probes with the GFP-kinesin surface density (Supplementary Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The velocity of the active probes was strongly dependent on the kinesin density on PDMS surface and increased sharply when the kinesin density was increased from 70 to 112 m2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highest velocity of the active probes (410±4.0 nm s1) was observed at a kinesin density of 112 m2; the velocity gradually decreased as the kinesin density was increased further.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This velocity was higher than twice the velocity of the active probes (190±3.0 nm s1) obtained at the highest kinesin density employed in this work (560 m2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This change in the active probe velocity in response to the change in kinesin density corresponds well with the results of previous reports21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, using the standard curve shown in Supplementary Fig 3a and the values of the fluorescence intensity of GFP-kinesins at different strains at the gliding assay substrate, we estimated the kinesin density on the substrate surface at different strains (Supplementary Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The change in the active probe velocity under applied stress correlated well with the change in the kinesin density on the gliding assay substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be mentioned that, the change in surface hydrophobicity, which may affect the protein mobility23,24, was not observed upon stretching of PDMS25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the change in velocity of active probes on elongation and compression of the gliding assay substrate is due to the change in the density of kinesin on the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, since smoothness of the movement of active probes is a factor for the precise measurement, we also evaluated the smoothness of the movement of active probes in terms of motional diffusion and found that there was no considerable difference in the smoothness of movement of active probes after elongation and compression of the gliding assay substrate (see Supplementary Note 2; Supplementary Figs 4 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Effect of substrate deformation on the direction of probes', 'We investigated the effect of elongation and compression of the gliding assay substrate on the direction of movement of the active probes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially, in the absence of any applied stress, the active probes moved randomly without showing any preferred direction (Fig 3a, left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the substrate was elongated or compressed, the direction of movement of the active probes changed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a strain of =130%, the active probes were aligned parallel to the direction of stretching axis during substrate elongation and perpendicular to the stretching axis during compression (Fig 3a middle, right; Supplementary Movies 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the orientation behaviour of the active probes, we measured the orientation angle of the active probes,  (range of  is from 0° to 360°; Fig 1b), which is the angle between the track of the leading end of active probes and the stretch axis within 10 s, and we plotted the orientation angle on a circular histogram (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially, the orientation angle of the active probes was dispersed around the circular histogram (Fig 3b, left), but the active probes adopted an angle corresponding to the parallel or perpendicular orientation relative to the stretch axis after the substrate was elongated or compressed, respectively (Fig 3b middle, right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we evaluated the degree of orientation of the active probes by measuring the nematic order parameter, S which is defined as', 'Figure 3: Change of the direction of probes upon substrate deformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Fluorescence microscopy images showing orientation of active probes at different substrate conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The active probes moved randomly on the gliding assay substrate before the substrate deformation (left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The active probes were oriented parallel (middle) and perpendicular (right) to the direction of substrate elongation and compression, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both the elongation and compression, 130% strain was applied to the substrate at the strain rate of 0.6% s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 10 m.

For elongation and compression of the substrate,  were calculated as elongation=25.6 s and compression=48.9 s, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A difference in the relaxation time for elongation and compression is observed where the major effect is due to the difference in velocity and fluctuation or detachment of the probes, while other factors such as rigidity of the probes were found negligible (Supplementary Note 2; Supplementary Figs 68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the alignment of the active probes along the stretching axis, as discussed above, one may suppose that the probes prefer areas with lower kinesin density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand whether kinesin density has any influence on the alignment of the probes, or in other words, the probes preferentially move depending on gradient in kinesin density, we took into consideration the number of kinesins bound to a single probe after stretching the substrate (130% strain).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in the number of kinesin bound to a single probe aligned along the parallel and perpendicular direction to the stretching axis is found quite negligible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, no significant difference was observed in the velocity of the probes at different directions before and after stretching of the gliding assay substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus the preferential alignment of the probes upon stretching or compression of gliding assay substrate seems not to be related to the change in kinesin density or heterogeneity of kinesin density (Supplementary Note 2; Supplementary Figs 9 and 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Next, we evaluated the effect of stretching strain and strain rate on the alignment of the active probes in terms of the S. We found that randomly moving active probes started to align as the stretching or compressive strain was increased (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the stretching or compressive was increased to =130%, most of the active probes assumed a parallel or perpendicular orientation respectively relative to the stress axis (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a fixed strain of =130%, we then investigated the effect of the stretching and compression rate on the orientation of the active probes by varying the strain rate over one order of magnitude, for example, from 0.6 to 30.0% s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strain rate had no effect on the S within the range studied, where the S was measured just after stopping elongation or compression of the substrate (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is the strain, not the strain rate, which played the key role in the orientation of the active probes upon elongation or compression of the gliding assay substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Buckling of non-motile probes upon substrate compression', 'To elucidate the orientation mechanism of the active probes under deformation of the gliding assay substrate we performed a control experiment where the probes were immobilized to the substrate in the absence of ATP, and tensile and compressive stress were applied to the substrate at a strain of =130%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the substrate was elongated (x axis was the stretch axis), the non-motile probes which had been directed towards the y axis of the substrate, formed a buckled structure (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But when the substrate was compressed (x axis was the compression axis), the probes that had been directed toward the x axis showed buckled structure (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The buckling of the non-motile probes could be accounted for in the light of our recent report where we revealed how compressive stress at the substrate resulted in buckling of the non-motile probes19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The buckling of the non-motile probes observed in the present work is the result of compressive stress at the probes that originated from contraction of the substrate; the probes underwent buckling whenever they were subjected to compressive stress due to compression of the substrate irrespective of the mode of deformation of the substrate by the applied stress (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probes are sensitive to compressive stress along their longitudinal axis because the probes are one dimensional (aspect ratio103).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As reported in our recent work, compressive stress induced buckling of the probes is accompanied by a simultaneous accumulation of bending energy19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It could be assumed that in the presence of ATP, the moving active probes also underwent the compressive stress induced buckling and changed their moving direction, thereby minimizing the accumulated bending energy (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it was difficult to experimentally confirm the effect of bending on the orientation or change in moving direction of the active probes because of the difficulty in monitoring the active probes during elongation and compression of the gliding assay substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Buckling of non-motile probes upon compression of substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Fluorescence microscopy images of buckled probes which were immobilized to the substrate due to the absence of ATP in the gliding assay system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During elongation of the substrate along the x axis, the probes which were aligned perpendicular to the stretch axis underwent buckling due to compression of the substrate along the y axis (left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, during compression of the substrate along the x axis, the probes that were parallel to the stretch axis underwent buckling by the compressive stress along the x axis (right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 20 m.

As reported in literature, a kinesin moves along a microtubule over a so called run length of 500 nm and detach from the microtubule29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking into account a translational speed of kinesins of 200 nm s1 (as described above), a kinesin motor remains attached to a microtubule for 2.5 s. On the other hand, our recent work19 showed that the critical buckling strain, that is, the minimum strain required to buckle a microtubule, is 1%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus it is clear that in order to buckle a microtubule, the 1% strain has to reach within 2.5 s. Therefore, the minimum strain rate is estimated to be 0.4% s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This estimated strain rate is smaller than the lowest strain rate investigated in our work (0.6% s1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At present confirmation of the actual minimal strain rate through experimentation is limited by the lowest strain rate that could be applied using the stepping motor used in this work (0.6% s1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Demonstration of sensing surface mechanical deformation', 'We demonstrated the capability of the active probes for sensing surface mechanical deformation of soft materials by visualizing a stress field with a greater complexity than a uniform stress field (Fig 6a); this stress field has been analytically solved30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared the stress field obtained from the analytical solution with that obtained from our experiments, and thus we investigated the validity of our method of sensing surface mechanical deformation of soft materials using active probes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A stress field with a hole (diameter: 1.0 mm) at the centre was visualized on a PDMS substrate (Fig 6a); upon application of the inhomogeneous stress, the active probes would be oriented in accordance with distorted stress directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PDMS substrate with a hole was elongated (=75%, strain rate=0.6% s1) and subsequently compressed to its initial length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the application of the compressive stress, the active probes were oriented radially around the hole (Fig 6ae).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The predicted stress direction calculated from theoretical principal direction (Fig 6f) and the colour map31 which represents the distribution of the orientation angle of the active probes (Fig 6g) revealed that the orientation direction of the active probes well corresponded with the theoretical one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also performed the same experiment using non-motile probes, that is, in the absence of ATP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon deformation of the substrate the non-motile probes did not show any preferential orientation (Fig 6h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the fragmentation and buckling of the probes were observed18,19, which suggests that dynamic condition is required to use microtubules as probes for sensing the mechanical deformation at the surface of a soft material (Supplementary Fig 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we successfully demonstrated the ability of the active probes for sensing surface mechanical deformation by visualizing the stress field of a substrate with a greater complex morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Orientation of the probes in an inhomogeneous stress field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Fluorescence microscopy images showing the orientation of active probes, with respect to the stretch axis indicated by the black arrow, in an inhomogeneous stress field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 500 m.

'By performing the in vitro gliding assay of microtubules on PDMS we demonstrated the use of gliding cytoskeletal filaments as active probes for sensing surface mechanical deformation of soft materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work provides a useful and robust approach with high throughput, and spatiotemporal resolution for characterizing surface mechanical deformation of soft materials by using a large number of active microprobes and a simple microscope-based detection system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If some probes are detached from the surface of soft materials during investigation, other probes are able to detect and fill up the vacancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even if some of the active probes suffer from any defect, there are sufficient probes available to help characterize the surface mechanical deformation without compromising with the accuracy of measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Properties such as the length and rigidity of the probes are also easily tunable32,33 which in turn would widen the application of the probes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with other methods such as speckle pattern measurement34 or photoelasticity measurement of materials35,36, our method allows direct visualization of direction of surface deformation of soft materials by separating it from internal deformation of the materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, since the active probes are always moving, after finishing one set of measurement, they are able to autonomously reset their state, which allows repeating the surface deformation measurement without any hysteresis from the previous measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This methodology is applicable not only for PDMS but also for other soft materials, which was confirmed by replacing the PDMS by polyurethane (PU), a material used to prepare artificial skin and heart valves37,38,39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although PU was previously reported to be harmful for motor proteins at an ambient condition41, we successfully demonstrated the gliding assay of microtubules on the PU using the stretch chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also confirmed that similar to the PDMS, gliding microtubules on the PU substrate can sense the deformation of the PU and preferentially align to an energetically preferable configuration (Supplementary Fig 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the promises, some drawbacks of the proposed methodology are needed to be addressed in future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the presented method is based on the in vitro gliding assay of cytoskeletal filaments and motor proteins which work in aqueous environment under limited conditions such as at a neutral pH, and within a narrow range of temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Denaturation of proteins due to prolonged employment even in these conditions may also hinder the application of our methodology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, our method requires a specialized chamber for ensuring inert atmosphere around the specimen along with a multistep preparation process as described in the experimental section, which is also unavoidable at present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Nowadays, soft materials are gaining much attention in diverse applications for the chemical, biomedical and health care industries; thus, understanding the surface deformation is important to broaden the applications of soft materials42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By providing a new methodology for probing the mechanical deformation at the surface of soft materials, the present work should facilitate further elucidation of the surface science of soft materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, through stretching of the gliding assay substrate, dynamic control of the velocity and movement direction of microtubules was demonstrated without using any micropatterning method44,45,46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This system might be employed to simultaneously control the direction and velocity of gliding cytoskeletal filaments over a wide area to form large-scale groups48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As well as the importance in nanotechnology, use of the stretchable device allows one to have an in situ control of motor protein density, which provided us with a better understanding on the biophysical aspects of dynamic motor protein systems, for example, correlations among the directionality, smoothness and velocity of the gliding microtubules (see Supplementary Information for detail).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
