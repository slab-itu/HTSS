Divergent effects of central melanocortin signalling on fat and sucrose preference in humans  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Melanocortin-4-receptor (MC4R)-expressing neurons modulate food intake and preference in rodents but their role in human food preference is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that compared with lean and weight-matched controls, MC4R deficient individuals exhibited a markedly increased preference for high fat, but a significantly reduced preference for high sucrose food.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These effects mirror those in Mc4r null rodents and provide evidence for a central molecular circuit influencing human macronutrient preference.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Neural circuits involving the hypothalamus, brainstem and mesolimbic system play a pivotal role in the regulation of eating behaviour in response to changes in nutritional state and meal consumption1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary leptin-responsive neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus expressing the anorectic peptide pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) or the orexigen agouti-related peptide (AgRP) project to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus where they synapse with neurons expressing the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) to regulate food intake3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeted disruption of melanocortin signalling in Pomc, Agouti and Mc4r null mice leads to an increase in food consumption and more specifically to increased preference for a high fat diet in food choice experiments5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies in Mc4r/ mice and rodents harbouring a point mutation in Mc4r, suggest that disruption of melanocortin signalling paradoxically reduces consumption of high sucrose solutions and food6,8, an effect that is not seen with the non-nutritive sweetener sucralose, and is not explained by conditioned taste aversion6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, live optical recording of AgRP and POMC neurons in awake mice has revealed direct activation/inhibition of these neurons by a highly palatable diet offered in the energy-deficient state9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While there is considerable data regarding the contribution of central melanocortin signalling to food preference in rodent models, the relevance of these findings to food preference in humans has not been explored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Highly penetrant loss of function MC4R variants in humans are rare (15% of people with severe obesity), but as the phenotype of human MC4R deficiency closely parallels that seen in mice lacking Mc4r10, studies in genetically characterized individuals allow us to directly test whether disruption of melanocortin signalling alters food preference in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested whether MC4R deficient individuals have an altered preference for foods of varying fat and sucrose content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that compared with obese and lean controls, individuals with MC4R mutations show an increased preference for high fat food but a decreased preference for sucrose containing food.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Although common genetic variants in the fatty acid translocase CD36 have been associated with liking of high-fat foods in African Americans12 and common obesity-associated variants have been associated with diary reports of food choices in a number of studies13,14, this is to our knowledge one of the first experimental studies to show a direct association between macronutrient preference (other than alcohol) and a specific genetic/molecular mechanism in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional studies using a forced choice paradigm which makes a direct comparison between fat and sucrose will be needed to test whether disruption of melanocortin signalling primarily alters sucrose or fat sensing or the reward from these stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The potential neural mechanisms involved in fat and sucrose preference have been explored in rodent studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fat preference may in part be mediated by MC4R-expressing neurons in the amygdala where injection of AgRP acutely increases15, whereas the agonist Melanotan-II decreases16, fat consumption in rats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The central nucleus of the amygdala receives and provides projections to the parabrachial nucleus, a region which responds to gustatory and visceral signals, is involved in sucrose preference and is connected to excitatory MC4R-expressing hypothalamic neurons17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have shown that pre-prandial gut hormone levels (total ghrelin, PYY and GLP-1), as well as plasma insulin and glucose are comparable in MC4R deficiency and weight-matched controls20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although postprandial total ghrelin suppression was attenuated in MC4R-deficient individuals compared with lean controls in a previous study22, as this difference emerges 30 min after meal initiation, it is unlikely to contribute to the effects on food preference seen in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The additional experimental flexibility afforded by investigating humans in this study enabled us to dissociate consumption from subjective liking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the increased consumption of high fat food in MC4R deficient individuals did not appear to be related to increased subjective liking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possible explanation is that the motivating effect of high fat content is implicit and non-conscious, consistent with a theoretical distinction between liking and wanting23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a failure to observe an effect on rated (subjective) liking may be an issue of power and/or reflect the choice of scaling method used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'What is the potential physiological relevance of these findings?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In free living (nutritionally replete) humans, food preference is complicated by the fact that sweet foods are often also high fat energy dense foods, thus the choice is rarely between a high fat food and a high sucrose food.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that the preference for energy-dense high-fat foods in animals and humans may represent part of the adaptive response to nutritional deprivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fasting/starvation leads to a fall in leptin levels which triggers physiological and behavioural responses to restore energy homoeostasis24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In keeping with this hypothesis, leptin-deficient ob/ob mice provided with single energy-source diets self-select a higher proportion of energy from high-fat (94%) and a lower proportion from high-carbohydrate food (3%) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Critical to mediating the response to fasting/starvation is an increase in the endogenous MC4R antagonist AgRP, which potently stimulates food intake26, increases fat preference and reduces carbohydrate intake when administered centrally27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the preference for fat (which delivers twice as many calories/gram as carbohydrates or protein and can be readily stored in adipose tissue), at the expense of sugars/carbohydrates may represent an advantageous behaviour that is expressed in the face of nutritional depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies of food preference in the weight reduced/partially-leptin deficient state will be needed to test this hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detailed behavioural study of humans with naturally occurring mutations affecting specific central signalling pathways provides a powerful tool to link contemporary advances in the understanding of the molecular control of energy balance to the biology underpinning food preference in humans.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
