Coarse-grained simulation reveals key features of HIV-1 capsid self-assembly  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The maturation of HIV-1 viral particles is essential for viral infectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During maturation, many copies of the capsid protein (CA) self-assemble into a capsid shell to enclose the viral RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanistic details of the initiation and early stages of capsid assembly remain to be delineated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present coarse-grained simulations of capsid assembly under various conditions, considering not only capsid lattice self-assembly but also the potential disassembly of capsid upon delivery to the cytoplasm of a target cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effects of CA concentration, molecular crowding, and the conformational variability of CA are described, with results indicating that capsid nucleation and growth is a multi-stage process requiring well-defined metastable intermediates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generation of the mature capsid lattice is sensitive to local conditions, with relatively subtle changes in CA concentration and molecular crowding influencing self-assembly and the ensemble of structural morphologies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Significant morphological changes convert an immature virus particle (virion) of HIV-1 into the mature and infectious form1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During maturation, enzymatic cleavage of Gag polypeptide4 releases capsid protein (CA) to self-assemble into a conical lattice structure enclosing the viral RNA (the capsid, Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Failure to generate a suitable capsid precludes infectivity5,6,7,8,9 and so the details of capsid generation are of significant interest as a therapeutic target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: The fullerene cone model of the HIV-1 capsid is assembled from mature-style capsid lattice with hexameric (green) and pentameric (red) building blocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) CA dimer structure with both CG (tube) and all-atom (ribbon) monomer representations (NTDs green and CTDs grey).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CTD dimer interface marked by dashed line;

for example, extensive CG simulations of icosahedral capsid self-assembly have been reported36,37,38,39,40, but the small, well-defined end products are in striking contrast to the structural pleomorphism observed with HIV-1 CA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Non-equilibrium CG simulations featuring irreversible subunit binding can generate capsid-relevant morphologies41,42, but may struggle to represent any dynamic reorganization that might occur at the leading edges of lattice growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CG self-assembly of CA dimers was explored using Monte Carlo43 and MD simulations34 on two-dimensional or quasi-two-dimensional surfaces, and recent work extended Monte Carlo simulations to three-dimensional (3D) systems44 albeit using rigid models that cannot capture the innate NTD/CTD flexibility of the capsid protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this work, we consider the nucleation and growth of CG HIV-1 capsid protein in 3D systems under various conditions relevant to the viral lifecycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we examine the effects of CA concentration and molecular crowding on mature CA lattice generation, the influence of dynamic transitions between populations of CA that are compatible and incompatible with mature lattice formation, and the effects of rapid CA dilution on previously self-assembled CA lattice structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While comparisons to fully assembled HIV-1 capsid structures from experimental data are difficult (our system sizes are restricted by computational expense), and hence caution is warranted when considering large-scale structural assemblies, the early stages of nucleation and growth for capsid protein lattice are accessible in our simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, we present the results of 51 separate CG simulations and examine general trends across the data sets.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The effects of CA concentration and molecular crowding', 'As noted, there is a dynamic population of CA conformations dictated by the flexible linker between the NTD and CTD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For our simulations, the equilibrium NTD-CTD conformation was based on the curved hexagonal lattice within CA tubes (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations were performed (see Methods and Supplementary Fig 1AC) using CA concentrations CA of 1, 2, 3 and 4 mM (with CA in a typical virion estimated as 3.8 mM)24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each CA studied, inert CG crowding agent densities CR from 0 to 200 mg ml1 were present with increments of 50 mg ml1 to study the effects of molecular crowding on CG self-assembly12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single simulation was performed for each data point for 2 × 108 MD time steps, with results summarized in Table 1 (full data in Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 CG self-assembly for varying CA and inert crowding levels.Full size table', 'For CA=1 mM, no stable self-assembly of mature-style capsid lattice occurred for any level of crowding studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, populations of metastable trimer-of-dimers structures34 rapidly formed (Fig 2a,b), with average trimer populations increasing with CR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar trend was observed for CA=2 mM until 200 mg ml1 of crowder was present, at which point the self-assembly behaviour changed dramatically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather than generating a steady-state population of trimers, as was apparently the case for CR=150 mg ml1, a new self-assembly regime emerged: the steady production of mature-style CA lattice with quasi-equivalent pentamers and hexamers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar effects were observed for CA of 3 and 4 mM, with metastable trimers generated below the onset of CA lattice growth at 100 less_than CR150 mg ml1 (for CA=3 mM) and 50 less_than CR100 mg ml1 (CA=4 mM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transition from producing only trimers to the nucleation of mature-style lattice was thus a function of both CA and CR, with higher CA requiring lower CR to induce lattice growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences of 50 mg ml1 in CR therefore led to markedly different behaviours for CA2 mM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Dimers of the CA protein are the units of self-assembly of HIV-1 capsid-like CG structures.

( less_than 5 × 106 MD time steps).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For simulations producing mature-style CA lattice, the appearance of stable pentameric inclusions lags the production of stable hexamers (see Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In every simulation producing mature-style lattice, nucleation and growth of multiple lattice regions occurred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, with CA=2 mM and CR=200 mg ml1, two independent lattice regions were generated: an incomplete cone fragment, and a small array of hexamers (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For CA=3 mM and CR=200 mg ml1, several independent lattice regions appeared, resulting in a pill-shaped structure with a closed lattice surface and the fusion of an incomplete pill shape with a cylinder fragment (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For CA=4 mM

molecular mass25 kDa, CA of 2, 3, and 4 mM correspond to CA mass densities of 50, 75 and 100 mg ml1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Onset of mature-style lattice growth therefore occurred for total mass densities of between 200 and 250 mg ml1 (for CA=2 mM), 175 and 225 mg ml1 (CA=3 mM), and 150 and 200 mg ml1 (CA=4 mM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total non-lipid mass density of HIV-1 virions was estimated as 200300 mg ml1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24), and so the CG model self-assembly initiated at mass density levels comparable to the virion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These results indicate sensitivity to both CA and local

However, CA is also a self-crowding agent as it occupies volume in the simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct comparison between self-assembly behaviours of different CA with the same quantity of inert crowder is therefore non-trivial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To examine the effects of CA concentration on CG self-assembly under constant molecular crowding, the initial CA content of identical systems (4 mM CA, CR=200 mg ml1) is partitioned into fixed active (CA+) and inactive (CA) populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the initial partitioning, CA dimers remain either active or inactive for the duration of the simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This partitioning is motivated by the experimental results of Deshmukh et al.23 suggesting a relatively small population of assembly-competent CA dimers in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inactive CA is identical to active CA in all aspects in our CG model except for the removal of attractive interactions, and thus both types of CA occlude equivalent volume.

effectively describe a limiting case of this behaviour: CA+ corresponds to a population of CA whose instantaneous structure is compatible with mature lattice (and hence may directly self-assemble) and

of CA+ and CA in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interval between random population assignments is thus a simplified proxy for time correlations in CA structural conformation: once assigned to either the CA+ or CA populations, a CA dimer remains assembly-competent or assembly-incompetent at least until the next random population assignment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aggregated CA is not included in this

quasi-equivalent NTD packing in pentameric and hexameric rings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While care should be taken in assuming any CG model to be a direct representation of a real, fully atomistically resolved system, the reproduction of specific experimental phenomena suggests that our CG model can capture the early and intermediate stages of nucleation and growth of the capsid lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even so, we note that the computational expense still limits the system sizes considered in this work, preventing the generation of full capsid structures after the depletion of the CA concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study demonstrates that CG self-assembly is sensitive to CA concentration, molecular crowding, and NTD/CTD conformational correlation times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single CG CA protein model generates surprisingly varied morphologies, encompassing the wide range of local curvatures required in the viral capsid15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evident in the results is a reversible multi-stage process triggering mature lattice self-assembly50, where metastable trimer-of-dimers structures rapidly emerge to act as potential seeds for the nucleation of mature lattice growth (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The steady-state population of trimers increases as a function of both concentration and molecular crowding, until suitable conditions produce mature-style capsid lattice over the simulation lengths examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lattice growth progressively reduces both the solution-state CA and the population of independent trimers to deter the nucleation of additional lattice regions (for example, Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transition between self-assembly regimes appears to be quite stable, in which relatively small changes in the molecular environment are capable of producing different outcomes, in agreement with, for example, previous studies of self-assembly for icosahedral capsid models37,38,39,40,51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The general effects of molecular crowding in our simulations are in agreement with those observed using other computational approaches for self-assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, high levels of crowding can reduce nucleation lag times to effectively zero (see, for example, Supplementary Figs 24), changing the self-assembly process from nucleation-limited to non-nucleation-limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Smith et al.39 also noted such effects in discrete event simulations of icosahedral capsid self-assembly: multiple parallel nucleation and growth events depleted the available capsid components, arresting complete capsid assembly and producing off-pathway growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar kinetic traps and multiple nucleation were also observed by, for example, Johnston and co-workers in Monte Carlo investigations of icosahedral capsid assembly37,38,39,40,51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the absence of RNA, CA is typically observed to assemble into tubes of variable diameter in vitro10,12,13,15,16,17,18, albeit with occasional cone-shaped structures12 and other non-tubular morphologies13,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments typically feature CA concentrations significantly below that expected in a virion, which likely assists in producing regular, purely hexameric cylinders via orderly nucleation and growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Sigmoidal assembly curve characteristics have been observed in experimentally for capsid assembly in, for example, HIV-1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12) and HPV-11 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results follow this general prediction, with assembly lag periods that are very short or effectively zero with suitable CA concentration and crowding (see, for example, Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that simulations lacking mature-style lattice production do not necessarily indicate that CG lattice growth cannot occur under those conditions, but rather that nucleation and growth were not detected over the simulation timescales examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the main focus of this study is the nucleation and growth of capsid lattice, converged simulations (that is, those attaining some final equilibrium) do not offer significantly more information regarding these aspects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, examination of structural data as a function of time (for example, Supplementary Figs 24) indicates that many simulations are approaching the plateau of a sigmoidal growth curve, with significant additional lattice growth unlikely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Trimer-of-dimers structures have been reported previously in computer simulations34,43, and have also been assumed as the fundamental building block in mathematical models of capsid cylinder growth54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that trimer structures are metastable in isolation, but addition of CA dimers onto these templates (Fig 4) provides the basic nucleation pathway for capsid assembly rather than the aggregation of independent trimer-of-dimer structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The regular appearance of transient pentamers at the growing edge of CG lattice was observed, suggesting a natural aspect of lattice growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If growth is slow, local remodelling can remove the pentamers provided the expanding lattice edge does not advance too far.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For more rapid assembly (for example, higher crowding or CA concentration) the lattice advances too quickly for reliable remodelling, producing high local curvature via stably embedded pentamers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process can explain why relatively low concentrations of CA typically produce cylindrical structures in vitro10,12,15,16,17,18,19,20, and why increased CA concentration reduces cylinder length16: early pentamer incorporation redirects lattice growth, suppressing the formation of longer cylinders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inherent instability in lattice edges suggest that CG models allowing dissociation more accurately reflect capsid assembly41,42,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Switching between active and inactive CA populations in solution, akin to the conformational dynamism recorded in vitro23, has pronounced effects on CG lattice self-assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Faster random mixing of the populations suppresses CG lattice production (Table 3), with a low instantaneous proportion of assembly-competent CA limiting uncontrolled nucleation and growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Longer intervals between population switching might allow CA that dissociates from a lattice edge to remain assembly-competent long enough to reassociate directly, and thus maintain the overall lattice structure, but more investigation is required to elucidate this mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In any case, dynamic conformational switching can ensure that growth is not prevented by the exhaustion of an otherwise limited quantity of assembly-competent CA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that CG models incorporating this phenomenon may better represent a key aspect of HIV-1 capsid assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is interesting to consider HIV-1 virion maturation in light of these results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the prototypical mature virion contains a single capsid, multiple capsid structures are sometimes observed9,31,32,33,55, both with and without RNA/NC encapsulation32, suggesting a delicate balance in the virion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple capsids appear correlated with larger virions33,55, consistent with sensitivity of CG assembly to local conditions: lattice growth reduces CA in solution, so larger virions (with larger numbers CA for the same overall CA concentration) could maintain CA levels above the critical nucleating value after an initial nucleation, increasing the likelihood of subsequent nucleation events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is compatible with observations that multiple cores are often comparable in size55, suggestive of separate nucleation events in quick succession.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sensitivity of CG self-assembly to CA concentration and local molecular crowding, in combination with natural virion variability, may complicate analyses that assume multiple cores are unrelated to CA concentration55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our CG simulations produced virion-relevant morphologies such as the extended cone-shaped structure shown in Fig 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the narrow end of this cone formed first, electron cryotomography indicates capsid growth typically proceeds from a small region of CA lattice adsorbed to the RNA/NC complex, generating the broad end of the capsid first (although capsid growth can also occur without RNA/NC)32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of a RNA/NC complex would obstruct high local curvature (such as in the narrow end of a cone), selecting against the initial formation of a narrow end.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our simulations therefore do not fully recapitulate the virion environment, but instead explore principles relevant to capsid self-assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the results are in general agreement with models of capsid generation where a small sheet of CA lattice curls under growth, producing a cup shaped structure from which assembly proceeds32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results suggest the importance of relatively slow, controlled growth of the HIV-1 capsid, allowing significant relaxation of both the local and global structure to produce a metastable capsid despite weak interactions between CA dimers11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenomena suggests caution is appropriate when fitting atomic-resolution models into relatively low-resolution capsid data: for example, CTD/CTD dimer interfaces present in the atomistic MD simulations of HIV-1 viral capsids by Zhao et al.49 can display significant shearing and distortions from the expected structures10,23 (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that such deformations occur naturally in a viral capsid, but further experimental support is needed to clarify this situation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The stability of CG lattice structures was sensitive to CA concentration in the supporting solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rapid dilution under otherwise identical conditions destabilized the capsid lattice, indicating the metastability of CA structures in agreement with experimental observations12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar effects have also been observed in simulations of icosahedral capsids56, albeit these simulations did not examine this effect under constant crowding conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sealed, edge-free CA lattices appear more resistant to this process (Fig 7c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cellular responses to HIV-1 include the weak binding of TRIM5 protein to capsids, forming a hexameric super-lattice on the capsid exterior57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TRIM5 binding promotes rapid capsid uncoating48,58,59,60,61,62,63, and while TRIM5 is digested by the proteasome64, capsid protein does not appear to be destroyed in this manner58,59,63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TRIM5 restriction is less efficient under proteasomal inhibition65,66,67, and we speculate this somewhat counterintuitive data can be explained by TRIM5 inducing local faults in the capsid lattice: slight mismatches in CA and TRIM5 lattice spacing induces additional stress in the metastable CA lattice68, with local tears providing an exposed edge from which CA can dissolve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteasomal degradation then ensures that a TRIM5 scaffold cannot exert any stabilizing influence on the overall capsid superstructure, enabling fragmentation of the capsid to further accelerate uncoating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Partial support for this hypothesis is offered by TRIM5 inducing only mild disruption of CA cylinders in vitro61, but as these studies used above-physiological salt concentrations with no rapid dilution (conditions in which the CA lattice may be over-stable)12 complete breakdown of CA lattice was not observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental data suggests HIV-1 capsids often feature exposed lattice edges, with an estimated 25% of cytoplasmic capsids featuring seams or holes large enough to allow the escape of green fluorescent protein (GFP)42, and so TRIM5 could help to accelerate natural lattice dissipation under rapid dilution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For capsid structures lacking exposed lattice edges, however, TRIM5 would provide a powerful accelerator of uncoating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process would offer a relatively simple description of the general effects of TRIM restriction on HIV-a capsids, but we note that the natural TRIM-restriction processes could be significantly more complicated.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Model details', 'Full-model details provided in Supplementary Note 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, CG CA is modelled directly from experimental hexamer (PDB 3H4E) and pentamer (3P0A) data20,21, and also heavily influenced by work from the same authors (B.K.G-P. and M.Y.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  with cylindrical CA assemblies in vitro14,15,16,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CA is represented as a dimer, the prevalent species in solution10,23, which is required for CA lattice assembly11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NTD and CTD of a CA monomer are represented as independent stiff elastic network models (ENMs) comprising the C atoms from CA- helices, which are well conserved across experimental structures34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional weaker ENM connects the NTD and CTD in each monomer to provide limited inter-domain structural flexibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CTD/CTD dimer interface is represented by a stiff ENM based on PDB structure 2KOD (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10) relevant for the mature lattice23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CG beads have excluded volume radii to deter unphysical overlaps as indicated by experimental structural data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Important CA protein/protein interfaces required for self-assembly9,10 are represented by specific attractive interactions, with the locations of energy minima parameterized using experimental structures20,21 and attractive strengths chosen to allow CA self-assembly under the experimentally relevant mass densities and conditions we study here (Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These attractive interactions can be dynamically enabled and disabled, allowing the generation of a fixed solution-state ratio of assembly-competent and assembly-incompetent populations as indicated by NMR data23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inert crowding agent is based on the excluded volume and relative mass of Ficoll 70 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of internal NTD/CTD flexibility in CA monomers, switching capability, and freedom of motion in a 3D simulation domain with explicit crowding molecules provides an advanced and relatively detailed molecular model with which to study CA self-assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Simulation details', 'All simulations were performed with our UCG-MD code69.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulation domain was an 800 Å cube (50% of typical virion volume due to computational expense, with max.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  616 CA dimers present at CA=4 mM) with periodic boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temperature of 300 K was maintained by Langevin dynamics with relaxation period 100 ps1 to minimize influence of thermostat, integration time step 10 fs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Visualizations of simulation data were created using VMD70, with CG CA depicted as tubes connecting CG particles in each notional  helix to emphasize the local secondary structure of the CG model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'All relevant data are available from the authors on request.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
