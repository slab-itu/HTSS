Elevated levels of Bcl-3 inhibits Treg development and function resulting in spontaneous colitis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Bcl-3 is an atypical NF-B family member that regulates NF-B-dependent gene expression in effector T cells, but a cell-intrinsic function in regulatory T (Treg) cells and colitis is not clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that Bcl-3 expression levels in colonic T cells correlate with disease manifestation in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice with T-cell-specific overexpression of Bcl-3 develop severe colitis that can be attributed to defective Treg cell development and function, leading to the infiltration of immune cells such as pro-inflammatory T cells, but not  T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Treg cells, Bcl-3 associates directly with NF-B p50 to inhibit DNA binding of p50/p50 and p50/p65 NF-B dimers, thereby regulating NF-B-mediated gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study thus reveals intrinsic functions of Bcl-3 in Treg cells, identifies Bcl-3 as a potential prognostic marker for colitis and illustrates the mechanism by which Bcl-3 regulates NF-B activity in Tregs to prevent colitis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The mucosal immune system of the gastrointestinal tract mediates immune protection against foreign pathogens and simultaneously conveys tolerance to microbes in the gut.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Failure to tolerate microbial antigens can result in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohns disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pathological process of both CD and UC involves cycles of inflammation, ulceration and subsequent regeneration of the intestinal mucosa1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD is classically considered as a TH1-mediated disease, due to the predominance of interferon- (IFN-)-producing CD4+ T cells in the mucosa2, whereas UC is characterized by infiltrating TH2 cells and the production of interleukin (IL)-5 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T cells, which can secrete high levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17A in the gut4, have important functions in the pathogenesis of IBD5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are essential for the maintenance of gut immune homeostasis, owing to their function as suppressors of cytokine production in TH1 and TH2 cells4,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Treg cells are important mediators of tolerance in the intestine and various studies have linked defects in Treg cell development or function to the onset of IBD10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though the contribution of Treg cells in the prevention of IBD is well-appreciated, the molecular factors regulating the functionality of Treg cells during IBD are still not entirely characterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The nuclear factor-B (NF-B) transcription factor family is composed of five members: RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, p50 (NF-B1) and p52 (NF-B2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These factors have been implicated in the development and function of natural Treg (nTreg) cells, which develop in the thymus, as well as inducible Treg (iTreg) cells, which are derived from naive CD4+ T cells after antigenic stimulation in peripheral tissues such as the gut12,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, mice lacking NF-B members such as p50, c-Rel and p65 have impaired Treg cell development15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in mice with T-cell-specific transgenic expression of an inhibitors of B (IB) super-repressor, the number of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells correlates with NF-B activity14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, although mice lacking p50, c-Rel and p65 have defective Treg cell development15,16,17, only mice lacking p65 develop signs of autoimmunity17, leaving an open question as to how NF-B activity modulates Treg cell functionality to prevent the development of autoimmunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'NF-B activity is regulated by members of the classical IB protein family, including IB, IB and IB, as well as p105/NF-B1 and p100/NF-B2 precursors, whereas the atypical IB proteins, including IB, IBNS and Bcl-3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18), bind directly to NF-B members in the nucleus and modulate NF-B-mediated gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bcl-3, originally identified as a proto-oncogene in a subgroup of B-cell leukaemia, enters the nucleus and associates selectively with DNA-bound NF-B p50 or p52 homodimers to regulate NF-B-dependent gene transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bcl-3 was shown to enhance NF-B-mediated transactivation by acting as a coactivator for p50 and p52 dimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies have shown that Bcl-3 is also able to inhibit NF-B-mediated transactivation by binding to p50 homodimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mode of Bcl-3 action, whether inhibitory or activating, further depends on the cell type investigated19,20,21,22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies using Bcl-3-deficient mice underline the importance of Bcl-3 in effective adaptive and innate immune responses against pathogens, in central tolerance and the prevention of autoimmune diseases, as well as in effector T-cell plasticity25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Bcl-3 regulates intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and was shown to be essential for the induction of dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these studies indicate a possible involvement of Bcl-3 in the regulation of effector T cells and gut immune homeostasis, the exact functions of Bcl-3 in Treg cells and IBD have not been reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we demonstrate that Bcl-3 is important for the maintenance of Treg cell function and the prevention of spontaneous colitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patient data show that Bcl-3 expression levels correlate with disease severity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with this, mice that overexpress Bcl-3 in T cells develop severe spontaneous colitis, which is not mediated by effector T cells but instead is caused by impaired Treg cell function resulting from altered NF-B activity via cell-intrinsic regulation by Bcl-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Treg cells, Bcl-3 interacts with p50 and inhibits p50 DNA binding, and thereby alters the NF-B-mediated genetic programmes that are required for Treg cell development and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our study highlights the necessity to monitor Bcl-3 expression in both CD and UC, and implicates Bcl-3 as a potential therapeutic target in IBD.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Bcl-3 expression levels are increased in patients with IBD', 'To study a potential role of Bcl-3 in the pathogenesis of human IBD, we used immunohistochemistry to examine Bcl-3 expression levels in colons of patients suffering from either CD or UC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This staining revealed that CD and UC patients had massive infiltration of Bcl-3+ cells in the lamina propria (LP), whereas control groups displayed only few Bcl-3 expressing cells within this area (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, quantitative reverse transcriptasePCR (RTPCR) analysis using RNA isolated from colons of patients with active CD or UC showed significantly increased levels of Bcl-3 expression compared with controls (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate specifically which cells express Bcl-3, immunohistochemistry from colon cross-sections of patients with CD and UC was performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis revealed increased numbers of CD4+ T cells in the inflamed colon of both CD, as well as UC patients compared with healthy patients (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we could show that in most regions, the majority of infiltrating CD4+ T cells was positive for Bcl-3 expression (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we isolated LP T cells from UC and control patients and analysed the expression of Bcl-3 by western blotting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that patients with UC expressed increased protein levels of Bcl-3 compared with control patients (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data illustrate a direct correlation between Bcl-3-expressing CD4+ T cells and the pathogenesis of IBD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Increased Bcl-3 expression levels in colons of IBD patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Representative picture of immunohistochemistry of human colonic

Bcl-3 expression in T cells in the pathogenesis of IBD, we used a mouse model in which Bcl-3 and enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) are expressed upon Cre-mediated recombination of a loxP flanked transcriptional STOP cassette30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mice were crossed to the CD4-Cre mouse strain to obtain mice, termed Bcl-3TOE, that specifically overexpress Bcl-3 in all mature  T cells including Treg cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot analysis of purified CD4+ T cells of Bcl-3TOE mice confirmed higher expression of Bcl-3 compared with control T cells (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starting at 8 weeks of age, Bcl-3TOE mice suffered from severe diarrhoea and rectal prolapse (Fig 2b, left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the development of a rectal prolapse is a predisposition for colonic inflammation, those mice were examined by mini-endoscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that Bcl-3TOE mice spontaneously developed severe intestinal inflammation, as indicated by a significantly higher clinical score of colitis (Fig 2b right and Fig 2c), with an incidence of  greater than 90%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, macroscopic examination of the intestine showed severe pancolitis affecting all parts of the colon distal from the caecum (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, histological haematoxylin and eosin analysis revealed a dramatic infiltration of immune cells into the colon of Bcl-3TOE mice (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As T-cell-specific Bcl-3 overexpression drives the development of a strong colonic inflammation similar to the histopathology observed in patients with IBD, we further characterized the colitis phenotype in these mice and examined gene expression of different pro-inflammatory cytokines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along with increased levels of Bcl3 transcript, expression of Il6, Il17a, Tnfa and Ifng were significantly elevated in the colons of Bcl-3TOE mice compared with littermate controls (Fig 2f), whereas expression of Il10 was unaffected (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we performed immunohistochemistry of cellular infiltrates within the mucosa of Bcl-3TOE mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found increased numbers of infiltrating CD4+ T cells, CD11c+ dendritic cells, F4/80+ macrophages and MPO+ neutrophils compared with littermate controls (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of this analysis revealed a significant increased cell infiltration of all tested immune cells in the colon of Bcl-3-overexpressing mice, confirming the increased score of colitis as measured by mini-endoscopy (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data demonstrate that increased Bcl-3 expression in T cells leads to severe intestinal inflammation in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Bcl-3TOE cells cause spontaneous colitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a)

drives the initiation of intestinal inflammation, we analysed the effect of Bcl-3 overexpression on T-cell pathogenicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we used Bcl-3-overexpressing CD4+ T cells to induce intestinal inflammation using the T cell transfer model of colitis31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, transfer of Bcl-3TOE CD4+CD25 T cells failed to induce colitis in RAG1/ recipients, whereas control CD4+CD25 T cells induced colitis as measured by significantly increased clinical scores of intestinal inflammation (Fig 3a) and weight loss (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As Bcl-3TOE CD4+ T cells failed to mediate colitis, we assessed the proliferative capacity of these cells, as it was shown that the transfer of naive T cells into lymphopenic mice initiates their homeostatic proliferation32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis revealed an impaired proliferative capacity of Bcl-3-overexpressing CD4+ T cells compared with control CD4+ T cells upon stimulation (Fig 3c), an impairment that can explain the failure of these cells to induce transferred colitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously, it has been demonstrated that Bcl-3 overexpression promotes T-cell survival33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate whether this holds true also in our system, we performed Annexin V and 7-aminoactinomycin D staining of purified CD4+ T cells cultured for 4 days without stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we also found a survival advantage of Bcl-3-overexpressing CD4+ T cells compared with control T cells (Supplementary Fig 2), similar to the data published by Marck et al.33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine whether Bcl-3 has an impact on T-cell differentiation, we analysed naive versus memory/effector T cells in Bcl-3TOE mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a dramatic decrease in the percentage and total cell numbers of CD44high CD62Llow effector/memory CD4+ T cells in lymph nodes (LNs), mesenteric LN (mLN) and spleens of Bcl-3TOE mice compared with controls, whereas accordingly the percentage of naive T cells was significantly increased (Fig 3d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect we already detected in young mice at the age of 4 weeks before the onset of colitis (Supplementary Fig 3c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As proinflammatory cytokines IFN-, IL-17A and granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor have been implicated in playing important roles in the development and pathogenesis of colitis, we investigated their production by CD4+ T cells from Bcl-3TOE mice compared with controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of CD4+ T cells isolated from the spleen and LNs revealed a significant decrease in IL-17A and IFN- expression by CD4+ T cells from Bcl-3TOE mice, whereas there was no difference in granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor production when compared with T CD4+ T cells from littermate controls (Supplementary Fig 4a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 is known to have an ameliorating effect on colitis, we also investigated the production of this cytokine by CD4+ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, a significant reduction of IL-10 production by Bcl-3TOE CD4+ T cells was found, probably contributing to the observed colitis phenotype in Bcl-3TOE mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the effector CD4+ T cells themselves do not seem to be responsible for the induction of colitis, as their numbers as well as their production of the inflammatory cytokines IFN- and IL-17A are significantly reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Bcl-3-driven gut inflammation is dominated by  T cells.

homeostasis by suppressing the activation and expansion of potentially self-reactive T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a significant reduction in the percentage as well as total numbers of Foxp3+ Tregs in LNs and spleens of Bcl-3TOE mice compared with controls (Fig 4a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reduction was already present in Bcl-3TOE mice at the age of 4 weeks compared with littermate controls (Supplementary Fig 3e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mLNs of Bcl-3TOE mice, only the percentage of Foxp3+ cells was reduced, whereas the total cell number was similar to the numbers in littermate controls (Fig 4b), probably due to the enlargement in size of mLNs in Bcl-3TOE mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore whether the decreased number of Tregs in LN and spleen was due to reduced numbers of nTregs or iTregs, the expression of the transcription factor Helios, which was previously used as a marker for thymus-derived nTregs34, was analysed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon Bcl-3 overexpression, the numbers of both nTregs and iTregs were significantly reduced (Fig 4c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, Bcl-3 appears to regulate the development and induction of nTregs, as well as iTregs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as a

performed confocal microscopy in Tregs using antibodies directed against endogenous Bcl-3 and transfected p50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, both proteins localize in close proximity in the nucleus of Treg cells (Supplementary Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As Bcl-3 overexpression led to reduced expression of Foxp3, as well as IL-10, CTLA-4 and IL-2R (Fig 4g), we performed electrophoretic mobility shift

the specific binding of p50 to DNA, as competition assays with cold probes revealed similar results (Supplementary Fig 6c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Most importantly, this effect of Bcl-3 inhibiting p50

of p50 to DNA by elevated levels of Bcl-3, this inhibition was consistently observed through all experiments and reflects also the extent to which NF-B targeted genes were reduced in expression (Fig

diminished activity of the Foxp3 promoter in Tregs from Bcl-3TOE compared with Tregs isolated from littermate controls (Fig 8a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether this inhibitory effect of Bcl-3 overexpression on gene activity was due to its direct interaction and regulation of p50, we used a Bcl-3 mutant that is unable to interact with p50 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  46) (Fig 8b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, this mutant was not able to repress gene activity compared with wt Bcl-3 construct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of this construct, we observed enhanced promoter activity (Fig 8c),

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'IBD is characterized by the infiltration of T cells that cause colon damage and attract innate inflammatory immune cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found drastically elevated expression levels of Bcl-3 in CD4+ T cells isolated from patients with CD and UC, underlining a role for Bcl-3 in the pathogenesis of IBD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mice, we could define a clear role for Bcl-3 in intestinal inflammation, as mice overexpressing Bcl-3 in T cells develop spontaneous colitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This disease was accompanied by infiltration of various pro-inflammatory cells into the colon, including  T cells, which might account for the increased levels of IL-17A detected in the colon of these mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous studies using Bcl-3 deficient animals suggested an intrinsic function of Bcl-3 in constraining the plasticity of pathogenic TH1 cells27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we found that high expression of Bcl-3 in CD4+ cells leads to a reduced number of pathogenic effector T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the spontaneous colitis seen in our model is not driven by conventional  T cells, as these cells fail to proliferate and differentiate into pathogenic T cells and in accordance fail to induce colitis in a passive T-cell transfer model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We found a suppressive dysfunction of Tregs from Bcl-3TOE mice, as these cells secrete decreased levels of IL-10, shown to be crucial for suppressing  T-cell expansion and for the prevention of spontaneous colitis in vivo4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether or not the reduced IL-10 production by Bcl-3-overexpressing Tregs is the sole reason for the colitis is not clear, as we also noticed decreased expression levels of Foxp3, CTLA-4, GITR and IL-2R in these Treg cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance to the above data, the transfer of wt Tregs into Bcl-3TOE mice blocked the development of colitis and inhibited  T-cell expansion in the colonic compartment of these mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings underline the suppressive dysfunction of Tregs overexpressing Bcl-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Surprisingly, mice overexpressing Bcl-3 specifically in Treg cells (Bcl-3FoxP3OE mice) did not develop any signs of colitis probably due to the very high percentage of GFP Foxp3+ Treg cells, which was less pronounced using CD4-Cre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These GFP Foxp3+ cells could have escaped Cre-mediated recombination and fill up the Treg compartment through a proliferative and/or survival advantage over the cells that overexpress Bcl-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, also the different time points of Cre activity and the cells targeted could be a potential explanation of this inconsistency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the CD4-Cre mouse, Bcl-3 is overexpressed in CD4-expressing T cells during T-cell development, which results in elevated Bcl-3 levels already before Treg development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, in these mice all conventional T cells overexpress Bcl-3 possibly indirectly also influencing Treg cell development/proliferation and/or viability of these cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, enforced expression of Bcl-3 using Foxp3-Cre mice occurs later, starting only after Treg cells already developed and only in Foxp3+ Treg leaving all conventional T cells unaffected, and therefore functionally normal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference in time of overexpression and the targeted cells may affect how Treg cells are capable to deal with Bcl-3 overexpression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is well established that Bcl-3 plays an important role in NF-B regulation, either promoting or inhibiting target gene expression depending on the cell type and stimulus received47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bcl-3 selectively interacts with p50 and p52 subunits of NF-B via its ankyrin domains, thereby regulating NF-B-dependent gene transcription20,48,49,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to its numerous posttranslational modifications influencing its mode of action, Bcl-3 was also shown to act as an adaptor molecule, possibly building a platform for other coactivators or repressors to p50/p50 homodimers, thereby possibly influencing its mode of action51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously, it has been suggested that NF-B activity is important for Treg development and differentiation, as mice lacking p65, p50 and c-Rel show diminished Treg cell development and defective Foxp3 gene expression15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, p50 and c-Rel-deficient mice do not develop spontaneous autoimmunity even though these mice display decreased numbers of Tregs and defective peripheral Treg differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the exact mechanistic role of NF-B signalling in controlling immune homeostasis remains unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Aberrant expression of Bcl-3 results in a wide range of defects within the immune system but so far, no clear correlation between Bcl-3 expression and subsequent NF-B activation has been reported for Treg function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, for T-helper subsets a clear role for Bcl-3 in regulating NF-B activity has been demonstrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, it was shown that Bcl-3 controls T-helper cell plasticity by preventing the binding of c-Rel and p65 to NF-B binding sites in the RORt promoter27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of Bcl-3, c-Rel and p65 induce Rorc expression leading to Th17 differentiation52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Th1 cells, Bcl-3 mediates the stabilization of inhibitory p50 homodimers on NF-B-binding sites, thereby restricting RORt expression27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, our data using Bcl-3 transgenic mice clearly demonstrate that Bcl-3 overexpression has a global effect on T-helper cell differentiation and impairs Treg function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that enforced Bcl-3 expression has a cell type-specific suppressive function in Treg cells leading to repression of NF-B target gene expression, whereas inflammation and/or NF-B-driven Bcl-3 expression, as seen the gut of those mice, results in elevated NF-B target gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in line with previously suggested context-dependent functions of Bcl-3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that in Tregs Bcl-3 directly interacts with p50, thereby preventing its binding to DNA and thus directly inhibiting NF-B target gene expression, thereby fine-tuning the function of Tregs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How this is achieved is not clear, as Bcl-3 cannot bind to DNA, but it does exert its functions in the nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that Bcl-3 is also localized in the nucleus of Treg cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possible mechanism is the described interaction of Bcl-3 with histone deacetylases leading to transcriptional termination53,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observe transcriptional inhibition in Treg cells by enforced Bcl-3 expression on p50-regulated genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we also show weaker binding of p50 to DNA in the presence of high levels of Bcl-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the exact molecular mechanism for this still remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We further propose that the direct interaction of Bcl-3-p50 also prevents the binding of p50/p65 heterodimers to DNA but not through a direct mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  p65 was recently illustrated to be essential for Treg stability and controlling the functionality of Tregs, as p65 inactivation specifically in Tregs induces multi-focal autoimmune disease in mice17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, inhibition of p50/p65 activation by Bcl-3/p50 complexes is likely to be responsible for the suppressive dysfunction of Bcl-3-overexpressing Tregs, leading to chronic inflammatory colitis in Bcl-3TOE mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we define a cell-type-specific molecular mechanism by which Bcl-3 regulates NF-B-dependent gene expression in Treg cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analyses demonstrate the importance to fine-tune Bcl-3 expression for the development and function of Treg cells, as elevated levels of Bcl-3 expression leads to dysfunctional Tregs resulting from diminished NF-B activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically targeting the activity of Bcl-3 in IBD may represent an effective strategy for the inhibition of gut inflammation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
