Signalome-wide assessment of host cell response to hepatitis C virus  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Host cell signalling during infection with intracellular pathogens remains poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report on the use of antibody microarray technology to detect variations in the expression levels and phosphorylation status of host cell signalling proteins during hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following transfection with HCV RNA, the JNK and NF-B pathways are suppressed, while the JAK/STAT5 pathway is activated; furthermore, components of the apoptosis and cell cycle control machineries are affected in the expression and/or phosphorylation status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNAi-based hit validation identifies components of the JAK/STAT, NF-B, MAPK and calcium-induced pathways as modulators of HCV replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selective chemical inhibition of one of the identified targets, the JNK activator kinase MAP4K2, does impair HCV replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus this study provides a comprehensive picture of host cell pathway mobilization by HCV and uncovers potential therapeutic targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strategy of identifying targets for anti-infective intervention within the host cell signalome can be applied to any intracellular pathogen.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Hepatitis C virus (HCV), a member of the family Flaviviridae, infects approximately 2% of the world population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection leads to chronic hepatitis, which can progress to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, several studies indicate a significant association with metabolic disorders, such as steatohepatitis, type II diabetes and insulin resistance1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The virion contains a positive sense single-stranded RNA genome, which comprises a single open reading frame translated into a large (3000 amino acids) polyprotein, which is enzymatically cleaved into at least 10 mature proteins: core protein, E1, E2, p7, NS2-3, NS4A-B, and NS5A-B5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HCV contains a structured non-coding region at the 5 end of its genome that forms an internal ribosomal entry site and thus mediates viral genome translation (reviewed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In recent years, the introduction of several direct acting agents, including small molecules targeting NS3, NS5A and NS5B, has revolutionized HCV therapy and led to sustained virological response (defined as aviremia 24 weeks after completion of antiviral therapy for chronic HCV infection) in the majority of treated patients7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, direct acting agents failure and resistance in a subset of patients, as well as limited or absent access to therapy for a large majority of patients worldwide, remain important challenges that need to be addressed by complementary therapies9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'HCV, similar to other viruses, exploits host cell factors, structures and signalling pathways that control the host cell environment and are crucial for successful infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Host cell factors required for viral replication represent attractive antiviral targets, since the most parsimonious way for the virus to develop resistance, that is, the selection of mutations in genes encoding those targets, will not be available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several studies have explored the role of host cell signalling molecules in HCV replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Global proteomic and analyses of liver biopsies10,11 and HCV cell culture systems11,12 have revealed significant changes in cellular environment after infection with HCV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, several reports investigated the role of host cell protein kinases as major signalling elements in HCV replication and assembly13,14,15,16,17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there are no reports of comprehensive studies focussing on time-dependent mobilization of host cell factors during the early steps of HCV replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We previously used the Kinexus antibody-based approach to investigate interactions between the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and its host erythrocyte and demonstrated that a signalling pathway implicating the human kinases p21-activated kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase 1 is activated by infection20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that implementation of the Kinexus antibody microarray technology coupled to functional validation of hits by small interfering RNA (siRNA) confirmed a number of host cell factors, notably protein kinases, that were previously identified as modulators of HCV infection; this represents a useful positive control for our new approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, this also revealed several novel host cell signalling pathways that are mobilized by HCV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide evidence that treatment of infected cells with a selective chemical inhibitor of MAP4K2, one of the protein kinases found to be activated by infection, severely affects HCV genome replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This constitutes a proof-of-concept that this system-wide approach can deliver novel targets for antiviral intervention.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Signalling pathways affected by viral genome transfection', 'Replication-competent HCV RNA was transfected into the hepatocyte-derived Huh7.5.1 cell line, and transfection efficacy was verified by immunofluorescence assay using an anti-NS5A antibody (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alterations in host cell signalling pathways were investigated 6, 12 and 24 h after transfection using the Kinexus antibody microarray (Fig 1a; see Methods section for a description of the array).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allowed us to quantify the protein expression levels of cell signalling factors, as well as phosphorylation site occupancy on many of these factors, that were upregulated or downregulated at various time points post-transfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full and short-listed (103 genes) inventories of factors modulated at the 6, 12 and 24 h time points are shown in Supplementary Data 13, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A bioinformatic analysis of the data sets, performed to test statistical enrichment of KEGG pathways (see Methods section), revealed that multiple signalling pathways were modulated (Supplementary Data 4), including the nuclear factor (NF)-B, signal transducer and activator of transcription/Janus kinase (STAT/JAK) and MAPK pathways, as well as calcium signalling and components of the cell cycle progression and apoptosis machineries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of cell factors whose expression or phosphorylation status was modulated by infection generally increased over time; however, the number of downregulated genes was lower at 24 h than at 12 h post-transfection (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No signalling molecules were observed to be modulated at all three time points (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A heat map was generated to facilitate the comparison of the levels of proteins (or their phosphorylation status) across the three time points (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Flowchart of the Kinexus antibody microarray methodology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) In vitro synthesized transcripts of HCV deletion mutant (E1E2) were transfected into Huh7.5.1 cells using transfection lipid reagent DMRIE-C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Negative control cells (Controls) were transfected with the transfection mixture lacking viral genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At given time points post-transfection (PT), cells were harvested and lysed, and the extracts were incubated onto the antibody microarray.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b,c) Number of total and phosphorylated forms of signalling molecules across three time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Venn diagram of the 103 identified genes across different time points (6, 12 and 24 h post-transfection) (see Supplementary Data 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Effects of silencing of the genes identified by antibody microarray on virus replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The graph shows the top 20 factors that had most profound effect on virus replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following silencing of the genes for 43 h, cells were infected with a reporter virus containing a Renilla luciferase gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The luciferase activity of each well was measured and normalized to its viability and negative control si-OTP-NT set at 100%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The error bars represent s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of at least three wells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P values were calculated with the unequal variance t-test embedded in Excel;

the 103 genes and their specific SMARTpool siRNA sequences are presented in Supplementary Data 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modulation of HCV replication following silencing of cell factors was measured using a reporter system based on secreted luciferase enzyme encoded by a modified viral genome, which is an accepted quantifier of virus replication21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results were normalized against cell viability and are presented in Supplementary Data 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primary screen was validated by direct, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR) quantification of intracellular viral genomic RNA levels following infection with the virus; in this case, the results were normalized against mRNA levels of the housekeeping genes -actin and GAPDH and are presented in Supplementary Data 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of the two systems provided strong evidence for the implication of several cell factors in HCV replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a few tested factors, some discrepancy between the results of the luciferase and qRTPCR readout systems was observed (see Discussion section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The top 10 factors that play a promoting or inhibiting role in HCV replication are presented in Fig 1e, and the full list of the 103 cell factors tested in RNAi experiments can be found in Supplementary Data 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sections below focus on the JAK/STAT, NF-B, calcium and MAPK signalling pathways that our microarray and gene silencing analyses showed to be important in HCV replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data pertaining to several additional signalling pathways, namely, the insulin/phosphoinositide-3 kinase/AKT and Wnt/-catenin pathways, as well as components of the machinery regulating cell cycle progression and apoptosis, are discussed in Supplementary Note 1, with the relevant data presented in Supplementary Figs 710.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'JAK/STAT5A pathway', 'JAK/STAT signalling integrates extracellular environment signals through a complex network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different STAT transcription factors are activated by various upstream signals: for example, activation of STAT1 and STAT2 is initiated by binding of interferon to its receptor, while STAT5A is activated by interleukin-2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon activation by JAK2-dependent phosphorylation24, STAT5A is translocated into the nucleus where it promotes transcription of target genes, including B-cell lymphomaextra large (Bcl-xl)25 and c-myc26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been reported that HCV regulates JAK/STAT pathways, notably through degradation of STAT1 and STAT3 and induction of SOCS3, a member of the suppressors of cytokine signalling (SOCS) family that inhibits STAT phosphorylation by binding and inhibiting JAKs27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our antibody microarray data reveal that the phosphorylated forms of both JAK2 and STAT5A are increased 24 h post-transfection (Supplementary Data 3, Fig 2), suggesting a role for the JAK/STAT5 signalling pathway in virus replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with clinical findings that STAT5A is upregulated by HCV infection29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, and as discussed below in the context of the NF-B pathway, Bcl-xl showed a decrease at 24 h and c-myc level did not show significant changes, suggesting that STAT5A may not target these genes in the context of HCV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, STAT5A clearly plays an important role, because silencing of either JAK2 or STAT5A resulted in a reduction in virus replication; the effect of STAT5A silencing was equally strong when assessed by luciferase or qRTPCR, while the effect of JAK2 silencing was more pronounced when assessed by luciferase assay than by qRTPCR (see Discussion section; Fig 2 and Fig 1e; Supplementary Data 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is established that STAT5 promotes replication of human papillomavirus30 and polyomavirus31; that it also promotes replication of an RNA virus reveals that this strategy is widespread among animal viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: JAK/STAT5A pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Upregulation and downregulation of cell factors determined by antibody microarray experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Factors with a Z ratio  greater than 1.25 are considered significant (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) A schematic figure of simplified JAK/STAT5A pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colour boxes represent factors shortlisted for siRNA validation following the microarray experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Effect of silencing of the JAK/STAT5A pathway components on HCV replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following silencing the target genes for 43 h, cells were infected with a reporter virus containing a Renilla luciferase gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solid bars, luciferase readout: Luciferase activity in each well, normalized to viability and negative control (si-OTP-NT) set at 100%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hatched bars, qRTPCR readout, normalized to two housekeeping genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The error bars represent s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of at least three wells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P values were calculated with the unequal variance t-test embedded in Excel; significant variations (P less_than 0.05) are depicted by an asterisk.Full size image', 'NF-B pathway', 'The NF-B transcription factor regulates multiple cellular processes, including immune response, inflammation, apoptosis, autophagy, cell adhesion, differentiation and proliferation32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are two distinct NF-B pathways, the canonical and non-canonical33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The classical pathway comprises NF-B1 (p50), RelA (p65), the inhibitors of NF-B IB and IB and their cognate kinases IB kinases  and  (IKK, IKK).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The non-canonical pathway is regulated mainly by the NF-B-inducer kinase (NIK, also known as MAP3K14), IKK, IB, p55 and RelB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Major alterations in these pathways were observed 12 h post-transfection with HCV genomic RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The levels of both NF-B1(p50) and RelA (p65) were reduced 12 h post-transfection (Supplementary Data 2, Fig 3), confirming the previously reported suppression of the canonical NF-B pathway by HCV34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of NF-B-dependent anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-xL, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein and the long form of cellular-FLICE inhibitory protein, was decreased after infection of cultured cells, in line with the reported decreased levels of Bcl-xL, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein and cellular-FLICE inhibitory protein (mRNA and protein) in livers with chronic hepatitis C34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  siRNA-mediated silencing of the NF-B inhibitors IB and IB reduced virus replication, but in contrast, and consistent with the published results35, silencing RelA promoted virus replication (Supplementary Data 6, Fig 3); RelA supresses HCV replication through a RelA-dependent -interferon production mechanism36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was some discrepancy between the luciferase and qRTPCR readouts for RelA and NIK, but both assays concur in a strong impairment of viral replication when IB and IKK are silenced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data clearly indicate that activation of the canonical NF-B pathway suppresses virus replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the non-canonical NF-B pathway, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 2 (IRAK2) recruits the tumour necrosis factor- receptor-associated factor 6 and NIK, an activator of IKK37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detected an increase in IRAK2 levels at 24 h but a decrease in NIK at 6 h (Supplementary Data 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since NIK is constitutively expressed in its active form, abundance of the protein reflects activation of the pathway33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, silencing IRAK2 and NIK reduced virus replication as indicated by lower luciferase activity (Fig 3, Supplementary Data 6), suggesting an infection-promoting role for these two kinases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NIK plays a key role in the replication of several viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus, EpsteinBarr virus and Herpesvirus saimiri, through activation of the NF-B pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NIK phosphorylates IKK, which in turn (independently from downstream elements of the NF-B pathway) promotes HCV assembly35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NIK is downregulated 6 h post-transfection and never reaches the same level as the mock-infected cells control throughout the duration of the experiment (12 and 24 h; Supplementary Data 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IKK, the substrate of NIK, phosphorylates and destabilizes NIK in a negative feedback loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphorylation of IKK increases during HCV infection35, which may explain the lower quantities of NIK we observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, silencing NIK, similar to IKK silencing35, remarkably reduced HCV replication (see above).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, silencing cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1, which destabilizes NIK by promoting its ubiquitination38,39 and was increased at 12 h, also reduced virus replication (more noticeable when viral genome quantity was measured, Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that NIK and IKK play essential positive roles in HCV replication, as previously reported for IKK35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, this is the first report suggesting a promoting role for NIK in a viral infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Non-canonical NF-B pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Upregulation and downregulation of cell factors determined by antibody microarray experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Factors with a Z ratio  greater than 1.25 are considered significant (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) A schematic figure of the (simplified) NF-B pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colour boxes represent factors shortlisted for siRNA validation following the microarray experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Effect of silencing of the NF-B pathway components on HCV replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following silencing the target genes for 43 h, cells were infected with a reporter virus containing a Renilla luciferase gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solid bars, luciferase readout: Luciferase activity in each well, normalized to viability and negative control (si-OTP-NT) set at 100%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hatched bars, qRTPCR readout, normalized to two housekeeping genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The error bars represent s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of three independent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P values were calculated with the unequal variance t-test embedded in Excel;

Due to the absence in the array of antibodies detecting phosphorylated sites on CaMK1D and CaMK kinase, we were unable to assess the activation status of these enzymes; this deserves further investigations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As mentioned above, silencing CREB1 decreased virus replication, indicating a promoting role for this factor in virus replication; likewise, silencing CaMK1D suppressed virus replication as evidenced by the detection of both viral genome and luciferase activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another calcium-dependent kinase, FAK, was phosphorylated and activated at 24 h. Silencing FAK did not alter viral replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2, also known as PTK2B), activated by CaMK1D, may activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diacylglycerol (see above) activates protein kinase C (PKC), which then phosphorylates cell factors such as MAPKs and IB, through which it regulates several cellular functions49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PKC and PKC increased at 6 and 24 h post-transfection, respectively, but PKC silencing reduced virus replication more than PKC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PKC and PKC levels were lower than those of the controls at 6 and 12 h, respectively, and their silencing reduced virus replication as evidenced by both detection assays (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Calcium-dependent signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Upregulation and downregulation of cell factors determined by antibody microarray experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Factors with a Z ratio  greater than 1.25 are considered significant (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Effect of gene silencing on HCV replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following silencing the target genes for 43 h, cells were infected with a reporter virus containing a Renilla luciferase gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solid bars, luciferase readout: Luciferase activity in each well, normalized to viability and negative control (si-OTP-NT) set at 100%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hatched bars, qRTPCR readout, normalized to two housekeeping genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The error bars represent s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of at least three wells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P values were calculated with the unequal variance t-test embedded in Excel;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We utilized the Kinexus antibody microarray to generate a comprehensive picture of host cell signalling pathways that are modulated by HCV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cellular processes regulated by key signalling cascades that are modulated during the early steps of replication include: (i) metabolism (insulin/AKT/phosphoinositide-3 kinase pathway), (ii) inflammation (NF-B pathway), (iii) apoptosis, and (iv) cell proliferation (MAPK pathways, cell cycle control elements, calcium and Wnt signalling).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene silencing experiments demonstrated that specific components of the signalling pathway identified in the microarray experiment are essential for HCV replication, while others play an inhibitory role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assessed the effect of gene silencing on viral replication in two independent sets of experiments, based on two different readouts: measurement of secreted luciferase encoded by a modified virus21,22,23, and direct measurement of viral RNA by qRTPCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In many instances, the data obtained with each system overlap, while in others (for example, RelA and JNK2), considerable discrepancy is observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is likely due to the fact that silencing signalling genes may well interfere, either with the trafficking systems underlying luciferase secretion or with the expression of the housekeeping genes used as a normalization component in the qRTPCR experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, those genes whose silencing give the same results with both readout methods are very strong candidates as regulators of viral replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the major signalling components that promote HCV replication (CaMK1D, MAP4K2, PLC1) were downregulated at early time points after replication initiation, which may provide some insight into the process whereby limited HCV replication leads to chronic infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several novel promoting factors such as CaMK1D, MAP4K2, PLC1 and STAT5A were identified and clearly deserve further investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also identified novel HCV-induced alterations in the insulin-induced pathway, whose characterization may unravel unidentified mechanisms of HCV pathogenesis, notably in the context of the association of this virus with type II diabetes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using a combination of RNAi and chemical inhibition, we demonstrated that the proximal activator MAP4K2 plays a role in HCV genome replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MAPK pathways are involved in several cellular physiological functions and are crucial to the life cycle of some viruses56,57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several protein kinases have been demonstrated to mediate HCV entry, genome replication and translation58,59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While previous reports indicate that MAP4K2 plays a role in HCV entry13, our data indicate that MAP4K2 is also mobilized for HCV genome replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated that a selective type II inhibitor of MAP4K2 kinase, TL4-12 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  54), impairs virus replication, suggesting that inhibitors of this class have therapeutical potential for HCV patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the kinase may have a role not only in virus replication but also in the transformation of infected cells; MAP4K2 chemical inhibition may thus kill two birds with one stone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We further validated our microarray data by examining the data set from a published transcriptomics study performed by oligonucleotide microarray at early time points post-infection with HCV (6, 12 and 24 h)60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analysed the data sets from this report using TFactS61, a program designed to predict which transcription factors are activated or inhibited based on the expression of their target genes in a microarray data set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The output of the TFactS analysis of the published transcriptomics data set60 is presented in Supplementary Data 8; overall, the host cell transcription factors that are predicted to be activated or inhibited by HCV infection fit well with our antibody microarray data: at early time points of HCV infection, only a limited number transcription factors is predicted to be modulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data concur with the transcriptomics results in detecting activation of -catenin at 6 h post-infection and CREB1 (at 12 h for the antibody microarray data, and 24 h for the transcriptomics data).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, consistent with our microarray analysis, CREB1 and STAT5A were listed by the TFactS program as activated transcription factors at 24 h (Supplementary Data 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SMAD1 was inhibited at 24 h in both studies (the decrease was slight in our data set).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Kinexus microarray did not contain antibodies against the activated form of several transcription factors (including SREBF1-2, CREBBP and SMAD3) that our TFactS analysis of transcriptomics data identified as modulated by infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the TFactS analysis suggests that STAT3 is activated at 12 h post-infection, while the activated form of STAT3 appeared at 6 h in the antibody microarray; it can actually be expected that the transcriptional response is in full swing at a later stage than the activation of the signalling pathway triggering the response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, the transcriptomics analysis60 showed that the expression of some genes promoting apoptosis, and that of other genes promoting cell survival, were increased upon HCV infection; such an apparently opposite response was also observed with respect to cell cycle genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in line with our antibody microarray data suggesting (i) that levels of Bax (a pro-apoptotic molecule) increased at 6 h post-transfection but decreased at 12 h, and (ii) that Bak (another pro-apoptotic factor) decreased in abundance at 24 h post-transfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would be consistent with the cell engaging an apoptotic response immediately after infection and with the apoptotic machinery being skewed towards cell survival at later stages of infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus conflicting transcriptional changes revealed by the transcriptomics analysis appear to occur in response to HCV60, which, in some instances such as that of the apoptotic response mentioned above, may reflect temporal regulation of opposite responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in line with the complexity of the signalling pathway mobilization revealed by our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The combination of antibody microarray and gene silencing approaches allowed us to identify several factors that play an important role in the viral replication cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While some of these factors had previously been reported as influencing HCV replication, several others are novel to our understanding of the molecular aspects of HCV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of antibody microarray and gene silencing represents a novel, system-wide approach for the understanding of infectious disease biology and can be expected to provide a strong basis for the development of urgently needed lead compounds against not only viruses but also any intracellular pathogens of bacterial or protist taxons.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
