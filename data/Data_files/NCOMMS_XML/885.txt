Allosteric cross-talk in chromatin can mediate drug-drug synergy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Exploitation of drugdrug synergism and allostery could yield superior therapies by capitalizing on the immensely diverse, but highly specific, potential associated with the biological macromolecular landscape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe a drugdrug synergy mediated by allosteric cross-talk in chromatin, whereby the binding of one drug alters the activity of the second.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found two unrelated drugs, RAPTA-T and auranofin, that yield a synergistic activity in killing cancer cells, which coincides with a substantially greater number of chromatin adducts formed by one of the compounds when adducts from the other agent are also present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that this occurs through an allosteric mechanism within the nucleosome, whereby defined histone adducts of one drug promote reaction of the other drug at a distant, specific histone site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This opens up possibilities for epigenetic targeting and suggests that allosteric modulation in nucleosomes may have biological relevance and potential for therapeutic interventions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Therapies based on an individual drug frequently have limited efficacy with poor resistance and safety profiles1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This arises largely from the network basis of cell structure and activity, whereby numerous interacting pathways can potentially allow for compensation, counteraction or neutralization of the initial drug effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To circumvent these shortcomings of single agent regimens, much effort has been focusing on discovering drug combinations that function in a therapeutically productive fashion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combinations that act in synergy can be especially advantageous by lowering therapeutic dose, thereby diminishing off-site targeting and corresponding side effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, synergistic drug combinations have been shown to generally coincide with improved therapeutically specific selectivity2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The origin of a particular drugdrug synergy can be varied, but commonly comes about via one of several general phenomena, including complementing or facilitating actions or effects that antagonize counteraction1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecular mechanism of the synergy may thus arise from targeting different molecules that do or do not interact over the course of the therapeutic event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, targeting of two different sites on a given molecule or molecular assembly may underlie the synergy, which raises the possibility that the drugdrug interaction is mediated allosterically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this scenario, there is no direct interaction between the agents, but rather the binding of one drug shifts the dynamic equilibrium of conformational substates in such a way that it influences the association of the other drug3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Largely because of the enormously diverse binding site and conformational landscape available to allosteric modulation, it has been argued that the discovery of allosterically acting drugs has special potential for developing innovative therapies4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But the challenge is first to uncover these compounds and second to define the mechanism of action, allowing for rational design strategies5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are numerous examples of well-defined allosteric drug mechanisms behind protein signalling systems, in particular G protein-coupled receptors6 and different kinases7, and also for a variety of drug metabolizing enzymes, the P450 cytochromes8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, instances of allosteric drug activities on the histone protein-packaged form of cellular DNA, chromatin, are not clear, and chromatin drugdrug interactions of allosteric origin have not been reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we characterize a synergistic impact on tumour cells mediated by RAPTA-T, (6-p-toluene)Ru(1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane)Cl2, and auranofin, 3,4,5-triacetyloxy-6-acetyloxymethyl,oxane-2-thiolate)Au(triethylphosphanium) (AUF; Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RAPTA-T is a bifunctional ruthenium agent that displays low toxicity and is proficient at inhibiting both primary tumour growth and the spreading and growth of solid metastatic tumours in mice9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This agent also has anti-angiogenic properties that likely contribute to the antimetastasis activities11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AUF, on the other hand, is a monofunctional gold compound having high cytotoxicity, which was developed more than 30 years ago as an orally administrable drug to treat rheumatoid arthritis12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recent years have witnessed a resurgence of interest in AUF as a potential anticancer or antimicrobial agent, since it has come to light that it can inhibit both inflammatory pathways and thiol redox enzymes13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Synergistic activity of RAPTA-T and AUF in cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Structures of RAPTA-T and AUF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Effect of combinations of RAPTA-T with AUF on cytotoxicity towards A2780 tumour cells (mean±s.d., n=3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) CI as a function of drug concentration (additive effect, CI=0.91.1;

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Tumour cell cytotoxicity synergism with RAPTA-T and AUF', 'RAPTA-T has sufficiently low toxicity that treatment of human ovarian cancer A2780 cells with a 30 M concentration of the compound yields no measurable impact on cell viability, whereas the corresponding IC50 value for AUF is  less_than 100 nM (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when cells are treated with both RAPTA-T and AUF, cell viability is reduced significantly relative to treatment with AUF alone (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The drug combination coincides with a synergistic impact on viability, which is maximal (over the concentration ranges tested) at approximately 62 M RAPTA-T (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we found that there is a significantly greater reduction in viability when cells are first pre-treated with RAPTA-T followed by incubation with AUF as compared to vice versapre-treatment with AUF, followed by incubation with RAPTA-T (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that RAPTA-T activity has a sensitizing effect on the tumour cells towards AUF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Synergistic accumulation of cellular chromatin drug adducts', 'We next employed inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to quantify drug association with chromatin in tumour cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of cells with either RAPTA-T alone or AUF alone resulted in substantial levels of chromatin-metal adduct formation, 139±29 pmol per g of DNA of ruthenium and about twice that level of gold, 345±138 pmol per g of DNA, for the two individual compounds (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When cells were subsequently co-treated with RAPTA-T and AUF together, the level of chromatin-bound ruthenium remained approximately the same, to within experimental error, relative to the treatment with RAPTA-T alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this co-treatment yielded a nearly threefold greater quantity, 1,006±324 pmol per g of DNA, of chromatin-bound gold relative to AUF treatment alone, indicating that RAPTA-T promotes chromatin-AUF adduct formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'RAPTA-T forms specific histone adducts on the nucleosome', 'To shed light on the chromatin site selectivity of RAPTA-T, we treated nucleosome core particle (NCP) crystals with the compound and characterized adduct formation by X-ray crystallography (Supplementary Table 1;

Supplementary Fig 4; Supplementary Movie 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This perturbation of the local environment surrounding the RAPTA-T adducts occurs in the early steps of dynamics and is accompanied by further structural alterations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the H3 C-terminus (residues 133135) that had not been resolved in the crystal structure due to its high mobility undergoes a conformational transition that culminates in multiple altered inter-histone contacts around the middle of the histone octamer (Fig 4b; Supplementary Figs 5 and 6; Supplementary Movies 3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we observe systematic changes of the relative inter-helical orientations, which involve the H2A and H3/H3 -helices and connect them via a network of subtle structural modifications that link the RU1/RU2 and the AU1/AU1 adduct sites (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These specific RAPTA-mediated alterations in the conformation and dynamics of the histone octamer are seen for both the RAPTA-TNCP and RAPTA-T/AUFNCP systems, but are neither observed for the native NCP nor the AUFNCP systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Conformational changes induced by RAPTA-T adducts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Snapshot from MD simulations of the RAPTA-T/AUFNCP system, showing a kink within the long -helix of H2A induced by the presence of RAPTA-T adducts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The histone proteins (grey) are shown as cartoon, highlighting the kinked H2A -helix in orange.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DNA is represented as pale blue ribbons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RAPTA-T and AUF (black) are shown in space-filling representation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Close view of the nucleosome core, showing the conformational change involving the H3 C-terminus (A135), which occurs in the presence of RAPTA-T adducts and culminates in the H-bonding of A135 with H2A K95 and H4 N64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An arrow indicates the conformational change of H3 A135, which is shown as sticks in its initial (pink) and final (red) configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bottom graph reports the time evolution along MD of the simulated systems for the distance (dA135-switch) between the C atom of H3 A135 and the centre of mass (COM) of the H4 N64 and H4 R67 residues, colour-coded according to the scale on the right.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The A135 switch occurs after 80 ns (RAPTA-T/NCP) and 220 ns (RAPTA-T/AUFNCP) and is indicated with a white bar.Full size image', 'Figure 5: Histone -helical rearrangements between the RAPTA-T and AUF adduct sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Highlighting of dynamically coupled -helices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Colouring scheme for the different NCP systems shown in the probability distributions of panels c and d.

Supplementary Tables 4 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that when RAPTA-T adducts are present, histone substituents tend to make closer, more favourable hydrophobic contacts with the triethyl groups on the phosphine and suggests that the AUF binding sites are rendered on average more compact via the allosteric influence of RAPTA-T binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Allosteric mechanism for promoting AUF adduct formation', 'To detect the presence of possible dynamic correlations between the ruthenium and gold binding sites, as well as the molecular elements that could be responsible for signal transmission between them, we performed a cross-correlation analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cross-correlation matrix calculated for the histone components of the RAPTA-T/AUFNCP system (Fig 6a) shows a peculiar pattern of correlations, which is absent when RAPTA-T is not bound (Supplementary Figs 8, 9 and 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These correlations describe a path among adjacent -helices, which allows the transfer of information from RAPTA-T binding to the AUF sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starting with the kink of the H2A long -helix (blue, panel i) that is induced by RAPTA-T binding, we find a sequence of high correlations among angles between adjacent -helices, which connect the RU and AU sites (panels iivi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the kink of the H2A long -helix is highly correlated with the orientation of the H3 long -helix (magenta, panel ii; Pc=0.86; Fig 6b; Supplementary Fig 11), which constitutes the AU1 binding site on the RAPTA-binding face of the structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This latter element is further coupled to the -helices of the H3-H3 interface (panel iii), thus reaching the AU1 site at the opposing face of the structure (Pc=0.83).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High couplings are also associated with the AU1-coordinating H3 helix and elements of the H4 histone (panel iv) that couple to the central -helices of H2A (panel v), which are in turn correlated with H2B elements (panel vi) and to the kink of the H2A -helix that is induced by RAPTA-T binding (panel i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Allosteric mechanism mediating cross-talk between RAPTA-T and AUF sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Cross-correlation matrix of the fluctuations of the C atoms (Cij) around their mean positions, calculated over the equilibrium MD trajectory of the RAPTA-T/AUFNCP system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extent of correlated (0 greater than Cij less_than 1) and anticorrelated (1 greater than Cij less_than 0) motions is color-coded according to the scale on the right.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RAPTA-T (RU1/RU2) and AUF (AU1/AU1) sites are indicated, as well as the H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 histones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Highly correlated regions are highlighted within the panels (ivi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histone protein components involved in the (ivi) correlations are shown on the right.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histones are shown in cartoon representation, with correlated residues highlighted in blue and magenta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RAPTA-T and AUF are in space-filling representation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Graphical representation of Pearson correlation coefficient (Pc) analysis used to compute the strength of coupling between the dynamics of the -helices of the histones for the RAPTA-T/AUFNCP system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highest Pc calculated between pairs of angles formed by the adjacent histone -helices are reported, revealing a correlation path that connects the H2A -helix kink, occurring at the RU sites, with the AUF sites at both the front (AU1) and rear (AU1) of the nucleosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blue and magenta dashed lines are used to indicate the correlated angles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure is rotated along the pseudo-twofold axis, showing the front face (left and middle) and rear face (right) of the NCP.Full size image', 'Given the possibility that the interaction of the two RAPTA-T adducts with each other could alter the overall dynamics of the system, or that the presence of both RU1 and RU2 adducts are required for the observed effect, we also carried out an additional MD run of the RAPTA-T/AUFNCP system with the RAPTA-T adduct at site RU2 omitted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, however, the 600 ns MD simulation shows that the single RAPTA-T adduct alone at site RU1 induces as well a kink in the long -helix of H2A, like the one observed in the presence of both RU1 and RU2 RAPTA-T adducts (Supplementary Fig 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the A135 switch, which occurs after 220 ns in the simulation of the complete RAPTA-T/AUFNCP system and after 80 ns for the full RAPTA-TNCP system, is also observed after 90 ns in the RU1-only RAPTA-T/AUFNCP system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the calculated cross-correlation matrix reveals a similar correlation pattern as observed in the simulation of the full RAPTA-T/AUFNCP and RAPTA-TNCP systems (Supplementary Figs 10 and 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the impact of RAPTA-T on altering the conformational dynamics in the nucleosome core can be achieved by just a single adduct residing in the acidic patch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The cross-correlation evidence indicates the critical role of RAPTA-T in inducing a tight cooperation among the histone components, which culminates in the transmission of the allosteric effect to the AUF sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our correlation analyses indicate that, by inducing a kink in the H2A -helix, RAPTA-T promotes the formation of highly correlated motions, thus allowing communication within the histone core and resulting in propagation of the effect of RAPTA-T binding to the AUF sites.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Crystallographic studies of proteins treated with different gold compounds, including triethylphosphine-Au-Cl, have shown that adducts form at specific histidine sites, in spite of the presence of thiol sulphur-donor groups22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In NCP crystals, there are at least five solvent accessible histidine imidazole groups available for metal compound binding14,15,16, but we only observe AUF adducts at the one type of histidine site, H113 of H3/H3 (and only when RAPTA-T is bound in the acidic patch).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have hitherto not observed metal compound binding at this site type, but these locations are unique in having a small access channel to the histidine delta nitrogen atom that is composed largely of hydrophobic histone elements (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This apparently underlies the site selectivity of AUF in binding only to this particular motif, whereby association is fostered through hydrophobic histone interactions with the triethylphosphine group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydrophobic contacts, and more generally complementarity of shape between the metal ligands and protein substituents, appear to be major driving forces behind ruthenium/osmium compound-histone site selectivity, together with the chemical nature of the coordinating group(s)14,15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The enhancement of AUF reactivity towards nucleosome (chromatin) in the presence of RAPTA-T that we observe in the NCP crystals as well as in cancer cells is apparently also a consequence of modulating hydrophobic contacts and shape complementarity to favour binding, as evidenced by the MD simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RAPTA-T binding results in dynamic remodelling of a major portion of the histone octamer in the nucleosome, which is linked to decreasing the average size of both of the H3/H3 H113 binding pockets, yielding closer and more favourable hydrophobic contacts that promote AUF association.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allosteric mechanism behind the RAPTA-T adducts promoting AUF adduct formation in the nucleosome provides a rationale for how co-treating cells with the two agents results in 3-fold higher levels of gold adducts in chromatin relative to treatment with AUF alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we have characterized an example of a nucleosome-based drugdrug synergy as well as a small molecule-mediated allosteric effect in the nucleosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is consistency in our simulation results since we find effectively the same discrete dynamic transitions occurring in any of the three NCP systems containing RAPTA-T adducts (RAPTA-TNCP, RAPTA-T/AUFNCP and RAPTA-T/AUFNCP with only a single RAPTA-T adduct at the RU1 site), and we do not observe these conformational features in either of the systems lacking RAPTA-T adducts (native NCP and AUFNCP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, a very recent MD simulation-based study showed that there are allosteric networks within the nucleosome core, which can be modulated by histone variant changes24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, it was found that substitution of just four amino acid residues in the histone-fold loop 1 (L1) region play a dominant role in yielding differential dynamics and energetics between nucleosomes composed of the ubiquitous H2A versus the H2A.Z and macroH2A variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, sites of histone posttranslational modification are disproportionately prevalent at key locations within the allosteric networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conjunction with our findings here, this indicates that there are likely to be multiple allosteric mechanisms within the nucleosome, which have the potential to modulate chromatin activity and can be influenced by even subtle chemical changes to the histone proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The allosteric mechanism at play could be dependent on the specific nucleosome binding event or alteration in question, but may involve one of either two proposed classifications7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the domino model, a sequential set of local events propagates via a well-defined pathway from one allosteric active site to the other, spatially distant, site through a network of highly correlated neighbours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, with the violin model, the binding event alters a collective vibrational mode of the molecule, transferring the signal through the whole system without a specific route.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signal transmission we observed here from the ruthenium to the gold binding sites in the nucleosome core appears to occur mainly via a domino form of events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although signal transmission does not seem to be limited to a single pathway, it is possible to identify just a few pathways with particularly high local correlations, in which the binding of RAPTA-T at the RU1 site induces a local perturbation (kink in the long -helix of H2A), creating a defined sequence of correlations among angles between adjacent -helices, thereby connecting the RU and AU sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interestingly, comparison of the stoichiometric gold versus ruthenium content in chromatin for the RAPTA-T/AUF co-treatments shows that there is more than a fivefold greater quantity of gold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the RAPTA-T/AUFNCP crystal structure, there are two equivalents each of ruthenium and gold per nucleosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RAPTA-T adducts form on only one face of the nucleosome, meaning at a single H2AH2B dimer, as a result of the symmetry-related (RU1/RU2) sites on the other H2AH2B dimer being sterically blocked due to crystal contacts14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the MD studies suggest that the allosteric impact of a RAPTA-T adduct on only one face of the nucleosome is sufficient to influence both of the AUF binding sites in a similar fashion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, in vivo, it is possible that RAPTA-T adducted and non-adducted H2AH2B dimers are exchanged between different nucleosomes25, which thereby effectively facilitates AUF adduct formation across chromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism could explain the excess of AUF equivalents we observe in the cellular chromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond this, adduct occupancy levels on a given nucleosome in the cell may differ with respect to the crystallographic studies, where high compound concentrations are used to ensure acquisition of accurate structural models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, we have observed that RAPTA compounds and certain other ruthenium-based agents form adducts first at the RU1 site14,16, and moreover occupation of this site alone appears sufficient to elicit the allosteric effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that a single RAPTA-T adduct per nucleosome would be sufficient to mediate the allosteric activity in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One additional possibility behind the disproportionately high gold versus ruthenium levels observed on the isolated cellular chromatin could relate to AUF adducts forming at sites

disproportionately high levels of AUF adducts in cellular chromatin is consistent with the nucleosome allosteric mechanism we have determined to be in operation in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The synergistic cytotoxic effect of RAPTA-T/AUF to cancer cells may also be linked to the higher chromatin adduct levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that the synergy in chromatin adduct formation is at least partially responsible for the cytotoxicity synergism, since we observe that pre-treatment of cells with RAPTA-T has a sensitizing effect on the tumour cells, and it is the RAPTA-T-chromatin adducts that would have to be initially present to promote AUF adduct accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together in conjunction with our previous related studies, this strongly suggests that adducts on the histone proteins can have a therapeutic impact14,15,16,17,18, such as the increased tumour cell cytotoxicity observed here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we had previously proposed, adducts within the acidic patch have the potential to interfere directly with nuclear factor binding and chromatin dynamics and thereby mediate a cytotoxic effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the glutamate residues involved in coordinating RAPTA-T at the RU1 site are part of a seemingly ubiquitously employed nucleosome-recognition motif that binds one or more basic residues of nuclear proteins that interact with the acidic patch19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, adducts that form here could inhibit or block the binding of chromatin associating factors, such as the regulator of chromatin condensation 1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26) and polycomb repressive complex 1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27) proteins (Fig 7; Supplementary Fig 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although AUF reacts at sites well outside of the acidic patch, an adduct at either one or both AU1/AU1 sites also alters the surface properties of the histone octamer in such a way that could influence factor binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, a model based on the structure of the polycomb repressive complex 1 ubiquitylation module bound to the NCP places the ubiquitin substrate27 in close proximity with the AU1/AU1 sites (Supplementary Fig 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the AUF adducts could also interfere with nuclear factor transactions and in conjunction with activities mediated by the RAPTA-T adduct(s) may underlie at least in part the synergistic cytotoxic effect we find for the two drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: Potential for RAPTA-T and AUF adducts to interfere with nucleosome-nuclear factor interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

which are especially favourable for structural visualization and cellular tracking, it is likely that synergies and allosteric actions in the nucleosome occur with other drug classes as well.
