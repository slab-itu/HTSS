Impairment of PARK14-dependent Ca2+ signalling is a novel determinant of Parkinsons disease  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The etiology of idiopathic Parkinsons disease (idPD) remains enigmatic despite recent successes in identification of genes (PARKs) that underlie familial PD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To find new keys to this incurable neurodegenerative disorder we focused on the poorly understood PARK14 disease locus (Pla2g6 gene) and the store-operated Ca2+ signalling pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the cells from idPD patients reveals a significant deficiency in store-operated PLA2g6-dependent Ca2+ signalling, which we can mimic in a novel B6.Cg-Pla2g6Ex2-VB (PLA2g6 ex2KO) mouse model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate that genetic or molecular impairment of PLA2g6-dependent Ca2+ signalling is a trigger for autophagic dysfunction, progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta and age-dependent L-DOPA-sensitive motor dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Discovery of this previously unknown sequence of pathological events, its association with idPD and our ability to mimic this pathology in a novel genetic mouse model opens new opportunities for finding a cure for this devastating neurodegenerative disease.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Genetic mutations in specific genes (PARKs) are thought to be the primary risk factors for familial Parkinsons disease (fPD), which comprises about 10% of all Parkinsons disease (PD) cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several PARKs have been linked to autophagic dysfunction, mitochondrial dysfunction, -synuclein aggregation and other cellular defects, which are now viewed as hallmarks of human PD1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the vast majority of PD cases are idiopathic, occurring on ageing with no distinct triggers or clear underlying mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The aetiology of idiopathic PD (idPD) remains obscure, suggesting that not all pathological mechanisms underlying this disease may have been accounted for.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To find new triggers and signalling pathways that can lead to age-dependent idPD, we focused on the store-operated Ca2+ signalling and the poorly understood disease locus PARK14, which was identified as the Pla2g6 gene5 encoding Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 group 6 (PLA2g6 or iPLA2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Distinct mutations in Pla2g6 gene (PARK14) were found to be associated with familial Parkinsonism6,7,8,9,10,11, although the underlying mechanism and the role of PLA2g6 in idPD remain unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PLA2g6 is a multifaceted enzyme that is best known for its catalytic function, which was linked to phospholipid remodelling in cells (for review see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loss of the catalytic activity of PLA2g6 was associated with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD), and results in early death in humans and in mouse models13,14,15,16,17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to INAD mutations, PD-associated mutations in PLA2g6 were reported not to affect its catalytic activity20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The question remains open as to which cellular function of PLA2g6 could be involved in human PD, and may be responsible for a PD-like phenotype that would appear later with ageing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Earlier, we discovered21,22,23,24,25,26 and others confirmed27,28,29,30,31 that PLA2g6 plays an important role in the activation of endogenous store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, besides Orai1 (store-operated plasma membrane Ca2+ channel) and STIM1 (Ca2+ sensor in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)), PLA2g6 was identified in an RNAi screen as one of the essential components of endogenous SOCE (supplementary material in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is well established that SOCE is activated on depletion of ER Ca2+ stores (for review see refs 33, 34, 35), and is crucial for their timely refilling in a wide variety of cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the role of store-operated Ca2+ signalling in dopaminergic (DA) neurons and PD remains largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This study was designed to explore the origins of human age-dependent PD from the new perspective of PARK14 and the store-operated Ca2+ signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested a novel idea that impairment of the store-dependent Ca2+ signalling function of PARK14 could be a previously unknown determinant of idPD and PARK14 form of fPD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a wide array of genetic, molecular, cellular, imaging, behaviour and other approaches for in vivo and in vitro studies in human cells and new mouse model, we discovered a major source for cellular vulnerability that can be associated with premature death of DA neurons and age-dependent PD.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'SOCE and PLA2g6 are impaired in idPD and fPDR747W patients', 'One of the requirements for Ca2+ signalling studies is the live-cell preparation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because live DA neurons cannot be extracted from the midbrain of PD patients, human primary skin fibroblasts (hPSFs) provide an alternative cellular model representing PD and control patients, which proved to be instrumental for the studies of human neurodegeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if idPD may be associated with changes in store-operated Ca2+ signalling, primary skin fibroblasts from control donors and idPD patients were obtained from the NINDS Cell Line Repository (http://ccr.coriell.org/ninds; Supplementary Table 1), and used in our studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The idPD group was represented by aged (62±5 years old) male Caucasian idPD patients with no documented mutations in the PARK genes and no family history of PD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The group of neurological control donors was represented by aged (68±8 years old) Caucasian males with no symptoms or family history of PD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Analysis of live primary skin fibroblasts (P35) from idPD and control donors revealed a significant deficit in endogenous SOCE in the cells from all idPD patients tested (Fig 1a,c and Supplementary Fig 1): on average, there was more than 40% reduction in thapsigargin (TG)-induced Ca2+ influx in idPD patients compared with the control group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SOCE in both groups was highly sensitive to diethylstilbestrol (inhibitor of PLA2g6-dependent Orai1-mediated SOCE36,37): 10 M of diethylstilbestrol produced 80±1% and 82±4% inhibition of TG-induced Ca2+ influx in control and idPD groups, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Deficiency in PARK14 and store-operated Ca2+

associated with R747W mutation in PARK14/PLA2g6 (fPDR747W) have a similar deficit in SOCE (Fig 1b,c and Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To understand which PLA2g6 function may be associated with human PD, catalytic activity and store-dependent activation of PLA2g6 was analysed and compared in the cells from control, idPD and fPDR747W patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that activation of PLA2g6 by TG-induced Ca2+ store depletion26 seen in control donors is significantly impaired in the cells from idPD and fPDR747W patients, while the catalytic activity of PLA2g6 is the same (Fig 1d,e and Supplementary Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specificity of PLA2g6 activity in both cases was confirmed by its inhibition with S-BEL, a chiral-specific suicidal substrate that discriminates PLA2g6 from all other phospholipases38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Notably, the analysis of the expression of several major components of SOCE revealed that SOCE deficiency in the cells from idPD patients was not associated with reduction in Orai1, TRPC1, STIM1 or STIM2 expression: Fig 1f and Supplementary Figs 3 and 4 demonstrate no difference in mRNA levels for these genes in control and PD patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, we found that the expression of PLA2g6(L) (a specific plasma membrane-associated splice variant of PLA2g6 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39)) is significantly reduced in idPD patients (Fig 1f and Supplementary Fig 3b), while expression of the PLA2g6(S) splice variant (which lacks exon 8b and encodes a cytosolic enzyme that was shown to be involved in lipid remodelling12) is the same, as in control donors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Thus, primary skin fibroblasts from idPD and fPDR747W patients share a striking deficiency in store-dependent activation of PLA2g6, as well as significant impairment in endogenous SOCE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'PLA2g6 ex2KO mice mimic SOCE deficiency in idPD patients', 'To determine if and how the defects in the store-dependent activation of PLA2g6 and impaired SOCE could be translated into the age-dependent PD, we sought a mouse model with targeted impairment of these specific cellular functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently existing transgenic PLA2g6 mouse models13,14,15,16,17,18 appear to be unsuitable for PD studies, as they have impaired catalytic activity of PLA2g6, which we found to be unaffected in idPD patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, PD pathology develops later in life, while the loss of catalytic activity of PLA2g6 is associated with INAD and early death in mice and humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To create a new model suitable for PD studies, we targeted PLA2g6 in a different manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that genetic deletion of the N terminus of PLA2g6 (Fig 2a) should not affect its catalytic activity (encoded by S519-containing catalytic domain in the C terminus), but may impair PLA2g6 activation by depleted stores, thus reproducing the specific deficiency that we found in idPD patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this approach, a novel PLA2g6 ex2KO mouse model was created (B6.Cg-Pla2g6Ex2-VB/J), in which exon 2 of Pla2g6 gene was constitutively deleted (see Fig 2a, Supplementary Figs 57 and Methods for details on generation and validation of this model).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of the translation initiation ATG1 (coded by exon 2), did not affect expression of (L) and (S) splice variants of PLA2g6 (Supplementary Fig 8), and did not lead to the loss of PLA2g6 protein: the presence of a cryptic ATG2 in exon 4 initiated translation and resulted in the expression of the truncated ex2KO PLA2g6 protein that lacks the first 178 amino acids in the N terminus (Supplementary Fig 9 and 10), while the rest of the molecule remained intact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: New PARK14

terminus did not affect its catalytic activity (Fig 2b), but resulted in the loss of PLA2g6 activation by TG-induced depletion of the stores (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, similar to the cells from idPD and fPDR747W patients, ex2KO mice appear to have deficiency in the store-dependent activation of PLA2g6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to emphasize that preserved catalytic activity of PLA2g6 clearly discriminates this new ex2KO mouse model from other PLA2g6 models13,14,15,16,17,18, in which catalytic activity of this enzyme was genetically impaired.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To test if PLA2g6 ex2KO mice could also mimic the defect of the store-operated Ca2+ signalling that we found in fibroblasts from idPD patients, endogenous SOCE was analysed and compared in MEFs from WT and ex2KO animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of these studies indicated that TG-induced SOCE is significantly impaired in MEFs from ex2KO mice (Fig 2d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, we found that TPEN (a low-affinity Ca2+ chelator that is known to mimic depletion of Ca2+ in ER stores40,41) activates PLA2g6-dependent (BEL-sensitive) SOCE in the cells from WT, but not from ex2KO mice (Supplementary Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the physiological role of SOCE in refilling of ER Ca2+ stores, significant impairment of endogenous SOCE resulted in constitutive depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores in ex2KO cells, as indicated by more than 50% decrease in intracellular Ca2+ release caused by ionomycin (Fig 2f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Passive Ca2+ release in response to TG application in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig 2d) was also significantly decreased in ex2KO cells (by 56±5%, P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Importantly, primary skin fibroblasts from idPD patients also appear to have significant reduction in ionomycin-induced Ca2+ release: the Ratio (F340/F380) was 5.9±0.5 (n=7) in idPD and 8.5±0.9 (n=4) in control patients, respectively (P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Therefore, PLA2g6 ex2KO mice exhibit major functional deficiencies in store-operated PLA2g6-dependent Ca2+ signalling that mirrors the pathological cellular phenotype found in idPD and fPDR747W patients (Fig 1): MEFs from ex2KO mice (i) retain normal catalytic activity of PLA2g6 (Fig 2b), (ii) have a major defect in PLA2g6 activation by depleted stores (Fig 2c), (iii) have a significant impairment of endogenous SOCE and (iv) show a significant depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores (Fig 2f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PLA2g6 ex2KO mouse model offers a unique tool to determine if and how such cellular deficiencies could lead to PD pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'iPSC-derived DA neurons from PLA2g6 ex2KO and WT mice', 'The role of SOCE in live DA neurons is obscure, so the next two questions were (i) whether SOCE is present in DA neurons and (ii) if DA neurons from PLA2g6 ex2KO mice had similar defects in SOCE and ER Ca2+, as we found in fibroblasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the role of PLA2g6 and SOCE in live DA neurons, an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) approach was used to create iPSC-derived A9 midbrain DA neurons42 from WT and PLA2g6 ex2KO MEFs (see Methods and Supplementary Fig 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Live-cell Ca2+ imaging (Fig 3a,b) revealed that iPSC-derived tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH+) DA neurons indeed have classical TG-induced Ca2+ responses (Fig 3c), including passive release of Ca2+ from the stores and SOCE that could be detected on Ca2+ re-addition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data present first evidence for SOCE in iPSC-derived DA neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the amplitude of SOCE in DA neurons appeared to be very small compared with SOCE in MEFs under the same experimental conditions: on Ca2+ addition to TG-treated cells Ratio was 0.31±0.18 in DA neurons (n=12) versus 2.39±0.16 (n=31) in MEFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, ionomycin-induced Ca2+ release in DA neurons (Fig 3e,f) also appeared to be significantly smaller than in MEFs: Ratio=0.87±0.03 (n=11) in DA neurons versus 2.66±0.21 (n=26) in MEFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small Ca2+ release was consistent with previously acknowledged low Ca2+ buffering capacity of

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'On the basis of our findings, we propose that dysfunction of PLA2g6-dependent Ca2+ signalling could be a previously unknown mechanism contributing to the pathophysiology of human PD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 7e illustrates a sequence of pathological events that could be initiated by dysfunction of the store-dependent activation of PLA2g6, which we found in idiopathic and genetically induced forms of PD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Defects in PLA2g6(L) activation by depleted stores can be due to PD-associated mutations (like in fPDR747W patient) or reduced expression (like in idPD patients) or cleavage of the N terminus (mimicked in ex2KO mice), all of which were found to cause impairment of SOCE and depletion of ER Ca2+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is tempting to speculate that the limited SOCE and low capacity of Ca2+ stores (Fig 3) could make DA neurons particularly vulnerable to additional loss of SOCE found in idPD humans and PLA2g6 ex2KO mice, thus setting the stage for their premature demise, which could be aggravated and accelerated by other factors that will be discussed below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, our studies present the unexpected discovery of a previously unknown ability of the defects in PLA2g6-dependent store-operated Ca2+ signalling to trigger autophagic dysfunction, premature loss of DA neurons in SNc and age-dependent Parkinsonism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This sequence of pathological events was validated in a novel PLA2g6 ex2KO mouse model, which mimics deficient PLA2g6-dependent Ca2+ signalling and autophagic dysfunction found in idPD and fPDR747W patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, such defects in ex2KO mice were directly associated with a marked age-dependent phenotype, which exhibits selective loss of DA neurons in the SNc and L-DOPA-sensitive motor dysfunction resembling human PD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The anatomic selectivity of age-dependent neurodegeneration in this model appears to be the best yet observed for PD-associated genetic defects in murine models55,56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Discovery of a novel causal relationship between impaired SOCE, depleted stores, autophagic dysfunction and PD-like pathology illuminates complex role of Ca2+ signalling in PD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It creates an interesting paradigm: insufficient Ca2+ entry through SOCE mechanism can be as detrimental to DA neurons as excessive Ca2+ entry through voltage-gated CaV1.3 channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This apparent duality has a simple explanation: distinct Ca2+ entry pathways regulate different cellular processes57, and apparently can be linked to different pathological hallmarks of PD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pioneering studies from Surmeiers laboratory showed that excessive Ca2+ entry through CaV1.3 channels is linked to mitochondrial oxidant stress58,59, so that the physiological pacemaker activity of this Ca2+ channel increases pathological vulnerability of DA neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Ca2+ entry through PLA2g6-independent36 TRPC1 channels was recently shown60 to be protective in a MPP+ (1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium) model of DA neuronal cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our current findings demonstrate that impairment of Ca2+ influx through the PLA2g6-dependent SOCE mechanism leads to depletion of ER Ca2+ stores, autophagic dysfunction and premature death of DA neurons, suggesting that preservation of SOCE and refilling of ER Ca2+ stores is essential for DA neuronal health and survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Why deficiency in SOCE, depleted ER Ca2+ stores and autophagic dysfunction may be particularly detrimental to DA neurons?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several reasons can be of particular importance, starting with the new empirical data demonstrating rather limited SOCE and low capacity of ER Ca stores in live iPSC-derived A9 midbrain DA neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Poor store-dependent Ca2+ signalling can increase vulnerability of DA neurons to mitochondrial stress imposed by constant pacemaker activity of CaV1.3 channels (highlighted by the work of Surmeiers group58,59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This stress can be further exacerbated by idiopathic or genetic defect in PLA2g6-dependent Ca2+ signalling and autophagic dysfunction (found in idPD and fPDR747W patients, and demonstrated in DA neurons from PLA2g6-deficient mice), which can push DA neurons over the threshold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, high demand for dopamine production makes DA neurons especially vulnerable to ER Ca2+ store depletion and autophagic dysfunction, which altogether may explain premature age-dependent demise of the nigral DA neurons in idPD patients and PLA2g6 ex2KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interestingly, distinct defects in Ca2+ signalling were recently associated with Alzheimers disease (AD) and Huntingtons (HD) disease: in contrast to PD, ER Ca2+ stores in AD and HD were found to be overfilled61,62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Bezprozvany and colleagues reported that HD can be associated with TRPC1 overexpression and upregulation of TRPC1-dependent Ca2+ entry62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, AD can be associated with a significant reduction in synaptic expression of STIM2 leading to impairment of highly localized STIM2-dependent Ca2+ entry in mushroom spines and resulting in their loss61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these findings suggest a rather high specificity of distinct Ca2+ signalling pathways for specific forms of neurodegeneration: pathological changes in expression or function of PLA2g6, Orai1, TRPC1, STIM1, STIM2 or other molecules can affect distinct mechanisms of Ca2+ entry and/or storage, and lead to pathological changes in neurons (or distinct neuronal structures) that are most vulnerable to each specific defect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The results of genetic and molecular manipulations with distinct molecules involved in SOCE presented new clues for the causality of PLA2g6(L)-dependent Ca2+ signalling events leading to autophagic dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that genetic ablation of Orai1 (in MEFs from Orai1KO mice) mimics impairment of SOCE, ER store depletion and autophagic dysfunction found in PLA2g6 ex2KO MEFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar autophagic dysfunction can be also produced by TG, which inhibits SERCA and depletes ER Ca2+ stores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in contrast to TG, which activates SOCE, there is a significant loss of SOCE in Orai1KO and PLA2g6 ex2KO cells that have normal cytosolic Ca2+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, PLA2g6-dependent depletion of Ca2+ stores (rather than actual reduction in SOCE) is most likely to be responsible for autophagic dysfunction, and loss of DA neurons in SNc leading to PD, as illustrated by the sequence of pathological processes proposed in Fig 7e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Impairment of the store-operated Ca2+ signalling might trigger or accelerate other pathological processes that are detrimental to DA neurons beyond the impairment of autophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, significant depletion of ER Ca2+ stores can also cause ER stress63 and unfolded protein response that plays important role in neurodegeneration64,65,66.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to emphasize that since PLA2g6-dependent Ca2+ signalling appears to be upstream of both autophagy and the unfolded protein response, its deficiency in DA neurons can contribute to (or set the stage for) aggregation to human -synuclein and Lewy body formation, which is a diagnostic hallmark of PD47,50,51,64,67,68, and can be found in patients with familial PARK14 mutations7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The late life onset of idPD and the late onset of PD-like phenotype in PLA2g6 ex2KO mouse model indicate that additional age-dependent processes participate in the final demise of DA neurons that are put at risk by insufficient store-operated Ca2+ signalling (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and/or protein misfolding are the hallmarks of a normal ageing process44, and while they do not by themselves cause PD in ageing WT mice, they may become lethal for DA neurons weakened by PLA2g6 deficiency, sustained Ca2+ store depletion and autophagic dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is appealing to speculate that idiopathic or genetic loss of PLA2g6-dependent SOCE function could be especially detrimental to DA neurons, which are physiologically weakened by excessive mitochondrial oxidant stress due to the life-long pacemaker activity of CaV1.3 channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study supports the idea of nigrostriatal degenerative processes as a complex phenomenon43,56,69 that goes beyond mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative damage and/or defects in protein degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that impairment of PLA2g6-dependent store-operated Ca2+ signalling can initiate or in tandem with other age-related processes exacerbate a sequence of pathological events leading to demise of specific DA neurons in SNc, and resulting in PD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Altogether, our study presents empirical evidence for a previously unknown link between PARK14/PLA2g6, SOCE and human PD, and the data provide strong support for our conclusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we found that primary skin fibroblasts from idPD patients have a characteristic cellular phenotype with pronounced deficiency in SOCE and significant autophagic dysfunction (Figs 1 and 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we demonstrated that such idPD phenotype (impaired SOCE and autophagic dysfunction) can be rescued by simple overexpression of the functional PLA2g6(L) (Fig 7c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the cells from fPD patient carrying PLA2g6R747W mutation have the same cellular phenotype (loss of PLA2g6 activation by the stores, deficient SOCE, depleted stores and autophagic dysfunction) as we found in idPD patients (Figs 1 and 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, human PD-associated mutations in PARK14 (F72L and R747W) appeared to be sufficient to impair SOCE, deplete the stores and cause autophagic dysfunction (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourth, cellular phenotype of human idPD and PARK14 fPD patients can be mimicked by targeted impairment of PLA2g6 function in a new transgenic mouse model (Figs 1, 2 and 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, impairment of SOCE and depletion of Ca2+ stores was found not only in fibroblasts but also in iPSC-derived A9 midbrain DA neurons from PLA2g6 ex2KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
