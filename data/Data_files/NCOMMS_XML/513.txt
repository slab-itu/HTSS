Optical patterning of trapped charge in nitrogen-doped diamond  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond is emerging as a promising platform for solid-state quantum information processing and nanoscale metrology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of interest in these applications is the manipulation of the NV charge, which can be attained by optical excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we use two-colour optical microscopy to investigate the dynamics of NV photo-ionization, charge diffusion and trapping in type-1b diamond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We combine fixed-point laser excitation and scanning fluorescence imaging to locally alter the concentration of negatively charged NVs, and to subsequently probe the corresponding redistribution of charge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We uncover the formation of spatial patterns of trapped charge, which we qualitatively reproduce via a model of the interplay between photo-excited carriers and atomic defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, by using the NV as a probe, we map the relative fraction of positively charged nitrogen on localized optical excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations may prove important to transporting quantum information between NVs or to developing three-dimensional, charge-based memories.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The future realization of quantum technologies in the solid-state largely relies on our ability to identify physical platforms compatible with the local manipulation of quantum information and subsequent transport to remote processing nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibilitypresently attracting widespread interestis the use of select colour centres and paramagnetic defects in semiconductors, including silicon1,2, silicon carbide3,4,5, diamond6 and yttrium aluminium garnets7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of interest herein is the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centre (NV), a paramagnetic defect formed by a substitutional nitrogen immediately adjacent to a vacant site in the diamond lattice8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the last decade, extensive studies have demonstrated the use of the NV (and neighbouring nuclear and electronic spins) as a valuable resource to locally store and process quantum information6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, chains of spin-active defects9,10 and spin-photon entanglement11 are being explored as possible routes to communicate distant NVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these architectures, quantum-state transport is mediated by the dipolar couplings between the spins in the chain or by spin-encoded photons propagating through a photonic network, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An alternate approach to defect networking could rely on the use of electrons photo-generated from separate, non-interacting NVs, as proposed recently12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, prior work on the ionization dynamics of individual defects demonstrates that the NV charge state can be controlled optically13,14, thus prompting one to view the nitrogen-vacancy centre alternatively as a source of photons or charge carriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regrettably, no prior work exists on the transport of charge carriers between NVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, the charge exchange between NVs and nitrogen donorsoften invoked when explaining the origin of the NV excess electronhas not yet been experimentally probed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we use two-colour fluorescence microscopy to selectively examine the spatial distribution of negatively charged NVs on local optical excitation of type-1b diamond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that carrier diffusion and subsequent trapping of photo-generated electrons and holes results in the emergence of singular patterns of trapped charge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we demonstrate that intense, fixed-point illumination at select wavelengths affects the NV concentration non-locally to produce regions of the crystal where the content of trapped charge is either enhanced or depleted relative to the background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the resulting NV distribution is mostly insensitive to the initial conditions, and arises from a subtle interplay between carrier photo-generation and trapping rates, electron and hole self-diffusion constants, and the type and concentration of atomic defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We theoretically model the underlying dynamics and manage to qualitatively reproduce most observations.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Optical control of NV charge', 'The approach we follow in our experiments is illustrated in Fig 1 (see also Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use green (532 nm) and red (632 nm) laser light and a homemade fluorescence microscope to locally excite and subsequently image a 111, type-1b diamond crystal (40 p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nitrogen content).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Red excitation photo-ionizes the NV ensemble to produce neutral NVs (denoted below as NV0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is generally accepted that this processinvestigated at the single NV level13,14takes place via a two-step absorption mechanism comprising the consecutive excitation of the excess electron into an intermediate, excited state and then into the conduction band (Fig 1b and Supplementary Fig 2); tunnelling from an NV in the excited state to an adjacent nitrogen is also possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, neutral NVs are transparent to light at 632 nm (the zero-phonon line is 575 nm), and hence the back transformation can only take place, for example, via tunnelling from the NV0 ground state or two-photon absorption (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter processes, however, are comparatively slow and therefore, red-induced fluorescence must gradually decay as an increasing fraction of negatively charged NVs transitions to the neutral state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is precisely the observation in Fig 1c where we plot the measured fluorescence as a function of time on red illumination of variable intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidence of the red-induced conversion of NV into NV0 is presented in Supplementary Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Red-light-induced bleaching of the NV fluorescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Experimental protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On a green laser sample scanning, we station the red beam at a fixed spot for a predefined, variable time, to finally image the area via a red beam scan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the fixed-point illumination and scanning times the green beam is off.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) NV ionization takes place via a two-step process in which the excess electron is ejected into the conduction band (CB) by the consecutive absorption of two photons of wavelength 632 nm (steps 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NV0 recharging takes place on absorption of an electron from the valence band (VB) following excitation with 575 nm (steps 3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) The central figure displays the sample fluorescence as a function of the red illumination time tR for three different excitation powers before the readout scan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The top/down inserts correspond to fluorescence images obtained on scanning the red beam over an area xy on the focal plane around the fixed point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time lapse tR before sample scanning is indicated in the lower right corner of each image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all images, the green laser power is 750 W; note that the red laser power is 500 W during tR and 100 W during the readout scanning, thus leading to different fluorescence intensities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each image has 100 × 100 pixels and the integration time per point is 1 ms both throughout the scanned images and the fluorescence time traces in the central plot.Full size image', 'At low laser powers, NV ionization takes place on a slow time scale14, hence allowing one to scan-image a vicinity of the excited area without considerably altering the local NV concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images of the system fluorescence on fixed-point red illumination of variable duration are presented as inserts in Fig 1c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We witness the formation of a 3-m-wide dark area (slightly larger than the size of the red beam, see Supplementary Fig 1) consistent with the progressive neutralization of negatively charged NVs within the excited volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that unlike red light, green excitation dynamically interconverts the NV charge state from negative to neutral and vice versa (Fig 1b and Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present case we exploit this feature to bring the NV content to a reproducible initial state, which we attain via a short, moderately intense green laser reset scan preceding red illumination (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A subject of interest in the investigation of charge dynamics in diamondlargely overlooked so farconcerns the redistribution of photo-generated carriers during and after optical excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiment in Fig 2 introduces a versatile platform to tackle this problem: Following green light scanning, we repeatedly bleach the area of interest via several consecutive red laser sweeps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images before and after red illumination (Fig 2b,c, respectively) show a considerable reduction of the NV fluorescence, as anticipated from Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then park the red laser beam approximately at the centre of the scanned area for a predefined time tR, to subsequently take an image via a readout red laser scan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2d,e show the results, both in the shape of a bright two-dimensional (2D) torus concentric with the laser excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The outer torus radius increases logarithmically with tR, while the inner radius remains approximately constant (Fig 2h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: NV formation during fixed-point, red-light excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Experimental protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A scanning green beam brings a predefined sample area to a well-defined reference configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On partially bleaching the sample through repeated red beam scanning, the red laser is focused on an arbitrary (but fixed) point for a time tR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, a fluorescence image is acquired via a readout scan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Reference fluorescence image as obtained immediately after the green laser reset scan;

All parameters as listed in Supplementary Table 1.Full size image', 'To quantitatively interpret our observations we adapt the set of equations (1, 2, 3, 4) to green excitation (Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculated result for fixed-point illumination of duration tG is presented in the upper graph of Fig 3c, assuming that the photo-ionization rates of neutral and negatively charged NVs are identical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Best agreement with the experiment is attained using the nitrogen photo-ionization rate kN30 kHz and the NV hole capture rate  kHz m3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the condition  can be anticipated since the NV0 is a neutral electron trap whereas the NV electrostatically attracts holes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, we caution that the many degrees of freedom governing the system dynamics introduces considerable uncertainty in the numerical values extracted from our model, which, correspondingly, must be interpreted as a rough estimate (see Supplementary Note 2, and Supplementary Figs 4 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The numerical results of Fig 3c explicitly take into account the charge dynamics during the final readout scan required to form an image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This latter step is inconsequential when the illumination intensity is sufficiently weak because the scanning-induced NV ionization is negligible in this limit, meaning that the observed fluorescence count is directly proportional to the local NV concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The situation changes in the opposite regime of intense beam scanning, because the red-induced bleaching of the local NV fluorescence also depends on the charge state of nitrogen defects in the area: Faster NV bleaching rates are to be expected in parts of the crystal where most nitrogen impurities have been previously ionized because excess electrons can be removed more quickly from the group of illuminated NVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This scenario is experimentally and numerically confirmed in the lower 2D graphs of Fig 3b,c where the more intense readout scan makes the fluorescence patterns take an inverted shape, with a local minimum at the centre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We will show later that the notion of an environment-sensitive NV bleaching rate can be generalized to obtain a map of the positively charged nitrogen concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A remarkable feature observed in the formation of these patterns is that the resulting charge distribution is mostly independent of the initial conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This behaviour is vividly demonstrated in Fig 4 where we bleach only half of the scanned area and excite a point at the interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that both for red (Fig 4b) and green (Fig 4c) fixed-point illumination, the emerging pattern is almost identical on both halves of the scanned area, despite the very dissimilar initial concentrations of NV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we note that the left half of the red-induced torusbrighter than the background in Fig 2d,enow takes the form of a dimmer half-ring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Something similar can be said about the green-induced halo of Fig 4c, less bright than the background in the unbleached half of the crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Pattern formation in the presence of heterogeneous NV content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) After initializing with a (green) reset scan, we ionize NV on half the sample area via a strong (red) bleach scan; we then focus either the red or green laser to a point approximately at the centre for a fixed time interval, and finally image the result via (a low-intensity red) readout scan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Fluorescence image on application of the protocol in a using red, fixed-point excitation during tR=10 s.

reasonably well by solving the set of coupled differential equations presented above (Fig 4d,e), although some subtle discrepancies hint at underlying dynamics somewhat overlooked by our model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Best agreement is attained in the case of green fixed-point excitation where the numerical simulation correctly produces a bright, 3-m-diameter disk surrounded by a flat halo of intermediate NV concentration on both halves of the imaged area (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photo-excited NV centres and nitrogen impurities play different roles in generating the observed pattern: diffusing carriers produced by the former tend to lower the overall halo brightness because holes are preferentially attracted to NV centres, whereas electrons tend to get trapped by positive nitrogen ions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is the extra influx of electrons from photo-ionized nitrogen that somewhat increases the NV concentration in the halo to a level above that observed in the pre-bleached half.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The pattern in Fig 4b is, however, more puzzling because solely electrons are (presumably) being generated by red, fixed-point excitation, which can only increase the NV concentration of the area surrounding the beam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This intuitive prediction contrasts with the experiment, and suggests the existence of concealed mechanisms of NV depletion, likely via the absorption of holes originating from a red-induced reconversion of NV0 into NV in the illuminated area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, good agreement with our observations can be attained by assuming only a low probability of reconversion of NV0 into NV (that is, , compare Fig 4b,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that even a small k0 value can have a substantial effect, given the relatively large hole capture rate of the NV compared with N0, at least in part, a consequence of the electrostatic attraction present only in the case of the NV centre (from Fig 4c,e we find  kHz m3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We warn that the generation of holes could also originate from other defects not contemplated in our model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides some possible nitrogen complexeslikely coexisting with the more abundant substitutional nitrogen defectone candidate is the silicon-vacancy (SiV) centre, present in this sample at a concentration of 6 p.p.b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (see the Methods section and Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SiV is known to exist in the negative and neutral charge states, with zero-phonon lines at 737 nm (1.69 eV) and 939 nm (1.32 eV), respectively26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another possibility is the nitrogen-vacancy-hydrogen complex, a common defect in CVD diamond known to exist in the neutral and negatively charged states25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both for the SiV and the NVH centres, red (and green) illumination can, in principle, dynamically interconvert one charge state into the other with the corresponding additional production of electrons and holes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, since the ionization rates of these defects are unknown, their impact on the observed dynamics is difficult to ascertain at this point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The way these patterns evolve with time deserves special consideration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Fig 5 shows a sequence of images recorded on green fixed-point excitation of variable duration tG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather than a widening, Gaussian-like distribution, the halo region expands radially with a well-defined front separating different NV concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of a boundary suggests that an equilibrium concentration of negatively (positively) charged NVs (nitrogen) is established on a time scale shorter than that governed by carrier self-diffusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This behaviour is analogous to that observed in reaction kinetics and is a direct consequence of the reaction-diffusion structure of the master equations governing the system dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the cylindrical symmetry in the patterns of Fig 4insensitive to the initial NV contentcan be interpreted along these same lines, since one would anticipate the equilibrium NV fraction to be an exclusive function of the ratio between the number of free electrons and holes reaching a given point, independent of the initial charge distribution between NVs and nitrogen centres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phenomenologically (upper half in Fig 5h), we find that the outer halo diameter do grows with time as , where (I) and (I) are functions of the laser intensity (see Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar response is predicted numerically for the present illumination conditions (lower half of Fig 5h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note, however, that the red-induced pattern follows a slightly different, non-logarithmic time dependence (Fig 2h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The origin of this trendgrowing with the applied laser intensity, see Supplementary Fig 6is presently unknown, though a detailed analysis seems to rule out contributions from electrostatic fields, not taken into account by our model (see Supplementary Notes 1 and 2, and Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Time

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In extending the experiments herein, the ability to control the spin of photo-generated carriers is particularly intriguing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optical and microwave pulses can be easily articulated to project the negatively charged NVa spin-1 systeminto an arbitrary spin state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, if properly initialized (for example, into the mS=1 level of the ground state), the NV could arguably be exploited as a resource for electron spin injection, provided ionization takes place on a time scale shorter than that inherent to the NV intersystem crossing (of order 1 s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether the spin polarization of photo-generated carriers survives ionization, transport and subsequent trapping (for example, in a neighbouring, neutral NV) as indirectly suggested by recent observations13 is a question of both fundamental, and practical interest, which, surprisingly, has not yet been explored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, spin-polarized electrons propagating from a source to a target NV could serve as a quantum bus to mediate the interaction between remote, in-chip spin qubits12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the use of diamond as a material platform for quantum spintronics is particularly attractive because its large electronic bandgap, inversion symmetry, small spin-orbit interaction, and low nuclear spin density promise long carrier spin-relaxation times, even at room temperature29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Systematic observations over a period of a week suggest that, once created, these patterns persist indefinitely in the absence of optical illumination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter is consistent with the large gap separating the ground state of NV centres and nitrogen impurities from the conduction band minimum (2.6 eV and 1.7 eV, respectively) and suggests that charge tunnelling between defects is limited at the present concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability to store, read and re-write classical information in the form of local patterns of trapped charge may be exploited to develop compact, three-dimensional (3D) memories, especially if super-resolution or multi-photon excitation techniques manage to bring the volume per bit below the light diffraction limit.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Experimental setup and sample characterization', 'All experiments are carried out using a custom-made, two-colour microscope as sketched in Supplementary Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excitation in the red (632 nm) or green (532 nm) is provided by a 13 mW helium-neon laser or a 2 W cw solid-state laser, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The illumination timing is set independently with the aid of acousto-optic modulators; a servo-controlled, two-mirror galvo system is used for sample scanning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample fluorescence in the range 650850 nm is detected after a dichroic mirror and notch filters by a solid-state avalanche photo detector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 0.42 numerical-aperture objective is used to focus either beam on the sample and collect the outgoing fluorescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All experiments are carried out under ambient conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To determine the laser beam shape f(r) at the focal point we reconstruct the image formed by a beam reflecting from a silver mirror placed at the sample position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end we alter the green laser path so as to bypass the galvo (see Supplementary Fig 1a); the beam shape is measured as the galvo scans the focal plane (set to coincide with the mirror surface).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting beam shapeshown in Supplementary Fig 1bhas a nearly ideal Gaussian profile, with a full width at half maximum of about 1 m.', 'The sample used throughout our experiments is a type-1b diamond from Diamond Delaware Knives (DDK).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infrared spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig 1c) is consistent with the presence of substitutional nitrogen but a quantitative determination is complicated by the overlap of the characteristic N0 peak at 1,132 cm1 with other broad adjacent lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An estimate using the method in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30 yields P0=40±5 p.p.m., with the exact value depending on the deconvolution protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low infrared absorption near 1,282 cm1 suggests that A-centresformed by two adjacent nitrogensare, if at all present, at trace concentrations31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optical spectroscopy confirms that the collected fluorescence originates almost exclusively from NV centres (Supplementary Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A distinctive peak superimposed on the red-shifted NV fluorescence emission at 737 nm reveals the presence of negatively charged SiV centres; from the peak amplitude we estimate the SiV-NV ratio to be about 0.6 %.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the absence of a peak at 741 nm indicates that most vacancies are, if present, in the negatively charged state (with zero-phonon line at 394 nm) and hence are immune to red or green illumination20,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Throughout our modelling we set the NV concentration to Q=0.4 p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This valuederived from the observed ratio Q102P between nitrogen impurities and naturally occurring NV centres in CVD diamond25also provides the best agreement between experiment and modelling (see Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'During the experimental protocols of Fig 1 through 6 the typical duration of the reset and imaging scans is 30 s. To create an NV-depleted area, the red laser (1.5 mW) is typically scanned multiple times so as to bring the observed fluorescence to a minimum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time lapse between steps typically ranges from 1 to 30 s depending on the particular protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the exact wait time between steps is not crucial because all NV patterns were observed to remain unchanged in the dark for a virtually arbitrary time (days).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Numerical simulation', 'Given the cylindrical symmetry of the observed patterns, we restrict our simulations to just the radial dimension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further simplify the equations, we assume that free carrier self-diffusion prevails over the electric forces generated by the separation of charge (for example, , where n is the electron mobility), such that electric forces can be neglected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In each simulation, the model equations are solved over a 100 × 100 m2 region for a period extending up to 100 s. These dimensions are chosen so as to enclose the observed patterns and to satisfy the requirements of the assumed boundary conditions (see Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To recreate the effect of strong red laser scanning in Fig 3c computations are carried out in two stages: during the first one, the system evolves in the presence of green fixed-point illumination from a homogeneously low NV distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting NV pattern is then subjected to a (virtual) red beam of uniform intensity throughout the simulated sample area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The model equations are solved using the numerical differential equation solver (NDSolveValue) of Mathematica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulations are repeated as the model parameters are swept logarithmically in the region of their expected values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulations that qualitatively compare the best with our observations are selected for presentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parameters of the selected simulations are detailed in Supplementary Table 1 and a discussion on the model accuracy is presented in Supplementary Note 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author on request.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
