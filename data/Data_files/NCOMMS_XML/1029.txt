An allosteric site in the T-cell receptor C domain plays a critical signalling role  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The molecular mechanism through which the interaction of a clonotypic  T-cell receptor (TCR) with a peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex (p/MHC) leads to T-cell activation is not yet fully understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we exploit a high-affinity TCR (B4.2.3) to examine the structural changes that accompany binding to its p/MHC ligand (P18-I10/H2-Dd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to conformational changes in complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of the TCR seen in comparison of unliganded and bound X-ray structures, NMR characterization of the TCR -chain dynamics reveals significant chemical shift effects in sites removed from the MHC-binding site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remodelling of electrostatic interactions near the C H3 helix at the membrane-proximal face of the TCR, a region implicated in interactions with the CD3 co-receptor, suggests a possible role for an allosteric mechanism in TCR signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contribution of these TCR residues to signal transduction is supported by mutagenesis and T-cell functional assays.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A key step in T-cell-mediated adaptive immunity is the triggering of cell-surface  T-cell receptors (TCR) by peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex (p/MHC) proteins on target antigen presenting cells1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TCR- and - polypeptide chains are encoded by genes assembled by recombinatorial assortment of V-J and V-D-J gene segments, respectively, and non-templated nucleotides added at junctions of rearrangement during T-cell ontogeny in the thymus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Encounter of particular clonally expressed TCR with cognate p/MHC ligand triggers a signalling cascade leading to a variety of cellular programmes including thymic selection, proliferation, cytokine production and differentiation into effector and memory T cells3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Whereas antigen specificity is dictated by the amino-terminal variable (V) domains of the -receptor, signalling function is mediated by the non-covalently associated co-receptor CD3,  and  dimers, which bear cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs)4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ligand binding to the TCR/CD3 complex extracellularly initiates intracellular signalling through Src kinase-mediated phosphorylation of these ITAMs6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to their signalling function, CD3 subunits are also required for stable cell-surface expression of the TCR/CD3 complex7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistic details concerning the transmission of signals from the extracellular domains of the TCR to the intracellular ITAMs are incomplete, and are the subject of considerable interest, the importance of which is highlighted by diseases associated with dysfunction of this cellular process9, the immunosuppressant role of therapeutic antibodies targeting the TCR/CD3 complex10 and the potential of synthetic TCRs towards immunotherapeutic applications11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Efforts to understand the molecular basis of TCR-mediated signalling have relied largely on biophysical, structural and functional approaches13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding of p/MHC to the TCR induces structural changes at the cytoplasmic face of the TCR/CD3 complex, as evidenced by the accessibility of a polyproline sequence in the CD3 cytoplasmic tail14, and the repositioning of Tyr residues within the CD3 cytoplasmic ITAMs from a relatively inaccessible membrane-associated form to a cytoplasmically oriented, kinase-accessible conformation15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the molecular mechanism by which p/MHC binding to the TCR is communicated to the associated CD3 subunits for signalling remains unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To gain further insight into the dynamics of TCR/MHC interactions, we employ complementary biophysical methods to examine the high-affinity B4.2.3 TCR in both the liganded and unliganded states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  X-ray structures indicate a large rearrangement of the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) loops upon binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, chemical shift mapping utilizing complementary backbone amide and side-chain methyl NMR probes reveal several residues in the C domain of the TCR, distant from the ligand-binding interface and close to a putative CD3-binding site, that show significant perturbations upon ligand binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, mutational and functional analyses suggest a critical role of these allosteric sites in signal transduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate a dynamic activation mechanism, where p/MHC recognition by the CDRs triggers conformational remodelling of interactions near the C H3 helix at the membrane-proximal face of the TCR.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'TCR binds to its pMHC ligand with high affinity', 'The B4.2.3 T-cell hybridoma, derived from a BALB/c mouse immunized with P18-I10 (RGPGRAFVTI), is sensitive to picomolar concentrations of peptide presented by the MHC-I molecule, H2-Dd (refs 16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To probe the affinity and kinetics of the interaction between the TCR and p/MHC, we first employed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) where immobilized P18-I10/H2-Dd was offered graded concentrations of the B4.2.3 TCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured affinity (KD) is 0.54 M (Fig 1a), and no binding of the TCR was detected to H2-Dd displaying the motif peptide (MTF) AGPARAAAL, a negative control (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As TCR affinities for p/MHC ligands span a wide range of KD from 0.5 to  greater than 100 M (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18), this affinity is among the highest reported for a naturally occurring TCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: TCR binds pMHC with high affinity and peptide specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

described in the Methods.Full size image', 'To explore the TCR/MHC interaction in a complementary assay, we employed sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation, which permits assessment of the stoichiometry as well as the affinity of the interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The B4.2.3 TCR interacts with P18-I10/H2-Dd strongly over a broad range of concentrations (0.120 M of each component) displaying a characteristic concentration-dependent sedimentation coefficient distribution, indicative of a greater time average of molecules in complex as a function of concentration (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The limiting sedimentation coefficient of 5S is consistent with a 1:1 stoichiometry, considering the size and shape of the individual components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strong interaction of the TCR with the cognate P18-I10/H2-Dd ligand contrasts sharply with mixtures of B4.2.3 TCR and MTF/H2-Dd (Fig 1d), both of which sediment at a concentration-independent velocity of 3.6S.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the binding affinity, we analysed the isotherm of signal weighted-average sedimentation coefficient (sw) using the sw values determined from the c(s) distributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A simple 1:1 association model with affinity (KD) of 0.23 M fits the data well (95% confidence interval: 0.140.40 M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the B4.2.3 recombinant TCR interacts with P18-I10/H2-Dd with high affinity, in two distinct biophysical assays, consistent with the high peptide sensitivity of the T-cell hybridoma in functional assays16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'TCR uses plasticity in the CDR3 loops to recognize pMHC', 'To elucidate the details of the ligand/receptor interaction, we determined the crystal structures of both free and p/MHC-bound states of the B4.2.3

#@NEW_LINE#@#  The P18-I10/H2-Dd/B4.2.3 complex formed crystals in the C2 space group and diffracted to 2.1 Å, revealing a structure with an overall orientation of the TCR on P18-I10/H2-Dd that conforms to previously elucidated general principles19,20,21,22 (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The germline-encoded CDR1 and CDR2 loops of the TCR -chain are positioned towards the C-terminal half of the H2-Dd 2 helix, resulting in a diagonal orientation mode (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting crossing angle calculated as described22 is 30°, within the range observed for the majority of stimulatory TCR/MHC complexes (22°87°; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shape complementarity index23 of the interface is 0.71 (1.0 is a perfect match), and is among the highest observed

the disposition of the CDR3 and CDR3 loops, with little alteration discernible in CDR1 and CDR2 or in the C domains (Supplementary Fig 1ad) as observed in other TCRs22,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the structures examined here, CDR3, spanning Ala95 to Lys102, undergoes a large conformational change upon ligand binding, in particular a 9.1 Å displacement of the C atom of Asp99 of the first molecule in the asymmetric unit of the unliganded TCR compared to the same atom in the liganded TCR (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The movement projects the CDR3 loop into the peptide-binding groove, and allows interactions of the Phe97 side chain with the peptide backbone of Gly2 and Gly4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is illustrated by a 9.2 Å displacement of the C atom of the Phe97 side chain from the free to bound form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CDR3, from Ser92 to Val99, is displaced inwards on ligand binding by 3.1 Å as measured at the C of His96.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the X-ray structures indicate large movements of the CDR3 and - loops upon p/MHC engagement that are critical for achieving a highly complementary interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extensive interface and hydrogen-bonding network between the - and -CDR domains with the P18-I10 peptide suggests an enthalpic compensation for the apparent entropic loss due to loop rearrangement and provide a structural basis for the measured high

for obtaining NMR assignments of TCR backbone atoms using TROSY-based methods under extensive perdeuteration of the  and -chains25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we employed a multipronged approach for assignment and cross-validation of both backbone amide and side-chain methyl resonances of isotopically labelled -chain TCR samples (outlined in Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, backbone amide chemical shifts in the 2D 1H-15N TROSY-HSQC were assigned sequentially utilizing a combination of three-dimensional (3D) HNCA, 3D HN(CA)CB and 3D HNCO experiments recorded on a triple-labelled sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, Ile 13C1, Leu 13C1/13C2, Val 13C1/13C2 chemical shift assignments were obtained from 3D HMCMCGCBCA methyl out-and-back experiments27 recorded on a selectively methyl-labelled sample28 (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Backbone amide assignments obtained using the J-correlated experiments were validated by acquiring amide-to-amide NOEs in TROSY-based 3D HN-NHN nuclear Överhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) experiments, while side-chain methyl assignments were validated with NOE connectivities obtained from 3D HM-CMHM and 3D CM-CMHM SOFAST NOESY experiments29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Close comparison of the NOE crosspeak intensities to their corresponding distances in the X-ray structure further permitted stereospecific disambiguation of the geminal Leu 13C1/13C2 and Val 13C1/13C2 resonances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the combined backbone amide and side-chain methyl assignments were cross-validated using NOEs obtained from 3D HN-CMHM and 3D CM-NHN SOFAST NOESY experiments29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach allowed us to achieve backbone amide assignments for 90% of non-Pro residues and side-chain methyl assignment of 100% Ile1, Leu1/2, Val1/2 and Ala methyls for -chain labelled TCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examples of our sequential assignment and NOESY-based cross-validation strategy for two selected regions of the -chain are presented in Supplementary Figs 4 and 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, with the addition of complete, stereospecific assignments of methyl groups to our backbone assignments we obtained a complementary network of probes towards mapping dynamics of the TCR -chain in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The backbone assignments and NOE connectivity patterns further confirm the structural features of the TCR -chain, including the identification of all conserved Ig domain disulfide bonds in an oxidized form as evidenced by the 13C and 13C chemical shifts of the four Cys residues (22, 90 in V and 141, 202 in C), as well as the observation of a single peak for all residues in the vicinity of the disulfides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resonances from several residues within the -chain CDR loops, CC loop and FG loop (Supplementary Fig 6) were absent in the TROSY spectra, likely due to conformational exchange line-broadening, suggesting the sampling of alternative environments on a sms timescale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the multiple crystallographic conformations observed for the same residues among the three TCR molecules in the asymmetric unit (Supplementary Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The NMR backbone chemical shifts are highly sensitive probes of the local environment and secondary structure of the molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of the assignments of backbone 1H, 15NH, 13C, 13C and 13CO atoms, we used TALOS-N30 to calculate the secondary structure index and found these predictions to be in excellent agreement with the DSSP31 annotation of our X-ray structure of the free TCR (Fig 3c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When provided with near-complete assignments, the detail of structural information contained in the chemical shifts analysis is highlighted by the robust prediction of the boundaries for the H3 and H4 -helices in the C domain, as well as the 310 helical segment (residues 113115) located in the linker between V and C (shown as red bars in Fig 3c, and coloured red in the diagram of Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chemical shift-derived order parameter (RCI-S2), expressed in the range 01 with 0 indicating a random coil and 1 a fully ordered backbone structure, further reveals regions of increased disorder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As opposed to the more detailed model-free order parameters32 derived from fitting 15N relaxation rates and 15N-{1H} NOE ratios that probe psns timescale motions directly, this analysis is based on a statistical comparison of backbone chemical shifts with database values for random coils using an empirical formula parameterized by comparison to molecular dynamics simulations33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among regions of the TCR -chain (lower plot in Fig 3c), the 23 loop (residues 1317) and the 78 loop (residues 6872), not directly involved in p/MHC binding, as well as the CDR1 and CDR3 loops in the V domain, all show decreased order parameter values with correspondingly increased crystallographic B-factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most unstructured region of the -chain of the TCR in solution is the FG loop located in C (residues 206225), with RCI-S2 values systematically below 0.75 for most residues and as low as 0.5 for Gly218.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the CC loop (residues 157166) shows only a minor reduction in backbone rigidity, with values in the range 0.80.9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the CC loop may still undergo dynamic motions at a longer time scale window (sms), as suggested by the missing resonances for three amides in that region due to conformational exchange line-broadening or increased solvent exchange rates.

experiment34 in which TCR was prepared with 15N, 2H-labelled -chain and unlabelled (protonated) -chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here selective irradiation of the aliphatic protons of the -chain is expected to transfer to -chain amides located at the interface with the -chain through cross-relaxation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peak intensity ratio analysis of -chain amide resonances from saturated relative to

the / interface (Gly41, Leu42, Gln43, Cys90, Phe101) and a more extended surface area on C that includes residues near the H3/H4 helix regions (Ala137, Val140, Arg187, Val188; Fig 4a,b).

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A fundamental question in T-cell immunity is the mechanism by which p/MHC engagement by the TCR is relayed to the associated CD3 subunits to initiate intracellular signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Signal transduction likely occurs through ligand-induced conformational changes in the TCR constant domains, which are then transmitted to the CD3 subunits15,36,37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such structural changes have been difficult to visualize crystallographically, because of the relatively low resolution typically seen for these regions in crystal structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NMR offers an alternative approach to identify subtle changes in the local magnetic environment of proteins and can thus pinpoint sites undergoing conformational exchange in the NMR timescale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several studies have used NMR to study the mechanism of p/MHC recognition by the TCR39,40, or to explore the binding footprint of the CD3 co-receptor subunits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early NMR studies found the interaction of CD3 with TCR in solution too weak to detect significant chemical shift perturbations41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recent work found that only a mixture of CD3 and CD3 subunits produced detectable effects on the H3 and H4 helices of the TCR C25, while a subsequent study reported weak but measurable perturbations in both C and C upon addition of CD3 or CD3, respectively26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the cytoplasmic side, NMR studies have revealed lipid-sensitive conformational changes in the signalling domains of the CD3 homodimer42 and the CD3 subunit38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we use NMR to elucidate changes in TCR dynamics upon binding to the p/MHC ligand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a complementary combination of backbone amide and side-chain methyl probes, we extensively map ligand-induced chemical shift perturbations along the TCR -chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our X-ray structures of the free and p/MHC-bound forms of the receptor, the V CDR loops that directly engage the p/MHC ligand show large changes in our NMR spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we report significant chemical shift perturbations for the amide resonances of Ser27 on CDR1, Asp52 on CDR2 and several CDR3 residues, as well as the methyl resonances of Val51 on CDR2 and Leu94, Val99 on the hypervariable loop region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, we also observe significant NMR effects on sites located near the H3 and H4 helices of the C domain, distal to the p/MHC recognition site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include the amides of Glu130 and Thr138 and the methyls of Ala132 and Ala190.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The importance of the H3 helix for signalling is further corroborated by functional data obtained for selected mutants that inhibit signalling without affecting the expression levels of the TCR, its stability or its ability to recognize the p/MHC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The potential of TCR self-association having an impact on the observed chemical shift and intensity changes is ruled out by several lines of evidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, our AUC data are consistent with a fully monomeric TCR sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the 15N and 13C linewidths are consistent with a predominantly monomeric form of the heterodimer in solution, and remain very similar over a range of concentrations from 70 to 350 M. Finally, the NMR spectra show the same slow-exchange process and changes over a range of TCR concentrations from 70 to 250 M. These results conclusively support the view that the significant distal changes observed by NMR arise from an allosteric communication mechanism, as opposed to a secondary binding site or transient dimerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Close inspection of interactions near the H3 region in the crystal structures of the free and p/MHC-bound forms of the TCR suggests a possible explanation for the observed NMR chemical shift perturbations at this site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interface between the C and C domains of the TCR is composed primarily of polar and charged residues that form a network of electrostatic interactions22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, Tyr125 in the unliganded TCR interacts with Asn133 and Lys134 in one of the three molecules in the asymmetric unit (Fig 8a) and has long-range contacts with these residues in the other two molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a displacement of the C domain upon p/MHC-binding promotes the formation of a Glu121-Lys134 salt-bridge in the bound state (Fig 8b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the side chains of Arg187 and Asp142 interact in both the free and the bound structures (Fig 8a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These structural displacements are consistent with the measured chemical shift perturbations for the Glu130, Thr138 and the broadening of the Lys134, Arg187 backbone amide resonances (Fig 5c), as well as the broadening of the Ala132 (on H3), Ala190 (on H4) methyl resonances (Fig 6b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, solution NMR mapping and X-ray structural data are consistent with a systematic reorganization of the C/C interface involving a remodelling of electrostatic interactions near the H3 and H4 regions of C. Taken together, our results provide a link between p/MHC binding at the CDR loops and dynamic changes in the TCR C domain that are critical for signalling43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 8: Sequence conservation at the C- and C-domain interface near the H3 helix of the TCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Free and (b) bound X-ray structures of the B4.2.3  TCR dimer showing a network of electrostatic interactions (dashed lines) at the interface between the - and -subunit constant domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C and C domains are shown with yellow/beige and cyan/green in the free/bound structures, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functionally important residues identified by NMR to show significant changes upon MHC binding are highlighted on the structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Sequence conservation patterns within the same regions of the C and C domains as in a,b.Full size image', 'The interface between the C and the C domains plays an essential role for the stability and assembly of the TCR heterodimer, as shown both in vitro and in vivo in a recent study44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance, residues at the C/C domain interface near the H3 helix are highly conserved across - and -chain sequences from different species, which could result from their role in stabilizing the TCR itself as well as communicating an activation signal to CD3 (Fig 8c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While Asn133 and Lys134 are not 100% conserved, residues with potential for hydrogen bond formation are retained at these positions, suggesting that the interface interactions with Tyr125 and Glu121 are crucial for TCR stability and CD3 signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A plausible structural mechanism for the transmission of conformational changes from the CDRs to the C distal sites is suggested by the observation of affected sites in the V/C linker region, in particular Val116, which shows significant line broadening in our NMR spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore conceivable that dynamically driven p/MHC-induced allosteric changes in the constant regions of the TCR, supported both by NMR data presented here and previous hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments45, could potentiate interactions with CD3 and , which, according to recent NMR studies, interact only weakly with the free TCR25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The role of the -chain in mediating these structural changes cannot be directly addressed with the -chain labelling scheme used here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, similar effects on the -chain structure are implied by the fact that most sites that undergo conformational transitions are localized near the /-interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with an earlier crystallographic study of a human TCR that revealed extensive conformational rearrangement of the BC and DE turns on C (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  46) as well as recent fluorescence47 and hydrogen/deuterium exchange studies45, which showed that binding of the cognate p/MHC ligand induces long-range effects on the C A-B loop region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structural basis of such changes at the TCR /-interface, and their impact on interactions with the CD3 co-receptor should be investigated in future studies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
