ATR inhibitors as a synthetic lethal therapy for tumours deficient in ARID1A  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Identifying genetic biomarkers of synthetic lethal drug sensitivity effects provides one approach to the development of targeted cancer therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations in ARID1A represent one of the most common molecular alterations in human cancer, but therapeutic approaches that target these defects are not yet clinically available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that defects in ARID1A sensitize tumour cells to clinical inhibitors of the DNA damage checkpoint kinase, ATR, both in vitro and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistically, ARID1A deficiency results in topoisomerase 2A and cell cycle defects, which cause an increased reliance on ATR checkpoint activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ARID1A mutant tumour cells, inhibition of ATR triggers premature mitotic entry, genomic instability and apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data presented here provide the pre-clinical and mechanistic rationale for assessing ARID1A defects as a biomarker of single-agent ATR inhibitor response and represents a novel synthetic lethal approach to targeting tumour cells.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'ATR (Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) and Rad3-related protein kinase), is a critical component of the cellular DNA damage response (DDR)1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ATR is activated by regions of single-stranded DNA, some of which occur as a result of replication stress2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oncogene activation can induce replication stress and a reliance upon an ATR checkpoint function; this provides one rationale for the use of small molecule ATR inhibitors (ATRi) as cancer therapeutics5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Potent and specific ATRi have been discovered including EPT-46464 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6), AZ20 (AstraZeneca)7, VE-821 and VX-970 (VE-822) (Vertex), some of which are currently in Phase I clinical trials5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In pre-clinical studies, VE-821 enhances the cytotoxic effects of a number of DNA damaging agents in tumour cells that have defects in the ATM/p53 pathway8,9,10,11, suggesting that ATRi might have clinical utility as chemo-sensitizing agents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in what context ATRi might be used as single agents is less clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have demonstrated that alterations in canonical DDR/cell cycle checkpoint genes (ERCC1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12), XRCC1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13), CDC25A14 and ATM15,16) have the potential to act as predictive biomarkers of single-agent ATRi sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is not yet clear whether processes beyond canonical DDR, and in particular loss of tumour suppressor genes, might also predict for ATRi sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, as ATRi enter Phase 1 clinical trials, it is clear that there is a pressing need to identify clinically useful biomarkers of sensitivity5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelling complex is composed of multiple components, including proteins such as ARID1A, ARID1B, SMARCA4 and SMARCB1 that have tumour suppressor roles17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These complexes utilize ATP to modify chromatin architecture by sliding or ejecting nucleosomes from DNA18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This activity appears to modulate a number of DNA processes including replication, transcription and DNA repair19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two primary versions of SWI/SNF have been isolated from cells, BAF (SWI/SNF-A) and PBAF (SWI/SNF-B)21, distinguished in part by the DNA-binding component of the complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BAF complexes interact with DNA via either ARID1A or ARID1B components, while the PBAF complex binds DNA through ARID2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When taken as a group, SWI/SNF components are estimated to be mutated in nearly 20% of all human tumours, making loss of this complex one of the most common alterations in cancer17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we aimed to discover clinically actionable determinants of single-agent ATRi sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using large-scale genetic screens we identified the BAF component ARID1A as a synthetic lethal partner of ATR inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We validated the synthetic lethal interaction between ATR and ARID1A using both in vitro and in vivo models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistically, we found that ATR inhibition exploits a pre-existing DNA decatenation defect in ARID1A mutant tumour cells and causes premature mitotic progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This leads to large-scale genomic instability and cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of this data, we propose that ARID1A should be assessed as a biomarker of ATRi sensitivity in clinical trials.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'RNAi screens identify ARID1A as ATRi synthetic lethal partner', 'To uncover clinically actionable genetic determinants of single-agent ATRi response, we performed a series of high-throughput RNAi chemosensitization screens where cells were transfected with a library of SMARTPool short interfering (si)RNAs and then exposed to the highly potent and selective ATR catalytic inhibitor VE-821 (Fig 1a; Ki=13 nM (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For screening we selected the p53 mutant, triple negative (ER negative, PR negative and ERBB2 negative) breast tumour cell line HCC1143, based on previous work suggesting that ATRi might have utility in TP53 mutant cancers6,9,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To model the effect of ATRi on normal cells, we also screened the non-tumour, mammary epithelial cell model, MCF12A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed that both cell lines retained a functional ATR activation pathway by assessing cisplatin-induced ATR p.T1989 autophosphorylation26,27 (Supplementary Fig 1A,B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify clinically actionable effects, the RNAi library we used encompassed 1,280 siRNA SMARTPools (four siRNAs per gene in each pool) targeting either recurrently mutated genes in cancer28, kinases, due to their inherent tractability as drug targets, and DDR genes29, given the potential for ATRi to enhance defects in these processes6,9 (Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HCC1143 and MCF12A cells were transfected in a 384-well plate format using the siRNA library.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were then exposed to a sub-lethal concentration of VE-821 (1 M, Supplementary Fig 1C) or vehicle (DMSO) for a subsequent 4 days, at which point cell viability was estimated using CellTitre-Glo Reagent (Promega; Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

150 significant (DE Z less_than 2) VE-821 sensitivity-causing effects in HCC1143 cells and 179 in MCF12A cells (Fig 1b,c and Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous observations9,12,15,16, we observed significant VE-821 sensitization associated with siRNA SMARTPools designed to target either ATR, the ATR activation factors RAD17, RAD1 and RAD9A, ERCC4 or ATM (Supplementary Fig 1D,E), giving us confidence in the results from the screens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To identify ATRi synthetic lethal effects operating in diverse genetic backgrounds, we compared the HCC1143 and MCF12A data and identified 30 siRNA SMARTPools that caused VE-821 sensitivity in both cell lines (Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis identified several novel ATR synthetic lethal partner genes involved in DNA damage/repair including those targeting components of the HR/Fanconi Anaemia pathway (FANCE, SLX4, PALB2), DNA mismatch repair (MSH4, PMS2) and trans-lesion synthesis (RAD18) pathways (Fig 1c and Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amongst the common hits we also identified seven siRNA targeting tumour suppressor genes (ATM, FANCE, GCP3, IDH1, PALB2, PMS2 and ARID1A; Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observation that silencing ARID1A sensitized cells to ATRi was particularly interesting as ARID1A is recurrently mutated in a variety of tumour types (45% ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC), 1419% gastric, bladder and hepatocellular tumours and 23% breast tumours17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We validated the ARID1A/ATRi synthetic lethal interaction using a number of orthogonal approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In HCC1143 cells, an siRNA SMARTPool targeting ARID1A-reduced ARID1A protein levels and significantly enhanced sensitivity to VE-821 (P less_than 0.0001, analysis of variance (ANOVA), Fig 1e,f) as did the four individual ARID1A siRNAs (P less_than 0.001, Students t-test, Fig 1g,h), suggesting that this was unlikely to be an off-target siRNA effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both pooled and individual ARID1A siRNAs also caused sensitivity to an ATRi currently being assessed in Phase 1 clinical trials trials, VX-970 (Fig 2a), suggesting that the synthetic lethality was not specific to VE-821 (Supplementary Fig 2A,B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess whether constitutive loss of ARID1A function, as would occur in tumours, also resulted in ATRi sensitivity, we used human colorectal HCT116 isogenic cells containing either wild-type ARID1A (ARID1A+/+) or homozygous loss-of-function ARID1A mutations (p.Q456*/p.Q456*; referred to as ARID1A/; Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In clonogenic survival assays exposure to three distinct ATRi (VE-821, VX-970 and AZ20) all significantly impaired the survival of ARID1A/ cells compared with ARID1A+/+ (P less_than 0.0001, ANOVA, Fig 2cf).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ARID1A/ selective toxicity of ATRi was also observed in short-term (5-day exposure) viability assays using all three inhibitors (P less_than 0.001, ANOVA, Fig 2gi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to our observations using ATRi, HCT116 ARID1A isogenic cells had a similar level of sensitivity to other common chemotherapeutic agents such as methotrexate and taxol, suggesting that ARID1A/ cells are not globally sensitive to exogenous agents (Supplementary Fig 2C,D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we noted that heterozygous HCT116 ARID1A+/ cells expressed an intermediate level of ARID1A protein compared with homozygous wild-type and homozygous mutant cells and exhibited an intermediate level of ATRi sensitivity (Supplementary Fig 2E,F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggested that an ARID1A gene dosage effect might possibly influence ATRi sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: In vitro ARID1A/ATR synthetic lethality.

validated the synthetic lethal interaction between ARID1A and ATR inhibition but also established that the effect was likely not restricted to cells from a breast lineage such as HCC1143 or MCF12A used in the high-throughput screens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further investigate the generality of this effect we determined ATRi sensitivity in a genetically and histologically diverse panel of tumour cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this analysis, we found that the presence of loss-of-function ARID1A mutations in tumour cell lines was associated with sensitivity to VX-970 (P=0.0059, Students t-test, Fig 2j and Supplementary Data 3), although we were statistically underpowered to confirm whether or not the synthetic lethality was any more or less profound in particular tumour types in this analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address whether the ATR/ARID1A synthetic lethal interaction was limited to human cell line models, we also studied isogenic Arid1a+/+ and Arid1a/ mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In clonogenic assays both VX-970 and VE-821 selectively targeted Arid1a/ ES cells (P less_than 0.0001, ANOVA, Fig 2k,l and Supplementary Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next compared how the observed ATR/ARID1A synthetic lethality compared with other ATRi related synthetic lethalities and other reported ARID1A-selective agents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnitude of ATRi sensitivity associated with ARID1A mutant cells was comparable, if not greater than that seen with other candidate biomarkers of ATRi sensitivity such as ATM (Supplementary Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we found that the ARID1A/ selectivity of VX-970 was also more profound than other proposed ARID1A-targeted agents such as PARP inhibitors (PARPi) or cisplatin32,33 (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We originally identified the ATR/ARID1A synthetic lethal effect in p53 mutant HCC1143 and p53 wild-type MCF12A cells and confirmed this synthetic lethality in p53 wild-type HCT116 and mouse ES cells (Figs 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggested that the synthetic lethal effect was somewhat independent of p53 status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Silencing of ARID1A using siRNA significantly sensitized HCT116 TP53/ cells to VX-970 (P less_than 0.001, ANOVA, Supplementary Fig 4A), suggesting that the absence of p53 function did not negate the ATR/ARID1A synthetic lethality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, silencing of TP53 using siRNA in p53 wild-type HCT116 ARID1A/ cells also did not alter the sensitivity to VX-970 (Supplementary Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively this data suggested that p53 might not be a key modulator of the ATR/ARID1A synthetic lethality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To address the possibility that the ARID1A/ATRi synthetic lethality might be specific to catalytic inhibition of ATR, we exploited data describing the sensitivity of 86 human tumour cell lines to SMARTPool siRNAs targeting 720 kinase-coding genes34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the presence of loss-of-function ARID1A mutations in tumour cell lines was associated with greater sensitivity to ATR siRNA (P=0.008, Median Permutation test, Supplementary Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm this, we silenced ATR using siRNA in HCT116 ARID1A/ and ARID1A+/+ cells, and found that ATR siRNA selectively targeted ARID1A/ cells (P less_than 0.05, Students t-test, Supplementary Fig 4D,E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, this data suggested that inhibition of ATR function, either by small molecule inhibition or by gene silencing was synthetically lethal with ARID1A deficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In vivo ATR/ARID1A synthetic lethality', 'We next assessed whether the clinical ATRi, VX-970, could inhibit ARID1A-deficient tumours in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do this, we generated cohorts of mice with established xenograft tumours derived from either HCT116 ARID1A+/+ or ARID1A/ cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once tumours had established, mice were treated with either VX-970 or drug vehicle for 40 days (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that, compared with vehicle treatment, VX-970 had no effect on ARID1A+/+ tumours (P=0.45, ANOVA, Fig 3b) but significantly inhibited the growth of ARID1A/ tumours (P=0.024, ANOVA, Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VX-970 treatment also had a greater impact on ARID1A/ tumours compared with ARID1A+/+ tumours (P=0.006, ANOVA, Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a subsequent experiment, we assessed whether VX-970 could impair the establishment of tumours by treating mice with VX-970 immediately after xenografting HCT116 cells, as opposed to waiting for tumours to establish before initiating treatment (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that VX-970 prevented the establishment of HCT116 ARID1A/ xenografts (frequency of ARID1A/ tumour formation=27% for VX-970-treated mice versus 73% in vehicle-treated mice, P=0.027, Fishers exact test), but had no impact on the establishment of ARID1A+/+ xenografts (frequency of ARID1A/ tumour formation=80% for VX-970-treated mice versus 87% in vehicle-treated mice, P=1 ns by Fishers exact test, Fig 3c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this experiment, early initiation of VX-970 treatment also dramatically slowed the growth of ARID1A/ tumours (P=0.015, ANOVA), but did not impair ARID1A+/+ xenografts (P=0.63, ANOVA, Fig 3e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also determined the in vivo efficacy of VX-970 in mice with established tumours derived from a tumour cell line with naturally occurring ARID1A mutations (TOV21G, ARID1A p.548fs/p.756fs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In in vitro studies, we found that the TOV21G human OCCC cell line was more sensitive to both VE-821 and VX-970 than the ARID1A wild-type OCCC cell line RMG1 (Fig 3g, P less_than 0.0001, ANOVA and Supplementary Fig 4F) and also exhibited a DNA damage (H2AX; Supplementary Fig 4G) and apoptotic response to ATRi exposure (Fig 3h,i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo, VX-970 treatment significantly inhibited the growth of established TOV21G tumours compared with vehicle administration (P=0.014, ANOVA, Fig 3jl).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the scale of anti-tumour effect in TOV21G xenografts was not as profound as in HCT116 ARID1A/ xenografts, the effect of ATRi in this setting did suggest that the ARID1A/ATR synthetic lethality could be exploited in vivo and warrants further investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: In vivo ARID1A/ATR

progression through S phase and a slower progression from G2 into mitosis (810 h after blockFig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In asynchronous cell cultures, we found that ARID1A/ cells exhibited lower levels of phosphorylated Histone H3 (Ser-10), a marker of mitotic entry, compared with ARID1A+/+ cells (P=0.035, Students t-test, Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Silencing of ARID1A by siRNA SMARTpool in ARID1A+/+

G2/M cell cycle checkpoint, a defect in the ability to separate DNA sister chromatids after DNA replication (DNA decatenation), and reduced localization of the topoisomerase enzyme, TOP2A, to DNA37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TOP2A modulates the topological structure of DNA and is critical to processes such as chromosome condensation, chromatid separation, DNA transcription and replication (reviewed in refs 38, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that HCT116 ARID1A/ cells exhibited lower levels of chromatin-bound TOP2A, compared with isogenic ARID1A+/+ cells (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition RNAi-mediated silencing of ARID1A in ARID1A+/+ cells also reduced chromatin-bound TOP2A (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that the TOP2A defect in ARID1A defective HCT116 cells was associated with an increased frequency of anaphase bridges (P=0.038, Students t-test, Fig 4e), a biomarker of defective DNA decatenation, a process controlled by TOP2A37,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TOP2A defect was also apparent amongst a panel of OCCC cell lines, where those with ARID1A mutations exhibited a reduction in chromatin-bound TOP2A, despite expressing similar amounts of total TOP2A (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that siRNA silencing of TOP2A using SMARTPool siRNAs in ARID1A+/+ HCT116 cells caused sensitivity to both VE-821 and VX-970 (P less_than 0.001, ANOVA, Fig 4g and Supplementary Fig 4I,J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Silencing of TOP2A by SMARTPool siRNA in HCT116 ARID1A/ cells led to high levels of cell death, presumably because of the pre-existing TOP2A defect in these cells (Fig 4h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It seemed possible that the defects in TOP2A localization and cell cycle progression in ARID1A mutant cells would generate an enhanced necessity for ATR function that could be therapeutically exploited with ATRi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TOP2A alleviates many of the topological problems caused by chromosomal metabolism such as catenated DNA and DNA transcription/replication interference41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It seemed possible that cell division in the presence of a TOP2A defect and a failure to adequately resolve such topological problems could cause genomic instability and ultimately impair the fitness of cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In HCT116 cell cultures synchronized at the late G1/early S phase boundary using a double thymidine block, we found that exposure to VX-970 accelerated the rate of G2 exit, so that ARID1A/ cells no longer exhibited the G2/M cell cycle progression delay seen in the absence of ATRi (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, VX-970 exposure also resulted in reduced cytoplasmic Cyclin B1 in both ARID1A+/+ and ARID1A/ cells (Supplementary Fig 4H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite both wild type and ARID1A null cells displaying increased mitotic entry in response to VX-970, ATRi exposure led to increased anaphase bridges in ARID1A/ cells compared with ARID1A+/+ (P=0.023, Students t-test, Fig 5b) an effect also observed in ARID1A mutant TOV21G cells (P=0.006 by Students t-test, Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VX-970 exposure also led to a significant enhancement in the frequency of chromosomal aberrations in ARID1A/ cells compared with wild-type cells (P=0.0007, Students t-test, Fig 5d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we found that the VX-970-induced H2AX response, a marker of DNA damage, was more pronounced in ARID1A/ cells (Fig 5f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar H2AX response was also observed in ARID1A mutant TOV21G cells (Supplementary Fig 4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ARID1A/ cells exposed to ATRi for a short period (2 h), we found an increase in H2AX phosphorylation in Cyclin A positive as well as negative cells (Supplementary Fig 5AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of VX-970-induced H2AX phosphorylation in S phase cells was confirmed by western blotting in synchronized cells as they transitioned through S phase (Supplementary Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, this suggested that the H2AX response to ATRi in ARID1A/ cells occurred in S/G2 phases (Cyclin A positive) as well as in G1 phase (Cyclin A negative) of the cell cycle, implying that processes occurring in multiple phases of the cell cycle could contribute to the synthetic lethal phenotype observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that the H2AX response in Cyclin A negative cells could be initiated in G1 itself or could be the result of DNA damage occurring during mitosis becoming apparent as cells transit into G1 during the 2-h ATRi exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also noted that VX-970 exposure caused an apoptotic response in ARID1A-deficient cells, as shown by higher caspase-3/7 activation in ARID1A/ cells compared with ARID1A+/+ cells (P less_than 0.05, Students t-test, Fig 5g) and in TOV21G compared with RMG1 cells (Fig 3i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also assessed the induction of apoptosis in ATRi exposed cells by measuring PARP-1 cleavage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Camptothecin elicited similar levels of cleavage in both ARID1A/ and ARID1A+/+ cells, suggesting both genotypes possessed a functional apoptotic response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, VX-970 caused far higher levels of PARP-1 cleavage in ARID1A/ cells than in ARID1A+/+ cells (Fig 5h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this data we concluded that loss of ARID1A function results in: (i) a defect in the ability of cells to recruit TOP2A to chromatin; and (ii) cell cycle progression defects in both S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It seems possible that these factors combined or in isolation might render tumour cells sensitive

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our data suggest that ATRi could have potential as single-agent treatments for ARID1A defective cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highly recurrent nature of ARID1A mutations in human cancer and the availability of clinical ATRi suggests that once Phase I clinical trials are complete, biomarker driven proof-of-concept trials could be instigated to assess this hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These trials could be conducted in cancer types where there is a high frequency of ARID1A mutations, such as OCCC, where standard of care therapeutic responses are limited and where few targeted approaches exist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In Fig 5i, we present a working model to explain the ARID1A/ATR synthetic lethality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There might of course be additional mechanisms that also contribute to this synthetic lethality, as highlighted earlier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we cannot find evidence for ATR activation defects in ARID1A defective cells, we cannot formally exclude the possibility that these processes play a part in the synthetic lethal effect and act in parallel to the TOP2A and cell cycle defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, cells utilizing the ALT-pathway of telomere maintenance have also been shown to have increased ATRi sensitivity44, although whether this effect operates in all tumour cells with an ALT defect is not clear45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, none of the models used here are ALT-positive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, in Fig 4, we show that ARID1A defective cells have a delayed progression through the cell cycle and specifically delayed progression through S and G2/M.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell cycle defects appear to be an inherent characteristic of ARID1A/BAF defective cells, as originally noted by others31,37; as such, it seems difficult to eliminate the possibility that some other characteristic(s) associated with reduced proliferation might also influence the sensitivity of ARID1A mutant cells to ATRi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Topoisomerase function has also been implicated in the prevention of deleterious collisions between the transcriptional and replication machineries41, potentially providing another mechanism that, if defective, could lead to a dependency upon ATR, and could explain the S phase delay in ARID1A/ cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally it is possible that loss of ARID1A, by causing alterations in chromatin structure that lead to an altered transcriptional programme, could impair the expression of other genes critical for cells to survive in the face of ATR inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study we compared the transcriptional profiles of HCT116 ARID1A/ and ARID1A+/+ cells but observed no clear defects in the transcript expression of genes known to be associated with ATRi sensitivity (Supplementary Data 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results, and previous work37 have detailed a role for ARID1A in chromosomal decatenation through the appropriate localization of TOP2A to chromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, despite this defect in TOP2A, tumour subtypes characterized by a high frequency of ARID1A mutations, such as OCCC, have been reported to have relatively flat genomes (that is, relatively few large-scale genomic alterations/rearrangements)46 compared with other gynaecological malignancies such as high-grade serous ovarian cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the TOP2A defect and flat genomes might possibility be viewed as inconsistent with one another, it is possible that the TOP2A defect in ARID1A mutant tumours has relatively moderate effects (compared with a profound homologous recombination defect for example) on the structure of the genome as it is normally kept in check by proteins such as ATR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, when ARID1A defective cells are exposed to an ATRi, chromosomal rearrangements are observed (Fig 5d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We do note that the potential for ATR inhibition to alter the genomic stability of ARID1A mutant tumours in a genotype specific manner (and therefore potentially tumour cell specific manner) might have beneficial therapeutic effects but could also have deleterious effects in driving tumourigenesis or drug resistance by the generation of new oncogenic mutations and chromosomal rearrangements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a challenge not just to the use of ATRi but is also an issue of concern when using other agents whose mechanism of action results in changes to the structure of the genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This issue could be addressed by assessing what additional processes are required to ensure that any increase in genomic instability results in tumour cell death, rather than cell survival with a reordered genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, we also note that the precise composition of the BAF complex and the influence of other driver mutations in ARID1A mutant tumours might also be important in determining the ARID1A/ATR synthetic lethality and our subsequent work will focus on assessing how the balance between the different members of the SWI/SNF complex might modulate the TOP2A defect and ATRi sensitivity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
