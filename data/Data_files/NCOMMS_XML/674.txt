Structural basis of GM-CSF and IL-2 sequestration by the viral decoy receptor GIF  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Subversion of the host immune system by viruses is often mediated by molecular decoys that sequester host proteins pivotal to mounting effective immune responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The widespread mammalian pathogen parapox Orf virus deploys GIF, a member of the poxvirus immune evasion superfamily, to antagonize GM-CSF (granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor) and IL-2 (interleukin-2), two pleiotropic cytokines of the mammalian immune system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, structural and mechanistic insights into the unprecedented functional duality of GIF have remained elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we reveal that GIF employs a dimeric binding platform that sequesters two copies of its target cytokines with high affinity and slow dissociation kinetics to yield distinct complexes featuring mutually exclusive interaction footprints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We illustrate how GIF serves as a competitive decoy receptor by leveraging binding hotspots underlying the cognate receptor interactions of GM-CSF and IL-2, without sharing any structural similarity with the cytokine receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings contribute to the tracing of novel molecular mimicry mechanisms employed by pathogenic viruses.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Throughout evolution, mammalian viruses co-evolved with their hosts and developed numerous immunomodulatory strategies aimed at countering and evading antiviral responses by the host immune system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the many different immune evasion tactics deployed by viruses, are the use of antigenic variation, latency, interference with antigen presentation, inhibition of apoptosis of viral infected cells and viral mimicry1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter is mainly deployed by large DNA viruses of the pox and herpes family, which encode viral homologues of host cytokines, chemokines and their cognate receptors as primary molecular detractors of the host immune response3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The orf virus, a 140 kb double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) virus from the parapoxfamily infects ruminants and humans worldwide causing contagious ecthyma, also known as orf, a highly spreadable skin condition characterized by severe lesions and ulcerations6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, the socioeconomic footprint of orf is estimated to be very large placing orf in the top 20 of the most impactful diseases in developing countries or poor communities with a heavy economic dependence on animal farming and agrarian activities10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection by the Orf virus through damaged skin elicits a severe and acute immune response characterized by local accumulation of T cells, B cells, dermal dendritic cells and neutrophils12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the Orf virus does not inflict systemic infections and orf is generally not fatal, it can lead to high mortality rates in young animals and children when ulcerations prohibit food intake or can drastically affect ovine flock sizes when lesions would hinder reproduction8,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The Orf virus subverts the immune response by secreting virulence proteins that inhibit or mimic key anti-inflammatory host effector molecules15, including a chemokine-binding protein (CKBP)16, an Orf virus homologue of interleukin-10 (orfIL-10)17 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-E)18, an interferon resistance protein (OVIFNR) resembling the vaccinia virus E3L gene19 and a secreted dual inhibitor of both granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-2 (IL-2), termed GM-CSF/IL-2 inhibition factor (GIF)20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The latter, GIF, is arguably one of the most intriguing viral proteins known because it targets two distinct host proteins pivotal to the hosts ability to mount an effective immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, GM-CSF is involved in the survival and activation of macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils, the maturation of dendritic cells and differentiation of invariant natural killer T cells21, while IL-2 is crucial for the maintenance of regulatory T cells, and the proliferation of B cells, memory T cells and NK cells22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GIF is distantly related to type-II CKBP (CKBP-II), also known as the vCCI or orthopox 35kDa major secreted virus family24,25,26, and displays restrictive cross-species specificity since it is able to bind ovine GM-CSF and IL-2, but not their human or murine orthologues20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the structural and mechanistic basis for the remarkable functional duality displayed by GIF has remained uncharacterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we employ an integrative structural biology approach in an effort to elucidate the structural and mechanistic principles of how a single viral protein can sequester two different host proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Via a series of cross-validated structural snapshots including the crystal structure of GIF in complex with GM-CSF, two-dimensional (2D) classifications of GIF:GM-CSF and GIF:IL-2 complexes by negative-stain electron microscopy, the ensuing three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the GIF:IL-2 complex, and modeling of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data in conjunction with multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS) measurements, we show that GIF adopts an obligate dimeric structure that can bind two molecules of its target cytokines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further show via structure-based mutagenesis in combination with interaction studies that GIF does so with high affinity using a mutually exclusive interaction site for both cytokines and plays into binding principles utilized by the cognate receptors of GM-CSF and IL-2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our findings help to unmask the molecular virtuosity gained during viral protein evolution towards new protein ligand specificities and the molecular mechanisms developed by viruses to subvert the host immune response.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Crystal structure of the GIF:GM-CSF complex', 'To obtain structural insights at high resolution into the functional duality of GIF as a cytokine-binding platform we sought to determine the structure of GIF in complex with its target cytokines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large-scale production of recombinant GIF by transient expression in HEK293T cells and subsequent purification by immobilized-metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) initially led to prohibitory low amounts of purified GIF protein and uncovered the tendency for recombinant GIF to aggregate in standard purification buffers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, addition of a molar excess of either recombinant ovine GM-CSF or IL-2 to culture medium containing secreted recombinant GIF enabled in situ reconstitution of GIF:GM-CSF and GIF:IL-2 complexes that could be purified to homogeneity for further biophysical and structural studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, crystallization trials and subsequent crystal optimization efforts yielded crystals of the GIF:GM-CSF complex that enabled determination of the crystal structure to 2.8 Å resolution (Table 1) allowing us to obtain for the first time structural snapshots of GIF and its complex with GM-CSF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Crystallographic data collection and refinement statistics.Full size table', 'Our structural analyses reveal that GIF is an obligatory dimer, consisting of two GIF subunits with an 11-strand -sandwich topology stabilized by three intramolecular disulfide bonds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two GIF protomers interact via -strand complementation mediated by strand B and the C-terminal strand K, resulting in an extended and concave -sandwich platform (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ensuing dimeric GIF assembly is decorated by long loops and two short -helices at the ends of each GIF protomer, with a dense cluster of N-linked glycans on the bottom side (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GIF dimer interface is additionally stabilized by two sets of interactions, one cluster centered around the intersheet disulfide bridge between Cys59 on strand B and Cys59 on K on either side of the twofold axis, and a second set mediated by the tips of opposing G-H loops (Fig 1b; Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, predictions of structural disorder identify the C-terminal 30 residues of GIF as intrinsically disordered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is now clear that the second half of that sequence is essential for constructing the dimeric core structure of GIF, while the first half in the JK loop could not be modeled and might indeed be intrinsically disordered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The -sandwich core of GIF is very similar to the fold representing poxviral CKBPs of the poxviral immune evasion (PIE) superfamily (Fig 2) consistent with prior predictions and structural annotations27,28,29,30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Crystal structure of the GIF:GM-CSF complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Dimeric GIF (pale green/dark green) is bound by two copies of ovine GM-CSF (blue/dark blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disulfides are shown as yellow spheres and N-linked glycans are depicted as sticks with transparent surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The missing loop connecting -strands J and K is represented as a dashed line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two-fold non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) axis present at the center of the GIF dimer interface is indicated as a black oval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Inset showing the GIF dimerization interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two GIF monomers are coloured in pale and dark green, disulfides are shown as yellow sticks and polar interactions are shown as dashed lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Inset of the GM-CSF (blue) binding epitope on GIF (green).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interacting residues are shown as sticks, and hydrogen bonds/salt-bridges are shown as dashed lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interface residues for which mutation data is available are labeled in red (see also Fig 6; Supplementary Fig 5; Supplementary Table 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c,d) Close-up view of interactions made by GIF residues R188 and K211, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Close-up view of interactions made by GIF residues R188 and K211, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) Inset displaying the WSXWS-like motif (WDPWV) present in the F-G loop of GIF, which is involved in stabilizing the final three C-terminal residues of -strand K.

two molecules of GM-CSF at equivalent interaction epitopes at the poles of the dimeric -sandwich platform (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GM-CSF employs the helix-bundle face defined by helices A and D to interact with a rather broad surface on GIF contributed by strands F, A, I and J burying 1,750 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface area (Fig 1c; Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interaction interface displays striking electrostatic complementarity with GIF contributing a highly basic surface flanking an island of aromatic residues, while GM-CSF projects a conspicuously acidic face of equal extent (Fig 1g; Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the side of GIF not involved in binding to GM-CSF displays opposite electrostatic properties in that is highly acidic (Fig 1g) and heavily glycosylated (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given the extensive interactions between GM-CSF and GIF, we wondered whether GM-CSF undergoes any conformational changes upon binding to GIF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To enable such comparisons, we determined the crystal structure of ovine GM-CSF (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural superposition of the bound and unbound forms of GM-CSF reveals that the helical bundle core of GM-CSF only undergoes rather subtle main-chain and side-chain adjustments, most notably Lys20 and Asn27 on helix A, which tilt downwards to interact with Gln41 and Trp43 on A of GIF, respectively (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Glu108 on helix D reaches out to Arg106 on the E-F loop of GIF, whereas Phe115 bends inwards to make place for His209 on I of GIF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further note that in one of the two-bound GM-CSF molecules, the N-terminal loop preceding helix A at Gln14 is disordered, whereas in the second copy of GM-CSF it swings inwards by almost 180° to align roughly parallel to helix A and interact with Phe189 and Tyr228 on GIF (Supplementary Fig 1; Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'GIFcytokine complexes are structurally distinct', 'Next we sought to obtain comparative structural information on GIF:GM-CSF and GIF:IL-2 complexes by negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) using purified complexes following co-expression of GIF with each of its target cytokines in HEK293T cells (Fig 3a,b; Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ensuing 2D class averages for the two complexes revealed particles with apparent twofold symmetry, albeit with striking differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On one hand, the 2D class averages for the GIF:GM-CSF complex (Fig 3b) agreed very well with the crystal structure for the GIF:GM-CSF complex (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, however, the particle classification for the GIF:IL-2 complex (Fig 3a) showed a drastically different assembly resembling a horseshoe-shaped structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This prompted us to proceed to a 3D reconstruction of the particle representing the GIF:IL-2 assembly (Fig 3c), which confirmed the shape incompatibilities with the crystal structure of the GIF:GM-CSF complex and revealed structural features to support a possible model representing the GIF:IL-2 complex (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 3D EM envelope representing the GIF:IL-2 complex can be interpreted in terms of a GIF dimer occupying the toe of the horseshoe mounted by two copies of IL-2 at the poles of the GIF dimer (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resolution of the 3D EM model did not allow us to discriminate the absolute orientation of IL-2, although the features of the 3D EM model strongly suggest that IL-2 is orientated with the longitude of its helical bundle nearly perpendicular to the plane of the GIF dimer (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, similarly prepared and purified GIF:GM-CSF and GIF:IL-2 complexes characterized by SAXS yielded scattering data that despite the heterogeneous glycosylation levels of the samples, support this interpretation and further show that the two GIFcytokine complexes have similar molecular weights (Supplementary Fig 3ad; Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Structural analysis of GIF:IL-2 and GIF:GM-CSF complexes by negative-stain EM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

and displays a two-fold symmetry axis centered at the GIF dimer interface, indicated as a black oval.Full size image', 'To provide additional evidence for the molecular basis and stoichiometry of the two structurally distinct GIFcytokine complexes we carried out a comparative analysis by SEC and MALLS (Fig 4a,b; Supplementary Fig 4; Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analyses show that both the GIF:GM-CSF and the GIF:IL-2 complexes are chromatographically relatively monodisperse as evidenced by the molecular weight profiles across each elution peak, and that both complexes obey a 2:2 stoichiometry assuming fully N-glycosylated proteins (Fig 4a,b; Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of a large molar excess of purified cytokine to its respective complex with GIF did not change the chromatographic behaviour of the complex indicating that the purified GIFcytokine complexes were stable and fully occupied by cytokines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along these lines and to cross-validate the consistency of the deduced 2:2 stoichiometry of the GIF:cytokine complexes, we treated a given GIFcytokine complex with a molar excess of the second cytokine partner and analysed the resultant protein mixtures by SEC-MALLS (Fig 4c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the SEC-MALLS profiles showed that the 2:2 assemblies were conserved and that the chromatographic profiles and fits were consistent with the exchange of one cytokine for the other (Fig 4c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we conclude that GIF is able to adopt well defined 2:2 stoichiometric assemblies in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-2, despite its aggregative propensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, we note that we were only able to observe chromatographically well-behaved GIF in the presence of detergent (0.15% (w/v) CHAPS), albeit as an unresolved mixture of dimers and tetramers (Supplementary Fig 4a)20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we note that glycan analyses of the two complexes unmasked very complex N-glycan profiles suggestive of high levels of sialylation, and by extrapolation expected structural heterogeneity with respect to the glycan structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: SEC-MALLS

IL-2 in soft bone marrow cell colony and T-cell proliferation assays, respectively20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To characterize the interaction between GIF and its two target cytokines kinetically and in terms of binding affinity we employed bio-layer interferometry (BLI) using biotinylated GIF immobilized onto streptavidin-coated BLI sensors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our measurements reveal that GIF binds GM-CSF and IL-2 with high affinities yet with quite distinct kinetic binding profiles (Fig 5a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On one hand, binding of GM-CSF to GIF is characterized by rather slow association kinetics and very slow dissociation kinetics leading to a KD=27 nM, whereas IL-2 binds to GIF with 60-fold higher affinity (KD=0.47 nM) that can be recapitulated by fast association kinetics and moderately

different cytokines resulting in structurally distinct complexes prompted us to explore the possible overlap between the GM-CSF and IL-2 binding epitopes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus carried out BLI

preassembled complexes (Fig 5c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that neither GM-CSF nor IL-2 were able to bind additively to GIF already occupied by the other cytokine, revealing that the cytokine binding sites on GIF are mutually exclusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In light of our structural analyses, it would appear that the binding footprints of GM-CSF and IL-2 on GIF might be overlapping to a certain degree (Figs 1 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To delineate the possible boundaries of the two distinct binding epitopes utilized by GIF to sequester GM-CSF and IL-2, we resorted to our high resolution snapshots of the GIF:GM-CSF complex to design GIF variants carrying alanine mutations at amino acids involved in the GIF:GM-CSF binding interface (Figs 1ce and 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, given the overwhelmingly positive electrostatic potential of the GIF-binding epitope (Fig 1g), we hypothesized that mutation of arginine, lysine and histidine residues involved in more than one interaction with

'The Orf virus GIF protein provides a fascinating example of viral protein evolution to enable evasion of the host immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A decade and a half after the discovery of GIF as a viral protein able to antagonize the bioactivity of both GM-CSF and IL-2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20), two distinct cytokines pivotal to the host immune response, we have presented here the structural and mechanistic determinants underlying cytokine sequestration by GIF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GIF neutralizes GM-CSF and IL-2 with high affinity by engaging the two cytokines on mutually exclusive binding epitopes on the concave surface of its dimeric scaffold yielding two structurally distinct complexes (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structural and evolutionary origins of GIF can be traced to a conserved beta-sandwich fold that serves as the hallmark of the PIE domain superfamily40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although GIF does not bear any resemblance to the cognate receptors of GM-CSF and IL-2 whatsoever, it targets hotspots and mechanistic binding principles that are pivotal to the assembly of productive complexes between GM-CSF and IL-2 and their cognate receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, GIF joins a very sparsely populated class of viral decoy cytokine receptors that are structurally distinct from the cognate receptors, as was also recently shown for BARF1 from the Epstein-Barr virus41, and the Yaba-like disease virus 2L protein42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: Schematic mechanistic recapitulation of the two possible GIFcytokine complexes.GM-CSF (dark blue) and IL-2 (orange) have partially overlapping binding sites on GIF (dark green).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of an excess of IL-2, the GIF:GM-CSF complex switches to a GIF:IL-2 complex, and vice versa.Full size image', 'The herein structural characterization of GIF now provides the structural prototype for PIE viral proteins that target cytokines, defining a distinct functional branch in the phylogenetic tree of the PIE superfamily (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most structurally characterized members of the PIE superfamily (vaccinia virus A41L (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27), ectromelia virus EVM1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30), cowpox virus vCCI (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28), rabbitpox vCCI (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29), Orf virus CKBP (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31), and the SECRET domain of the ectromelia virus CrmD43,44) are functionally annotated as bona fide chemokine binding proteins, while a third functional branch is represented by a soluble MHC Class 1-binding protein from the cowpox virus CPXV203 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar -sandwich fold, albeit with a different -strand topology, is also found in the N-terminal domain of M3, a chemokine binding protein secreted by murine -herpesvirus 68 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 8: Phylogenetic tree of members of the Poxviral Immune Evasion (PIE) superfamily with known structures.The phylogenetic tree, based on the alignment presented in Supplementary Fig 1, is generated by ClustalW2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  78) and visualized by Geneious 4.8.5 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  79).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scale bar represents the number of substitutions per site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Representative structures (Orf virus GIF: 5D28, Orf virus CKBP: 4ZK9 , Vaccinia virus A41: 2VGA, Rabbitpox virus vCCI: 2FFK, ectromelia virus SECRET domain: 3ON9 , Rabbitpox virus CPXV203: 4HKJ) displaying a variation of the PIE superfamily -sandwich fold are shown for each branch.Full size image', 'With such a wealth of structural data at hand we deemed it opportune to trace the common and differentiating structural features of the PIE superfamily (Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stunning versatility of the common -sandwich core becomes apparent when comparing the targeting (CC and CXC chemokines, cytokines, MHC class I molecules) as well as the binding epitope of ligands binding the aforementioned proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas Orf CKBP, A41 and vCCI all bind chemokines on the acidic surface formed by -sheet II, Orf GIF binds both GM-CSF and IL-2 through a basic patch present on -sheet I (Fig 9a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, although the surface charge distribution of -sheets I and II is generally conserved among PIE superfamily members, the ectromelia virus SECRET domain displays reversed surface charge properties of -sheets I and II, and differs from other viral CKBPs since it binds chemokines on the negatively charged surface of -sheet I. Conversely, -sheet I is shielded away by two loops in A41 and vCCI: one connecting -strands G and H, and the second present at the C-terminal end of both proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GH loop serves a different role in Orf GIF, where it is involved in GM-CSF binding through the functionally important Arg188 (Fig 1c) as well as stabilizing the GIF dimer through binding to the GH loop of an opposing GIF monomer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Orf CKBP, -sheet I is occupied by the extra -helix C, which connects -strands J and K. Cowpox virus CPXV203 on the other hand uses the extra C-terminal helices B and C covering -sheet I to bind into a groove formed by subunits 2 and 3 of MHC1 (Fig 9a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Helix C is not present in Orf GIF, instead it is replaced by an arginine- and proline-rich stretch of 15 amino acids connecting J and K. This loop region is predicted to be unstructured and in fact we were not able to model it in the electron density maps for the GIF:GM-CSF complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the binding specificity of GIF towards ovine GM-CSF and IL-2 most likely appeared after speciation of the Orf virus16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It thus appears that the J-K loop diverged to an -helix in Orf CKBP and an unstructured loop in Orf GIF, which allows the surface formed by -sheet I to bind GM-CSF and IL-2 (Fig 9b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 9: Structural comparison of Orf GIF with other members of the Poxviral Immune Evasion (PIE) superfamily.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Structures for Orf virus GIF (PDB code 5D28),Orf virus CKBP (PDB code: 4ZK9), Vaccinia virus A41 (PDB code: 2VGA), Rabbitpox virus vCCI (PDB code: 2FFK), Ectromelia virus SECRET domain (PDB code: 3ON9) and Cowpox virus CPXV203 (PDB code: 4HJK) are shown in cartoon representation with labeled secondary structure elements and disulfides shown as spheres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding ligands are labeled and shown as a black outline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shared secondary structure elements consist of 2 -sheets (I: -strands J, I, A, F, E, K and II: -strands B, C, D, G, H) and one common -helix linking -strands F and G present in all proteins except the SECRET domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the -sandwich, six cysteines are fully conserved throughout all PIE superfamily members, resulting in three disulfide bonds stabilizing the -sandwich core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The related Orf GIF and Orf CKBP proteins contain one and two extra -helices, respectively, which are not present in the folds of vaccinia virus A41, rabbit pox virus vCCI and ectromelia virus SECRET domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, cowpox virus CPXV203 contains two extra C-terminal -helices of which the second one is present at an equivalent position as the C-terminal helix observed in Orf CKBP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Structural alignment of GIF from the GIF:GM-CSF complex (GIF: green, GM-CSF: dark blue) with Orf CKBP bound to CCL7 (CKBP: wheat, CCL7: light blue).Full size image', 'An intriguing aspect of the PIE superfamily -sandwich fold concerns its oligomerization capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A41, vCCI, CPXV203 and the ectromelia virus SECRET domain form monomers in solution, while Orf CKBP is an obligate dimer (Fig 9a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the SECRET domain present in the CrmB gene from variola virus was also found to be a dimer47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Orf CKBP dimerizes via -sheet complementation involving its C-terminal -strand K. A similar interface involving -strand K is found in GIF dimers, where the binding between GIF monomers is further strengthened by additional interactions mediated by the G-H loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By combining an oligomeric state with binding multivalence on a single molecular platform that can engage the target molecules with high affinity into long-lived complexes, GIF appears to recapitulate well the general strategy employed by viral effector proteins and decoy receptors for inflicting a potent and efficient modulation of the host immune system within the relatively short timeframes available to them41,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arguably, what appears to set GIF apart from all other viral decoy receptors characterized to date is not only its ability to target two different cytokines but also the fact that it does so via structurally distinct assemblies (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of GM-CSF, the mechanistic consequences of its sequestration by GIF can be traced to interference with the cognate cytokine receptor binding interfaces (Fig 6b), which is likely the mechanism deployed for the antagonism of IL-2 activity as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our work contributes a novel example of the virtuosity and potency of viral effector proteins and molecular decoys to achieve immunomodulation of the host.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
