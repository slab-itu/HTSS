A tailored double perovskite nanofiber catalyst enables ultrafast oxygen evolution  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Rechargeable metalair batteries and water splitting are highly competitive options for a sustainable energy future, but their commercialization is hindered by the absence of cost-effective, highly efficient and stable catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the rational design and synthesis of a double perovskite PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+ nanofiber as a highly efficient and robust catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-doping of strontium and iron into PrBaCo2O5+ is found to be very effective in enhancing intrinsic activity (normalized by the geometrical surface area, 4.7 times), as validated by electrochemical measurements and first-principles calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, the nanofiber morphology enhances its mass activity remarkably (by 20 times) as the diameter is reduced to 20 nm, attributed to the increased surface area and an unexpected intrinsic activity enhancement due possibly to a favourable eg electron filling associated with partial surface reduction, as unravelled from chemical titration and electron energy-loss spectroscopy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), an essential but sluggish step in many energy storage and conversion processes, has received significant attention, particularly in the development of solar/electricity-driven water splitting and rechargeable metalair batteries1,2,3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, however, a large overpotential () is still required to accelerate the rate of the multistep electron transfer processes to deliver a desirable current density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The development of highly efficient OER catalysts is critical to achieving fast kinetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Precious metal oxides (for example, RuO2 and IrO2) have demonstrated reasonably high OER activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, IrO2 has been considered the state-of-the-art electrocatalyst1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the high cost prohibits their widespread use in practical applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As an alternative cost-effective catalyst with high intrinsic OER activities, perovskite oxides (ABO3, where A is a rare earth or alkaline earth metal ion and B is a transition metal ion) are of particular interest7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The substitution of A and/or B cations by ions of different radii, valencies and electronegativities has been successfully used to tailor the physical, chemical and catalytic properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, considerable efforts have been devoted to understanding the OER mechanism of perovskite catalysts, identifying reliable descriptors of OER activity, and developing highly efficient perovskite catalysts8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of systematic experiments and molecular orbital principles, the eg occupancy of surface cations has been proposed as a dependable descriptor for OER activity; Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (BSCF) with an optimal eg1.2 was identified with a landmark intrinsic OER activity, about one order of magnitude higher than that of IrO2 catalyst1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, the surface amorphization with formation of structural motifs with local order of edge-sharing octahedra was found for BSCF during the OER9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strategies such as A/B cation substitution (or doping)11,12,13,14, nanostructure engineering11,15,16 and surface treatment17,18 have been successfully applied to enhance activity and/or stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Double perovskites (AAB2O5+) were found to have stable structure during the OER due to proper O p-band centre position relative to the Fermi level19; in particular, PrBaCo2O5+ (PBC) was identified with optimal intrinsic OER activity, comparable with that of BSCF catalyst19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intrinsic activity, also known as specific activity that is defined as the surface area-normalized kinetic current density (where the surface area can be measured electrochemically20 or geometrically1,19,21), is essential to characterizing the optimum catalytic behaviour for OER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the intrinsic activity, the mass activity of the catalyst will be more crucial to the practical application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, a high calcination temperature, especially for double perovskites19,22,23,24, is obligatory for the preparation of phase-pure perovskite oxides, resulting in a significantly lower surface area and thus low mass activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, development of perovskite catalysts for OER with combined properties of high mass activity, intrinsic activity as well as durability remains a critical challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this work, we report our findings on the rational design, controlled synthesis and characterization of double perovskite PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+ (PBSCF) as a highly efficient and stable catalyst for OER, attributed to both co-doping and nanostructure engineering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A PBSCF nanofiber of 20 nm in diameter achieves 72-fold enhancement in mass activity at an overpotential of 0.37 V compared with PBC powders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our rational design of the catalyst includes co-doping of Sr and Fe into PBC perovskite oxide to enhance OER intrinsic activity and tailoring the nanostructure of PBSCF fibers to further enhance its mass activity by increasing the surface area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-doping is first applied to PBC for enhancing the intrinsic or specific OER activity (that is, the BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET) surface area-normalized kinetic current density in this work), which is validated by electrochemical measurements and first-principles calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further demonstrate the controlled synthesis of PBSCF nanofibers with diameters from 196 to 20 nm to enhance the OER mass activity and understand the nanosize effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, PBSCF nanofibers of 20 nm in diameter show markedly enhanced OER activities compared to that of the PBSCF powders, superior to the commercial IrO2 catalyst and those of recently reported advanced perovskite catalysts11,12,13,14,15,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An enhancement in intrinsic activity of the same PBSCF material with decreasing the diameter to 20 nm (ultrafine nanofiber versus micron-sized powder) is observed, which is explained by favourable eg electron filling of ultrafine nanofiber, stronger adsorption of oxygen-containing adsorbates, possible surface reduction and heterostructure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of its superior activity and stability, the ultrafine PBSCF nanofiber has potential to be a very promising candidate of the next-generation electrocatalysts for OER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work not only represents an advancement in the development of highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts for OER but may also provide insight into the effect of nanostructures on the intrinsic OER activity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Structure and microstructure characterizations', 'Double perovskite PBC has an ideal layered structure (Fig 1a) with Pr and Ba cations ordered in alternating layers along the c axis, that is, BaOCoO2PrOCoO2BaO, where the oxygen vacancies are confined only to PrO layer22,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By co-doping of Sr and Fe into PBC, ideally, Sr replaces Ba, and Fe occupies B site (Co), respectively (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the ionic radius of Sr2+ (1.44 Å in 12-fold coordination) is not much larger than that of Pr3+ (1.31 Å, extrapolated to 12-fold coordination) compared to Ba2+ (1.61 Å in 12-fold coordination)26, the structure will change somewhat by excess Sr-doping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When Ba is fully replaced by Sr, the structure changed to a simple perovskite27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To enhance the electrochemical performance while maintaining the structure, half of the Ba atoms are usually substituted by Sr (refs 23, 27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was demonstrated that Sr- or Fe-doping will change the electrical conductivity, oxygen content and thermal expansion coefficient of PBC-based cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs)27,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A synergistic effect of Sr and Fe co-doping in PBC (that is, PBSCF) for SOFC has been reported by creating pore channels that markedly enhanced oxygen ion diffusion and surface oxygen exchange24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the electrode processes on a cathode of SOFC at high temperatures are very different from those on an OER catalyst in a liquid electrolyte at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Structure and morphology characterization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic of PrBaCo2O5+ (PBC)/PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+ (PBSCF) double perovskite crystal structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) XRD patterns of PBC-0 and PBSCF-0 powders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern (obtained from region of 23 nm × 23 nm) and (d) corresponding schematic crystal structure of single unit cell of PBSCF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (eg) Bright-field TEM images of (e) PBSCF-I, (f) PBSCF-II and (g) PBSCF-III nanofibers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (h,i) FFT patterns (obtained from region of 19 nm × 19 nm and 15 nm × 15 nm, respectively) of PBSCF-III;

Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To maximize the surface area and thus the OER mass activity, a low calcination temperature of 750 °C was used for all PBSCF nanofibers to ensure that the finest PBSCF nanofiber (denoted as PBSCF-III) had a pure phase (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This temperature was significantly lower than that for other synthesis methods (Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the PBSCF-III sample calcined at 750 °C was somewhat sintered, they still appear to be nanofibers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PBSCF nanofibers with mean diameters of 196, 83 and 20 nm were obtained after calcination and denoted as PBSCF-I, PBSCF-II and PBSCF-III, respectively (Supplementary Figs 1,3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The representative bright-field transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of PBSCF-I, II and III nanofibers were shown in Fig 1e,f,g, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PBSCF-I and PBSCF-II nanofibers have discontinuous pores inside (Fig 1e; Supplementary Fig 5a) and hollow structure with continuous mesopores (Fig 1f; Supplementary Fig 5b), respectively, which were created by outward diffusion of the gases from oxidization of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and decomposition of metal precursors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By further decreasing the diameter to 20 nm, the ultrafine PBSCF-III nanofibers were solid with no observable pores, and some abutting nanofibers were sintered together (Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PBSCF-III was composed of sintered small grains, where the diameter of the nanofiber is the grain size (Supplementary Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It suggests that the diameter almost reaches the minimum limit at this calcination temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To the best of our knowledge, this is the finest diameter for reported electrospun perovskite oxide nanofibers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The double perovskite structure of PBSCF-III nanofiber with superstructure was confirmed by fast Fourier transform patterns along 110 and 221 zone axes (Fig 1h,i), even though the structure is not in perfectly layered structure similar to the case of PBSCF-0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BET surface areas of the PBSCF samples were successfully increased with decreasing the particle sizes (Supplementary Fig 6; Supplementary Table 2), that is, 1.52, 9.09, 14.72 and 18.81 m2 g1 for PBSCF-0, I, II and III, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Characterization of the electrochemical performance', 'To evaluate the OER activity, we loaded the catalysts on a glassy carbon (GC) electrode, which was mounted to a rotating disk electrode (RDE) fixture for measurements in 0.1 M KOH solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All potentials were calibrated with respect to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE; Supplementary Fig 7a; Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2a shows typical OER activity curves of the as-synthesized catalysts, together with that of a commercial IrO2 (with a surface area of 146.68 m2 g1) for direct comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data were corrected for the effect of the ohmic resistance and capacitance (Supplementary Fig 7b; Supplementary Note 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tafel plots shown in Fig 2b were obtained from the steady-state measurements30, which are similar to the plots derived from capacitance-corrected cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves (Supplementary Fig 8; Supplementary Note 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PBSCF-0 powder catalyst exhibited lower onset potential, higher kinetic current density at a fixed potential (Fig 2a) and lower Tafel slope (67 mV dec1; Fig 2b) compared to those of PBC-0 powder, suggesting that the OER activity and kinetics are enhanced by the co-doping into PBC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, the PBSCF-0 powders exhibited higher mass activity (that is, catalyst mass loading-normalized kinetic current density) and 4.7 times intrinsic activity (that is, the BET surface area-normalized kinetic current density) at =0.37 V than those of the PBC-0 powders (Fig 2c), confirming the positive effect of the co-doping on intrinsic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the effect of the Co to Fe ratios in PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2-xFexO5+ (x=0, 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2) on the intrinsic activity was investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the activities for the samples with x=0.5, 1 and 1.5 are similar, they are better than those for the samples with x=0 and 2 (Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the PBSCF-0 has a much higher intrinsic activity than that of the commerical IrO2, as shown in Fig 2c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the IrO2 has a lower onset potential, lower  of 0.394 V at 10 mA cm2disk (which is a metric related to solar fuel synthesis31; Fig 2a), lower Tafel slope (59 mV dec1; Fig 2b) and much higher mass activity (Fig 2c) than those of the PBSCF-0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relation of higher intrinsic activity but a lower mass activity relative to IrO2 is usually observed for perovskite oxide catalysts since they had a low specific surface area due to a necessary high-temperature calcination process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Electrochemical properties and structural stability of catalysts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Capacitance- and ohmic resistance-corrected OER activity curves of IrO2, PrBaCo2O5+ (PBC), PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+ (PBSCF) powders and PBSCF nanofibers in 0.1 M KOH at 10 mV s1 with a rotation rate of 1,600 r.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These curves were averaged from three independent measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Tafel plots obtained from the steady-state measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Mass activities and BET surface area-normalized intrinsic activities of catalysts at =0.37 V derived from (a);

Fig 2b), suggesting faster reaction kinetics due to the decreased feature size and improved surface area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrochemical performances, especially mass activity (Fig 2c), of the PBSCF-I nanofibers were already comparable to those of IrO2 catalyst.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By further decreasing the diameter of the fibers to 83 and 20 nm, the electrochemical performance was further increased (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PBSCF-III nanofiber (20 nm in diameter) delivered a current density of 10 mA cm2disk at an  of 0.358 V (versus RHE), and a Tafel slope of 52 mV dec1, which is much lower than those for IrO2 catalyst.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mass activity was markedly enhanced by increasing the specific surface area of the catalysts (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mass activity at =0.37 V of the PBSCF-I, II and III nanofibers was 6.3, 9.5 and 20 times higher than that of the PBSCF-0 powder, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the PBSCF-III nanofiber, its mass activity was 72 times higher than that of the PBC-0 powder, and still 2.5 times higher than that of the commercial IrO2 catalyst (where the intrinsic activity is 20 times higher).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mass activity depended linearly on the surface area for PBSCF-0, I and II samples (Supplementary Fig 10a), suggesting that they have similar intrinsic activity (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mass activity of the PBSCF-III nanofiber was greater than the value predicted from the surface area effect (Supplementary Fig 10a), indicating that the intrinsic activity of PBSCF-III is greater than that of other three PBSCF samples (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intrinsic activity of the PBSCF-III was 1.6 times higher than that of the PBSCF-0 catalyst at =0.37 V, suggesting that there are some intrinsic difference (for example, electronic structure) between the PBSCF-III nanofiber and the PBSCF-0 powder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The OER performance of the ultrafine PBSCF-III nanofiber was superior to that of the recently reported advanced perovskite catalysts with novel compositions11,12,13,14, nanostructures11,15 and atmosphere-treated surfaces17,18 in terms of iR-corrected  (i is the current, R is the ohmic resistance), Tafel slope and catalyst mass loading in 0.1 M KOH (Fig 2d, for example, =0.358 V, Tafel slope of 52 mV dec1, 0.202 mgoxide cm2disk for PBSCF-III are lower than =0.55 V, Tafel slope of 129 mV dec1, 0.64 mgoxide cm2disk for surface-modified BSCF (calcined at 950 °C under O2)18 and =0.49 V, Tafel slope of 69 mV dec1, 0.25 mgoxide cm2disk for 80 nm LaCoO3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15)), indicating that ultrafine PBSCF-III nanofiber is an outstanding electrocatalyst for OER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, chronopotentiometry was used to evaluate the stability of the PBSCF-III nanofiber catalyst for 12 h (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The potential from PBSCF-III almost remained unchanged throughout the test for initial 1 h, whereas the potential from IrO2 catalyst increased gradually.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was little observable change for PBSCF-III in the electrochemical impedance spectra and the cyclic voltammograms before and after chronopotentiometric test for 1 h (Supplementary Fig 10b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, there were no significant changes (only a small, gradual increase) in the potential during the 12 h test for the PBSCF-III nanofiber catalyst, suggesting that the catalyst has high stability under the OER condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further evidence of the stability was from TEM analysis shown in Fig 2f.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been reported that the ink preparation conditions may significantly change the surface structure of perovskites such as BSCF10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike BSCF10 but similar to the previously reported PBC19, little surface amorphization was observed for PBSCF-0 (Supplementary Fig 11) and PBSCF-III (Fig 2f) catalysts after ink preparation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No further change in the surface was observed after the stability test for 1 and 12 h (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The continuous CV measurements demonstrate that all PBSCF catalysts have relatively high stability (Supplementary Fig 12;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Increasing specific surface area by reducing particle size of catalysts is a well-known strategy to improve mass activity, as demonstrated for Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1) and SrNb0.1Co0.7Fe0.2O3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the intrinsic activity degraded as the surface areas were increased for these cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, the significantly enhanced mass activity of the ultrafine PBSCF-III nanofiber is attributed not only to the increased surface area but also to improved intrinsic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Very recently,

with the eg electron filling of 1.2 exhibited the best performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for double perovskites, the presence of octahedral (Oh) and square pyramidal (C4v) symmetries and multiple spin configurations for B-site ions lead to the difficulty in identifying their spin states19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By a first-order approximation that the Co2+ (3d7), Co3+ (3d6) and Co4+ (3d5) in the double perovskite are in high spin (HS) in the C4v symmetry, intermediate spin (IS) in the Oh and C4v, and HS in the Oh symmetry, respectively, Grimaud et al.19 proposed a relationship between eg electron filling and cobalt (B-site) oxidation state obtained by chemical titration (Fig 4a) and found higher OER activity for the double perovskites with the eg electron filling close to 1.26, almost consistent with the previously reported descriptor of surface cation eg electron filling1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Structural homogeneity and charge transfer properties of PBSCF samples.

estimated from the relationship proposed by Grimaud et al.19 (Supplementary Note 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the PBSCF-III has an eg electron filling (1.29) closer to 1.26 compared to that of PBSCF-0 (1.36), PBSCF-III has higher intrinsic OER activity than PBSCF-0 (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The B-site ion oxidation state from chemical titration represents the mean value in the entire perovskite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was reported that the oxidation states of B-site ions on the surface may be different from that in the bulk41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, scanning TEM (STEM) electron energy-loss spectroscopy line scan was acquired to characterize the variations in surface composition and charge distribution in PBSCF-III (Fig 4b) and PBSCF-0 (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Summarized in Fig 4d are the O/Pr and Fe/Pr intensity ratios, which can be correlated with the oxygen vacancy concentration distribution42 and/or surface oxygen-containing adsorbates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased O/Pr ratio from inner to exterior in the surface layer of 510 nm width were observed in both PBSCF-III (Fig 4d) and PBSCF-0 (Supplementary Fig 18a), where the Fe/Pr ratio almost remained unchanged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the O/Pr ratio variation is mainly contributed to oxygen vacancy concentration, an increased Co oxidation state from inner to exterior should be present, which means that the Co L3/L2 white line ratio decreases correspondingly43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, both PBSCF-III (Fig 4e) and PBSCF-0 (Supplementary Fig 18b) demonstrate that the Co L3/L2 white line ratio increases from inner to exterior in the surface layer, suggesting that O/Pr ratio variation is due mainly to surface oxygen-containing adsorbates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It reveals that the PBSCF-III has more oxygen-containing adsorbates on the surface compared to that of PBSCF-0, suggesting its higher adsorption ability for oxygen-containing adsorbates, which may be beneficial to OER activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, PBSCF-III has a somewhat higher Co L3/L2 white line ratio in the surface (that is, lower Co oxidation state) compared to that of PBSCF-0, which may make its eg electron filling in the surface further close to the optimal value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is difficult to quantify the Co L3/L2 ratio to understand the oxidation state due to the strong overlap with Ba M4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Fig 4b indicates an inhomogeneous element distribution for PBSCF-III, in which the Pr M4,5 white line reached the highest intensity in the near middle probe position but Ba M5,4 white line intensity is low in the corresponding position, suggesting the presence of minor heterostructure in the PBSCF-III compared to PBSCF-0 with homogeneous element distribution (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such minor heterostructure may result in a synergistically enhanced OER activity44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While the relationship between eg electron filling and cobalt (B-site) oxidation state proposed by Grimaud et al.19 is used to explain the origin of enhanced OER activity of the PBSCF-III nanofiber, there still exists some uncertainty in spin state of Co ions in double perovskite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, it has been reported that Co4+ is likely in HS state in some double perovskites45,46 and La1xSrxCoO3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  47), but the Co4+ in SrCoO3 was found to be in IS state48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the Co4+ is in an IS state and Co3+ remains in an IS state in PBSCF, then the enhanced intrinsic activity of PBSCF-III over that of PBSCF-0 will be mainly attributed to other properties (rather than eg electron filling) such as stronger adsorption of oxygen-containing adsorbates, surface reduction and heterostructure in PBSCF-III as revealed by electron energy-loss spectroscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Moreover, compared to the PBSCF-0 powders, the PBSC-I, II and III nanofibers had markedly decreased charge transfer resistance (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is different from the reported case by decreasing the size from bulk to 20060 nm nanoparticles, where the resistances of nanoparticles were relatively close to that of the bulk15, suggesting that the fast charge transfer of PBSCF nanofibers is attributed mainly to their unique nanofiber morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ultrafine PBSCF-III nanofiber exhibited the highest rate of charge transfer, much better than that of the IrO2 catalyst.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combined features of optimized structure/surface electronic structure, high surface area and ultrafast charge transfer resulted in attractive intrinsic activity and markedly enhanced mass activity for ultrafine PBSCF-III nanofiber, indicating that it is a very promising candidate of the next-generation electrocatalysts for OER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, experimental measurements and DFT calculations reveal that the A/B site co-doped double perovskite PBSCF has a better OER activity than that of PBC due mainly to the enhanced activity of the Fe site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With increasing specific surface area by reducing particle size of PBSCF from bulk to nanofibers (196 and 83 nm in diameters), the OER mass activity increased while the intrinsic activity remained unchanged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the PBSCF-III nanofiber with a diameter of 20 nm demonstrated a mass activity 20 times and intrinsic activity 1.6 times higher than that of the PBSCF-0 catalyst at =0.37 V, superior to that of IrO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The markedly enhanced OER activity and stability of the ultrafine PBSCF-III nanofiber could be attributed to the unique nanostructure, favourable surface electronic structure, high surface area, high surface oxygen species and possible presence of some heterostructures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work not only results in a highly efficient and durable electrocatalyst for OER, which may have important technological implications, but also offers new insight into the development of advanced materials by nanostructure engineering for other applications of energy storage and conversion.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
