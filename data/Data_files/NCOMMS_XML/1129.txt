Electrical gate control of spin current in van der Waals heterostructures at room temperature  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Two-dimensional (2D) crystals offer a unique platform due to their remarkable and contrasting spintronic properties, such as weak spinorbit coupling (SOC) in graphene and strong SOC in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we combine graphene and MoS2 in a van der Waals heterostructure (vdWh) to demonstrate the electric gate control of the spin current and spin lifetime at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By performing non-local spin valve and Hanle measurements, we unambiguously prove the gate tunability of the spin current and spin lifetime in graphene/MoS2 vdWhs at 300 K. This unprecedented control over the spin parameters by orders of magnitude stems from the gate tuning of the Schottky barrier at the MoS2/graphene interface and MoS2 channel conductivity leading to spin dephasing in high-SOC material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings demonstrate an all-electrical spintronic device at room temperature with the creation, transport and control of the spin in 2D materials heterostructures, which can be key building blocks in future device architectures.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Spintronics aims to exploit the spin degree of freedom in solid state devices for data storage and information processing technologies1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fundamental spintronic device concepts, such as creation, manipulation and detection of spin current has been demonstrated in semiconductors3,4,5 and spin transistor structures6,7,8,9 using both electrical and optical methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, an unsolved challenge in the field is the realization of all-electrical methods to control the spin current and spin lifetime at ambient temperature2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, two-dimensional (2D) crystals offer a unique platform for spintronics due to their remarkably broad range of spin-dependent properties10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Graphene has been demonstrated as an excellent material for spin transport and spin logic devices due to the low spinorbit coupling (SOC) and high electron mobility11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this low SOC causes a big challenge for the electrical control of the spin polarization in graphene11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, transition metal di-chalcogenides (TMDCs) are semiconductors with a high SOC, several 10 meV in the conduction band and 100 meV in the valence band, which are orders of magnitude higher than in graphene11,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, such high-SOC TMDCs also showed fascinating spin dynamics and transport properties22,23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To harvest these novel and contrasting spintronic properties of both 2D materials, hybrid devices, consisting of graphene and TMDC van der Waals heterostructures (vdWh)26,27, are proposed to be promising28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proximity-induced strong SOC of graphene/TMDC vdWhs led to the observation of weak anti-localization29,30 and spin Hall effect31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the advantage of spin transport in graphene, SOC in such vdWhs can be utilized to electrically control the spin polarization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, a spin field-effect switch has been demonstrated by using non-local (NL) spin-valve measurements in such a vdWh up to 200 K (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comprehensive understanding and advancement of 2D materials vdWh-based spintronic devices, demonstration of electrical gate-tunable spin current and spin lifetime by both spin-valve and Hanle spin precession measurements at ambient temperatures is a crucial requirement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this article, we demonstrate the electronic gate control of the spin current and spin lifetime at room temperature by using both spin-valve and Hanle measurements on graphene/MoS2 vdWh devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hanle spin precession measurements unambiguously prove the spin-polarized transport and demonstrate the electrical gate control of the spin lifetime and diffusion length in such 2D material heterostructures at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further prove that the gate-voltage tuning of the Schottky barrier at the grapheneMoS2 interface and MoS2 channel conduction facilitate the spin in graphene to interact and dephase efficiently in high-SOC material MoS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extensive spintronic and electronic measurements in different devices at various gate voltages, injection bias currents and temperatures enable us to understand the gate control of spin relaxation mechanism in such vdWhs.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'To understand the gate-controlled spin modulation, we characterized the charge transport in both the MoS2 channel and the graphene/MoS2 vdWhs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lateral MoS2 field-effect transistor shows a typical n-type transfer characteristic with an enhancement of current up to 106 times with application of Vg at room temperature (see Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a gate-tunable MoS2 channel resistance in our MoS2/graphene vdWh would allow the tuning of a parallel spin transport channel next to graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the spin current from graphene can enter MoS2 in the ON state, spins would lose their coherence at a much faster rate, due to the high SOC of MoS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Next, we investigated the charge transport in vertical graphene/MoS2 devices, to understand the transport mechanisms at the interface (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transfer characteristic of such a device is typical for n-type field effect transistors with a current enhancement of more than 102 times (ON/OFF) at room temperature (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding output characteristic shows an asymmetric line shape in the OFF state, which becomes symmetric in the ON state (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This transistor behaviour can be attributed to the presence of a gate-tunable Schottky barrier () at the MoS2/graphene interface36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined this barrier  from the temperature-dependent output characteristic using the thermionic emission model22,36 (see Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 4d shows the gate dependence of  at the graphene/MoS2 interface, which changes from 300 to 50 meV when tuning the vertical transistor from OFF to ON state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This corresponds to a gate modulation of the graphene Fermi level with respect to the MoS2 conduction band as depicted in the insets of Fig 4d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequentially, in the spin-ON state, a high Schottky barrier at the graphene/MoS2 interface and high-channel resistance of MoS2 prevents spins in the graphene to enter the MoS2 channel (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in the spin-OFF state, the Schottky barrier at the graphene/MoS2 interface is significantly reduced yielding an almost Ohmic contact, in addition to a drastic reduction in MoS2 channel resistance (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions, spins can easily enter MoS2, where they experience a much faster spin relaxation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This explains the reduction in spin lifetime in addition to the decrease in spin signal amplitude with gate voltage in our spin-modulation device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings demonstrate that the gate voltage can tune the band offset between materials having complementary spintronics properties, facilitating the spins in graphene to interact efficiently with MoS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Tuning the Schottky barrier at the MoS2/graphene interface by gate voltage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematics of the graphene/MoS2 vertical heterostructure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Transfer characteristic (drainsource current Ids versus gate voltage Vg for different drainsource voltages Vds) in a vertical device with MoS2 thickness of 35 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Output characteristics (Ids versus Vds) at .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Schottky barrier height  obtained for different Vg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inset: Band structures at the MoS2/graphene interface for Vg less_than 0 V and Vg greater than 30 V.
