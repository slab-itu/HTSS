Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Lattice oxygen can play an intriguing role in electrochemical processes, not only maintaining structural stability, but also influencing electron and ion transport properties in high-capacity oxide cathode materials for Li-ion batteries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report the design of a gassolid interface reaction to achieve delicate control of oxygen activity through uniformly creating oxygen vacancies without affecting structural integrity of Li-rich layered oxides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations demonstrate that oxygen vacancies provide a favourable ionic diffusion environment in the bulk and significantly suppress gas release from the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The target material is achievable in delivering a discharge capacity as high as 301 mAh g1 with initial Coulombic efficiency of 93.2%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 100 cycles, a reversible capacity of 300 mAh g1 still remains without any obvious decay in voltage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study sheds light on the comprehensive design and control of oxygen activity in transition-metal-oxide systems for next-generation Li-ion batteries.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The functionality of many transition metal oxides can be significantly altered by oxygen vacancies on the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxygen vacancies can behave as charge carriers for solid-oxide fuel cells1, as well as important adsorption sites and as active sites for electro-photocatalysts2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Li-ion cathode materials, these vacancies play a vital role in determining the materials electron and ion transport properties3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The influence of oxygen vacancies at the surface on electrochemical performance can be completely different depending on the type of Li-ion cathode material6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Li-rich layered oxides, either as a solid solution or as a nano-composite of layered Li2MnO3 and Li(TM)O2 (TM=Ni, Co, Mn), are drawing attention as next-generation cathode materials for high-energy-density Li-ion batteries in electric vehicles9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the past 20 years, the discharge capacity at room temperature of these cathode materials9,12,13,14 has been improved, from 200 mAh g1, given in the first report12, to over 320 mAh g1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14) today as summarized by Hy et al.15, and even higher at elevated temperatures16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While research has continued to push the limit of the available capacity of the materials over the years, debates on the origins of the ultrahigh capacity beyond the redox of transition metal have intensified recently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Numerous studies10,17,18,19,20,21,22,23 exemplify the contributions of bulk and surface oxygen on high chargedischarge capacity in Li-rich layered oxides, although this hypothesis has not been fully verified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tarascon and co-workers21,22 concluded that the extra-high capacity is mainly attributable to reversible anionic redox processes (O2/O22 or O2/O2n, where 3 greater than n greater than 1) within the bulk of Li-rich layered oxides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Delmas and co-workers19,20 proposed that surface oxygen is oxidized to O2 gas and irreversibly lost from the structure, leaving some oxygen vacancies on the surface or in the sub-surface layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our previous work24,25,26 illustrated that oxygen vacancies generated during the high-potential electrochemical process can facilitate the transition metal ion migration and surface structural transformation, finally leading to their potential degradation during extended cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To reduce oxygen gas generation and utilize reversible oxygen redox activity during charging and discharging, oxygen vacancies have been proposed to form on the surface of the as-synthesized Li-rich layered oxides before electrochemical processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The influence of the surface oxygen vacancies on the oxygen gas generation is discussed in detail in Supplementary Note 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The creation of surface oxygen vacancies was previously attempted utilizing a reducing atmosphere27,28 and leaching with acid accompanied by heat treatment29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the bulk structure reported in previous work easily transforms from a pure layered phase to spinel- and/or rock-salt phases28,29,30,31,32,33, which diminishes the rate capability and cycling stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Motivated by the considerations above, we propose a strategy based on a gassolid interface reaction (GSIR) between Li-rich layered oxides and carbon dioxide gas to create oxygen vacancies on the particles surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The schematic of GSIR process between Li-rich layered oxides and carbon dioxide is displayed in Fig 1a, and the procedure is detailed in the Methods section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxygen vacancies in the surface regions up to 20-nm thick are created on the particles without affecting structural integrity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the surface modification, the target material LiLi0.144Ni0.136Co0.136Mn0.544O2 exhibits discharge capacity as high as 300 mAh g1 with no obvious voltage degradation after 100 cycles at a current density of 25 mA g1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As confirmed by both theoretical calculations and experimental characterization, the improved electrochemical performance is ascribed to the full utilization of oxygen activity through the creation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the as-synthesized Li-rich layered oxides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: GSIR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic of GSIR between Li-rich layered oxides and carbon dioxide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) FTIR spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GSIR LR-NCM without water washing (red line), compared with the pristine LR-NCM, has three additional peaks, corresponding to the IR-active modes of CO3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sharp peak (864 cm1) is the CO3 group bending mode, while the other two peaks (1,438 and 1,500 cm1) are from the CO asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes;

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Characterizations of oxygen vacancies after GSIR process', 'Li-rich layered oxide LiLi0.144Ni0.136Co0.136Mn0.544O2 (denoted as LR-NCM) was prepared by a co-precipitation method (see the Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the GSIR process is completed, the general morphology remains the same as in the pristine LR-NCM (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) refinements and transition metal K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure show no major difference for the pristine and GSIR LR-NCM samples (Supplementary Figs 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results preliminarily imply that the GSIR process does not heavily influence the average crystal structures and bulk electronic environments of the LR-NCM sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To investigate the GSIR reaction mechanism of the formation of surface oxygen vacancies, we applied Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to three samples (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FTIR results (Fig 1b) indicate that carbonate formed on their surfaces after the GSIR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lithium concentration of the GSIR LR-NCM is slightly lower (6.4%) than that of the pristine LR-NCM, as was determined by inductive coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, in the oxygen 1s XPS spectra (Fig 1c), the intensity of the binding energy at 529.5 eV representing TM-O covalency for the GSIR LR-NCM after washing is much lower than that of the pristine LR-NCM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the intensity of the binding energy at 531.5 eV representing the carbonate group (CO3) for the GSIR LR-NCM without washing is much larger34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both changes indicate some lattice oxygen was extracted by CO2, forming oxygen vacancies on the sub-surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The amount of oxygen vacancies in the GSIR LR-NCM sample was determined by neutron diffraction (ND), a technique with high sensitivity for detecting light elements36, such as Li and O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2a,b demonstrates the as-collected time-of-flight (TOF) ND patterns with Rietveld refinement for both samples (patterns refined with a solid solution of R-3m symmetry; the normalized TOF ND patterns are shown in Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lattice parameters of the pristine layer are a=2.8445(2) Å, and c=14.2113(9) Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oxygen occupancy of the pristine LR-NCM is 99.97±1.10%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison, the lattice parameters of the GSIR LR-NCM are a=2.8526(8) Å and c=14.2503(7) Å, which are slightly larger than those of the pristine LR-NCM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oxygen occupancy is reduced to 96.21±1.20% after surface modification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of Ni2+ in the Li layer, and the occupancy of Li in the Li layer are also relatively larger than that of in the pristine LR-NCM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the data are also analysed using the two-phase model (the as-collected TOF ND patterns are shown in Supplementary Fig 5), that is, a combination of LiTMO2 (R-3m) phase, and Li2MnO3 (C/2m) phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results show that no oxygen vacancies (VO) are observed in the pristine LR-NCM sample, while the GSIR LR-NCM sample exhibits 7.20±3.3% VO on the 4i site and 3.8±3.0% VO on the 8j site in Li2MnO3 phase and 2.96±1.86% VO in the overall composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both models are consistent with the observed oxygen vacancies in the GSIR LR-NCM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lower oxygen occupancy in the GSIR LR-NCM proves that the oxygen vacancies are successfully created after applying the GSIR process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Structural characterizations of the pristine and GSIR LR-NCM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) TOF ND patterns for the pristine and GSIR LR-NCM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of these results, the oxygen vacancy for the GSIR LR-NCM is around three per cent higher than that of the pristine LR-NCM sample;

less oxygen gas is released from the material and less oxygen vacancies are created in the bulk during the charging process; limited electrode/electrolyte corrosion and bulk material structure transformation are formed in the battery system.Full size image', 'Overall, Fig 6b,e summarizes the proposed reaction mechanism for the pristine and GSIR LR-NCM during charging and discharging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before charging, uniform oxygen and lithium vacancies are created on the particle surface of the GSIR LR-NCM, accompanied by the pre-activation of certain amount of the Li2MnO3 component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sloped region ( less_than 4.4 V) of the charging curve is attributed to the extraction of Li+ ions from the lithium layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No difference is expected between the pristine and GSIR LR-NCM material during this process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the charging plateau region, more lithium ions can be extracted from the Li2MnO3 component, together with the oxidation of lattice oxygen19,20,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pre-activated surface layer of the GSIR sample with oxygen vacancies reduces the partial pressure of oxygen on the surface, and then prevents gaseous oxygen from evolving during plateau charging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A thinner SEI layer is thus expected to form on the particles surface of the GSIR LR-NCM due to less side reactions between released oxygen and the electrolyte species, thereby decreasing the electrochemical resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface, as supported by our electrochemical impedance-spectroscopy (EIS) results (Supplementary Fig 6 and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, the more reversible oxygen redox-reaction is triggered in the bulk of the GSIR LR-NCM during the high-potential-charging process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These oxygen vacancies can activate the Li trapped in the tetrahedral sites to provide a favourable environment for Li-ion diffusion during the rate-determining step (the last stage of discharging).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher levels of Li-ion diffusivity in the bulk, together with smaller resistance to charge-transfer and larger numbers of activated Mn4+/Mn3+ couples lead to higher capacity and better rate capability of the GSIR LR-NCM sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, minimal structure changes enable the superior cycling stability after GSIR modification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, a facile but effective approach to surface modification based on GSIR has been applied to create oxygen vacancies homogeneously without causing structural destruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxygen vacancies in the surface regions up to 20-nm thick are found to facilitate Li diffusion by activating the Li in the tetrahedral sites and suppress the release of gas from the surface, which finally lead to higher discharge capacity and a better rate capability in the Li-rich layered oxides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To the best of our knowledge, this study also clarifies for the first time the critical influence of the activity of surface oxygen in enhancing the electrochemical performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe this facile, scalable and inexpensive approach opens a door for comprehensive designing and controlling oxygen activity in transition-metal-oxide systems to achieve excellent energy and power density in their commercial applications.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
