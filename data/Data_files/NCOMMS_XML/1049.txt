The distinct metabolic phenotype of lung squamous cell carcinoma defines selective vulnerability to glycolytic inhibition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) are the two predominant subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and are distinct in their histological, molecular and clinical presentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, metabolic signatures specific to individual NSCLC subtypes remain unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we perform an integrative analysis of human NSCLC tumour samples, patient-derived xenografts, murine model of NSCLC, NSCLC cell lines and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and reveal a markedly elevated expression of the GLUT1 glucose transporter in lung SqCC, which augments glucose uptake and glycolytic flux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that a critical reliance on glycolysis renders lung SqCC vulnerable to glycolytic inhibition, while lung ADC exhibits significant glucose independence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinically, elevated GLUT1-mediated glycolysis in lung SqCC strongly correlates with high 18F-FDG uptake and poor prognosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This previously undescribed metabolic heterogeneity of NSCLC subtypes implicates significant potential for the development of diagnostic, prognostic and targeted therapeutic strategies for lung SqCC, a cancer for which existing therapeutic options are clinically insufficient.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Overall, 8085% of all human lung cancers are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and the majority of NSCLC comprises two major histological subtypes: adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC)1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SqCC accounts for 2530% of all lung cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five-year survival rates among advanced SqCC patients being treated with current chemotherapeutic regimens is less than 5% (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although ADC has benefited the most from molecularly targeted therapies3, to date, few achievements in the development of a targeted therapy for SqCC have been made, resulting in the use of platinum-based chemotherapy remaining the first-line treatment for decades4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recent FDA approval of Necitumumab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for metastatic SqCC has generated positive, albeit limited clinical impact5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Aerobic glycolysis has been implicated in tumour growth and survival, contributing to cellular energy supply, macromolecular biosynthesis and redox homeostasis7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite recent advances in our understanding of the metabolic differences between cancer and normal cells, tumour-type-dependent metabolic heterogeneity is still largely unknown9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the differential usage of metabolic pathways in NSCLC subtypes has not been addressed outside clinical observations10,11,12,13,14,15, and detailed functional studies have not been performed in representative preclinical models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) is a facilitative membrane glucose transporter16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among 14 GLUT family members, GLUT1 is the most frequently implicated in human cancers and is responsible for augmented glucose uptake and metabolism17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several oncogenic transcription factors, such as c-Myc, have been shown to directly regulate GLUT1 mRNA expression in human cancers18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aberrant activation of growth factor or oncogenic signalling pathways, such as PI3K/AKT, enhances GLUT1 activity via increased membrane trafficking19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to these cell-autonomous, intrinsic pathways, GLUT1 expression is profoundly regulated by tumour microenvironmental effectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, hypoxia induces GLUT1 expression via the transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the selective acquisition of KRAS or BRAF mutations in response to glucose deprivation has been shown to upregulate GLUT1 expression21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elevated GLUT1 expression is clinically relevant to positron emission tomography (PET) scanning with the use of 18fluro-2-deoxy-glucose (18F-FDG) for initial diagnosis as well as prognostic evaluation of NSCLC23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we sought to identify the lung SqCC-specific core metabolic signature by integrating multifactorial experimental approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that GLUT1 is remarkably and uniquely elevated at both the mRNA and protein levels in SqCC as the principal cellular glucose transporter, but is minimally expressed in ADC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elevated GLUT1 expression in SqCC is associated with enhanced glucose and 18F-FDG uptake and cellular glucose metabolism, suggesting substantial heterogeneity of glucose dependence and usage between SqCC and ADC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further demonstrate that SqCC is more susceptible to glucose deprivation than ADC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, pharmacological inhibition of glycolytic flux via non-metabolizable glucose analogue, 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG) and GLUT1-specific inhibitor, WZB117, selectively suppresses tumour growth in SqCC, whereas ADC is significantly resistant to glycolytic inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that the reliance of SqCC on GLUT1-mediated glucose uptake and metabolism can be exploited for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies for SqCC.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'TCGA analyses reveal that GLUT1 is elevated in lung SqCC', 'To uncover the SqCC-specific gene expression profile among NSCLC, we unbiasedly analysed differential gene expression between SqCC and ADC patient tumour samples utilizing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the mRNA-sequencing gene expression profiles from 501 SqCC and 517 ADC patient tumour samples identified a set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two NSCLC subtypes (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among enriched DEGs, this analysis identified that the glucose transporter GLUT1 (SLC2A1) is among the most significant DEG elevated in SqCC ( greater than 10-fold median increased expression compared to ADC) along with genes associated with squamous differentiation (for example, KRTs, PKP1, DSP, SFN and JUP) and extracellular matrix (for example, COL1A1 and COL3A1)25 (Fig 1a and Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further examined the mRNA expression of all other 13 GLUT family members and verified that, although other GLUT family member mRNAs (for example, GLUT3) are expressed, GLUT1 is, by far, the most significantly expressed glucose transporter in SqCC patients (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed a robust correlation between GLUT1 mRNA expression and the mRNA expression of p63, cytokeratin 5 (CK5) and cytokeratin 6A, the most commonly employed clinical biomarkers in distinguishing SqCC26 (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, no correlation of GLUT1 expression with proliferation markers Ki67 and PCNA in the TCGA cohort of SqCC was found (Supplementary Fig 2c), suggesting that high GLUT1 expression is not reflective of high cellular proliferation but is phenotypically associated with SqCC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these TCGA analyses provide evidence that GLUT1 overexpression is specifically linked to the SqCC subtype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: GLUT1 is highly expressed in lung SqCC compared to lung ADC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Comparison of GLUT1 expression between 517 ADC and 501 SqCC tumour samples from the TCGA mRNA sequencing data (104 normalized transcripts per million mappable read (TPM)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars represent the median±quartile range, MannWhitney u-test, ****P less_than 0.0001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Expression of all GLUT isoform mRNA (104 normalized transcripts TPM) in TCGA ADC and SqCC tumour samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MannWhitney u-test, ****P less_than 0.0001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c,d) Representative IHC images and quantification of GLUT1 expression in human patient clinical samples of ADC and SqCC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ****P less_than 0.0001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Comparison of GLUT1 mRNA expression from human NSCLC tumour samples and matched normal lung tissue samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ****P less_than 0.0001, ***P less_than 0.001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) Representative IHC images of GLUT1, CK5 and p63 expression in human ADC and SqCC tissue microarray tumour cores (left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low-magnification scale bar, 300 m; high-magnification scale bar, 50 m.

expression in human lung SqCC', 'To validate specific upregulation of GLUT1 in human SqCC, we analysed GLUT1 expression in human SqCC (tumour, n=21; normal, n=19) and ADC (tumour, n=15; normal, n=15) tumour tissue samples (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GLUT1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) score (multiplication of the intensity score by positive area score, Supplementary Fig 3) was significantly higher in SqCC than in ADC (Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, human SqCC tumours have significantly higher GLUT1 mRNA expression than ADC (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant increase was observed in ADC compared to paired normal lung tissues (Fig 1e), suggesting that GLUT1 expression is specifically elevated in SqCC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To further determine whether GLUT1 expression is specifically elevated in human SqCC, we measured GLUT1 levels in tissue microarrays of lung cancer patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that GLUT1 expression is predominantly confined to SqCC patients (79%, 27/34), with little to no expression observed in the various non-squamous subtypes (21%, 6/28; Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was quantitatively associated with a greater than threefold increase of GLUT1-positive area in SqCC compared to ADC (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with TGCA data analyses (Supplementary Fig 2b), we found a significant correlation between GLUT1 and p63/CK5 (Supplementary Fig 4a,b), indicating that elevated GLUT1 expression is specific to SqCC across a wide selection of lung cancer patients as opposed to other NSCLC subtypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We further validated differential expression of GLUT1 within human NSCLC using a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunohistochemical analysis of GLUT1 expression across an array of SqCC (n=7) and ADC (n=9) PDX samples revealed significantly elevated GLUT1 expression in SqCC PDX tumours compared to ADC PDX tumours (Fig 1g and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SqCC PDX tumours showed high levels of relatively homogeneous GLUT1 expression (P less_than 0.001, two-tailed t-test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, GLUT1 expression was strictly confined adjacent to severely necrotic areas in ADC PDX tumours indicative of hypoxic induction of GLUT1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, despite the fact that most ADC PDX tumours were established from highly advanced metastatic patients (Supplementary Table 2) because of the relatively low PDX success rate of early-stage ADC tumours, GLUT1 expression is negligible in ADC PDX tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data provide strong evidence of the heterogeneous expression of GLUT1 in NSCLC and its specific overexpression in SqCC as the principal glucose transporter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Lung SqCC-specific GLUT1 expression in NSCLC animal model', 'Next, we sought to determine whether GLUT1 expression could differentiate SqCC from other various pulmonary neoplasia in the KrasG12D; Lkb1-null (KL) mouse model of NSCLC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The KL mice, in which oncogenic mutant Kras, KrasG12D, is expressed and tumour suppressor Lkb1 is deleted upon intratracheal inhalation of adenovirus-Cre, exhibit a full spectrum of NSCLC subtypes, allowing the characterization of different tumour types within the same mouse25,28,29 (Supplementary Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of tumours that develop in KL mice can be histopathologically identified as ADC (45%) and SqCC (25%), the two most frequently observed NSCLC phenotypes in humans (Supplementary Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunohistochemical staining on serial sections of KL tumours revealed that GLUT1 is exclusively expressed in SqCC tumours determined by co-localization with diagnostic markers such as p63 (Fig 1h and Supplementary Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, no detectable levels of GLUT1 were found in TTF-1-positive ADC tumours (Fig 1h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we found a strong correlation between GLUT1 levels and squamous marker p63 in individual KL tumours (Supplementary Fig 5d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To exclude the possibility of a distinct subset of KL ADC that may express p63, we further validated SqCC or ADC subtypes in KL tumours by double-staining with two SqCC markers, p63 and CK5, as well as a combination of SqCC and ADC markers, CK5 and TTF-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all KL tumours we examined, p63 and CK5 were co-localized in SqCC tumours, whereas TTF-1-expressing tumours (ADC) were negative for SqCC marker CK5 expression and vice versa (Supplementary Fig 5e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data demonstrate that GLUT1 expression is markedly and specifically elevated in murine SqCC tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Elevated GLUT1 and glucose uptake in lung SqCC cell lines', 'We next asked whether NSCLC cell lines retain differential GLUT1 expression to clinical and animal model tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Across a panel of NSCLC cell lines, the majority of SqCC cell lines express 715-fold higher levels of GLUT1 mRNA as compared to ADC cell lines (Fig 2a), which closely correlates with GLUT1 protein levels (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focused our further in vitro and in vivo studies to four cell lines, SqCC cell lines HCC95 and HCC1588, and ADC cell lines A549 and H522, after validating their expression of p63 and CK5 (Supplementary Fig 6a), indicating that these cell lines conserved their in situ specific phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with TCGA data, GLUT1 is predominantly expressed in SqCC cell lines compared to other GLUT family members (Supplementary Fig 6b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further validated membrane localization of GLUT1 in these cells19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunocytochemical staining showed GLUT1 concentrated at the plasma membrane in SqCC cell lines (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of GLUT1 fluorescence intensity was three- to fourfold higher in SqCC cell lines as compared to ADC cell lines (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescent glucose uptake was measured using flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig 6c) and fluorescent microscopy (Fig 2d), revealing a dramatic increase in glucose uptake in SqCC cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data show that not only is GLUT1 transcriptionally upregulated specifically in SqCC, it is localized to the plasma membrane where it significantly contributes to enhanced glucose uptake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: GLUT1 expression and glucose uptake in lung SqCC cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) qRTPCR analysis comparing GLUT1 mRNA expression

expression level and critical role in cellular glucose uptake, we reasoned that GLUT1 may be necessary for cell viability and growth of SqCC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of GLUT1 in SqCC HCC95 and HCC1588 cells using two different GLUT1-targeting sequences (Fig 3a and Supplementary Table 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GLUT1 knockdown markedly suppressed the proliferative capacity of SqCC cells compared to shGFP control cells even in high-glucose (25 mM) conditions (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was accompanied by extensive apoptosis and cell death, which we observed by Annexin-V and 7-aminoactinomycin-D (7-AAD) staining, respectively (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, GLUT1 knockdown in ADC cell lines A549 and H522 only moderately suppressed proliferation with no induction of apoptosis or cell death (Supplementary Fig 7ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescently labelled glucose uptake was significantly decreased in GLUT1-deficient cells, which was correlated with lower intracellular ATP, NADH and NADPH, suggesting not only disrupted bioenergetics, but an essential role for the GLUT1-dependent flux of glucose intermediates into glycolysis-dependent pathways such as the pentose phosphate pathway (Fig 3df).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to SqCC, reduced glucose uptake did not affect cell viability or intracellular ATP in ADC cell lines (Supplementary Fig 7d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, transient GLUT1 knockdown using short interfering RNA (siRNA) was more pronounced in SqCC cell lines, with a complete suppression of proliferation in SqCC but not ADC cells despite reduced glucose uptake in both SqCC and ADC cell lines (Supplementary Fig 8ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, A549 was more sensitive to transient GLUT1 knockdown than H522, in accordance with previous reports that loss of LKB1 sensitizes cells to metabolic disruption30; however, both ADC cell lines continued to proliferate even after depletion of GLUT1 (Supplementary Fig 8b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further employed an additional SqCC cell line, HCC2814, that contains an amplification of PIK3CA and lacks a Kras

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'NSCLC comprises multiple histologically, genetically and presumably metabolically distinct subtypes, given the reciprocal regulation of metabolic pathways and oncogenic signalling44,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing evidence suggests that there exist multiple layers of inter- as well as intratumoral metabolic heterogeneity that may essentially affect therapeutic outcomes of metabolic inhibition9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In light of this, identification of distinct metabolic alterations that are linked to specific subtypes of NSCLC may lead to the clinical development of effective NSCLC therapeutics with reduced toxicities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we have discovered distinct metabolic heterogeneity between major tumour subtypes of human NSCLC, ADC and SqCC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our comprehensive analysis encompassing genetic, metabolic and clinical association approaches demonstrates that GLUT1 expression is markedly and specifically elevated in human SqCC, and is associated with enhanced glucose uptake and glycolytic dependency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, GLUT1 and glycolytic enzyme expression remain relatively low in the majority of ADC when compared to SqCC, suggesting that ADC may be significantly less reliant on glucose metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study further provides evidence of the selective antitumour effects of glycolytic (2-DG) or GLUT1 (WZB117) inhibition on SqCC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results have revealed that SqCC is vitally reliant on augmented GLUT1-mediated glucose metabolism for survival and tumour growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, a recent epidemiological study has demonstrated, in a large cohort, that a diet composed of foods that cause consistently high availability of blood glucose is strongly associated with the development of SqCC among NSCLC patients46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study suggests that high dietary glycaemic index and carbohydrate availability may contribute to the development of SqCC, supporting our finding of the elevated glucose dependence of SqCC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In sharp contrast, in vitro cellular bioenergetic pathways and cell viability as well as in vivo tumour growth of ADC was not affected by glucose restriction or glycolytic inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although previous studies have reported an increase in GLUT1-mediated aerobic glycolysis by EGFR, KRAS, BRAF or other frequent oncogenic mutations in ADC22,47,48,49, our analysis found no significant increase in GLUT1 mRNA expression in ADC patients possessing KRAS, EGFR, BRAF, LKB1, PIK3CA or PTEN mutations compared to those who did not (Supplementary Fig 18a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it should be noted that the limited number of TCGA lung ADC patients who possess rare mutations hinder a conclusive analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further study within large cohorts of NSCLC will be required to assess GLUT1 expression with less-frequent oncogenic mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LBK1 inactivation has been linked to increased HIF-1 signalling50,51; however, a slight but statistically significantly lower expression of GLUT1 was detected in tumours with LKB1 mutations compared to LKB1 wild-type tumours (P=0.0076, MannWhitney u-test, Supplementary Fig 18a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, these studies did not compare GLUT1 expression or FDG uptake among the different subtypes of NSCLC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that LKB1-null A549 cell line exhibits higher GLUT1 expression as compared to other ADC cell lines we tested, yet all SqCC cell lines except HCC2450 express considerably higher levels of GLUT1 than A549 cells (Fig 2a,b), and SqCC xenograft tumours (HCC95 and HCC1588) exhibit significantly higher HIF-1 induction than A549 xenograft tumours (Supplementary Fig 16c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, as in SqCC, GLUT1 mRNA expression was also increased in ADC patients possessing genomic copy number gains of PIK3CA, although occurring at a much lower frequency than in the TCGA lung SqCC cohort (Supplementary Fig 18b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, GLUT1 levels in PIK3CA-amplified ADC tumours were significantly lower (3.3-fold) than SqCC tumours (Fig 7a and Supplementary Fig 18b), suggesting additional histology-specific regulation of GLUT1 expression in SqCC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest a mechanistic involvement of aberrantly activated PIK3 pathway signalling in elevated glucose metabolism in NSCLC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the recently described plasticity of NSCLC and potential for ADC to escape treatment through LKB1 inactivation or dysregulated pentose phosphate pathway-mediated metabolic reprogramming and squamous transdifferentiation in KL mice52, our characterization of GLUT1-mediated glycolytic metabolism in SqCC may be an important step in identifying and preventing potential mechanisms of acquired resistance in ADC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Enhanced influx and consumption of glucose in highly proliferative malignant cells can be utilized not only to fulfil cellular bioenergetic demands, but more importantly to provide various macromolecular building blocks and NADPH for cellular biosynthetic reactions and redox homeostasis53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aberrantly elevated serine biosynthesis and pentose phosphate pathway have been identified as critical glycolysis-diverting pathways conferring crucial metabolic benefits for tumorigenesis by providing essential intermediates for nucleotide biosynthesis and cellular reducing power in the form of NADPH54,55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, SqCC cells have elevated levels of NADPH, which was significantly reduced in lower glucose concentrations (5 mM), suggesting that heightened glucose utilization of SqCC cells may contribute to these branched metabolic pathways (Fig 4h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, TCGA cohort of lung SqCC shows significantly higher expression of rate-limiting enzymes for the serine biosynthesis and pentose phosphate pathways compared to ADC (Supplementary Fig 19a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a recent metabolic tracing study revealed a significant increase in serine biosynthesis among NSCLC cell lines with high Nrf2 activity56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, our TCGA analysis revealed greater than twofold higher Nrf2 mRNA expression in SqCC than ADC tumour samples (Supplementary Fig 19c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies to assess metabolites and metabolic enzymes involved in these pathways will be of great importance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'KRAS mutations are infrequently found in human SqCC lung tumours; this underlines an inherent limitation in capturing the distinct genetic alterations of SqCC within mouse models and individual cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The KL mouse model, as well as SqCC cell line HCC1588, features a KRAS mutation whose role in driving SqCC tumour formation is not well understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, GLUT1 is uniformly elevated in most SqCC cell lines we tested (Fig 2a,b), despite diverse molecular alterations present in these cell lines (Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of PDX models provides an excellent opportunity to explore the differential metabolism of NSCLC subtypes in an even more clinically relevant setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not only do PDX models retain the genetic and histopathological characteristics of their donor tumours, but distinct elevation of GLUT1 expression in SqCC is recapitulated across successive mouse-to-mouse passages (Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further characterization using the PDX tumours will be crucial for validating enhanced glucose reliance and susceptibility to glycolytic inhibition in SqCC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This study provides evidence that the elevated GLUT1-mediated glycolytic flux has clinical relevance with high potential for translational development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings of increased 18F-FDG uptake in human and murine SqCC are consistent with previous clinical studies, demonstrating that SqCC has higher 18F-FDG-PET activity11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While increased 8F-FDG uptake in SqCC is clearly evident, recent studies have also demonstrated that certain subtypes of ADC, such as the solid subtype, demonstrate high 8F-FDG-PET activity as well57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis of 18F-FDG uptake in NSCLC patients suggests that, while a small proportion of Acinar and Papillary ADC tumours have comparably similar SUVmax, SqCC tumours exhibit significantly increased SUVmax (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While constitutively elevated GLUT1 expression in SqCC shows no correlation with proliferation markers Ki67 or PCNA (Supplementary Fig 2c), a small subset of ADC tumours displays comparably high GLUT1 mRNA expression (Fig 1a) that significantly correlates with Ki67 and PCNA mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that, in contrast to SqCC, GLUT1 expression in ADC may be restricted to advanced tumours, which may play a critical role in malignancy and 18F-FDG uptake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our clinical correlation analysis of both human NSCLC tumours and TCGA clinical data revealed a robust association of SqCC-specific high GLUT1 expression with poor tumour cell differentiation status (Table 1), supporting the prognostic potential of high GLUT1 expression in SqCC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'High prevalence of multiple genetic alterations leading to aberrantly activated PI3K/AKT signalling has been reported in SqCC35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic deletion of PTEN, a phosphatase that negatively regulates PI3K/AKT activity, resulted in SqCC in LKB1-deficient mice58, suggesting that the PI3K/AKT pathway is critically implicated in SqCC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our TCGA analyses confirmed that genomic copy number gain, including both shallow and high-level amplifications, of PIK3CA frequently occurs in the TCGA lung SqCC cohort (Fig 7a and Supplementary Fig 14a; Broad Institute TCGA Genome Analysis Data Center, 2016, SNP6 Copy number analysis, GISTIC2, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard), leading to lung SqCC exhibiting exceptionally high mRNA expression of PIK3CA among the TCGA cohorts (Supplementary Fig 15a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides, a frequent genomic copy number loss of PTEN is evident within the TCGA cohort of SqCC samples (Fig 7b and Supplementary Fig 14b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significantly enriched AKT and mTOR oncogenic signalling (Supplementary Fig 14e,f), as defined by curated oncogenic signalling gene sets59, further suggests an increased PI3K/AKT/mTOR activity in SqCC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correlative analysis of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling using RPPA data with GLUT1 mRNA expression confirms a strong association in lung SqCC (Supplementary Fig 15b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we observed a modest negative correlation between GLUT1 mRNA expression and PIK3CA, p-AKT, and p-S6 in lung ADC, suggesting the involvement of further histology-specific regulation of GLUT1 in ADC (Supplementary Fig 15c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an agreement with human SqCC, KL and xenograft SqCC tumours exhibit significantly increased AKT activity and downstream signalling directing the stabilization of HIF-1 and GLUT1 expression (Fig 7c and Supplementary Fig 16ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results propose potential mechanisms underlying SqCC-specific GLUT1 induction by which oncogenic PI3K/AKT-mediated stabilization of HIF-1 leads to overexpression of GLUT1 and other glycolytic enzymes, which subsequently results in heightened glucose metabolism in SqCC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, these genomic alterations that lead to an increase in PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling are among the most strongly correlated with GLUT1 expression in SqCC (Fig 7a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, it has been shown that mTOR inhibitor MLN0128 attenuates HIF-1 and GLUT1 expression in NSCLC cell lines and the KL model of NSCLC, which is associated with decreased 18F-FDG uptake, further corroborating the regulation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway signalling on GLUT1 expression through HIF-1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data suggest that PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling may represent a viable target for future therapeutic development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the clinical efficacy of PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibition as a stand-alone therapy is limited in lung SqCC60 because of potential multiple kinase signalling adaptation mechanisms61,62,63,64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further preclinical and clinical assessment of resistance mechanisms in lung SqCC is needed for the development of combinatorial PI3K/AKT/mTOR-targeted therapies as well as effective screening to determine patient candidacy for treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We cannot exclude the possibility of involvement of extrinsic microenvironmental factors such as hypoxic induction of HIF-1 that contributes to GLUT1 expression especially when tumours become hypoxic at the advanced stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although augmented HIF-1 signalling has been well associated with elevated glycolytic flux and FDG uptake in human cancers, it is evident that tissue-specific metabolic regulation may contribute to further heterogeneity in glucose metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Von Hippel-Lindau factor (VHL) deletion and inactivation are among the most common mutations observed in renal cell carcinoma leading to oncogenic stabilization of HIF-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, renal cell carcinoma does not exhibit markedly elevated FDG uptake, suggesting that tissue-specific differences may further regulate glucose metabolism among different cancers that harbour similar oncogenes65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study demonstrating significant metabolic heterogeneity being crucially regulated by the tumour microenvironment66,67 argues for the necessity of further studies to determine whether SqCC exhibits a unique hypoxia-prone tumour microenvironment such as poor perfusion or infiltration of metabolically active inflammatory cells, which consume high levels of oxygen, thereby causing local hypoxia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results demonstrating specific anticancer effects of GLUT1 and glycolysis inhibitors on SqCC suggest enough therapeutic window for GLUT1 inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there is potential risk of side effects in employing GLUT1 inhibitors, given that GLUT1 is the primary GLUT family member expressed in red blood cells and endothelial cells of the bloodbrain barrier16, haematologic analysis and histological evaluation of major organs including the brain revealed no apparent toxicities with the administration regimens used in this study; yet, significant anti-SqCC effects were achieved (Supplementary Fig 21a,b and Fig 5f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the significant advances in lung cancer treatment with targeted therapy, exceedingly few promising options have been made for SqCC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study establishing aberrantly elevated GLUT1 expression and glycolytic metabolism as a specific metabolic feature of SqCC may facilitate the development of the targeted therapeutic strategy for the treatment of SqCC as well as novel diagnostic and prognostic parameters defining histological subtype-specific metabolic dependencies within NSCLC.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
