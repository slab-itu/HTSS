Mesenchymal stem cells use extracellular vesicles to outsource mitophagy and shuttle microRNAs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and macrophages are fundamental components of the stem cell niche and function coordinately to regulate haematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and mobilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies indicate that mitophagy and healthy mitochondrial function are critical to the survival of stem cells, but how these processes are regulated in MSCs is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that MSCs manage intracellular oxidative stress by targeting depolarized mitochondria to the plasma membrane via arrestin domain-containing protein 1-mediated microvesicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vesicles are then engulfed and re-utilized via a process involving fusion by macrophages, resulting in enhanced bioenergetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we show that MSCs simultaneously shed micro RNA-containing exosomes that inhibit macrophage activation by suppressing Toll-like receptor signalling, thereby de-sensitizing macrophages to the ingested mitochondria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these studies mechanistically link mitophagy and MSC survival with macrophage function, thereby providing a physiologically relevant context for the innate immunomodulatory activity of MSCs.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapies have yielded beneficial effects in a broad range of animal models of disease and several human clinical trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, their mode of action in vivo remains ambiguous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early studies indicated that MSCs promoted tissue repair via direct differentiation; however, data showing cells that exhibited transient and low engraftment in vivo rebutted this hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is now believed that MSCs achieve a therapeutic effect in vivo via paracrine action1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This paradigm shift was based initially on studies indicating that conditioned medium from cultured MSCs reproduce some of the beneficial effects of intact cells4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent studies have identified a long list of paracrine-acting factors secreted by MSCs that contribute to their therapeutic potency1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recent studies indicate that the cells also shed extracellular vesicles including exosomes (50100 nm in diameter) and microvesicles (MVs; 0.11 m in diameter) into the extracellular space6,7,8,9,10,11 and that MSC-derived exosomes protect mice from myocardial or renal ischaemia, and pulmonary arterial hypertension12,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the isolation of exosomes requires differential ultracentrifugation, MVs can be isolated from cell culture supernatant by low-speed centrifugation16,17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of MVs in MSC biology is largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'MSCs reside within the bone marrow stem cell niche and regulate haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance via crosstalk with macrophages20,21,22,23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bone marrow niche represents a low-oxygen environment, and changes in oxygen concentration affect MSC and HSC fate26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recently reported that culture expansion of MSCs in atmospheric oxygen induces mitochondrial oxidative stress (mtROS) that compromises cell growth and survival28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the programme regulating the quality control of mitochondria in MSC is poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mitophagy and allophagy regulate mitochondrial numbers in stem cells and mediate the maternal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) by facilitating the elimination of paternal mitochondria29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies indicate that mitochondria can be transferred between cells, and cross-talk between MSCs and renal, myocardial and lung epithelial cells involve mitochondrial transfer30,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, MSCs introduced into the lungs of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mice form connexin 43 gap junctional channels and transfer mitochondria to the alveolar epithelium33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, circulation of mitochondria induces inflammatory responses similar to sepsis34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These inflammatory responses have been attributed to the release by mitochondria of damage-associated molecular patterns including mtDNA, which stimulate pattern recognition receptors34,35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, while mitochondrial transfer is purported to contribute to the paracrine action of MSCs, its physiological relevance is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, loss of mitochondria is likely to have detrimental effects on cell survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We hypothesized that oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction induce cell survival mechanism in MSCs that include mitochondrial transfer, thereby providing a physiological relevant explanation for this behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we studied mitophagy in MSCs and the role of macrophages in this process since these two cell types are in close proximity within the HSC niche20,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that under standard culture conditions MSCs undergo mitophagy and use arrestin domain-containing protein 1-mediated MVs (ARMMs) to unload mitochondria, which are engulfed by macrophages and re-utilized to increase bioenergetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we show that MSCs tolerize macrophages to mitochondrial transfer by shedding exosomes that modulate Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression and inflammatory signalling via transfer of regulatory microRNAs both in vitro and in an in vivo model of lung injury.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'MSCs undergo mitophagy in response to oxidative stress', 'Human MSCs shed from their surface a diverse subpopulation of vesicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To characterize these vesicles, we performed electron microscopy on those recovered from MSC-conditioned medium by differential ultracentrifugation (100,000 g for 18 h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis demonstrated the presence of 50100-nm vesicles that are morphologically consistent with exosomes (Fig 1a, left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flotation of the 100,000 g pellets on sucrose gradients followed by western blot and fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) further demonstrated that these vesicles expressed the exosomal markers milk fat globule factor 8 (Mfge8) and the tetraspanins CD9 and CD63, respectively (Supplementary Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Centrifugation of conditioned medium at low speeds (10,000 g) revealed the presence of larger vesicles ( greater than 100 nm) that contain subcellular mitochondrial structures including outer and inner membranes and cristae, and expressed the mitochondria-specific protein ATP synthase as evidenced by immuno-gold labelling (Fig 1a, centre and Supplementary Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MSCs also release larger multivesicular bodies containing lysosome-like vesicles and entire mitochondria, suggesting that these organelles were selected for mitophagy by targeting to autophagosomes (Fig 1a, right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: MSC-derived MVs contain depolarized mitochondria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Left panel, electron microscopy of vesicles isolated from sucrose densities of 1.11 and 1.14 g ml1 and purified using differential ultracentrifugation (100,000g per 18 h) reveal a typical exosome morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Middle panel, MVs over 100 nm in size recovered from human MSC-conditioned medium following low-speed (10,000 g per 1 h) centrifugation contain structures conforming to the morphology of mitochondria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Right panel, MVs contain closely packed-vesicles and entire mitochondria (multivesicular body (MVB)) representing autophagosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Left panel, flow cytometric analysis of MitoSOX Red-stained human MSCs expanded in

sample using three distinct replicate cultures from each experimental group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Mitochondrial membrane potential of human MSCs from b determined using JC-1 staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expansion in 21% oxygen results in partial depolarization of mitochondria as evidenced by accumulation of JC-1 monomers (*P less_than 0.005, Students-t test versus MSCs in 5% oxygen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Western blot analysis (Supplementary Fig 1) of cytoplasmic or mitochondrial extracts prepared from human MSCs expanded in 21% oxygen for the indicated passage numbers (P1 or P4) reveals Parkin mitochondrial translocation and Pink1 kinase activation in human MSCs but not human dermal fibroblasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are representative of a single experiment repeated five times.Full size image', 'To determine whether culture expansion of MSCs impairs mitochondrial function, we expanded cells under physiological oxygen levels (5% O2) or standard culture conditions (21% O2) and quantified mtROS levels and mitochondrial membrane potential by staining with MitoSOX Red and JC-1, respectively37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FACS analysis of stained cells confirmed that exposure to 21% oxygen resulted in a significant increase in mtROS (Fig 1b) and a concomitant decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential as demonstrated by the accumulation of JC-1 monomers (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, western blot analysis revealed that prolonged exposure to 21% oxygen activated the Pink1/Parkin-mediated pathway of mitophagy in MSCs but not in human fibroblasts cultured under identical conditions (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, increased mitochondrial expression of Parkin and Pink1 kinase was accompanied by Pink1 kinase activation as evidenced by the presence of lower molecular weight moieties of the protein and reduced Miro levels in mitochondrial extracts from P4 versus P1 MSCs (Fig 1c and Supplementary Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, Pink1 targets Miro for degradation, thereby severing the connection of the mitochondria to the cytoskeleton and facilitating its incorporation into the phagosome38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these results, western blot analysis also revealed that mitochondria-containing MVs expressed microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) and autophagy-related protein 12, which are highly enriched in MVs as compared with whole-cell extracts (Supplementary Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, these MVs are characteristic of autophagosomes39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'MSCs package mitochondria in MVs for cellular transfer', 'To examine mitophagy in MSCs in more detail, MSCs were infected with baculoviruses encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the E1alpha pyruvate dehydrogenase leader peptide, which drives transport to the mitochondria, and LC3 fused to a red fluorescent protein (RFP) to allow tracking to the phagophore39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescent microscopy confirmed that the GFP-labelled mitochondrial network is in close proximity to RFP-LC3-labelled phagosomes (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Live cell imaging further revealed that mitochondria are loaded in the cytoplasm into LC3-containing vesicles, which migrate towards the cell periphery and are incorporated into outward budding blebs in the plasma membrane (Fig 2bd and Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot analysis further revealed that RFP-LC3-MVs also expressed the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-associated proteins tumour suppressor gene 101 (TSG101) and arrestin domain-containing protein 1 (ARRDC1)11,41 (Supplementary Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results indicate that MSCs employ the release of ARMMs to extrude mitochondria at their cell surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, MSCs exhibited marked increases in apoptosis when treated with Bafilomycin A1 or low concentrations (35 M) of chloroquine, which block the mitophagy flux, indicating that this process is critical for MSC survival (Supplementary Movie 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: MSC outsource mitophagy to macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ad) Differential interference contrast (DIC) fluorescence overlay of live human MSCs expressing fluorescent proteins that target mitochondria (green) and phagosomes (red) shows mitochondria being loaded into phagosomes (arrows), which are then shuttled to the plasma membrane for extrusion (also see Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (eh) Inset shows a representative macrophage interacting with a human MSC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interaction is shown as a time sequence (5 min intervals) in the lower images and in Supplementary Movie 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inset demarcates the area in the human MSC plasma membrane where the membrane blebs outwards and accumulates vesicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Macrophages nibble the surface of human MSCs and uptake mitochondrial laden phagosomes from blebs budding (arrows) from the plasma membrane of the human MSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars, 10 .Full size image', 'Next, we co-cultured GFP-labelled human MSCs from above with primary human or mouse macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Live cell imaging revealed that macrophages nibble the plasma membrane of MSCs, establishing cell contact at areas where membrane blebs are enriched in RFP-labelled vesicles, which are subsequently stripped by the macrophage (Fig 2eh and Supplementary Movie 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This activity was also observed between mouse macrophages and primary human MSCs (Fig 3a and Supplementary Movies 4 and 5) but was not evident when macrophages were co-cultured with mouse or human fibroblasts (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a subsequent experiment, we co-cultured the macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 with human MSCs containing RFP-labelled mitochondria (10:1 ratio) for 4 h and recovered macrophages using FACS after staining with antibodies that recognize macrophage epitopes (that is, F4/80) not expressed by MSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sorted macrophages were cultured for up to 2 weeks in RPMI media, which do not support MSC expansion and survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescent microscopy of these macrophages revealed clear evidence of cell-associated RFP derived from human MSCs (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm these findings, we demonstrated using PCR amplification that these macrophages expressed the mitochondrial specific transcript human cytochrome c oxidase I (MT-COX I), which was confirmed on the basis of the restriction fragment pattern obtained after digestion of the PCR product with Bfa1 (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This PCR product was not detected in mouse macrophages because of limited sequence homology between the two genes30 but was detected in human MSC-derived MVs as expected (Fig 3c and Supplementary Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, we co-cultured Cy5-labelled human MSCs with macrophages that were pre-incubated with or without dextran sulfate (100 g ml1), a nonspecific inhibitor of phagocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Live cell imaging showed phagocytosis of MVs by macrophages over a period of 18 min, and confocal microscopy confirmed that the engulfed Cy5-labelled vesicles resided within the cell body of the macrophage (Supplementary Movie 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, MV uptake was blocked in macrophages pre-treated with dextran sulfate as evidenced by the accumulation of Cy5-labelled MVs on the macrophage surface (Supplementary Movie 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: MSC transfer mitochondria to macrophages and lung tissues.

track the in vivo transfer of mitochondria, we systemically administered RFP-labelled human MSCs into C57BL/6 mice expressing a GFP reporter under control of the endothelial specific Tie2 promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 24 h post injection, GFP-labelled endothelial cells, epithelial cells and macrophages that contained RFP-labelled mitochondria were visible (Supplementary Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bfa1 digestion of mouse lung DNA following intravenous administration of human MSCs, exosomes or MVs yielded a pattern of restriction similar to those observed in RAW 264.7 macrophages (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To follow the fate of viable human MSCs in the mouse lung, we measured the abundance of human-specific GAPDH transcripts via reverse transcriptasePCR (RTPCR)42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human GAPDH mRNA was not detected in the lung tissue of untreated mice but was detected at 3 days post injection of human MSCs or human fibroblasts (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, expression rapidly declined and was no longer evident by 14 or 28 days post transplant, consistent with the clearance rate of cells from lung tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of human COXI mRNA in mouse lung mirrored that of human GAPDH following injection of human fibroblasts and was detected at 3 days but not 14 or 28 days post transplant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, human COXI transcripts were detected up to 28 days post injection of human MSCs, indicating that mouse lung tissue retained mtDNA long after the disappearance of viable human MSCs (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, MSC-derived vesicles constitute an effective mechanism to transfer mtDNA into the mouse lung.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'MSC extracellular vesicles enhance macrophage energetics', 'To study the effect of MVs on macrophage bioenergetics, we analysed oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) using the SeaHorse technology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human macrophages exhibit higher basal OCR than human MSCs or human fibroblasts (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-culture of macrophages with human MSCs (Mac+hMSC) or MSC-derived exosomes (Mac+Exo) but not human fibroblasts (Mac+Fibro) significantly (analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by StudentNeuman Keuls (SNK) post-hoc pairwise comparisons) increased their OCR, suggesting that MSCs or MSC-derived exosomes alter macrophage bioenergetics (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we repeated these measurements after treatment of cells with oligomycin A, an inhibitor of ATP synthase, which is required for the oxidative phosphorylation of ADP to ATP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These conditions differentiate ATP-linked respiration from the proton leak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Macrophages exhibited a higher level of proton leak as compared with human MSCs and fibroblasts, and proton leak was significantly (ANOVA followed by

by SNK post hoc pairwise comparisons) reduced proton leak in macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also repeated the OCR measurements following treatment of cells with the uncoupling agent carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydraone (FCCP) to determine how cells respond to an increase in ATP demand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All three cell types responded to FCCP treatment with increased OCR, and the magnitude of the response was greater in macrophages as compared with human MSCs and fibroblasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, OCR was significantly increased in FCCP-treated macrophages following

#@NEW_LINE#@#  Silica exposure results in a burst of mtROS production as evidenced by changes in MitoSOX Red fluorescence intensity; however, this effect is largely mitigated in macrophages incubated with human MSC-derived exosomes (Fig 4b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Silica exposure also decreased macrophage OCR, but this decrease was reversed by co-culture with human MSCs or human MSC-derived exosomes but not with human fibroblasts (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that transfer of partially depolarized mitochondria from MSCs to macrophages enhances that macrophage bioenergetics appears paradoxical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential as a result of MSC expansion is not absolute as mitochondria exhibit residual membrane potential as evidenced by the concentration of JC-1 aggregates (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the mitochondrial membrane is not collapsed and the mitochondria are still capable of undergoing fusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'MSCs modulate macrophage function by a variety of mechanisms, and this crosstalk contributes to their anti-inflammatory activity but the physiological relevance of this crosstalk remains obscure particularly as it relates to the survival and function of MSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we report that during their ex vivo culture MSCs transfer partially depolarized mitochondria to macrophages as a pro-survival mechanism in response to oxidative stress and that these mitochondria are repurposed via a process involving fusion to increase macrophage bioenergetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we show that MSCs also desensitize macrophages to mitochondrial transfers by repressing TLR-signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data indicate that MSCs employ two different types of MVs to achieve these goals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MSCs load mitochondria in the cytoplasm into LC3 containing MVs that are recovered from cell culture media with low-speed centrifugation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These MVs express the ESCRT-I-associated proteins TSG101 and ARRDC1 and are extruded from cells in ARMMs11, which bud outwards directly from the plasma membrane where they are identified by macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MSCs also shed exosomes that modulate TLR signalling and cytokine secretion in macrophages, in part, by transfer of regulatory microRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous reports indicate that mitochondria transferred by MSCs improve the energetic activity of the alveolar epithelium of LPS-treated mice30,31,32,33 and animal models of rotenone-induced airway injury52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the beneficial effects of mitochondria were limited to acceptor cells almost completely deficient of mitochondrial function30,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is unclear whether rescue is because of the transfer of mitochondria, mtDNA or release of other mediators by MSCs33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the bone marrow niche contains few, if any, epithelium, so the physiological relevance of this is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our data suggest that mitochondrial transfer by MSCs is not altruistic but rather may serve to enhance MSCs cell survival by unloading partially depolarized mitochondria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elimination of depolarized mitochondria is a priority for MSCs that experience high mtROS generation when cultured under atmospheric oxygen tension28 since inhibitors of the mitophagy flux induce MSC apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, MV-mediated mitochondrial transfer augments macrophage function by improving mitochondrial bioenergetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As reported for the alveolar epithelial cells, recovery of the energetic function of macrophages is characterized by an increased ability to generate ATP under conditions in which the cells exhibit mitochondrial uncoupling or an enhanced proton leak, and involves protection of the macrophage by reducing mtROS generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This outcome is consistent with data indicating that transfer of mitochondria, even if partially depolarized, is followed by fusion inside the acceptor macrophage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, several studies have reported that transfer of only a few mitochondria is sufficient to rescue cells depleted of mtDNA by culture in ethidium bromide30,54,55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the current study confirms evidence that exosomes, which do not carry mitochondria, contain nucleic acids56, including mtDNA that can be transferred, long term, in vivo to the lung.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presence of mtDNA inside exosomes is not surprising as mtDNAs are dispersed throughout the mitochondrial network as histone-free nucleoids with an average size in mammals under 100 nm, and contain a single copy of mtDNA per nucleoid57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that the exosome preparations could be contaminated by apoptotic bodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Accumulation of mtDNA that escapes mitophagy induces TLR 9-mediated inflammation that in the case of cardiac muscle is associated with heart failure35 and mice transplanted with cells harbouring allogeneic mtDNA trigger MyD88 responses to reject these cells36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, silencing TLR responses in macrophages is likely necessary to induce tolerance to transferred mitochondria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this hypothesis, we demonstrate that uptake of MSC-derived exosomes represses TLR signalling in macrophages and the production of inflammatory mediators by targeting pathways (TLRs and NF-B) central to inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interestingly, microRNAs present in MSC-derived exosomes are highly conserved between human MSC donors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One such microRNA, miR-451, is highly abundant in exosomes but is expressed at low levels in macrophages and dendritic cells where it regulates cytokine production58,59,60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mir-451 is known to suppress TNF, and macrophage migration inhibitory factor, which inhibits the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids and negatively regulates p38 MAPK signalling to protect from diabetic nephropathy48,58,59,60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, ectopic expression of a mir-451 mimic in macrophages inhibits TNF secretion in response to silica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these findings, MSC-derived exosomes prevent the recruitment of Ly6Chi monocytes and reduces secretion of pro-fibrotic IL-10 and TGF by these cells in the lung of silica-exposed mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, these data suggest that, as tested in vitro, immunomodulatory activities may have evolved, in part, as a mechanism by which MSCs survive oxidative stress and serendipitously confers on cells the ability to suppress inflammation, in lung injury models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, our data illustrate a physiological role for the innate immune regulatory activity of MSCs, and in doing so further highlights the important association between MSCs and macrophages in vivo.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
