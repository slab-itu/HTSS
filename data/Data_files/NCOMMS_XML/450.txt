Leukaemia cell of origin identified by chromatin landscape of bulk tumour cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The precise identity of a tumours cell of origin can influence disease prognosis and outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Methods to reliably define tumour cell of origin from primary, bulk tumour cell samples has been a challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use a well-defined model of MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) to demonstrate that transforming haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and multipotent progenitors results in more aggressive AML than transforming committed progenitor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcriptome profiling reveals a gene expression signature broadly distinguishing stem cell-derived versus progenitor cell-derived AML, including genes involved in immune escape, extravasation and small GTPase signal transduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, whole-genome profiling of open chromatin reveals precise and robust biomarkers reflecting each cell of origin tested, from bulk AML tumour cell sampling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that bulk AML tumour cells exhibit distinct open chromatin loci that reflect the transformed cell of origin and suggest that open chromatin patterns may be leveraged as prognostic signatures in human AML.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Accumulating evidence suggests that the cellular context or cell of origin in which a genetic lesion occurs contributes to the emergence of distinct tumour subtypes1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identifying cell of origin may allow better prediction of tumour behaviour, including tumour progression and response to therapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current methods to retrospectively identify cell of origin from tumour cell samples are limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histology, cytogenetics and cell surface marker staining may be insufficient to accurately predict cell of origin when the initiating cells are phenotypically similar and/or exist within the same tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcriptional profiling has been used to substantiate the tumour cell of origin model; however, technical variation due to platform differences and batch effects between studies have a significant impact on the ability to consistently apply expression signatures to clinical samples2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, accurate determination of tumour cell of origin was achieved based on the distribution of mutations along the genome of tumour cells3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach is most accurate when putative cells of origin have distinct gene expression profiles, chromatin organization and lineage fate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For tumours arising from cells along a differentiation spectrum within the same tissue, most abundantly characterized in haematological malignancies4,5,6, it remains a challenge to determine cell of origin from bulk circulating tumour cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Epigenetic modification is one conduit through which developmental origins of a cell are retained during differentiation, and potentially, transformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of striking cell type specificity of chromatin structure7,8, we hypothesized that assessment of open chromatin in bulk tumour cells with matched cells of origin would reveal novel epigenetic biomarkers of tumour cell of origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate this hypothesis, we used a well-established and clinically relevant model of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) driven by expression of the fusion oncogene MLL-AF9 (MA9)9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chromosomal translocations of the MLL (mixed lineage leukaemia) gene on human chromosome 11q23 are found in 5% of adult and 50% of paediatric AML cases11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MLL gene encodes a methyltransferase, which modifies histones to control the expression of target genes including the HOX gene family13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AML with t(9;11)(p22;q23) translocation giving rise to MA9 is the most common MLL-rearranged AML.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among AML cases with t(9;11) there is great clinical heterogeneity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies in mice have demonstrated that MA9 can confer self-renewal activity to committed myeloid progenitors as well as transform HSCs4, supporting use of this model to test cell of origin in AML development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we test the impact of cell of origin on AML development starting from cells within a differentiation spectrum from stem cells through lineage-committed progenitor cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compare both global transcriptome and epigenome (open chromatin) signatures of the resulting leukaemias to their respective cell of origin, to evaluate global changes in chromatin structure that occur during the process of transformation, and how these changes differ when AML is initiated from distinct cell types.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Transformed cell of origin dictates growth of AML cells', 'To test the impact of cell of origin on leukemogenesis, we isolated enriched populations of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, including long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs), short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs), multipotent progenitors (MPPs), common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) and granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs) (Fig 1a, Supplementary Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transformed cell lines were derived from independent biological replicates (n=2) following retroviral transduction with MLL-AF9 (MA9) and GFP reporter (Fig 1b), and transplanted into sublethally irradiated recipient mice (n=5 recipients per cell line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed distinct in vivo penetrance and rate of AML development in these mice (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MA9 cell lines derived from LT-HSCs (MA9 (LT)) were the most aggressive, with complete penetrance and a median survival of 70 days (70d) post transplant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In pair-wise comparisons, this was significantly different from overall survival of MA9 (ST) (median 96d, log-rank test P=0.002), MA9 (MPP) (median 108d, log-rank test; P=0.002), MA9 (CMP) (median 153d, log-rank test; P=0.0190), and MA9 (GMP) (median 184d, log-rank test; P=0.0116; Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate whether these distinct growth properties were associated with different levels of MA9 expression, we evaluated mean fluorescence intensity of GFP, which is correlated to the level of MA9 expression (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GFP intensity did not correlate to median survival time (Fig 1d), suggesting that differing levels of MA9 expression do not account for differences in tumour aggressiveness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these data suggest that cell of origin impacts the rate of AML development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, HSC-derived AMLs were the most aggressive and differentiated progenitor cell-derived AMLs were the least aggressive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

2-test; P=0.000643 and P=0.0501, respectively; Fig 1e, Supplementary Tables 2,3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the cell of origin impacts leukaemia-initiating cell frequency, with a spectrum from HSC-derived AMLs having the highest leukaemia-initiating cell content to the most differentiated progenitor cell-derived AMLs having the lowest leukaemia-initiating cell content, consistent with our observations of the distinct penetrance and rate of AML development based on cell of origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In vivo AML development is dependent on cell of origin', 'To evaluate the impact of cell of origin on in vivo leukemogenesis, haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells were transduced with MA9 and transplanted immediately into sublethally irradiated recipients (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To distinguish from cell line-derived leukaemias, we have termed these STHSC:MA9, MPP:MA9, CMP:MA9 and GMP:MA9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed distinct in vivo penetrance and rate of AML development based on the cell of origin (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  STHSC:MA9 and MPP:MA9 were fully penetrant with a median survival time of 74d and 76d post transplant, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CMP:MA9 and GMP:MA9 were partially penetrant (80 and 50%, respectively), with a median survival time of 84d and 239d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In pair-wise comparisons, overall survival of STHSC:MA9, MPP:MA9 and CMP:MA9 were significantly different from overall survival of GMP:MA9 (log-rank test; P less_than 0.0001, P less_than 0.0001, P=0.0086, respectively), and STHSC:MA9 were significantly different from CMP:MA9 (log-rank test; P=0.0358; Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the cell of origin impacts in vivo transformation rate and progression of disease, with STHSC:MA9 and MPP:MA9 progressing rapidly, and CMP:MA9 and GMP:MA9 progressing at a slower rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not observe a significant difference in leukaemia-bearing mice with respect to leukocyte count (Fig 2c), frequency of GFP+ cells in the bone marrow (Supplementary Fig 1d), spleen weight (Supplementary Fig 1e), or frequency of leukaemia stem cells (LSCs) as defined by the cell surface L-GMP phenotype9 (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, the cell surface L-GMP phenotype has previously been shown by secondary transplantation to enrich for LSC activity using the MA9 retroviral transduction model starting from both HSC and GMP cells of origin4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did observe distinct expression of the MA9 transcript in bulk leukaemia cells (Fig 2e) and LSCs (Supplementary Fig 1f) based on cell of origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GMP:MA9 bulk leukaemia cells and LSCs had significantly higher MA9 expression than CMP:MA9 bulk leukaemia cells and LSCs, respectively, consistent with the observation that higher levels of MA9 are required to transform GMP cells14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these data suggest that the gross phenotype of MA9-driven AML from distinct cells of origin is highly similar, consistent with previous reports4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Cell of origin alters tumour aggressiveness of in vivo-derived AML.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic diagram of

suggest MPP:MA9, with increased expression of Cluster II, have greater activation of small GTPase signalling and may be sensitive to targeting of these pathways18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  STHSC:MA9, with the lower expression of Cluster IV, may have greater ability to escape from immune recognition19, contributing to their aggressive phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cluster III (up in CMP:MA9 and GMP:MA9) mainly included predicted lncRNA genes, and Cluster V (up in MPP:MA9 and CMP:MA9) included genes associated with negative regulation of cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate whether these gene signatures were retained from normal cell of origin or were a consequence of transformation, we compared the expression of these genes in normal ST-HSC, MPP, CMP and GMP (Supplementary Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cluster I was not highly expressed in normal ST-HSC, but was highly expressed in normal GMP, consistent with the previously characterized gene expression signature common between normal GMP and

reflect the maturation stage of the cell of origin (Clusters II, IV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the greatest differences in expression between leukaemias based on cell of origin were found between STHSC:MA9 and MPP:MA9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data identify a transcriptional signature that may be used to distinguish ST-HSC-derived from progenitor-derived leukaemias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To evaluate clinical relevance of this signature, we converted each gene to human gene ID and computed prognostic significance of expression level in 200 de novo AML patients spanning the major morphologic and cytogenetic subtypes of AML21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a statistically significant enrichment of prognostic genes (19% in signature versus 10% in overall, two-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction; P=0.00018).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Cbfa2t3 was identified as downregulated in STHSC:MA9 versus progenitor-derived tumours (Fig 3b), and in human AML, low expression of CBFA2T3 was associated with poor prognosis (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KaplanMeier survival curves and relationship of prognostic genes to cytogenetic risk category are

with cell of origin', 'A potential driver of differential AML aggressiveness based on cell of origin, and biomarker of cell of origin, is the acquisition of distinct cooperating mutations.

mice using the Sanger Institute SNP resource24 and SNPs identified in any of our matched normal cell RNA-seq data were removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With respect to somatic mutational burden, only MPP:MA9 were found to consistently contain coding mutations (average three mutations per tumour), and these were not found to be recurrent across multiple biological replicates (Fig 3d, Supplementary Table 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are consistent with data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) showing that MLL fusion-driven AML requires fewer cooperating mutations (on average two mutations per tumour) than other AML-initiating events (on average five mutations per tumour)21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these data suggest that there are no recurrent patterns of MA9-cooperating mutations from

(Lin Sca-1+ c-Kit+, includes ST-HSC and MPP), CMP and GMP by Lara-Astiaso et al.25 We found that ATAC-seq peaks are most abundant in intergenic and intronic regions, followed by promoter regions (Fig 4a), suggesting that ATAC-seq offers distinct regulatory information than what can be gained from transcriptional signatures alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pearsons correlation values between ATAC-seq samples

level (bottom 10 and 25% of ATAC-seq peaks in terms of read counts) correspond to the progressively lowest fraction of transcripts with respect to expression level (Supplementary Fig 6).

to increased gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these data confirm the expected overall correlations between open chromatin and gene expression patterns, but also demonstrates the

genome-wide open chromatin profiling data from a large cohort of human AML patients) is currently not available, we instead utilized available DNA methylation array data from 200 de novo AML patients spanning the major morphologic and cytogenetic subtypes of AML21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been previously demonstrated that 20% of open chromatin regions genome wide show a significant inverse correlation with DNA methylation status8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our rationale was that loci with low DNA methylation level in AML patient samples may correspond to our cell of originspecific open

significantly associated with overall survival in the TCGA de novo AML data set by Cox-regression analysis37, our results represent a significant enrichment of predictive probes proximal to our cell of origin-specific open chromatin regions (Pearsons 2-test; P less_than 0.0001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As enhancer elements are rapidly evolving elements of the genome, we emphasize that our strategy

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have found that tumour cell of origin in MA9-driven AML significantly impacts the in vivo penetrance and rate of AML development, with a spectrum from HSC-derived AMLs being the most aggressive to the most differentiated progenitor cell-derived AMLs being the least aggressive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference in prognosis was associated with modest differences in transcriptional signatures of bulk tumours, where gene expression differences mainly distinguished stem cell-derived from progenitor cell-derived leukaemias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that profiling the chromatin state of regulatory regions of the genome would allow capture of regulatory elements conserved or uniquely gained during the transformation process from distinct cells of origin, reflecting transcriptional potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data demonstrate that open chromatin profiling can be used as a reliable determinant of tumour cell of origin, uniquely and precisely distinguishing each cell of origin tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work represents a proof-of-principle to be applied to normal and transformed primary human cell types, and defines a precision medicine strategy to refine AML prognosis from bulk, circulating tumour (non-stem) cells based on the identity of the cell of origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a recent report demonstrating that cell-free DNA isolated from circulating blood plasma can be used to footprint nucleosome occupancy38 suggesting that our proposed strategy may be more widely applicable to solid tumours using this noninvasive monitoring technique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Work by Krivtsov et al.4 has demonstrated differential leukaemia aggressiveness initiated from HSC versus GMP, using the same MA9 model described here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work confirms and extends their observations, now providing data on experimentally transforming intermediate stages in the normal haematopoietic hierarchy, the MPP and CMP populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By performing our study from staged cells of origin, our molecular signatures can be precisely and thoroughly compared with matched normal cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies focusing on methods of identifying AML cell of origin have utilized gene expression and/or global DNA methylation data derived from the LSC subpopulation4,39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we also observe distinct regions of open chromatin in the LSC subpopulation that are also reflective of cell of origin, many of which are lost as these LSCs differentiate into bulk tumour cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While pursuing these regions will have great value in furthering our understanding of LSC biology, and potentially drug resistance mechanisms, limitations in the translational context include the variability in cell surface marker expression on LSCs41, making it difficult to consistently sample this cell population across AML patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here by focusing on open chromatin regulation in bulk, circulating tumour samples, we have uncovered unique open chromatin signatures that correspond to particular cells of origin, demonstrating the utility of this strategy in determining tumour cell of origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, this also enables us to uncover potential enhancers that may be manipulated to regulate transcriptional programs within leukaemias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, our work demonstrates that many putative enhancer elements (based on H3K4me1 and H3K27ac histone modification marks) do not alter expression of the nearest annotated transcripts, emphasizing that these may represent long-range cis enhancers and/or poised regulatory elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work to model three-dimensional architecture within these tumour subtypes will be critical to identify the gene targets of our identified cell of origin-specific open chromatin regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As previous work has demonstrated that AML cell of origin influences response of tumours to conventional chemotherapeutic agents4, we propose that open chromatin profiling may be used to predict therapeutic response in addition to disease aggressiveness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Why are there differences in tumour aggressiveness when leukaemias are initiated from distinct cell types along a differentiation hierarchy?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene expression profiling in our study as well as others offers some clues as to the underlying basis of differential tumour aggressiveness based on cell of origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High expression of the oncogene Evi1, found in aggressive/poor prognosis AML in this study and others4,12,13, leads to hyperproliferation of bone marrow cells and downregulation of genes important for terminal differentiation42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our gene expression data point to underlying differences in extravasation/migration, small GTPase signal transduction, and immune recognition of AML based on cell of origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our data identify putative lncRNAs that may serve as novel targets for AML subtypes based on cell of origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, this supports that multiple underlying mechanisms contribute to driving AML prognosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies mechanistically interrogating these candidate mechanisms for directed therapeutics toward AML groups, defined based on cell of origin are warranted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Are these findings clinically relevant?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent interrogation of human AML data from TCGA has demonstrated that cell of origin in human AML is variable39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leukaemic transformation was predicted to predominantly occur at either the lymphoid-primed MPP (LMPP) or GMP stage, supporting a previous study demonstrating that human AML LSCs transcriptionally resemble LMPPs or GMPs40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LMPP-like LSCs were found to be the most immature40 and patients in this cluster are at high-cytogenetic risk39, while GMP-like LSCs are more mature40 and patients in this cluster are at low to intermediate cytogenetic risk39, consistent with our results demonstrating that MPP-derived AML is more aggressive in vivo than GMP-derived AML40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the Jung et al.39 study also identified a novel, small subset of AML patient samples that molecularly clustered with normal CMP, and a few samples clustering with normal HSC, MPP or MEP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work suggests that a method to reliably interrogate cell of origin from bulk tumour samples, as we have identified here, will have clinical prognostic utility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The development of genome editing technology has now permitted generation of endogenous MA9 through insertional mutagenesis in primary human haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs)43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome editing of prospectively isolated, normal human HSPC subpopulations will provide a valuable experimental platform to assess which chromatin loci may be retained or uniquely gained on transformation of distinct cells of origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that open chromatin profiling of bulk human AML samples, as well as normal human HSCs and progenitors, should be performed to identify the critical biomarkers with the greatest clinical relevance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we have shown that open chromatin profiling reveals regulatory regions of the genome that could serve as biomarkers of tumour cell of origin, from bulk tumour sampling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our studies provide proof of principle that the epigenetic state of the cell in which an oncogene is initially expressed contributes to the final epigenetic landscape of the tumour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, this work defines putative enhancer regions in the mouse genome that may be manipulated to regulate gene expression within leukaemia cell subsets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work to identify clinically relevant enhancer regions in human AML patients based on this proof of principle will be needed to define a precision medicine strategy to determine tumour cell of origin, provide improved predictions of tumour prognosis and therapeutic response, and allow development of targeted therapies based on unique biology and heterogeneity within currently defined tumour types.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

data of the human MA9 cell line MOLM14 (GEO GSM1587893)36 using Bedtools.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess prognostic significance of DNA methylation status surrounding these loci, regions of ±10 kb from the centre of each open chromatin peak were examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All CpG probes on the Infinium 450 K Human Methylation BeadChip array that fell within these regions were tested individually for prognostic significance in human AML TCGA data21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Methylation status of each sample, for each probe, was classified as high ( greater than 0.8), partial (0.2 less_than  less_than 0.8) or low ( less_than 0.2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cox proportional hazard model was used to test association of methylation status and clinical outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Statistical analyses', 'For overall survival, log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test was performed on KaplanMeier survival curves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A minimum of five mice per sample type and cell dose was chosen to detect a hazards ratio of  greater

Analysis of mice was not blinded during the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Limiting dilution analysis was performed with ELDA software50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analysis of non-survival data was performed by non-parametric one-way analysis of variance (KruskalWallis test) followed by Dunns multiple comparisons test, or two-way analysis of variance followed by Tukeys multiple comparisons test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these experiments, a minimum of 3 samples per condition was chosen to detect statistical differences with  greater than 80% power at an error rate of 5%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variance
