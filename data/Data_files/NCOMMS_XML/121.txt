A-dependent reduction of NCAM2-mediated synaptic adhesion contributes to synapse loss in Alzheimers disease  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Alzheimers disease (AD) is characterized by synapse loss due to mechanisms that remain poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the neural cell adhesion molecule 2 (NCAM2) is enriched in synapses in the human hippocampus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This enrichment is abolished in the hippocampus of AD patients and in brains of mice overexpressing the human amyloid- (A) precursor protein carrying the pathogenic Swedish mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A binds to NCAM2 at the cell surface of cultured hippocampal neurons and induces removal of NCAM2 from synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In AD hippocampus, cleavage of the membrane proximal external region of NCAM2 is increased and soluble extracellular fragments of NCAM2 (NCAM2-ED) accumulate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of NCAM2 expression or incubation with NCAM2-ED induces disassembly of GluR1-containing glutamatergic synapses in cultured hippocampal neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A-dependent disassembly of GluR1-containing synapses is inhibited in neurons overexpressing a cleavage-resistant mutant of NCAM2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data indicate that A-dependent disruption of NCAM2 functions in AD hippocampus contributes to synapse loss.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Learning and memory processes depend on the number and correct functioning of synapses in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell adhesion molecules are enriched in the pre- and postsynaptic membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These molecules physically connect synaptic membranes, providing mechanical stabilization of synaptic contacts1,2,3, are necessary for the formation of new synapses during neuronal development4,5, and maintain and regulate synaptic plasticity in adults6,7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Alzheimers disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative brain condition predominantly of the aging population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the earliest signs of AD is the loss of synapses11, which can at least partially be linked to the toxicity mediated by A12,13,14, a peptide that accumulates in the brains of AD patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The impact of AD on synaptic adhesion and the role of synaptic cell adhesion molecules in the progression of the disease remains poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The neural cell adhesion molecule 2 (NCAM2), sometimes designated OCAM, belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NCAM2 participates in homophilic trans-interactions15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During human embryonic development, NCAM2 is expressed in several tissues, including lung, liver, and kidney with the highest expression in the brain17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression level of NCAM2 peaks around postnatal day 21 and remains high during adulthood15, suggesting that the protein is necessary both during development and in adult brains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, studies with cultured neurons and in NCAM2 deficient mice show that NCAM2 is important for the development of the brain, and the olfactory system in particular18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The NCAM2 gene is located on chromosome 21 in humans and NCAM2 overexpression has been suggested to be one of the factors contributing to the symptoms of Down syndrome17, which presents with early-onset AD pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the NCAM2 gene have been reported as a risk factor related to the progression of AD in the Japanese population20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent genome-wide association study has found an association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the NCAM2 gene and levels of A in the cerebrospinal fluid in humans, suggesting that NCAM2 is involved in the pathogenic pathway to the senile plaques that concentrate in AD brains21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since genetic association studies indicate a link between NCAM2 and AD, we have analysed whether AD pathology influences levels of NCAM2 in synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that the synaptic adhesion mediated by NCAM2 is highly susceptible to A toxicity and that proteolytic fragments of NCAM2 generated in an A-dependent manner can directly contribute to the induction of synapse disassembly.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Synaptic NCAM2 is reduced in the hippocampus in AD', 'To analyse whether functions of NCAM2 are affected in AD, frozen post-mortem brain tissue of AD patients and non-affected controls (n=10 each) was analysed by western blot with antibodies against NCAM2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detailed demographic data for the subjects analysed are presented in Supplementary Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total levels of NCAM2 were slightly increased in the hippocampus, but not significantly affected in the cerebellum or superior temporal cortex in AD (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, levels of VGLUT1, a presynaptic marker-protein of excitatory synapses, were reduced in AD hippocampus (Supplementary Fig 1), indicating a loss of excitatory synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Levels of VGAT, a presynaptic marker-protein of inhibitory synapses, were not significantly affected in any brain region analysed (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Changes in the protein levels in brain homogenates do not necessarily reflect changes in the protein levels in synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To analyse whether the synaptic function of NCAM2 is affected in AD, we compared the enrichment of NCAM2 in synaptosomes isolated from the brain tissue of individuals with AD and non-affected controls by western blot analysis of synaptosomes and total homogenates of the brains used for synaptosome preparations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equal total protein amounts from each probe were applied to the gels to compensate for any possible differences in the yield of synaptosomes because of the synapse loss observed in AD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot analysis with antibodies against actin, VGLUT1, VGAT, synaptophysin (a general presynaptic marker-protein), and PSD95 (a postsynaptic marker-protein), showed that these proteins were enriched to similar levels in synaptosomes from AD and control brains, indicating similar purities of intact synaptosome isolations (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot analysis showed that in control individuals NCAM2 was highly enriched in synaptosomes from the hippocampus and to a lower degree in synaptosomes from the temporal cortex and cerebellum (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This synaptic enrichment of NCAM2 was significantly reduced in synaptosomes from AD hippocampi (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The synaptic enrichment of NCAM2 was slightly lower in the AD versus control cerebellum, however the difference was not statistically significant (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Synaptic accumulation of NCAM2 is reduced in the hippocampus of

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Alzheimers disease is characterized by loss of synapses, which is the strongest correlate of cognitive decline11,29,30,31,32 and possibly one of the earliest events in AD pathogenesis30,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synapses are long lasting contacts between neurons, which are stabilized by a number of cell adhesion molecules that concentrate in pre- and postsynaptic membranes2,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell adhesion molecules play an essential role in maintaining synapse functionality and stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although cell adhesion molecules of many families are required for the synapse integrity8,10, elimination of even one type of synaptic cell adhesion molecule is often sufficient to induce abnormalities in synapse ultrastructure and protein composition6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we show that levels of the synaptic cell adhesion molecule NCAM2 are markedly reduced in hippocampal synapses in AD brains and A-forming APP23 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observations that disruption of NCAM2 interactions at the cell surface, knockdown of NCAM2 expression and A exposure result in reduced numbers of glutamatergic synapses in hippocampal neurons suggest that abnormalities in NCAM2-mediated synaptic adhesion contribute to synapse loss in AD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although the mechanisms of synapse disassembly in AD remain poorly understood, previous studies indicated that synapse loss can be linked to A-induced toxicity12,34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observations showing that synaptic levels of NCAM2 are similarly reduced in APP23 mice and in cultured hippocampal neurons from wild-type mice exposed to A argue in favour of A-dependent mechanisms in the disruption of NCAM2-mediated synaptic adhesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We however do not exclude that other factors, such as disrupted trafficking of NCAM2 to synapses, may also contribute to the reduction of NCAM2 levels at synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, the effects of A on synaptic targeting of NCAM2 were particularly strong in hippocampal but not cortical or cerebellar neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enhanced susceptibility of synaptic NCAM2 to A-dependent proteolysis may therefore contribute to selective vulnerability of the hippocampus to AD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our observations that NCAM2 directly interacts with synthetic A1-42, that A1-42 forms a molecular complex with NCAM2 at the neuronal cell surface and that complexes of NCAM2 and oligomers of A can be isolated from APP23 mouse brains, indicate that NCAM2 may function as a previously unrecognized receptor for A at the neuronal cell surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have shown that A can also bind to other cell adhesion molecules at the neuronal cell surface, among which are the prion protein36 and L137.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a number of cell adhesion molecules have been shown to interact with APP, including the neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1)38 and TAG1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains to be investigated whether the NCAM2/A complex comprises other adhesion molecules and cell surface proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, NCAM1, a homologue of NCAM2, binds to prion protein40 and L1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in spite of homology to NCAM2, NCAM1 binds to a region of APP which is different to the A-containing region38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The fact that NCAM2 directly binds to A suggests that this event may predispose NCAM2 to proteolysis and shedding of its extracellular domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A-derived diffusible ligands, a form of A1-42 used in our study, have been previously shown to attach to the postsynaptic sites of excitatory synapses and induce removal of cell surface proteins13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How exactly A induces NCAM2 proteolysis remains to be investigated, but interestingly, we could show site-specific cleavage of NCAM2 is enhanced in AD synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, A has been shown previously to inhibit shedding of another synaptic cell adhesion molecule, N-cadherin42, an observation which indicates that A does not induce overall degradation of the synaptic cell adhesion machinery but rather target-specific components, including NCAM2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Notably, we found that extracellular domains of NCAM2 accumulate in brains of AD patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to enhanced proteolysis, an increase in the levels of soluble NCAM2 may also be related to overall increased expression of NCAM2 triggered by exposure to A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar increase in levels of expression were observed for cellular prion protein, another key player in A toxicity36, expression of which is increased in response to incubation with A43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observation that incubation of cultured hippocampal neurons with recombinant extracellular domains of NCAM2 results in a reduction of the numbers of glutamatergic synapses suggests that proteolytic products of NCAM2 may exacerbate the effect of A by interfering with NCAM2-mediated homophilic interactions and promoting further disassembly of synaptic contacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the disruption of NCAM2-mediated adhesion, binding of the extracellular domains of NCAM2 may influence the intracellular cytoskeleton by activating intracellular signalling, which can be induced by other members of this family of cell adhesion molecules in response to extracellular ligand binding44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Taken together, we show that A induces synaptic loss and proteolysis of NCAM2 in cell culture and APP transgenic mouse models, providing a mechanistic explanation for synaptic NCAM2 changes in AD brains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detrimental effects of proteolyically cleaved extracellular NCAM2 on synapses may augment the A toxicity in the pathogenesis of AD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exact molecular mechanisms underlying A-induced NCAM2 changes, and to which degree it contributes to onset and progression of disease remains to be established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, our data reveal a new role of NCAM2 in AD that warrants further investigation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
