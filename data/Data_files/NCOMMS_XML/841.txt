Rhomboid family member 2 regulates cytoskeletal stress-associated Keratin 16  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Keratin 16 (K16) is a cytoskeletal scaffolding protein highly expressed at pressure-bearing sites of the mammalian footpad.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be induced in hyperproliferative states such as wound healing, inflammation and cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that the inactive rhomboid protease RHBDF2 (iRHOM2) regulates thickening of the footpad epidermis through its interaction with K16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  K16 expression is absent in the thinned footpads of irhom2/ mice compared with irhom2+/+mice, due to reduced keratinocyte proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gain-of-function mutations in iRHOM2 underlie Tylosis with oesophageal cancer (TOC), characterized by palmoplantar thickening, upregulate K16 with robust downregulation of its type II keratin binding partner, K6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By orchestrating the remodelling and turnover of K16, and uncoupling it from K6, iRHOM2 regulates the epithelial response to physical stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying hyperproliferation of the palmoplantar epidermis in both physiological and disease states, and how this stress keratin is regulated.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The ridged skin of the palms and soles (palmoplantar sites) in mammals is uniquely adapted to withstand remarkable physical stress1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The actual physical resilience of the palmoplantar epidermis is thought to be predominantly due to an abundance of cytoskeletal scaffolding proteins known as keratin intermediate filaments5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Keratins constitute up to 85% of the protein content of differentiated epithelial cells and provide both flexibility and strength by forming a framework within the cytoplasm6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over 50 Keratin isotypes are expressed in stratified and pseudostratified epithelia7; however, their precise expression pattern is both site and situation specific8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Keratins are also expressed in a pairwise manner, with a type I keratin (acidic, keratins 920) paired with its specific type II partner (basic, keratins 18), for example, K6/K16 and K1/K10 (refs 8, 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific pairs initiate heterodimerization through their coiled-coil domains, forming 10 nm filaments, which self-assemble to form the keratin filament network11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Unlike inter-follicular skin, the ridged skin of the palms and soles is characterized by the constitutive expression of Keratins 6, 16, 17 and uniquely, Keratin 9 (K9)1,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to its high expression in the palmoplantar epidermis, K16 can be induced in hyperproliferative states such as during wound healing2,3 and inflammatory skin diseases13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On regeneration, epithelial cells at the wound edge deviate from their normal expression pattern, downregulating K10 and inducing K16 expression within 6 h of injury2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  K16 is also a biomarker of several cancers particularly squamous cell carcinomas, including those originating from cervical, oesophageal and nasopharyngeal epithelia9,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tightly restricted expression pattern of K16 supports the notion that this particular keratin bears unique properties; however, how the dynamic regulation of K16 occurs in response to physiological and cellular stress remains poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Several genetic skin disorders show a predilection for palmoplantar sites16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, germline dominant or recessive mutations in K16 in both humans17,18 and mice19 lead to hyperproliferative thickening of the palms and soles termed palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In humans, PPKs arising from dominantly inherited mutations in K16 are called pachyonychia congenita.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This monogenic disorder is associated with painful thickening of the palmoplantar epidermis on weight bearing17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other PPKs can be caused by inherited defects in non-keratin genes16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One example is Tylosis with oesophageal cancer (TOC, OMIM:148500)20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TOC is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and affected individuals first present with PPK in childhood21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, they carry a  greater than 95% lifetime risk of developing oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma by 65 years of age21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gain-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the inactive rhomboid protease RHBDF2 (iRHOM2) are the underlying cause of this syndrome4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mammalian myeloid and epithelial cells, iRHOM2 promotes the maturation and trafficking of ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17, or tumour necrosis factor- (TNF)-converting enzyme) in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activated ADAM17 then transits to the plasma membrane where it is able to cleave its substrates including TNF, interleukin-6R and epidermal growth factor receptor family ligands23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In TOC-derived keratinocytes, iRHOM2 mutations lead to high levels of constitutive ADAM17 activity with elevated ectodomain shedding of many of its substrates23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TOC keratinocytes also show increased rates of proliferation and rapid migration in monolayer scratch-wound assays when compared with control keratinocytes4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These features suggest that TOC keratinocytes exhibit features resembling a state of constitutive wound healing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from TOC patients also have increased TNF release compared with control PBMCs23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, PBMCs/macrophages from irhom2/ mice have impaired ADAM17 maturation and, consequently, TNF shedding from these cells is almost entirely abolished in response to bacterial stressors22,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we identify iRHOM2 as a novel regulator of K16 in humans and mice, with important implications for PPKs, wound healing, inflammatory skin disease and cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate for the first time that iRHOM2 binds to K16, and that this interaction is increased in TOC keratinocytes, where it is associated with robust downregulation of K16s binding partner K6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In humans and mice, iRHOM2 loss results in dampened proliferation and reduced K16 expression, and in mice this leads to thinning of epidermis in the footpad.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings highlight a novel and fundamental role for iRHOM2 in regulating the epithelial response to mechanical stress.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'iRHOM2/ mice paws reveal a thinner epidermis', 'To elucidate the role of iRHOM2 in the skin, we examined irhom2/ mice22,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these mice were reported to be physically similar to irhom2+/+ mice20,23, re-assessment revealed a striking difference in the paws of adult irhom2/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examination of their forepaws and hind paws revealed diminution of the stress-bearing footpads and also showed pallor and translucency, lacking the normal thickening and hyperpigmentation of the footpads seen in irhom2+/+ littermates (Fig 1a and Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microscopic examination of haematoxylin and eosin-stained skin sections of the fore and hind paws of irhom2/ mice showed thinning of the epidermis (Fig 1b and Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of epidermal thickness demonstrated that irhom2/ mice footpads were significantly thinner than irhom2+/+ (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there was no significant difference in the thickness of their back skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As keratins comprise a major component of the footpad epidermis and are known to be altered in palmoplanter keratodermas16, we performed immunohistochemical staining for the palmoplantar-expressed keratins; K6, K16 and K9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, this revealed diminished K16 expression in irhom2/ throughout the footpad epidermis compared with irhom2+/+ controls (Fig 1d and Supplementary Fig 1d), whereas the expression of K9 was comparable (Fig 1e and Supplementary Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  K6, the predominant type II binding partner of K16 however appeared to be upregulated compared with irhom2+/+ (Fig 1f and Supplementary Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The irhom2/ mouse footpad phenotype directly contrasts what is observed in TOC plantar skin, which exhibits marked thickening and callous formation at sites of pressure (Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the opposing skin phenotypes, the expression pattern of keratins was also reversed in TOC skin compared with irhom2/ mice, with increased K16 expression in lesional interfollicular (non-palm) epidermis (Fig 1h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings implicate iRHOM2 in determining footpad thickness and K16 expression in humans and mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: irhom2/ mice exhibit reduction in epidermal thickness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The hind paws of 16-week-old irhom2/ and irhom2+/+ littermates (n=4 per genotype) were photographed, revealing pallor and diminution of the major stress-bearing paw footpads calluses (black arrowhead) in adult irhom2/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Haematoxylin and eosin-stained cross-sections of hind-paw footpads showed a reduction in thickness of the epidermis (black line) in irhom2/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars, 50 m.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'K16 is a cytoskeletal protein with unique attributes contributing to its expression in specific pathological and physiological situations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It combines the distinct properties of mechanoresilience, flexibility and dynamic turnover, which are necessary in the hyperproliferative stressed stratified epithelia where it is expressed2,3, including at the wound edge, psoriasis, carcinogenesis and the palmoplantar epidermis1,5,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, how this particular keratin is regulated in response to cellular stress has remained elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, using human and mouse models, we report that iRHOM2 is a novel and unexpected regulator of the cytoskeletal response to physical stress through its interaction with K16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate direct interaction between iRHOM2 and K16, and show synchronicity between the expression pattern of these two proteins; shRNA-mediated knockdown of iRHOM2 in human keratinocytes or irhom2/ in mouse paw skin is associated with depleted K16 and, reciprocally, high iRHOM2 activity in TOC is associated with increased K16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Wound edge keratinocytes are poised to undergo proliferation and migration and thus allow tissue regeneration38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  K16 is rapidly expressed in response to tissue injury and, ultrastructurally, has been shown to adopt a perinuclear arrangement of filaments, which proceeds the onset of migratory behaviour2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies have shown that this delocalization is linked to fragmentation of rigid keratin filaments from the cell periphery, thereby increasing cell plasticity, subsequently facilitating proliferation, migration and invasion39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In TOC we observed increased K16 expression and perinuclear distribution of the filament network even in the absence of stress and this was enhanced further by mechanical stretching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that this process is mediated by increased iRHOM2 activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data show increased binding between iRHOM2 and K16 in TOC and this is also linked to downregulation of K16s major binding partner K6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is tempting to speculate that this results because iRHOM2 and K6 share the same interacting domain with K16, Coil 1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, we also observed, to a lesser extent, downregulation of K6 at mRNA level; however, how this occurs remains to be explored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Potentially, a negative feedback loop may exist when K6 binding to K16 is reduced, thereby preventing unstable K6 monomer accumulation in the cytoplasm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When K16 and K6 dimerize, the latter binds the complex to desmosomal adhesions structures, stabilizing the intermediate filament network31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, differential downregulation of K6 could release K16 from desmosomes and allow perinuclear localization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, K16 filament turnover is expedited in the absence of K6 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29), further facilitating migration and proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perinuclear localization of K16 and dynamic filament turnover would in turn contribute to the increased proliferation and migration in TOC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of high K16 expression in response to mechanical stress and increased cell turnover in the presence of upregulated iRHOM2 activity provide a possible explanation for the presence of PPK in TOC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model could also explain the diminished K16 expression and thinner footpads in irhom2/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although wounded epithelia rapidly induce both K6 and K16, perinuclear reorganization of K16 occurs despite the presence of K6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This also raises the possibility that the differential regulation of K6 and K16 occurring in TOC may be a phenomenon linked to neoplasia in these cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As K16 is highly expressed in disease states such as epithelial cancers and inflammatory dermatoses, there may be a broader significance for the role of iRHOM2 in the pathophysiology of these disorders, which remains to be explored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of inflammation in the paws of irhom2/ mice in contrast to K16-KO mice is noteworthy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  K16-KO mice have previously been shown to exhibit painful callous formation and activation of inflammatory pathways and, histologically, an influx of inflammatory cells such as macrophages are evident19,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, irhom2/ mice exhibit thinned footpads without overt inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As ADAM17 is a further target of iRHOM2 in keratinocytes and macrophages22,23,25, we suggest that its downregulation in the paws of irhom2/ mice dampens the development of an inflammatory PPK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could point to a hitherto unidentified role for ADAM17 in the development of PPK-associated inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, pharmacological modulation of iRHOM2 by targeting two stress-response proteins, K16 and ADAM17, could provide a specific therapeutic strategy in the treatment of PPKs, inflammatory epithelial disease and neoplasia.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
