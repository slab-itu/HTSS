Scanning tunnelling spectroscopy of superconductivity on surfaces of LiTi2O4(111) thin films  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Unique superconductivity at surfaces/interfaces, as exemplified by LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interfaces, and the high transition temperature in ultrathin FeSe films, have triggered intense debates on how superconductivity is affected in atomic and electronic reconstructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The surface of superconducting cubic spinel oxide LiTi2O4 is another interesting system because its inherent surface electronic and atomic reconstructions add complexity to superconducting properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Investigations of such surfaces are hampered by the lack of single crystals or high-quality thin films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, using low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy, we report an unexpected small superconducting energy gap and a long coherence length on the surface of LiTi2O4(111) epitaxial thin films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we find that a pseudogap opening at the Fermi energy modifies the surface superconductivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results open an avenue for exploring anomalous superconductivity on the surface of cubic transition-metal oxides, where the electronic states are spontaneously modulated involving rich many-body interactions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Recent advances in the atomic-scale synthesis and characterization of two-dimensional superconductors have kindled significant interest in their exotic electronic, orbital and magnetic structures1,2,3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the ultrathin superconducting films on substrates7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20, surfaces of cubic-structure superconducting transition-metal oxides provide another interesting platform, because the spontaneous electronic and atomic reconstructions on surfaces are expected to modify superconductivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A particularly interesting system is the spinel oxide (AB2O4) superconductor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this system, the cubic pyrochlore sublattice of B-atoms provides large degeneracy (frustration) of charge, spin and orbital states in bulk21,22, and a prominent degeneracy lifting at the surface is expected to lead rich electronic states on the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the previous studies, however, has revealed the electronic signature of modulated superconductivity on their surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Lithium titanate, LiTi2O4, is the only oxide superconductor with spinel structure23,24,25,26, and exhibits the highest superconducting transition temperature (Tc) with 13.7 K of any spinel superconductors27,28,29,30,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is known as a 3d0.5 metallic system (one half of an electron per Ti atom resides in the 3d states), and medium-coupling BardeenCooperSchrieffer (BCS) superconductivity with s-wave pairing symmetry has been proposed33,34,35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent transport data with epitaxial films showed an angle-dependent anomalous magnetoresistance, which is possibly related to a spin and orbital fluctuation effect22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of this data, the similarity between LiTi2O4 and high Tc cuprates has been discussed22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although superconducting properties of bulk LiTi2O4 have been investigated extensively, studies of the superconductivity at LiTi2O4 surfaces have been hindered by the lack of single crystals and high-quality thin films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, high-quality epitaxial LiTi2O4 thin films were successfully grown using pulsed laser deposition (PLD)37,38,39; however, investigations of the superconductivity on LiTi2O4 surfaces remain unexplored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, we have developed a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) combined with a PLD system40, and in situ investigation of the LiTi2O4 surface without exposing to air has became possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report modified superconductivity at the surfaces of LiTi2O4(111) epitaxial thin films, using STM/scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STM/STS) and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the atomic-scale observations of superconductivity, we present measurements of the unexpected small superconducting energy gap  and a long coherence length  values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we found that a superconducting gap exists on large energy scale pseudogap states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide the spectroscopic evidence of spontaneous superconducting modification on the surface of cubic transition-metal oxides, paving an interesting path to explore exotic superconductivity involving rich interactions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Preparation of higher Tc sample with flat surface', 'We found that low-temperature film deposition using PLD followed by post-deposition annealing increases Tc up to 13 K, together with improved surface flatness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first compare the STM images of the films grown at substrate temperature Ts of 600 °C (Fig 1a) and 400 °C (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The former temperature is the typical growth temperature reported in the previous studies22,37,38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While many triangular-shaped islands are observed on both surfaces, the height of the islands is much smaller in the latter film, indicating that the surface roughness is strongly dependent on the growth temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the Ts is reduced from 600 to 400 °C, the root mean square (RMS) value of surface roughness, RRMS, improved from 0.86 (Fig 1a) to 0.40 nm (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further improve the surface roughness, we investigated the post-deposition annealing effect on the film grown at Ts=400 °C; thin films were annealed at 600 °C in ultrahigh vacuum for an hour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expectedly, the film became flatter to RRMS=0.28 nm (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, this RRMS value was improved to 0.21 nm for the film deposited at Ts=300 °C followed by the above-mentioned annealing (Fig 1d and Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Surface topographies and superconducting critical temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) STM topographic images of as-deposited thin film at substrate temperature of 600 °C (a) and 400 °C (b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c,d) STM images after post-deposition annealing (PDA) for films deposited at 400 °C (c) and 300 °C (d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that b,c are taken with using the same film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ac are obtained at 77 K and d is obtained at 4.2 K (all the STM images were observed at a sample-bias voltage of +300 mV and a tunnelling current is about 10 pA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 80 nm (ad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Growth temperature dependence of root mean square of surface roughness (RRMS) values: as-grown samples (blue symbols) and after PDA (red symbols).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The value of RRMS is evaluated from topographic images observed at a sample-bias voltage of +300 mV and a tunnelling current of 10 pA (scan area of 400 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) Temperature dependence of the field-cooled dc magnetic susceptibility for the LiTi2O4 films in a magnetic field of 50 Oe, which was applied parallel to the (111) plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clear diamagnetism is observed.Full size image', 'Importantly, this annealing process increases Tc values (Fig 1f), in addition to the flattening of the surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the Tc values of the films grown at Ts=500 and 600 °C show 12.0 K and 12.5 K, respectively, the Tc increases up to 13.0 K for the films after annealing (red curves in Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Tc value of 13 K is one of the highest values among reported values for LiTi2O4 epitaxial thin films22,37,38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed from X-ray diffraction that the films exhibit rocking-curve full-width at half-maximum of 0.36° for 444 peak, and that the lattice is fully relaxed from SrTiO3(111) substrate (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The above results show that the quality of the sample is quite high.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the following investigations, we focus on the films deposited at Ts=300 °C followed by the post-deposition annealing in vacuum at 600 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Atomic-scale order on LiTi2O4(111) film surface', 'We observed, on the atomic level, a well-ordered triangular lattices and defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2a shows the wide-area STM image of the LiTi2O4 surface, where flat terraces and dark spots with peculiar defect shapes were observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the close-up image (Fig 2c), strong topographic corrugations (shown in blue) are observed together with weak topographic corrugations (shown in red), displaying three-fold symmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the inherent three-fold rotational symmetry along the 111 axis in a spinel system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unit cell size was found to be 0.6 nm (Fig 2c), which was independent of the location and sample-bias voltages Vs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This size well matches that of the unit cell of LiTi2O4 bulk (111) plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We concluded that the protrusions of the triangular lattice originate from Ti atoms on the surface, as discussed later together with the nature of the defects (dark spots).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Typical topographic images on a terrace.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Filled-state STM image of LiTi2O4(111) surface (11.6 nm × 11.6 nm, sample-bias voltage Vs of 900 mV, tunnelling current Iset of 30 pA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Empty-state STM image (4 nm × 4 nm, Vs=+30 mV, Iset=30 pA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Zoomed-up image (1.7 nm × 1.7 nm, Vs=+30 mV, Iset=30 pA) of b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The image shows three-fold symmetry representing the spinel crystal structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars, 2 nm (a), 0.8 nm (b) and 0.3 nm (c).Full size image', 'Superconductivity in tunnelling spectra measurements', 'In addition to the atomic-scale corrugations, we observed clear signature of superconductivity in tunnelling spectra measurements at 4.2 K.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'To understand the superconductivity on the LiTi2O4(111) surface, we performed first-principles calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first calculated the bulk electronic structures to understand the triangular lattice observed in the STM images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 5a shows the calculated partial DOS for bulk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ti 3d states predominantly contribute near EF, and the influence of Li atoms should be negligible to the STM images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the main protrusions of the triangular lattice observed in the topographic image (indicated by blue colour in Fig 2) correspond to Ti atoms on the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Comparison between bulk and surface electronic states based on DFT calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Calculated DOS for bulk

TiLi1-terminated surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DOS for bulk is shown again for clarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here 0 on the horizontal axes in a,f correspond to the Fermi energy.Full size image', 'To further understand the LiTi2O4(111) surface, we calculated the electronic structures of four possible bulk-cut surfaces: two-types of O-terminated, Kagome-lattice Ti-terminated, and TiLi2-terminated surfaces (see four dotted lines in Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These surfaces were optimized structurally and the electronic states of the reconstructed surfaces were investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the two O-terminated surfaces resulted in an insulating band structure (Supplementary Fig 4a,b), which is inconsistent with the experimental metallic tunnelling spectra (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the Kagome-lattice Ti-terminated surface, the simulated charge density plot (Supplementary Fig 4c) also shows inconsistency with the experimental topographic image (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, neither the O-terminated nor the Kagome-lattice Ti-terminated surface reproduced the experimental results (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, TiLi2-terminated surface shows metallic states, and the arrangement of the protrusions and their nearest neighbour distance (0.6 nm) observed in the STM image (Fig 2) can be explained by the framework of Ti-triangular lattice of TiLi2 layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We focus on the TiLi2-terminated surface, and further investigate the effect of Li-layer deficiency near surface since Li may be easily deficient during depositions process due to its high volatility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TiLi2-terminated surface contains a triangular lattice of Ti atoms, and two layers of Li atoms: Li atoms displaced towards the vacuum (hereafter called higher Li layer, dark green circle in Fig 5b) and those displaced towards the bulk (hereafter called lower Li layer, light green circle in Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three possible models of surface terminations are considered: a stoichiometric TiLi2-terminated surface, a surface without the higher Li layer (TiLi1-terminated surface), and a surface without both higher and lower Li layer (TiLi0-terminated surface) (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On the basis of the following discussion, we could exclude TiLi0-terminated surface by showing that Li atoms reside at the vicinity of the topmost Ti-triangular lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 5c shows a close-up image of the dark spots observed in the wide-area STM image (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three oval protrusions are observed, and this image indicates that a defect centre is around the middle of the three oval protrusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that the ovals are at the Ti sites, and taking into account the crystal structure of spinel system, the defects could be identified as a point-Li defect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the dark contrast around this point-Li defect, observed at a negative sample-bias voltage of 900 meV, is consistent with hole-doping nature of Li vacancy (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that Li atoms reside at the vicinity of the topmost Ti-triangular lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the results exclude TiLi0 termination, and the surface of the films is terminated with either TiLi2 or TiLi1 structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the density of point-Li defects on the surface is  less_than 2% of Li atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we speculate that the impact of the presence of point-Li defects on superconductivity can be negligible25, unless the defects on the surfaces induce local magnetic moments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We now compare the DOS at EF, N(EF), of a bulk and that of the TiLi2- and TiLi1- terminated surfaces, and reveal that both surfaces have smaller N(EF) than that of the bulk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our DFT calculations for bulk show a peak structure at EF (Fig 5a), which is consistent with previous calculations using the linear muffin-tin orbital method44 and full-potential linearized augmented plane wave45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulated peak structure at EF is also consistent with an experimental report of large normal-state electronic-specific heat, which is a measure of N(EF) for bulk35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the TiLi2- (Fig 5d) and TiLi1- (Fig 5e) terminated surfaces, a broken lattice symmetry normal to the surface lifts the degeneracy of the t2g orbitals and modifies the orbital states on the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared to the bulk, we observed reduction of the N(EF) at the topmost Ti atoms for both TiLi2 and TiLi1 (Fig 5f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the smaller N(EF) leads to lower Tc according to the BCS theory, the calculation naively suggest suppressed superconductivity on the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Based on the above discussions, we present here coherent interpretation of the experimental results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we experimentally observed a pseudogap state (shaded red in Fig 3a,b), which is expected to be absent in bulk, the modified superconductivity on the surface is a reasonable hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, using bulk Tc and surface , the 2/kBTc value becomes anomalously small.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is puzzling since the value 3.0 is much smaller than that for a weak coupling limit of BCS superconductors (3.52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this puzzle can be explained by considering the presence of a non-superconducting or reduced-Tc surface layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the large  value can possibly be understood as the reduced N(EF) due to pseudogap formation on the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Fermi velocity vF is proportional to 1/N(EF); therefore, based on the formula  = vF/D derived from BCS theory, the larger vF together with smaller D on a surface increases  more than that for the bulk value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond the framework of the less-interacting picture, it is an interesting future subject to investigate relations between modified superconductivity, pseudogap formation and frustration effects on this (111) oriented spinel oxide surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we have investigated superconductivity in the atomically well-defined surface of LiTi2O4(111) thin films, using STM/STS and first-principles calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provided spectroscopic evidence of modified superconductivity on the surface, originating from the formation of a pseudogap in the DOS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study has made an essential first step towards exploring superconducting phenomena emerging from spontaneous atomic and
