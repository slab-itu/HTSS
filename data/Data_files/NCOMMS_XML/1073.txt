CMG2/ANTXR2 regulates extracellular collagen VI which accumulates in hyaline fibromatosis syndrome  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Loss-of-function mutations in capillary morphogenesis gene 2 (CMG2/ANTXR2), a transmembrane surface protein, cause hyaline fibromatosis syndrome (HFS), a severe genetic disorder that is characterized by large subcutaneous nodules, gingival hypertrophy and severe painful joint contracture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that CMG2 is an important regulator of collagen VI homoeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CMG2 loss of function promotes accumulation of collagen VI in patients, leading in particular to nodule formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, collagen VI accumulates massively in uteri of Antxr2/ mice, which do not display changes in collagen gene expression, and leads to progressive fibrosis and sterility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crossing Antxr2/ with Col6a1/ mice leads to restoration of uterine structure and reversion of female infertility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also demonstrate that CMG2 may act as a signalling receptor for collagen VI and mediates its intracellular degradation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Hyaline fibromatosis syndrome (HFS) is a painful and disfiguring, potentially lethal, genetic disorder, the hallmark of which is the progressive growth of subcutaneous nodules, caused by accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients also present gingival hypertrophy, severe and painful joint contracture, skin thickening and hyperpigmentation over the large joints1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HFS is caused by loss-of-function mutations in capillary morphogenesis gene 2 (refs 3, 4) (CMG2), also known as anthrax toxin receptor 2 (ANTXR2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ANTXR2/CMG2 gene encodes a single-pass transmembrane protein harbouring an extracellular von Willebrand A (vWA) domain proposed to bind collagen IV and laminin5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ANTXR2 name stems from its well-characterized role in binding and endocytosis of Bacillus anthracis toxins6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, its physiological role is poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In zebrafish, it is involved in orienting cell division during embryogenesis within the planar cell polarity pathway8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mice, Antxr2 knockout was first reported to have no major consequence, other than resistance to anthrax infection9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent observations however showed that female Antxr2/ mice suffer from severe progressive fibrosis of the uterus leading to disruption of tissue architecture and failure of parturition10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we discovered an uncharacterized function of CMG2 that can account for both the presence of nodules in HFS patients and the uterine phenotype in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that both the nodules of HFS patient and the uteri of Antxr2/ female mouse are highly enriched in collagen VI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The progressive accumulation of collagen VI leads to loss of uterus integrity and ultimately sterility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, we find that Antxr2/::Col6a1/ double knockout mice are fertile, with complete restoration of the uterine myometrial layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We go on to show that CMG2 may be a receptor for collagen VI and mediates its transport to lysosomes for degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, loss of CMG2 function causes accumulation of collagen VI in the ECM, which with time may lead to tissue disruption and disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identification of CMG2 as collagen VI regulator opens new avenues towards understanding other processes involving this ECM protein such as obesity-induced insulin resistance12,13 and muscle homoeostasis14.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Accumulation of collagen VI in HFS patient nodules', 'Two biopsies of nodules, which often form at body site exposed to mechanical stress15, were obtained from a 6-year-old HFS patient (Supplementary Fig 1a and Supplementary Note 1 for patient information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One biopsy was taken from a nodule on the scalp on the posterior region of the head and the other from the back of the left ear, both with matching non-nodular adjacent tissue samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Non-nodular tissues showed normal skin architecture, with a regular epithelial layer, and a connective tissue of the dermis composed of a thick fibrillar ECM with embedded vessels (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nodules contained very few, spindle-shaped cells embedded in an abundant amorphous, pale eosinophilic ECM (Fig 1a) as reported for other patients16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sirius red (SR) staining confirmed differences in ECM between normal and nodular tissues (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, ultrastructure analysis by electron microscopy (EM) showed that whereas in the non-nodular tissue, cells were surrounded by a fibrillar ECM, the few cells observable in the nodule, were surrounded by a granular somewhat amorphous matrix with occasional fibrillar bundles (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: HFS patient nodules display ECM accumulation and loss of skin adnexa and dermal vessels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) H&E staining of formalin-fixed non-nodular skin and nodule from the ear and the head of a HFS patient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nodule displays a striking accumulation of ECM, causing secondary loss of skin adnexa, vascular structures and rarefaction of the dermal cellular component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One biopsy was obtained by tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A representative image is shown for each.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 200 m.

identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collagen VI can bind several integrins, such 1, 2, 5, 10 and 11, as well as to the cell surface proteoglycan CSPG4/NG2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29), but not as an exclusive ligand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As these proteins, CMG2 binds to the triple helical domain of collagen VI (Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This differs from its related protein ANTXR1/TEM8, which was reported to

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Analyses of HFS patient nodules and of Antxr2/ mouse uteri pointed towards a non-genetic interaction of CMG2 with collagen VI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies on purified proteins and tissue culture cells revealed that collagen VI can bind to the vWA domain of CMG2 via its triple helical domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While a complete characterization of CMG2 interaction with collagen VI, including the specific-binding site and affinity, requires further studies, we found that this interaction leads to ligand-induced endocytosis of the receptor, which targets collagen VI to lysosomal degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are consistent with previous observations showing that collagen VI fibrils are insensitive to MMPs24 but require serine and cysteine hydrolases, such as those found in lysosomes, for degradation31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These findings provide an explanation for the collagen VI accumulation observed in certain tissues or body parts of HFS patients, leading to progressive loss of tissue integrity and thereby function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Why certain tissues are particularly sensitive to loss of CMG2 function requires further investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sensitivity of the mouse uterus might be due to the fluctuating level of collagen VI in this organ, in particular during early gestation32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While excess of collagen VI is detrimental, decreased levels also lead to diseases, such as Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy and Bethlem myopathy (OMIM #25090, #158810)33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the amount of collagen VI in the extracellular environment needs to be tightly controlled, and CMG2 appears to play a critical role in this process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Binding of collagen VI to CMG2 might not systematically lead to endocytosis and degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An equilibrium between binding/signalling and endocytosis must exist, which depends on the concentration of collagen VI in the cellular environment, as described for the EGF receptor35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the massive accumulation of collagen VI in the extracellular environment might not be entirely due to the absence of endocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since collagen VI was found to modulate MMPs activity10,36, its accumulation could sequester inactive MMPs creating a positive feedback loop of ECM accumulation, leading to fibrosis37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The data obtained in Antxr2/::Col6a1/ mice indicates that collagen VI is the key initiator of the uterus fibrosis and most likely of nodule formation in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While inhibition of collagen synthesis has so far not been evaluated as a strategy to treat fibrotic disease38, specific targeting of collagen VI could be a new therapeutic strategy for HFS patients to attenuate or even revert the formation of nodules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a novel collagen VI regulator, it will also be of great interest to investigate the role of CMG2 in the collagen VI-dependent regulatory processes such as muscle homoeostasis14 and adipogenesis12.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
