Sulfur mass-independent fractionation in subsurface fracture waters indicates a long-standing sulfur cycle in Precambrian rocks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The discovery of hydrogen-rich waters preserved below the Earths surface in Precambrian rocks worldwide expands our understanding of the habitability of the terrestrial subsurface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many deep microbial ecosystems in these waters survive by coupling hydrogen oxidation to sulfate reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydrogen originates from waterrock reactions including serpentinization and radiolytic decomposition of water induced by decay of radioactive elements in the host rocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The origin of dissolved sulfate, however, remains unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report, from anoxic saline fracture waters 2.4 km below surface in the Canadian Shield, a sulfur mass-independent fractionation signal in dissolved sulfate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that this sulfate most likely originates from oxidation of sulfide minerals in the Archaean host rocks through the action of dissolved oxidants (for example, HO· and H2O2) themselves derived from radiolysis of water, thereby providing a coherent long-term mechanism capable of supplying both an essential electron donor (H2) and a complementary acceptor (sulfate) for the deep biosphere.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Precambrian crystalline rocks have recently provided evidence for a deep hydrosphere of hitherto unexpected antiquity1,2,3, with noble gas-derived mean residence times for fracture waters of tens of million years (in the Witwatersrand Basin, South Africa4,5) to billions of years (1.1 to 1.8 Ga at Kidd Creek in the Canadian Shield3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At Kidd Creek mine, Timmins, Ontario, the fracture waters from 2.4 km depth below the surface were found to contain the most radiogenic helium (He), neon (Ne) and argon (Ar) isotope signatures identified so far in groundwater, while the presence of excess 129Xe in the waters was attributed to remnants of the last regional incursion of metamorphic fluids that occurred at 2.6 Ga (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discovery of these fracture waters flowing out of boreholes at rates of up to a litre per minute (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3) provides novel insights into the fluid and atmospheric history of the early Earth that are complementary to conventional approaches that have focused exclusively to date on mineral phases and fluid inclusions6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Deep fracture waters in the Precambrian Canadian Shield rocks are generally characterized by high salinities (total dissolved solids up to 325 g l1), Ca-, Na-, Mg- and Cl-rich compositions, and 18O and 2H values falling well above the Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL) as a result of extensive fluidrock interaction8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H2 produced by radiolysis10 and/or serpentinization can accumulate in fracture waters to millimolar concentration levels, approaching those seen at marine hydrothermal vents1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discovery of chemolithoautotrophic microbial ecosystems coupling H2 oxidation to sulfate reduction in the fracture waters at least 2.8 km deep in South Africas Witwatersrand Basin5,11 and in deep Fennoscandian groundwater12 has generated intense interest in understanding the reactions and energy sources that sustain this subsurface terrestrial biosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although charge balance dictates production of H2 via radiolysis must necessarily produce equivalent oxidants1,10, the important question of the origin of sulfate (the essential electron acceptor to support a sulfate-reducing microbial ecosystem5,11) has not yet been resolved for these hydrogeologically isolated ancient fracture waters in Precambrian crystalline rocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The Kidd Creek Cu-Zn-Ag mine, where the samples in this study were collected, is located in the southwestern Abitibi greenstone belt in the Superior Province of the Canadian Shield (Supplementary Fig 1), and is currently the deepest base metal mine in North America.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Kidd Creek ore deposits are typical volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposits13 formed from low-temperature (250 °C) hydrothermal systems below the seafloor with some mixing of seawater14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sulfide ores occur within a set of Archaean igneous and (meta-)sedimentary rock sequences (Supplementary Figs 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The igneous rocks are ultramafic, mafic (gabbros and basalts) to felsic (mainly rhyolites) in composition16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The (meta-)sedimentary rocks vary from clastic graywackes to graphitic argillites18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The formation of the rhyolites that bounds the main ore bodies was initiated as a result of rifting of a back arc-like basin, similar to the Lau Basin14, at 2.717 Ga, reached peak at 2.716 Ga and extended to 2.711 Ga (refs 19, 20, 21), which bracket the ore formation ages to 2.7172.711 Ga.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The onset of convergence and collapse of rift basin induced calc-akaline volcanism as well as deposition of graywackes between 2.700 and 2.695 Ga.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regional metamorphism and deformation to greenschist facies was initiated as folding in 2.690 Ga and reached peak metamorphism at 2.660 Ga with sporadic intrusions of tonalite, granite and granitoid20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A discrete hydrothermal event (maximum temperatures estimated at 400 °C) occurred at 2.640 Ga (refs 20, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Localized, lower-temperature hydrothermal alteration could have continued as late as 2.60 Ga (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23), based on the growth of fuchsite in metasomatized ultramafic rocks, and sericite in rhyolite along steep faults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No major hydrothermal events are thought to have occurred in the Kidd Creek area after 2.60 Ga (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The sulfide minerals in the Kidd Creek ores include major layered massive sulfides in the ore body (formed in well-mixed submarine environments), and minor sulfides in turbidites (representing collapsed vent chimneys) and sinters (representing cooled vent effluent) in graphitic argillite layers between the massive sulfide layers (Supplementary Fig 3)14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sulfide minerals at Kidd Creek have previously been shown to have sulfur isotope mass-independent fractionation (S-MIF) signals15,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The S-MIF signals are commonly identified as non-zero 33S and 36S values, which are defined as 3xS=3xSmeasured1,000 × (1+34Smeasured/1,000)3x1 (in which x=3, 6, 33=0.515, 36=1.90, 3xS=1,000 × (3xS/32S)sample/(3xS/32S)standard1, and the standard is Vienna Cañon Diablo Troilite, VCDT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Terrestrial S-MIF is interpreted to arise from photochemical reactions in Earths early anoxic atmosphere25,26 and commonly seen in crustal rocks formed before 2.4 Ga (refs 27, 28) but thought to disappear from the geological record after 2.3 Ga.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The massive sulfide ores have consistently negative 33S values from 0 to 0.19 VCDT15, while sulfides in turbidites and sinters vary more widely with 33S from 1.50 to 1.76 VCDT15,24 (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report multiple sulfur isotope compositions of dissolved sulfate in the saline fracture waters from the Kidd Creek mine that were the focus of the previous noble gas study3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The saline fracture waters are intersected by drillholes (300600 m-long) at 2.4 km depth below the surface and naturally flow out of all the boreholes in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe S-MIF signals in dissolved sulfate in these waters and demonstrate that the S-MIF signature of dissolved sulfate originates from sulfide minerals in the host rocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oxidation of sulfide to sulfate is likely induced by oxidants that are produced by radiolytic dissociation of water, which also produces H2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the water radiolysis is driven by decay of radioactive elements (for example, U, Th, K) in the host rocks, our results indicate that the fracture waters themselves, by interacting with their host rocks in the Precambrian cratons, can provide both an electron acceptor (sulfate) and a complementary electron donor (H2) that in turn could support microbial ecosystems in these isolated subsurface fracture systems.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Water geochemistry', 'Fracture water samples were collected (see the Methods section) over periods from 3 to  greater than 60 months after the completion of borehole drilling, with the exception of sample 12262-FW-10.05.07 (marked by in Table 1), which was collected immediately after drilling finished.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fracture waters flow freely out of the boreholes at rates of up to 770 ml min1, corresponding to a total water discharge of  greater than 870 m3 or 106 kg from a single borehole over the course of this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The water samples in this study are among the most saline fracture waters in the Canadian Shield with conductivities mostly around 150 mS cm1 (Table 1) and show strong deviations of 18O and 2H above the GMWL (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Geochemical and isotopic characterization of fracture waters and dissolved sulfur species.Full size table', 'Figure 1: 18O and 2H of subsurface fracture waters.KC represents Kidd Creek (data from this study).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some other sites (YN, Yellowknife; TH, Thompson; SB, Sudbury) in the Canadian Shield (data source: ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8), local meteoric water in Timmins, Ontario (TM-LMW), Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL) and drilling water in the Kidd Creek mine (KC-DW) are also plotted for comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars (1) are smaller than the symbols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to what is observed in the subsurface fracture waters in South Africa38,69, less saline samples (typically from shallower depths) have oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions that lie on the GMWL due to mixing with surface water-derived components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While some recharge of surface water to depth cannot be ruled out38, the practice of recirculation of surface lake water to depth for use as drilling and service water in the mine is the most likely explanation for the presence of meteoric waters at such depths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KC-DW lies slightly below the GMWL, attributable to water evaporation in the local source lake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brine fracture waters lie well above the GMWL due to intensive fluidrock interaction as seen at other sites across the Canada Shield8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each site, a mixing line can be drawn between the most saline fracture water end-member and meteoric water end-members that lie on the GMWL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples from this study record some of the most elevated 2H and 18O values ever observed (31.6 to 39.5, and 11.6 to 14.3, respectively) and attest to the lack of significant mixing with surface/drilling waters in the fracture fluids that are the focus of this study.Full size image', 'Dissolved sulfate and multiple sulfur isotopes', 'Dissolved sulfur species in the fracture waters are dominated by sulfate (97 to 376 M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total dissolved sulfide species (H2S, HS and S2) are all below the detection limit of 2 M.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The 33S and 36S values of dissolved sulfate varied from borehole to borehole but remained nearly constant (within analytical uncertainty) for a given borehole over the course of this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 33S values of dissolved sulfate are identical to those of massive sulfide minerals in the Kidd Creek ore deposits (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sulfur isotopic data of dissolved sulfate from all boreholes define a 36S/33S slope of 1.1 with an uncertainty of 2.7 at 95% confidence level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the uncertainty is relatively large due to the small size of the measured 36S values, the estimated slope of 1.1 is close to the value characteristic of sulfides in Archaean rocks (approximately 0.9; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24) but statistically distinct from the canonical mass-dependent fractionation (MDF) slope of approximately 7 (refs 28, 29; Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of sizable S-MIF in 36S/32S values rules out the magnetic isotope effect associated with thermochemical sulfate reduction by amino acids as the cause30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the non-zero 33S values measured here (as large as 20 × the external reproducibility) are associated with relatively small positive 34S values (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These combined characteristics cannot be explained by MDF during either microbial sulfate reduction28 or mixing29, both of which require substantial changes in 34S to account for comparable changes in 33S values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we conclude that the observed S-MIF signatures in the fracture water sulfate are of Archaean origin, previously identified only in minerals and rock samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although the fracture waters have been shown to contain remnants of 2.6 Ga hydrothermal fluids based on excess 129Xe (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3), our data cannot be explained by preservation of primordial sulfate from the Archaean ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A previous study proposed that local Neoarchaean seawater at Kidd Creek had a much more negative 33S value of 1.5 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If such a seawater component were present, it would account for less than 13% of the observed sulfate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming the solid trend line defined by the data in Fig 2a represents a conservative mixing line with this Neoarchaean seawater end-member, the extrapolated Archaean seawater sulfate component would lie far to the right, at 1/SO42 values between 0.03 to 0.13 M1, and with a large positive 34S value (13 to 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This estimate is inconsistent with 34S value of around 5 proposed for Archaean seawater sulfate31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data also cannot be explained by more recent interpretations of Archaean seawater sulfate characterized by positive 33S values, based on carbonate-associated sulfate32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the dissolved sulfate in the fracture waters cannot have been sourced from dissolution of Archaean sulfate minerals (for example, barite, gypsum) because such sulfate minerals are not present in the cores we have investigated, nor are they observed in other studies of similar deposits in the area15,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A simpler interpretation is that the fracture water sulfate originates from the oxidation of sulfide minerals in the Kidd Creek ore deposit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This explanation is supported by the observations that the dissolved sulfate and the host rock sulfides (specifically the massive pyrite) have similar 36S/33S slopes and 33S ranges (Fig 3 and Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As estimated by the overall quantities of major metals (Fe, Cu, Zn, Pb) and sulfur16, the massive pyrite accounts for about 70% of the total sulfur budget in the host rocks (Supplementary Table 1), and thus the sulfur isotopic signature of the massive pyrite is representative of the host rock overall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of waterrock reaction is also supported by mineralogical observations of dissolution (Supplementary Fig 5) and re-precipitation (Supplementary Fig 6) textures on the surfaces of sulfide minerals in drill core samples from the Kidd Creek ore deposit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Comparison of 34S and 33S between dissolved sulfate and host-rock sulfides.Error bars (if not shown, smaller than the symbols) are 1 uncertainty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dissolved sulfate in drilling water (open orange circle) is also plotted for comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The black solid line represents mixing between pyrite minerals with different sulfur isotope compositions15 and the blue solid line represents mixing between dissolved sulfate in the fracture waters, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the estimated 1.5 to 3.4 enrichment36 in 34S in the product sulfate during the indirect radiolytic oxidation of pyrite (IROP), the initial isotopic compositions of product sulfate are shown as the area in grey (for pyrite only), or the area defined by the dashed magenta lines (for all sulfides).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significantly, 34S values for dissolved sulfate in the fracture water are instead 6 more enriched in 34S than pyrite, suggesting that an additional process of isotopic enrichment, possibly microbial sulfate reduction (MSR), has affected the measured sulfate (see text).Full size image', 'The 34S values provide further information to evaluate potential mechanisms of sulfur mobilization from the sulfide minerals into the fracture water reservoir.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fracture water sulfate is 6 more enriched in 34S than the massive pyrite (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the possible geological oxidation mechanisms to transform sulfide to sulfate, near surface oxidative weathering of sulfide is common in the oxic atmosphere and hydrosphere after 2.4 Ga.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resulting sulfate could have potentially infiltrated into the deep fractures by episodic recharge of surface water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, oxidative weathering of sulfide involves negligible isotope fractionation34 and thus would result in similar 34S values between source sulfide and product sulfate, in contrast to the 6 offset observed here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, 18O and 2H values (lying well above GMWL; Fig 1), and previously published noble gas measurements3 for these same fracture waters, indicate there is no evidence for surface water recharge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is therefore more likely that the dissolved sulfate was produced by in situ oxidation reactions occurring within the fractures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the contact between the mineral surfaces and fracture water, such reactions could occur between sulfides (mainly pyrite; Supplementary Table 1) and dissolved oxidants (for example, HO· and/or H2O2) produced by radiolytic decomposition of water driven by energy released from radiogenic decay of U, Th and K in the host rocks10,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism is hereafter referred as indirect radiolytic oxidation of pyrite (IROP) as it refers to oxidation via radiolysis of water (as opposed to what might be termed the direct mechanism, involving, for instance, -rays hitting minerals directly).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although IROP has not been conclusively identified in field studies to date, the process has been shown to produce sulfate in anoxic laboratory experiments on pyrite minerals, and is associated with 34S enrichments of 1.5 to 3.4 from source pyrite to product sulfate36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these enrichments are generally consistent with the observed 34S enrichment in the dissolved sulfate in the fracture waters, the magnitude of 34S enrichments due to IROP alone are too small to account for the observed 6 increase in 34S values of the dissolved sulfate relative to the massive pyrite (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Further insight can be gained by mass balance modelling of the sulfate concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using geochemical and experimental data36, a rate of sulfate production from IROP in the Kidd Creek rocks can be estimated (see the Methods section) to a first approximation at 1.7 × 105 M per year to 4.9 × 104 M per year (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of the residence times for these waters3, the accumulated sulfate concentrations in the fracture waters from IROP would be 1.9 × 104 to 5.4 × 105 M (for 1.1 billion years) or 4.4 × 104 to 1.3 × 106 M (for the maximum residence time of 2.6 billion years estimated for these waters).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both estimates are orders of magnitude higher than the measured values of dissolved sulfate (97 to 376 M), again suggesting that removal processes need to be examined to account for both the elevated 34S values and lowered concentrations of dissolved sulfate observed in the fracture waters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The fracture waters contain up to millimolar concentrations of dissolved H2 and CH4, as well as lesser amounts of higher hydrocarbons37,38, all of which can act as electron donors for sulfate reduction reactionseither thermochemical (TSR) or microbial (MSR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with MSR, TSR is less likely in these systems for two reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, TSR commonly requires environmental temperatures higher than 100 °C to proceed39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thermal history of the Kidd Creek terrane since its last low-grade metamorphic hydrothermal event (with peak temperatures of 400 °C at 2.6 Ga; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23) is not well constrained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, studies estimate that the North American Precambrian craton has been stable with essentially no net denudation (estimated rates=0±2.5 m per million years) over at least the last two billion years40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Applying this mean estimate to the Kidd Creek area suggests that the Kidd Creek host rocks, in which the boreholes are located at 2.4 km below the surface, have been at their current depth over the past 2.0 Ga.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a modern thermal gradient of 11.4 °C km1 for the Superior Province41 and taking into account the exponetially decayed radiogenic heat along geological time42, the temperatures of these fracture waters are estimated to have been as low as 47 °C at 2.0 Ga and 36 °C at 1.1 Ga.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even with the maximum estimate of erosion rate of 2.5 m per million years, the Kidd Creek area would have been eroded by 5 km over the last 2 billion years, or 2.8 km over last 1.1 billion years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests the current sampling site could have had a maximum depth of 7.4 km (corresponding to 143 °C) at 2 Ga, or 5.2 km (corresponding to 77 °C) at 1.1 Ga.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These temperature estimates reveal that efficient TSR has been unlikely occurring in the studied fracture waters since at least 1.1 Ga, maybe even since 2.0 Ga.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, even if we assume TSR did occur, modelling results (see the Methods section) over temperatures from 50 °C to 100 °C based on open-system kinetic isotope effects (Supplementary Table 3), and on closed-system equilibrium isotope effects (Supplementary Table 4), indicate that the sulfate loss attributable to TSR is at most 170 M, orders of magnitude too small to reduce the predicted sulfate concentrations of 104106 M to the measured values of 97 to 376 M. We turn therefore to an evaluation of MSR to reconcile both the concentration and isotopic patterns identified above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Two models are explored to quantitatively estimate the possible effects of MSR on a variety of timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first end-member scenario assumes IROP has slowly built up sulfate concentrations to high levels ( greater than 1.9 × 104 M) over the long history of isolation, whereas MSR acted more recently to deplete sulfate to current measured levels, and thus is an episodic scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second end-member scenario explores sulfate production by IROP coupled with simultaneous consumption by MSR, maintaining near modern sulfate levels in a dynamic balance, and thus is a steady-state scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modelling (see the Methods section) based on the concentration decrease and 34S increase yields estimated instantaneous 34S/32S fractionation factors up to 1.9 for the episodic scenario, and from 1.5 to 5.5 for the steady-state scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such small magnitudes of sulfur isotope fractionation have not been observed in TSR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies have identified cases with small fractionation factors for MSR however.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Habicht et al.43 demonstrated fractionation factors with magnitudes of less than 10 in cultures grown under sulfate concentrations less than 200 M, and in natural systems with low sulfate levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies with H2 as the substrate, directly relevant to this study, are fewer in number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hoek et al.44 were able to produce large fractionation factors (up to almost 40) only under low H2 growth conditions and slow sulfate reduction rates (SRR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All other experiments conducted with excess H2 over a range of sulfate reduction rates, including relatively low SRR (15 fmoles per cell per hour) and growth temperatures  less_than 70 °C, showed fractionation factors between 1 and 6, with only a slight increase to a maximum of 10 at temperatures between 70 and 80 °C (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar conditions of excess H2 and even slower rates of sulfate reduction are consistent with the ecological scenarios described for the deep microbial ecosystems in saline fracture waters in the Mponeng mine, South Africa5,11, and are likely applicable as well to the Kidd Creek saline fracture waters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As noted, the thermal history of the Canadian Shield suggests that the temperatures likely remained at less than 50 °C over the past 2 Ga in the Kidd Creek crustal environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While experimental constraints on sulfur isotope fractionation factors associated with sulfate reduction under conditions of excess H2, sulfate limitation, and slow sulfate reduction rates are clearly needed, the experimental demonstration of small fractionation factors in the range of 1 to 6 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  44) lends support to the microbial sulfate reduction scenarios explored here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To estimate the catabolic energy available to maintain a sulfate-reducing microbial community at maintenance level in this steady-state scenario, we modelled (see the Methods section) the hydrogenotrophic sulfate reduction reactions in a manner analogous to that used in modern day high-H2 hydrothermal systems45 for the measured range in the Kidd Creek fracture waters (6 to 15 mmol l1 H2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The potential Gibbs free energy available to H2 utilizing sulfate reducers in the fracture waters ranges from 194 to 210 kJ mol1 of sulfate, based on the spectrum of borehole chemistries measured (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a steady-state system with an IROP production rate of sulfate between 1.7 × 1011 and 4.9 × 1010 M per year (Supplementary Table 2), this translates to an energy availability between 1.0 × 1013 and 3.3 × 1012 J l1 s1 for hydrogenotrophic sulfate-reducing microorganisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given a laboratory-determined maintenance energy of 1015 J s1 for a single anaerobic cell at 25 °C (assuming 1 C-mol biomass=24.6 g dry biomass and 1013 g dry cell mass)46,47, the fracture waters at Kidd Creek could support between approximately 100 and 3,000 cells per litre of fluid, a biomass density consistent with those found in the fracture fluids in South African gold mines5,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the in situ energy requirements in these low-energy settings are in fact two to three orders of magnitude lower than the maintenance energy estimated in laboratory chemostat-based studies48,49, or similar to basal power requirements estimated in field-based studies of sulfate reducers in anoxic marine sediments (1019 to 1020 J s1 per cell50), a proportionally larger sulfate-reducing microbial community could be supported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have demonstrated that the S-MIF-bearing dissolved sulfate in the saline fracture waters at Kidd Creek originates from sulfides in the Archaean host rocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most likely mechanism for sulfate production in these anoxic fracture water systems is the indirect oxidation of sulfide minerals by oxidants from radiolytic decomposition of water, which is induced by the decay of radioactive elements (for example, U, Th and K) in the host rocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because both sulfides and radioactive elements have been present since the Archaean, this sulfur-cycling pathway is expected to have occurred over billions of years, with a higher rate earlier in the geologic past due to higher abundance of radioactive elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cycling of sulfur provides the mechanism for a long-term source of a major electron acceptor (sulfate) for an important metabolism in the terrestrial deep biosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regeneration of electron acceptors in the presence of reactions that produce electron donors (H2, CH4) implies that such subsurface ecosystems could exist over long timescales even if isolated from the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the findings have implications for planetary habitability and the exploration for evidence of life on Mars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mafic and ultramafic lithology of portions of the Martian crust, together with the mineralogical evidence (for example, serpentinization) for long-term waterrock interactions by subsurface groundwaters early in Mars history51, supports the potential for production of electron donors and acceptors that could have sustained microbial life in the Martian subsurface, isolated and protected from the later cold, irradiated and inhospitable surface of Mars52.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
