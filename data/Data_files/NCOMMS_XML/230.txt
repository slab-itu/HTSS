Repositioning tolcapone as a potent inhibitor of transthyretin amyloidogenesis and associated cellular toxicity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Transthyretin (TTR) is a plasma homotetrameric protein implicated in fatal systemic amyloidoses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TTR tetramer dissociation precedes pathological TTR aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Native state stabilizers are promising drugs to treat TTR amyloidoses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we repurpose tolcapone, an FDA-approved molecule for Parkinsons disease, as a potent TTR aggregation inhibitor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tolcapone binds specifically to TTR in human plasma, stabilizes the native tetramer in vivo in mice and humans and inhibits TTR cytotoxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystal structures of tolcapone bound to wild-type TTR and to the V122I cardiomyopathy-associated variant show that it docks better into the TTR T4 pocket than tafamidis, so far the only drug on the market to treat TTR amyloidoses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that tolcapone, already in clinical trials for familial amyloid polyneuropathy, is a strong candidate for therapeutic intervention in these diseases, including those affecting the central nervous system, for which no small-molecule therapy exists.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The misassembly of soluble proteins into toxic aggregates, including amyloid fibrils, underlies a variety of human diseases1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transthyretin (TTR) is a homotetrameric protein produced mainly in the liver and in the brains choroid plexus, and circulates in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TTR aggregation is associated with senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA)3, familial amyloid cardiomyopathy (FAC)4 and familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP)5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SSA and FAC are caused by aggregation and deposition of wild-type and mutant TTR, respectively, preferentialy in the heart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FAP is characterized by mutant TTR deposition in peripheral and autonomic nerves and the heart, but also in other sites such as the lung, carpal tunnel and gut.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More than 100 different TTR variants have been reported6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For some rare TTR mutations aggregation develops in the central nervous system, resulting in amyloid deposits in the leptomeninges, in the brain parenchyma, and in the eyes7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Plasma TTR binds and transports holo retinol binding protein and thyroxine (T4), whereas in the cerebrospinal fluid it transports T4 only10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TTR is composed of four identical 127 amino-acid residue -sheet-rich subunits, termed A, B, C and D11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TTR tetramer is formed by association of the AB and CD dimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The weaker dimerdimer interface defines two, largely unoccupied ( less_than 1% T4 bound), funnel-shaped T4-binding sites12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tetramer dissociation is the rate-limiting step for TTR aggregation13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, autosomal dominant mutations often destabilize TTR tetramer, thus increasing amyloidogenesis15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For many years, liver or combined liver and heart transplantation were the only palliative treatments for the TTR amyloidoses17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, it has been shown that small molecules able to bind to the TTR T4-binding sites increase the energy barrier of tetramer dissociation, acting as kinetic stabilizers, thus stalling TTR aggregation18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A pharmacologic strategy, based on stabilization of the TTR native tetramer by the benzoxazole tafamidis has been approved in Europe and Japan for the treatment of early-stage FAP29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, tafamidis might not be potent enough to treat advanced TTR amyloidoses31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of an Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved candidate for the treatment of TTR amyloidoses reflects the difficulty of moving from the discovery of in vitro hits to the development of clinically effective and safe drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Drug repositioning offers a potentially valuable and productive approach to identify candidates for new pharmacologic applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The process involves the identification of existing compounds licensed for a different therapeutic indication32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those candidates have already established safety profiles, reducing the time and cost required to bring them to trial and into the clinic for their new indication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diflunisal, an FDA-approved nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, acts as a TTR kinetic stabilizer33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although its in vitro affinity for TTR T4-binding sites is significantly lower than that of tafamidis, a randomized clinical trial has shown that the diflunisal treatment of patients with FAP for 2 years reduced the rate of progression of neurological impairment35, demonstrating the validity of drug repurposing for TTR amyloidoses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we identify tolcapone as a potential inhibitor of TTR amyloidogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tolcapone is an orally active cathecol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor authorized in the United States and Europe as an adjunct to levodopa and carbidopa for the treatment of Parkinsons disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that tolcapone binds specifically to TTR, stabilizes both wild-type (WT-TTR) and mutant TTR variants, reduces their aggregation and prevents TTR-induced cardiotoxicity more effectively than tafamidis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  X-ray crystallography and calorimetric assays reveal the molecular determinants that account for the activity of tolcapone in both WT-TTR and the V122I cardiomyopathy-associated variant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The anti-aggregational properties of this repositioned drug make it an ideal candidate for the therapeutic treatment of the TTR amyloidoses.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Tolcapone inhibits TTR aggregation', 'The Symyx Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry database includes compounds under clinical development, phase II-III and molecules already approved for human use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 30 compounds were selected for further experimental characterization (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first tested the anti-TTR aggregational activity of these molecules in the 040 M range with the highly amyloidogenic Y78F-TTR variant at pH 4.2 (ref 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This acidic pH induces TTR aggregation increasing thus sample turbidity and light scattering15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementary Table 1 shows the obtained EC50 values for TTR aggregation inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most active compound exhibits an EC50 of 3.92±0.30 M and corresponds to the commercial drug tolcapone (Tasmar, CAS 134308-13-17; Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under the same conditions, tafamidis displays an EC50 of 5.36±0.57 M. We validated these results by testing the capacity of tolcapone to prevent aggregation of WT-TTR and the FAC-associated V122I-TTR variant37 at pH 4.4 (refs 38, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tolcapone was highly effective at inhibiting both WT-TTR and V122I-TTR aggregation with EC50 values of 1.50±0.12 and 4.72±0.45 M, respectively, as measured by light scattering (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under the same conditions, tafamidis displayed EC50 values of 4.78±0.47 and 8.35±0.80 M for WT-TTR and V122I-TTR, respectively (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At any TTR/drug ratio tested, tolcapone exhibited a stronger aggregation inhibitory activity than tafamidis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed tolcapones anti-aggregational activity using sedimentation assays (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The A25T-TTR variant is among the most destabilized and fastest dissociating TTR tetramers8; however, it only causes an amyloid pathology in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of its instability, the protein is mostly degraded in the liver and not secreted into the bloodstream.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high concentration of T4 in the choroid plexus acts as a kinetic stabilizer allowing A25T-TTR folding and secretion16, but once secreted the tetramers dissociate, resulting in amyloid deposition in the leptomeninges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As tolcapone is able to cross the bloodbrain barrier40, we tested whether it could reduce the aggregation of this variant in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A25T-TTR (3.6 M) was incubated in the presence or absence of tolcapone (020 M) at pH 5.0 and 37 °C for 22 h, where this variant exhibits maximum amyloidogenicity8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A25T-TTR requires only 1 h to become fully aggregated due to its high kinetic unstability8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four molar equivalents of tolcapone (15 M) sufficed to reduce between 40% (Fig 1d) and 50% (Supplementary Fig 1b) of A25T-TTR aggregation, resembling the anti-aggregational activity exerted by T4 at the same pH (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Tolcapone and tafamidis effects over WT, V122I-TTR and A25T-TTR aggregation and stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Chemical structures of the commercially available drugs tolcapone (Tasmar, CAS 134308-13-17) and tafamidis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anti-amyloidogenic effect of tolcapone and tafamidis on (b) WT-TTR and (c) V122I-TTR and (d) anti-amyloidogenic effect of tolcapone on A25T-TTR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TTR solutions were incubated with several concentrations of test molecules and aggregation was induced by acidification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Turbidity at 340 nm was used to monitor TTR aggregation and fibril formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the end of the assays, the percentage of TTR aggregation for each experimental condition was calculated with respect to the TTR turbidity values obtained in the absence of compounds (vehicle only).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) WT-TTR was incubated in the presence or absence of 10 molar equivalents of tolcapone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Urea was added to promote protein unfolding at the indicated final concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) WT-TTR was incubated with several concentrations of tolcapone (from 0.25 to 10 molar equivalents with respect to WT-TTR) and denaturation promoted by addition of urea at a final concentration of 6.5 M.

Tolcapone does not interfere with TTR Trp fluorescence (Supplementary Fig 2), therefore, Trp fluorescence was measured to calculate the percentage of folded protein at any given urea concentration15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tolcapone exerted a strong stabilizing effect, allowing more than 80% of TTR to remain in the native state upon incubation in 8 M urea (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'At high denaturant concentrations, the rate of TTR tetramer dissociation is linked irreversibly to monomer unfolding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT-TTR (1.8 M) was incubated in the absence and presence of tolcapone (0.2510 molar equivalents with respect to TTR) in 6.5 M urea at room temperature (RT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intrinsic fluorescence was recorded after 72 h. In the presence of 2 and 4 molar equivalents of tolcapone, only, 33.8 and 8% of WT-tetramer, respectively, were unfolded, indicating a dose-dependent kinetic stabilization of TTR tetramer (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Tolcapone binds with high affinity to TTR', 'The strong stabilizing and anti-aggregational activity of tolcapone suggest that it binds tightly to the TTR T4-binding sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of tolcapone and tafamidis to compete with T4 for TTR binding was assessed by a gel filtration assay42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Competition binding experiments using radiolabelled T4 and WT-TTR were performed in the presence of different concentrations of test compounds and the T4 fraction bound to TTR was separated from the unbound fraction by gel filtration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The EC50 values for tolcapone and tafamidis were 41.4 and 183.5 nM, respectively; thus tolcapone displaces radiolabelled T4 from TTR 4 times more efficiently than tafamidis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to confirm the binding of tolcapone to WT-TTR (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also evaluated tolcapone binding to the FAC-associated V122I-TTR variant (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data analysis was performed considering two models: Model 1: Two identical and independent binding sites; Model 2: Two identical and cooperative binding sites43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fit using model 2 was better for WT-TTR, whereas model 1 was better for V122I, according to parametric (F test) and non-parametric tests (Akaikes and Bayesian information criteria).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Interaction of TTR with tolcapone assessed by ITC.Top panels: Thermogram (thermal power versus time) after baseline correction;
