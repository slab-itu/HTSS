Observation of temperature-gradient-induced magnetization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Applying magnetic fields has been the method of choice to magnetize non-magnetic materials, but they are difficult to focus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magneto-electric effect and voltage-induced magnetization generate magnetization by applied electric fields, but only in special compounds or heterostructures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate that a simple metal such as gold can be magnetized by a temperature gradient or magnetic resonance when in contact with a magnetic insulator by observing an anomalous Hall-like effect, which directly proves the breakdown of time-reversal symmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such Hall measurements give experimental access to the spectral spin Hall conductance of the host metal, which is closely related to other spin caloritronics phenomena such as the spin Nernst effect and serves as a reference for theoretical calculation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Generation and detection of non-equilibrium magnetization in non-magnetic conductors lie at the heart of spintronics research1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In previous studies, it was shown that spin injection can be achieved by various techniques4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the detection of the spin injection induced magnetization is more challenging because of its small magnitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Especially, the non-equilibrium magnetization induced time-reversal symmetry breaking has been rigorously confirmed in very limited systems, which usually requires the observation of Faraday(Kerr)-type phenomena or Hall effect7,12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For some thermal spin injection methods such as the spin Seebeck effect8,15,16,17,18, the temperature-gradient-induced spin current can be detected by the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) while expected accompanying magnetization still lacks direct experimental evidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We start with considering a simple bilayer film comprising an insulator magnet such as Y3Fe5O12 (YIG) and a normal metal layer, such as Au (see Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Au is far from a ferromagnetic instability and the static proximity magnetization is negligibly small8,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perturbation, such as a temperature gradient, generates non-equilibrium magnetization dynamics in the magnet4,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In such a system, non-equilibrium spin phenomena can be classified in terms of the following three regimes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, when the spin diffusion length of the metal layer lD is much less than its thickness t, lD less_than  less_than t; the normal metal properties are affected only over a thin-skin layer next to the ferromagnet, that is, the trivial class.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, when lDt, the magnetization dynamics excited in the magnet injects spin angular momentum deep into the metal layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the decay of the spin accumulation is steep and its average is suppressed22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most studies that detect spin Seebeck and spin-pumping effects by the ISHE are in this regime, in which a heat current and microwave-induced magnetization dynamics are treated as a perturbation, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Concept of the non-equilibrium magnetization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) In a normal metal/insulator magnet film, a non-equilibrium magnetization  can be generated in the normal metal (for example, Au) via a dynamic spin exchange by external perturbations such as a temperature-gradient (T).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orientation of  is related to the direction of the applied T. (b) In the presence of a non-equilibrium magnetization, spin-up and spin-down electrons are unequally populated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a charge current (jc) is applied normal to , an anomalous Hall-type voltage is expected.Full size image', 'Finally, in the regime, lDt, the perturbation is able to magnetize the entire metal layer in a non-equilibrium manner as illustrated in Fig 1a (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23): non-equilibrium magnetization, which breaks time-reversal-symmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The created non-equilibrium magnetization  may induce a Hall electromotive force EH when a probe electric current, jc, is applied as illustrated in Fig 1b:', '', 'just as the equilibrium magnetization of ferromagnets induces the anomalous Hall effect (AHE)24,25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Observation of such a Hall effect has been considered difficult since non-equilibrium magnetization in metals is small and short-lived13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this article, we, nevertheless, report a non-equilibrium magnetization created by a temperature gradient observed with a lock-in Hall measurement at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we also show that the non-equilibrium magnetization generated by spin pumping can be measured by the same method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Hall measurement method we developed enables the observation of such tiny magnetization, which highlights its high sensitivity and potential application in spintronics studies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We formulate the nAHE in terms of the spectral spin Hall effect (SHE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The non-equilibrium magnetization in a normal metal is proportional to the spin accumulation: s=, while the total charge density and Fermi energy remain to leading order unmodified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  is parallel to the minority spin direction in the paramagnet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a longitudinal electric field (E) is applied, Hall currents are induced via the spinorbit interaction39,40: , where  is the spin Hall conductivity for up (down) spin electrons and  is the electron spin polarization vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For small s,  can be expanded as , in which SHE is the ground-state spin Hall conductivity and the derivative is taken at the Fermi energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total Hall current reads:', '', 'According to equation (2), the nAHE current in the linear response of s is proportional to the energy derivative of the spin Hall conductivity (SHE/), while the spin Hall and anomalous Hall effects scale with SHE and AHE, respectively41,42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'SHE/ can be decomposed as', '', 'where the spin Hall angle SHE=SHE/ and  is the longitudinal conductivity of a normal metal film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second-term proportional to SHE/ in equation (3) represents the Hall current generated by the difference between the spin Hall angles of the up- and down-spin electrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first term is estimated to account for only one per cent of the observed nAHE voltage (see Supplementary Fig 3, and Supplementary Notes 2 and 3), which suggests that the SHE/ term dominates the signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A significant energy dependence of SHE has recently been predicted and observed in some metals44,45,46,47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we show that Au is magnetized by applying a temperature gradient or a microwave on YIG/Au bilayers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work also highlights the electron transport property modified by spin injection and thus offers a versatile approach for the generation and detection of non-equilibrium magnetizations in normal metals.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
