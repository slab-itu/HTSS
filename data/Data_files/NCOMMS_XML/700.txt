An antireflection transparent conductor with ultralow optical loss ( less_than 2 %) and electrical resistance ( less_than 6sq1)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Transparent conductors are essential in many optoelectronic devices, such as displays, smart windows, light-emitting diodes and solar cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate a transparent conductor with optical loss of 1.6%, that is, even lower than that of single-layer graphene (2.3%), and transmission higher than 98% over the visible wavelength range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was possible by an optimized antireflection design consisting in applying Al-doped ZnO and TiO2 layers with precise thicknesses to a highly conductive Ag ultrathin film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proposed multilayer structure also possesses a low electrical resistance (5.75  sq1), a figure of merit four times larger than that of indium tin oxide, the most widely used transparent conductor today, and, contrary to it, is mechanically flexible and room temperature deposited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the application potentials, transparent shielding of radiofrequency and microwave interference signals with 30 dB attenuation up to 18 GHz was achieved.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A wide range of electronic and optoelectronic devices require transparent conductors (TCs) to function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include, for example, displays, light-emitting diodes and photovoltaic cells, where TCs are used to either apply or collect electrical signals without reducing optical transmission (T)1,2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An intensive effort has been devoted to search for TC materials that can replace indium tin oxide (ITO), a wide band gap semiconductor, which is used in most of, if not all, the devices today.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite possessing large T, low electrical sheet resistance (Rs), high chemical and environmental stability, ITO requires high temperature processing, has poor mechanical flexibility and high raw material cost6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the material alternatives, Al-doped ZnO (AZO), carbon nanotubes, metal nanowires, ultrathin metals, conducting polymers and, most recently, graphene have been extensively considered7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of these alternatives can overcome the mechanical fragility, high temperature processing and/or cost of ITO, but still suffer from one or more drawbacks such as poor adhesion, large surface roughness and high optical scattering, and not always achieve a competitive trade-off between T and Rs21,22,23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Ultrathin metal films (UTMFs) can present very low Rs but their T is low unless antireflection (AR) undercoat and overcoat layers are applied26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the AR concept in TC is widely known, it has never been investigated and exploited fully, especially in conjunction of high-quality UTMFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of scattering, which is the case of the work presented in this study, the optical loss (OL) that accounts for the reduction in T with respect to the bare substrate (without TC) comes from absorption (A) of the TC material itself and reflection (R) at the interfaces in the TC on substrate structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we study in-depth the AR properties of a TC structure on glass made of ultrathin Ag, TiO2 undercoat and AZO overcoat layers, and show that, through a proper optimised design, reflection can be strongly suppressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OL of the optimized TiO2/Ag/AZO structure (1.6%) is even lower than that of a single layer graphene (2.3%), whereas the figure of merit (FoM) is four times larger than that of ITO, thanks to the very high T ( greater than 98%) and low Rs ( less_than 6  sq1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proposed TC has the highest electro-optical performance (FoM) reported so far, is mechanically flexible, room temperature processed and its potential for real applications is demonstrated by showing that it can be used as an efficient transparent shield for radiofrequency and microwave electromagnetic interference (EMI) signals, with 30 dB attenuation up to 18 GHz.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Figure 1ce show the optical simulation results with clear dependence of T, R and A on TiO2 and AZO thicknesses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that the simulated parameters include the substrates contribution, that is, they refer to the entire multilayer TC on substrate structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that in the case of complete AR, the simulated R would not tend to zero but the value corresponding to the backside substrateair interface (3.5%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simulation results point out that maximum T and minimum R should be obtained for TiO2 and AZO thicknesses in the range of 2030 nm and 3050 nm, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions, the absorption takes almost entirely place in the silver layer (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar trends can be observed for Corning Eagle XG glass and PET polymer substrates, which have a refractive index different from fused silica (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2a,b show the experimental results of TAVE and RAVE, average values of T and R, respectively, over the visible wavelength range (400700 nm), for varying thicknesses of TiO2 and AZO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a strong agreement with the simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optimum structures were TiO2 (25 nm)/Ag (12 nm)/AZO (40 nm) and TiO2 (20 nm)/Ag (12 nm)/AZO (45 nm), named AR-TC1 and AR-TC2, respectively (we have indicated in parenthesis the layers thicknesses).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2c,d show the measured wavelength-dependent T and R spectra of AR-TC1 and AR-TC2, respectively, compared with bare fused SiO2 substrate, commercial ITO (135 nm thick) and single-layer graphene on fused silica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TAVE for the investigated AR-TC structures was as high as 91.6%, 5% larger than that of ITO (86.7%) and very close (only 1.6% lower) to that of the bare fused silica substrate (93.2%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth noting that Fig 2d includes measurements of two side R. To verify the AR quality of the proposed AR-TC, we have also measured single side R. The inset in Fig 3b illustrates the method of measuring it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The back R from the substrateair interface has been suppressed by adding an absorbing substrate (black glass), index matched to the sample through an appropriate oil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The residual R from the AR-TC, with an average value of 1% in the 400700 nm wavelength range, is low compared with both the uncoated substrate surface (3.5%) and ITO-coated surface (5%; Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strong AR effect increases the value of T and reduces the OL for AR-TC compared with bare substrate to less about 1.6%, that is, even lower than that of a single-layer graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a more complete assessment of the AR properties, we simulated (Fig 3a) and measured (Fig 3b) single side R for the AR-TC1 at different angles of incidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3c,d show the results for AR-TC2 and commercial ITO samples, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The superior AR behaviour of the proposed AR-TC structure is maintained up to large angles (50°).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that preliminary experiments performed on Corning Eagle XG and PET substrates with same layers as AR-TC1 on fused silica indicate that even for these materials OL is already very low and transmission of TC very high (see Supplementary Table 1), despite the fact that the structures were not optimized to match a different refractive index.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Optical performance of AR-TC electrode.Experimental average values of (a) transmission (TAVE) and (b) reflection (RAVE) over the visible

the AR-TC structures were around 5.75  sq1, less than half of the value of reference commercial ITO (14.01  sq1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was almost entirely provided by the Ag layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From an electrical point of view, the thicker the Ag layer the lower the Rs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From an optical point of view, without the AR undercoat and overcoat layers, the thicker the Ag layer the larger the R and A, that is, the OL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the use of AR layers help to contain the increase of R as the layer gets thicker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is thus an optimum trade-off for the Ag thickness, which was 12 nm in our case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The root mean square (RMS) surface roughness of the Ag film was measured to be 2.2 nm, much smaller than that when directly deposited on the

polymeric substrates and subjected it to continuous bending.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alongside, ITO-coated PET was also tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rs was measured, whereas the bending radius was varied from 10
