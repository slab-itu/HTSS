Detoxification of hostplants chemical defence rather than its anti-predator co-option drives -glucosidase-mediated lepidopteran counteradaptation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The evolutionary plantherbivore arms race sometimes gives rise to remarkably unique adaptation strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report one such strategy in the lepidopteran herbivore Manduca sexta against its hostplant Nicotiana attenuatas major phytotoxins, 17-hydroxygeranyllinalool diterpene glycoside, lyciumoside IV and its malonylated forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that alkalinity of larval regurgitant non-enzymatically demalonylates the malonylated forms to lyciumoside IV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lyciumoside IV is then detoxified in the midgut by -glucosidase 1-catalysed deglycosylation, which is unusual, as typically the deglycosylation of glycosylated phytochemicals by insects results in the opposite: toxin activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Suppression of deglucosylation by silencing larval -glucosidase 1 by plant-mediated RNAi causes moulting impairments and mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the native habitat of N. attenuata, -glucosidase 1 silencing also increases larval unpalatability to native predatory spiders, suggesting that the defensive co-option of lyciumoside IV may be ecologically advantageous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We infer that M. sexta detoxifies this allelochemical to avoid its deleterious effects, rather than co-opting it against predators.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Plants commonly use lipophilic compounds such as cardenolides, iridoids, flavonoids, phenylpropanoids and several cyanogenic compounds as their major defences against their insect herbivores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These compounds are often glycosylated by the plants to increase their stability and to avoid self-intoxication; usually, such compounds are stored in specialized compartments to protect them from endogenous glycosidases1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissue damage resulting from insect feeding exposes these inactive pretoxins to their activating glycosidases resulting in the formation of toxic aglycones3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Released aglycones cause cellular damage in herbivores and severely affect their physiology and fitness6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frequently, on ingestion, these glycosides are deglycosylated in the midgut by insect glycosidases3,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid such deglycosylation, some herbivores downregulate their glycosidases after ingesting glycosides9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several herbivores have even evolved their own glycosylation systems to reglycosylate the formed aglycones3,5,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glycosides are more water soluble, have higher intracellular mobility and so are excreted faster than their aglycones2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, they are easily transported to vacuolar compartments and the apoplast by membrane-bound transporter systems, which often recognize their glycosyl residues2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, deglycosylation or glycoside hydrolysis in insects is commonly thought to result in toxin activation and glycosylation is regarded as a form of detoxification11,12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, most of this research has been conducted on compounds harbouring single sugar moieties; deglycosylation of phytochemicals containing more than one sugar moiety remains uninvestigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Several Nicotiana (Solanaceae) species produce 17-hydroxygeranyllinalool diterpene glycosides (HGL-DTGs) containing multiple sugar moieties15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HGL-DTGs have been reported to be biocidal and HGL-DTGs of Nicotiana tabacum retarded growth of Heliothis virescens larvae in artificial diet (AD) experiments15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biosynthesis of several HGL-DTGs is induced in N. attenuata on attack by its specialist herbivore, Manduca sexta (Ms; Lepidoptera, Sphingidae).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The susceptibility of M. sexta larvae to HGL-DTGs was demonstrated using different Nicotiana species such as N. attenuata, N. bigelovii and N. clevelandii, which differ in their HGL-DTG contents and composition, and, more convincingly, with different transgenic isogenic lines of N. attenuata with varying levels of HGL-DTGs16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M. sexta larvae grew three times larger than controls when they were fed transgenic N. attenuata plants depleted in their HGL-DTG content by silencing geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPPS), the gene responsible for the synthesis of the HGL-DTG precursor, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, HGL-DTGs were found to be more effective as chemical defences against M. sexta than some of N. attenuatas other well-characterized defence compounds, such as nicotine and trypsin proteinase inhibitors19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'N.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  attenuata HGL-DTGs are composed of an acyclic C20 HGL backbone decorated with glucose moieties at OH-3 and OH-17; glucose moieties can further be extended with either glucose or rhamnose moieties at OH-2, OH-4 or OH-6 to produce a large diversity of structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frequently, malonyl groups are additionally attached to glucoses at OH-6, resulting in additional structures20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heiling et al.20 defined lyciumoside I as a precursor HGL-DTG, as it represents the first glycosylation of the HGL backbone at both the OH-3 and OH-17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HGL-DTGs having disaccharides attached to OH-3 and OH-17 are referred to as core HGL-DTGs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  N. attenuata produces three core HGL-DTG structures namely, attenoside, nicotianoside III and lyciumoside IV (Lyc4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Core HGL-DTGs with malonyl groups on their sugar moieties are defined as malonylated HGL-DTGs and are further classified as singly or dimalonylated, based on the number of attached malonyl groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lyc4 with its singly malonylated form, nicotianoside I (Nic1), and its dimalonylated form, nicotianoside II (Nic2), constitutes 80% of the N. attenuatas total HGL-DTG pool20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although HGL-DTGs severely affect larval growth, M. sexta larvae survive on the HGL-DTG-rich N. attenuata.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigated M. sextas counteradaptation strategy against HGL-DTGs, using Lyc4 and its malonylated forms as model HGL-DTGs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discovered unusual mechanisms evolved by M. sexta to demalonylate and then detoxify these allelochemicals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To reveal the significance of this atypical strategy, we applied a modern herbivore reverse genetics approach, plant-mediated RNA interference (PMRi)23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By silencing M. sextas Lyc4 ingestion-induced -glucosidase (BG), we revealed that it is responsible for Lyc4 deglycosylation in the midgut and such detoxification is vital for larval development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Last, we used the PMRi in the native habitat of N. attenuata, the Great Basin Desert, Utah, USA to elucidate the role of Lyc4 detoxification in M. sextas interaction with its predators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that Lyc4 is a predator deterrent so avoiding its detoxification could benefit larvae that are vulnerable to predators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discuss why M. sexta could have chosen the detoxification of Lyc4 in spite of it being ecologically disadvantageous.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Nicotianoside I and II are demalonylated by the alkaline pH', 'Lyc4, Nic1 and Nic2 (Fig 1a) constitute the major fraction of N. attenuatas constitutive as well as herbivory-induced HGL-DTGs pool (Fig 1b;

regurgitant was either boiled or treated with pronase to inactivate its enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complete demalonylation of Nic1 and Nic2 occurred in both treatments (Fig 1d), suggesting that the reaction was non-enzymatic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, to test whether demalonylation was pH dependent, we incubated the leaf with an alkaline buffer of pH-8.5 (because the regurgitant is alkaline26), an acidic buffer (pH-6) or acidified regurgitant (pH-6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Demalonylation occurred in the alkaline buffer but not in the acidic buffer and acidified regurgitant, confirming that ingested Nic1 and Nic2 were non-enzymatically demalonylated to Lyc4 by the alkalinity of larval regurgitant (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: N. attenuatas malonylated HGL-DTGs are demalonylated non-enzymatically in M. sextas alkaline regurgitant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Structures of core lyciumoside IV (Lyc4) and its singly and dimalonylated forms, nicotianoside I (Nic1) and nicotianoside II (Nic2), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Proportions of Lyc4 and its malonylated forms Nic1 and Nic2 and other HGL-DTGs in uninduced and M. sexta herbivory-induced N. attenuata leaves showing that Lyc4 and its derivatives are the major HGL-DTGs (based on data from Heiling et al.20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Profile of core and malonylated Lyc4 in N. attenuata leaf and in larval regurgitant, midgut content and frass showing that complete demalonylation occurs when the leaf comes into contact with larval regurgitant, at the time of ingestion by larvae (F3,8=19.81, P0.0001;

these were not counted as moulting-impaired larvae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it was demonstrated that BG1 silencing suppressed Lyc4 deglucosylation, whether moulting impairment was caused by BG1 silencing or by Lyc4 metabolism suppression remained unclear (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along with the BG1 dsRNA, irBG1 plants contained Lyc4 levels equal to those of EV plants so the effects of BG1 silencing and Lyc4 deglucosylation suppression could not be uncoupled in the larvae feeding on these plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we generated Lyc4-depleted and MsBG1 dsRNA-containing plants by crossing irBG1 with irGGPPS plants (irBG1 × irGGPPS;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Heiling et al.20 discovered the occurrence of malonylated HGL-DTGs in N. attenuata.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They proposed that malonylation facilitates accumulation and distribution of HGL-DTGs in plant and prevents their deglycosylation by plant glycosidases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, that the malonylation is instantaneously lost in the alkaline larval regurgitant indicates that malonylations sole role could be in planta, for example, to ensure the availability of toxic Lyc4s to the herbivore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, considering that the lepidopteran herbivore is highly mobile and is likely to devour all parts of the shoot, the concentration and the distribution of Lyc4 could be crucial for the optimization of the plants defensive strategy38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of malonylated Lyc4 also appears to be similar to that of phytoanticipins in which, glycosylation ensures the within plant stability of defence molecules by maintaining them in inactive or rather pretoxin states1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, that the core Lyc4 often occurs in certain tissues of N. attenuata in large quantities implies that its stability and toxicity may not be of concern for the plant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, the malonylated Lyc4 could be considered as a type of phytoanticipin, which is decorated for distribution, rather than stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From M. sextas perspective, demalonylation appears to be unavoidable due to the need to maintain an alkaline midgut.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As mentioned earlier, the large literature3,11,12 on herbivores xenobiotic detoxification reveals that glycosylation is an important detoxification mechanism; consequently, the current perception that deglycosylation is often a toxin activation mechanism is widely accepted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of such literature, we initially hypothesized that Lyc4 is completely deglycosylated by M. sexta to release the non-polar toxic 17-HGL, the diterpene backbone of Lyc4; however, this compound was not found in the body, gut contents or frass of larvae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we identified RGHGL from the frass of Lyc4-fed larvae, we hypothesized that RGHGL was the activated toxin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High incidences of moulting impairment and mortality in larvae feeding on irBG1 foliage and the reappearance of these phenotypes in larvae feeding on Lyc4-complemented B × G foliage (Fig 4c,d) falsified this hypothesis, from which we inferred that Lyc4 was the toxin and RGHGL was actually the detoxified product.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While detoxification by deglycosylation is uncommon in insects, it has been frequently observed in phytopathogenic fungi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis (Magnaporthaceae) detoxifies the avenicin saponins (triterpenoid glycosides containing three sugars) of oat by BG-catalysed deglucosylation39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, various fungi detoxify the tomato steroidal glycoalkaloid -tomatine (containing four sugars) by removing its C-3 oligosaccharide that renders it incapable of binding to 3-hydroxy sterols, which leads to the formation of membrane pores and cell lysis41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, in all these cases, fungi completely deglycosylate the toxic glycosides; thus, Lyc4s detoxification is an atypical example of detoxification by partial deglycosylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The activity of glycosides can be attributed not only to their aglycones but also to sugar moieties, especially when compounds contain multiple sugars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such activity mainly depends on the binding specificity of sugars to the target molecules and receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, aureolic acid group antibiotics bind to DNA and inhibit the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase; aureolic acid variants differing in their sugar moieties show varying degree of inhibitory activities43, but the aglycone is completely unable to bind to DNA44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, a nonsugar sweetener, glycyrrhizic acid (ammonium salt), tastes sweeter if its second glucuronic acid is replaced by glucose or xylose, owing to the differential binding capacity of sugars to the receptors in the taste buds45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is known that binding of glycosides specific sugars to receptors on the cell surfaces facilitates their active uptake46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conspicuously, higher amounts of Lyc4 than RGHGL in most of the larval tissues (in EV- as well as irBG1-fed larvae) may result from this sugar-specific uptake phenomenon, wherein the uptake of Lyc4 in various tissues is facilitated by the receptor-binding capacity of C-17 glucose, a structural feature absent in RGHGL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The fact that spider deterrence is caused by Lyc4 and not by RGHGL is consistent with our inference that Lyc4 is the toxin and RGHGL is its detoxified product.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That the spiders completely ingest EV- and irGGPPS-fed larvae suggests that M. sexta larvae have not evolved sequestration of Lyc4 for their own defence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spiders chemosensory-endowed hair on legs and palps can detect the Lyc4 coated on the larval surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But the spiders are neither deterred by the control and nor by the BG1-silenced larvae, which have ingested Lyc4, mainly because the larvae do not externalize Lyc4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the concentrations of Lyc4 in haemolymph and fat body, the tissues in which insects usually sequester the xenobiotics36,47, were much lower than those found in the midgut suggesting that Lyc4 is not sequestered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Avoiding self-intoxication could be the reason behind not co-opting Lyc4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it would be interesting to study the generalist herbivores of Nicotiana spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  to evaluate if HGL-DTG co-option has evolved in them; such comparisons between the nicotine metabolism of Manduca spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and generalist herbivores were highly useful in evaluating the costs and benefits of detoxification and co-option of nicotine37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observation that spiders that ingest BG1-silenced larvae show signs of locomotor distress suggests that Lyc4 affects spiders nervous system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Together, this work reveals that deglycosylation can bring about detoxification and suggests that much remains to be revealed about the detoxification of multiply glycosylated compounds by herbivores and roles of such compounds in tritrophic interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It suggests that multiply glycosylated as well as malonylated plant metabolites could be much more useful in pest control than previously thought; consequently, the newly discovered role of insect -glycosidases in detoxification suggests that these enzymes could be valuable targets for pest control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It demonstrates value of PMRi in molecular ecological research, but given the simplicity and robustness of this trophically mediated gene-silencing technique, it could also become a valuable means of controlling pests in agriculture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biochemical basis of partial deglycosylations of Lyc4 by BG1 or other -glycosidases and the mode of action of Lyc4 are interesting future perspectives of this work.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
