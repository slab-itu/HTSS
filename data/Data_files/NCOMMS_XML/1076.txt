Unification of de novo and acquired ibrutinib resistance in mantle cell lymphoma  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The novel Brutons tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib has demonstrated high response rates in B-cell lymphomas; however, a growing number of ibrutinib-treated patients relapse with resistance and fulminant progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using chemical proteomics and an organotypic cell-based drug screening assay, we determine the functional role of the tumour microenvironment (TME) in ibrutinib activity and acquired ibrutinib resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that MCL cells develop ibrutinib resistance through evolutionary processes driven by dynamic feedback between MCL cells and TME, leading to kinome adaptive reprogramming, bypassing the effect of ibrutinib and reciprocal activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR and integrin-1 signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combinatorial disruption of B-cell receptor signalling and PI3K-AKT-mTOR axis leads to release of MCL cells from TME, reversal of drug resistance and enhanced anti-MCL activity in MCL patient samples and patient-derived xenograft models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study unifies TME-mediated de novo and acquired drug resistance mechanisms and provides a novel combination therapeutic strategy against MCL and other B-cell malignancies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma that accounts for 68% of all B-cell lymphomas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prognosis remains poor in MCL patients due to the emergence of drug resistance and lymphoma progression1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MCL depends on the strong interactions between lymphoma cells and their tumour microenvironment (TME)2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Integrin 1-containing receptors (41 and 51) are highly expressed in MCL cells and are major mediators of cell adhesion to stroma, provide protection against drug-induced apoptosis, and confer environment-mediated drug resistance (EMDR)3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, the B-cell receptor (BCR) has emerged as a pivotal pathway in many B-cell lymphomas4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon activation of BCR, CD79 is phosphorylated, triggering a signalling cascade that involves activation of kinases, GTPases and transcription factors via a number of downstream pathways such as Brutons tyrosine kinase (BTK), PI3K-AKT, ERK and NF-B, promoting lymphomagenesis6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibitors of BCR signalling have emerged as promising therapeutic agents for various B-cell lymphomas7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ibrutinib is a novel BTK inhibitor that has shown an unprecedented overall response rate and progression-free survival in relapsed/refractory MCL patients and in patients with other B-cell disorders10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinically, ibrutinib rapidly induces lymphocytosis and lymph node shrinkage, a phenomenon common to BCR inhibitors, likely attributed to attenuation of BCR-dependent lymphomaTME interactions12,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, despite the dramatic responses to ibrutinib, resistance inevitably develops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 43% of MCL patients have shown partial or complete lack of response to ibrutinib and experienced disease progression within 12 months of treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alarmingly, once patients relapse after ibrutinib treatment, the 1-year survival rate is only 22% (refs 16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar outcomes have been reported in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia after ibrutinib discontinuation because of disease progression and drug resistance18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Drug resistance is generally considered to evolve by intrinsic or acquired genetic alterations and is heavily influenced by the extrinsic TME3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TME-mediated resistance is a form of de novo drug resistance that protects tumour cells from the effects of diverse therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acquired resistance to kinase inhibitors is common and complex, involving mutations, reprogramming and reactivation of key intracellular signal networks19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the manner in which the TME contributes to the development of acquired ibrutinib resistance (IR) is largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To capture the complexity of IR, we applied activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) to examine the kinome response profiles in MCL modulated by stroma and/or chronic ibrutinib treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We interrogated TME-mediated and acquired drug resistance to determine the mechanistic link between TME and acquired IR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining kinomics, longitudinal drug screening with ex vivo, in vivo TME, and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, we identified a major kinase network involving PI3K-AKT-mTOR/integrin 1-integrin-linked kinase (ILK) as a central hub for TMElymphoma interactions mediating IR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that combined disruption of BCR signalling and central pathways resulting from kinome reprogramming is critical for overcoming IR in MCL.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'BCR signal in TMElymphoma interactions and drug resistance', 'We investigated the role of BCR signalling in stroma-mediated MCL cell survival and drug resistance and used a co-culture model to evaluate the impact of stromal cells on phosphorylation status of the BCR downstream proteins CD79a, BTK, ERK and AKT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1a,b, co-culture of MCL cells with lymph node stromal cells (HK cells) or bone marrow stromal cells (HS-5) significantly increased pBTK, pERK and pAKT in MCL cell lines (HBL-2 and Jeko-1) and primary MCL cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with BCR activation, stroma-induced phosphorylation of CD79a was observed (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When CD79a was depleted by using shRNA, stroma-induced activation of BTK and AKT was abolished (Supplementary Fig 1a), supporting that BCR is required for stroma-induced activation of BTK, ERK and AKT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "Figure 1: B-cell receptor (BCR) signalling is a central outside-in and inside-out signalling hub for MCL cell survival and growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Co-culture with lymph node stromal cells (HK-Ad) and bone marrow stromal cells (HS-5) induced a time-dependent BCR signalling activation detected by western blot for BCR downstream molecules (BTK, AKT, ERK) phosphorylation in MCL cell lines (HBL-2, Jeko-1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Co-culture with lymph node stromal cells induced BCR signalling activation detected by western blot for BCR downstream molecules (BTK, AKT, ERK) phosphorylation in primary MCL samples (MCL15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Co-culture with lymph node stromal cells induced BCR (CD79a) phosphorylation detected by western blot and immunofluorescence staining in HBL-2 cells in co-culture with HK cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 10 M.

or means±s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  from at least three biological replicates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See also Supplementary Figs 1, 8 for full gel scan of the WB.Full size image", 'Next, we used selective BTK and PI3K inhibitors (ibrutinib and GS-1101, respectively) to explore the functional role of BCR signalling in MCL survival and stroma-mediated drug resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, both ibrutinib and GS-1101 abolished intrinsic and stroma-induced activation of BTK, AKT and ERK (Fig 1d, Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ibrutinib induced cell apoptosis, sensitized responses to the cytotoxic agents and suppressed MCL survival and clonogenic growth with and without stroma co-culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, BCR signalling pathway inhibition overcame stroma-mediated drug resistance (Fig 1e,f, Supplementary Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that TME/stroma trigger a sustained outside-in BTK, ERK and AKT activation via a stroma-induced BCR signal and with enhanced MCL survival/drug resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'BCR activation in the context of stroma may be secondary to a number of factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address how BCR is activated after co-culturing with stroma cells, we evaluated whether stroma-secreted proteins regulate BCR activation in MCL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LC-MS/MS-based label-free proteomics experiments were performed to quantify the secreted proteins (secretome) in HK cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detected many cytokines (IL3, IL8, IL10, CCL3, CCL4), growth factors (TGF-, VEGF, HDGF, IGF2, PDGF) and extracellular matrix proteins (fibronectin, collagen, MMP1/3, laminin) in the supernatant of stromal HK cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified 187 proteins in the HK cell culture supernatant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By gene enrichment analysis, the most enriched and shared proteins in the HK supernatant were extracellular matrix proteins and adhesion/chemokine molecules (Supplementary Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given that fibronectin binds to integrin 1 (1) at the cell surface and relays protective environmental signals to cells, we examined changes in BCR signalling after MCL cells were adhered to fibronectin-coated plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, MCL cell (Jeko-1, HBL-2) adhesion to fibronectin triggered a rapid induction of BCR signalling activation manifested by increased phosphorylation of CD79a, BTK, AKT and ERK (Supplementary Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because our previous work revealed that lymphoma stroma-derived B-cell activating factor (BAFF) confers stroma-mediated protection of MCL cells from therapy-induced apoptosis21, we examined whether BAFF also activates the BCR pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of BAFF to MCL cell lines and to primary B lymphocytes induced CD79a, BTK, ERK and AKT phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, neutralization of BAFF with soluble TACI attenuated stroma-induced BCR activation (Supplementary Fig 1g), indicating that BAFF-like fibronectin may contribute to stroma-induced BCR activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data indicate that BCR activation by stroma is multifactorial and are in line with previous studies demonstrating that BCR and its downstream proteins are activated by a variety of molecules, including BAFF, antigen receptors and integrins22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We also explored the contribution of BCR signalling to 1 expression and MCL adhesion by co-culturing with HK or HS-5 stroma cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-culture with HK or HS-5 cells and treatment with BAFF upregulated 1expression in MCL cells (Fig 1g, Supplementary Fig 1h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1h,i, targeting BCR signalling with ibrutinib or GS-1101 blocked stroma-induced 1 expression and attenuated MCL adhesion to stroma in both MCL cell lines and primary MCL cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that inhibition of AKT significantly decreased 1 expression and MCL cell adhesion to stroma, otherwise constitutively AKT activation through myristoylated AKT plasmid (myr-Akt) transfection increased expression of 1 and cell adhesion in these MCL cells (Supplementary Fig 1i,j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the PI3K-AKT signalling pathway is a central outside-in and inside-out signalling hub for stromalymphoma interactions and stroma-mediated drug resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Adaptive kinome reprogramming in acquired IR MCL', 'To investigate the IR mechanisms, we generated three independent IR MCL cell lines by growing Jeko-1, HBL-2 and SP49 cells in increasing concentrations of ibrutinib over 6 months (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, Sanger sequencing for the C481S and R665W mutations in BTK and PLCG2 was performed in these three pairs of MCL lines respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, no C481S and R665W mutations in BTK and PLCG2 reported in IR chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were detected in all lines19,20,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we determined the key signalling adaptations associated with the development of acquired IR by performing ABPP to identify global kinome in both parental and IR cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For ABPP, we used a desthiobiotin-ATP probe for selective labelling of active sites in ATP-binding proteins, which was followed by identification and quantification using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using three paired parental and IR MCL cell lines, this approach identified 7,382 peptides corresponding to 2,327 ATP binding proteins, including 547 peptides corresponded to 250 protein kinases (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By extrapolating kinase expression in gene profiling data from the published data (GSE34602, GSE52148, GSE52434, GSE68091) in MCL lines (Jeko-1, HBL-2 and SP49), we concluded that there are 424 kinases present in MCL cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the 250 kinases identified by our proteomic analysis accounted for approximately 59% of the expressed kinome of MCL cells (Supplementary Data 1).

#@NEW_LINE#@#  Results in f are representatives of three independent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative changes of proteins were measured by quantitative densitometry and indicated below each lane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See also Supplementary Figs 2, 8 for full gel scan of the WB.Full size image', 'Next, by comparing changes in relative kinase activities between IR and parental MCL cells at a system level, ABPP revealed that the kinome of IR cells was markedly changed, with many kinases displaying enhanced ATP probe binding in at least two cell lines, indicating increased activity relative to sensitive cells (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes included biologically significant protein kinases such as CDKs, ILK, DNA damage response proteins and JAK-STAT kinases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By plotting the frequency distribution of the kinase changes and dividing the data into four quantiles, we selected fold changes of 1.35 for HBL-2, 1.92 for Jeko-1 and 2.28 for SP49 cells as cut-off values, as these values defined the top quantile changes within each cell line, and a significant overlap among these top quantile kinases was observed (Supplementary Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further mapping of the overlapped kinases by using KEGG pathway analysis identified PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways as a central signalling hub in IR MCL cells (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We next compared kinome alterations in sensitive and IR cells following ibrutinib treatment and determined the kinases/pathways that were inhibited with ibrutinib treatment in sensitive cells but remained unaltered or elevated in IR cells despite ibrutinib treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As illustrated in Fig 2d, parental cells were responsive to ibrutinib, showing reduction of BTK binding in all three cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified a kinome signature with significant changes in ATP binding after 6-h ibrutinib treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The changes in protein kinase activity by ibrutinib treatment could be attributed to both direct and indirect ibrutinib targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, IR cells displayed a more blunted response to ibrutinib than parental cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of the kinases demonstrated unchanged or even increased activity in response to ibrutinib, supporting the concept that BTK-independent kinases or BTK bypass pathways drive IR (Fig 2e and Supplementary Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analyses identified 40 kinases that remained unchanged or even elevated after ibrutinib treatment, including multiple PI3K-AKT-mTOR-related kinases (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway was most frequently found in this setting (Fig 2c), we further assessed activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR and its downstream targets in parental and IR MCL cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these, we found significantly increased AKT, 4EBP and S6K1 phosphorylation levels in IR cell lines compared with their parental cells (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ibrutinib effectively decreased AKT and BTK phosphorylation in parental MCL cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, high AKT phosphorylation in IR MCL cell lines was sustained in the presence of ibrutinib treatment, suggesting a mechanism of bypassing the effect of ibrutinib to promote activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway activation in IR MCL cells', 'We detected increased 1 expression in IR MCL cells compared with parental lines (Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, flow cytometry showed that 1 expression was further enhanced upon co-culture with stroma (Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After ibrutinib exposure, 1 expression levels were reduced in parental/naïve, although levels remained unchanged after ibrutinib treatment in IR MCL cells (Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adhesion assays and clonogenic growth experiments with and without ibrutinib treatment showed that IR MCL cells had a marked increase in adhesion to stromal cells and enhanced clonogenic growth in the presence of ibrutinib (Fig 3c,d and Supplementary Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, stable 1 knockdown dramatically attenuated cell adhesion to stromal cells,

no 1-ILK complex formations were detected in 1 knockdown stable Jeko-1-IR and HBL2-IR cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also probed for co-precipitated ILK with rictor, an upstream activator of AKT activation, and identified ILK-rictor complexes in Jeko-1-IR and HBL-2-IR cells (Fig 3h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that 1 regulates mTORC2-AKT pathway activation via ILK-rictor complex formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also examined 1-ILK-rictor complex formation after ibrutinib treatment and observed persistent -ILK-rictor complexes in IR cells but not in their parental cells (Fig 3i).

network of (1) de novo (TME-mediated), (2) acquired drug resistance and (3) IR selected while adherent to TME stroma (combined IR) (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our ABPP analysis detected 220 kinases,

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Acquired drug resistance has traditionally been studied by chronically exposing cancer cell lines in vitro to increasing doses of drug.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These drug-resistant models have been instrumental in identifying mechanisms that modulate drug response and, in some cases, have aided in the identification of drug targets31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these models have failed to account for the TME in the emergence of the drug-resistant phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we combined lymphoma TME models, using functional and chemical proteomics approaches, to define the key protein kinase reprogramming and a central signalling hub for TME-induced- and acquired IR in MCL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'PI3K-AKT pathway activation has been identified as an important drug resistance mechanism in many tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our study uniquely characterized the development of acquired IR in the context of TME and unified TME-mediated and acquired IR, providing a mechanistic link between TME and acquired IR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data indicated that their interplay and cooperative function are critical for promoting tumour growth, IR and MCL progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we identified integrin 1-ILK signalling as the underlying mechanism of not only PI3K-AKT activation in MCL IR but also TME in facilitating acquired IR resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, our functional and chemical proteomic results were independently validated by cell-based drug screen experiments in the setting of TME, implicating this drug screen assay as an innovative platform to help with design of effective individualized combination therapies to overcome IR and disable aggressive lymphomas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A simplified model showing the enforced interaction of the MCL-TME and development of IR is illustrated in Fig 7g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown here, the TMElymphoma interaction allows MCL cells to survive initial drug exposure and eventually acquire a complex array of acquired drug resistance mechanisms through kinome reprogramming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We compared functional resistance mechanisms and corresponding kinase activation profiles associated with de novo TME-mediated and acquired resistance mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When MCL cell lines selected in the absence of stroma for acquired IR were compared with parental MCL cell lines after adhesion (co-culture) to the stroma (de novo, EMDR), we found that acquired IR mechanism was more complex than that of EMDR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complex changes in IR MCL cell kinome could contribute to the observed phenotypic alterations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The kinomic changes account for increased proliferation and drug resistance in acquired resistant MCL cells, whereas activation of adhesion/integrin 1 signalling pathways contributed to enhanced TMEMCL cell interaction and amplified EMDR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite differences in the models for acquired and de novo drug resistance, we observed a significant overlap in kinase changes, supporting that EMDR is essential for initial survival, priming MCL cells for the acquisition of stable drug resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with this, our in vivo xenograft model revealed that TME stroma cells promote MCL growth and that IR MCL cells confer an advantage in stroma interaction, drug resistance and clonogenic growth ability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The adaptive kinome reprogramming and potential targets were further evidenced by an independent ex vivo drug screening that quantified drug sensitivity in a reconstructed TME.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, when selecting IR to chronic ibrutinib exposure in MCL cells adherent to stroma and developing IR MCL lines in the setting of TME (IR-TME), we observed that the kinome profile of cells from combined selection are more closely related to the cells with acquired resistance than cells selected by de novo resistance in co-culture with stroma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparable changes in 1-ILK expression, PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway activation, enhanced cell adhesion and growth in MCL cells were detected with both conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results highlight that development of IR represents a multiple stepwise process requiring a complex interplay between TME signals, gene and protein adaptation, and selection pressures, with ILK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR being potential target for overcoming IR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Initially, cellcell or cellTME interactions attract MCL cells to the stromal niche, conferring MCL BCR signal for MCL survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When therapeutic stress was applied, a series of cell responses occurred in both MCL cells and stromal cells, creating a positive feedback loop that amplified the pro-survival and anti-apoptotic signals, with eventual TME-independent acquired resistance dominating the late stage, although TME still physically or biochemically influenced the drug resistance phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our data support that the drug-resistant population presents a kinase activity pattern different from the one seen in the original naïve tumour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because de novo and/or acquired drug resistance mechanisms may drive clonal evolution before, during and after therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results are consistent with the complex nature of resistance mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resistance is often ascribed to either resistant mutations such as BTK and PLC2 reported in IR MCL and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or adaptive mechanisms, including amplification of alternative signalling pathways and altered cell states19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the complex heterogeneous nature of MCL and its TME, resistance to anti-cancer therapies probably stems from pre-existing clonal heterogeneity and clonal evolution, resulting from a combination of mutations or alteration of genetic and epigenetic determinants as part of adaptive responses to therapy and interplay with TME32,33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data further highlight that tumour cell heterogeneity and clonal evolution in response to the selective pressure of a toxic agent usually prevents long-term efficacy of any monotherapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Advances in proteomics techniques have now allowed the simultaneous quantification of several thousand proteins, which can be used to derive signalling networks from large-scale data sets35,36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In our study, we used ABPP and defined a kinase signalling network in parental and IR MCL cells and the adaptive rewiring in response to ibrutinib in de novo TME and acquired drug resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remodelling of kinase networks in IR cells produced patterns of signalling activity linked to their evolved phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the myriad of therapeutic resistance mechanisms, including point mutations in known targets, network-wide approaches are crucial to improving our understanding of altered survival and drug resistance as a consequence of reprogramming and ultimately determining the success or failure of therapeutic agents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, when considering the use of targeted therapies in cancer, it is necessary to understand and integrate the multiple tumour cell adaptation mechanisms to a given therapy to better design a combination of therapies with optimal anti-tumour effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identification of common signalling nodes or drivers for resistant clonal evolution in multiple altered signalling pathways that confer resistance is warranted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest a more complex network to stable genetically conferred resistance to cancer drugs than the specific drug resistance mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such mutations could arise spontaneously at low frequency before drug treatment and are selected during treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our observations implicate a multistep stepwise process mediated by TME and tumour interaction is not incompatible with pre-existing resistance-conferring mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the dynamics and complexity of tumour evolution and often lack of correlation between mutations with therapy response, our cell-based drug screen in the setting of TME can provide a promising tool for effective individualized therapy against MCL and other B-cell lymphomas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The continued application of this approach in combination with genomes, functional transcriptome and proteomes to primary and recurrent tumours will identify novel mechanisms driving tumour progression and therapeutic resistance, facilitating the identification of optimal combinatorial therapeutic strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inhibition of these pathways and resistance networks could be a more efficient way to overcome drug resistance and improve current therapies for patients with MCL and other B-cell malignancies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
