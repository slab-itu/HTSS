Label-free cell cycle analysis for high-throughput imaging flow cytometry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Imaging flow cytometry combines the high-throughput capabilities of conventional flow cytometry with single-cell imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate label-free prediction of DNA content and quantification of the mitotic cell cycle phases by applying supervised machine learning to morphological features extracted from brightfield and the typically ignored darkfield images of cells from an imaging flow cytometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method facilitates non-destructive monitoring of cells avoiding potentially confounding effects of fluorescent stains while maximizing available fluorescence channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method is effective in cell cycle analysis for mammalian cells, both fixed and live, and accurately assesses the impact of a cell cycle mitotic phase blocking agent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the same method is effective in predicting the DNA content of fission yeast, it is likely to have a broad application to other cell types.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A major challenge in many modern biological laboratories is obtaining information-rich measurements of cells in high-throughput and at single-cell resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conventional flow cytometry is a widespread and powerful technique for the measurement of cell phenotype and function using targeted fluorescent stains1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is highly suited to the study of cell populations and rare subset identification due to its high-throughput, multi-parameter nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluorescent stains can be used to label cellular components or processes, revealing specific cell phenotypes in the population and quantifying the particular state of each cell2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, quantifying the proportion of cells in each phase of the cell cycle, including mitotic phases is very useful in the modern biological laboratory3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be achieved with conventional flow cytometry using multiple stains: typically, a stoichiometric fluorescent stain for DNA reports the cells position within the G1, S and G2 phases of the cell cycle2, and additional stains are needed to sort mitotic cells into phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Often these stains are incompatible with live cell analysis (for example, antibodies against histone modifications3) and even if live cell reporters are available4 these may have confounding effects on the cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the commonly used Hoechst 33342 stain, which binds to the minor groove of the double-stranded DNA can induce single-strand DNA breaks5, or DRAQ5 (deep red fluorescing bisalkylaminoanthraquinone) the nuclear stain that intercalates with the cells DNA can influence chromation organization and lead to histone dissociation6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, several different markers are usually required to unambiguously identify all cell cycle phases7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, an assay that reduces or even eliminates the number of stains required to identify phenotypes such as the position in the cell cycle is particularly attractive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In recent years, the two technologies of fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry have been integrated to create imaging flow cytometry8, where an image is captured of each cell as it flows past an excitation source and a CCD detector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It combines conventional flow cytometrys high-throughput speed and easy identification of each individual cell with the fluorescence microscopys spatial image acquisition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, imaging flow cytometry measures not only fluorescence intensities but also the spatial image of the fluorescence together with brightfield and darkfield images of each cell in a population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rich information captured using imaging flow cytometry makes it an ideal candidate for the use of high content approaches to identify complex cell phenotypes such as the cell cycle phase of an individual cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously demonstrated that measuring the shape of the nucleus from cells stained with a nuclear marker using imaging flow cytometry drastically improves the classification of mitotic phases9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the even richer morphological information that can be extracted using imaging software tools10 offers the prospect of using more advanced multivariate analysis techniques to mine the data and to identify various cell phenotypes, as has been successfully done for traditional microscopy images11,12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This type of analysis is also usually more accurate and less subjective than any manual analysis of the acquired images13 as well as more robust than typical gating strategies that rely on only few features of the cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report that quantitative image analysis of two largely overlooked channels; brightfield and darkfield, both readily collected by imaging flow cytometers that enables cell cycle-related assays without needing any fluorescence biomarkers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use image analysis software9 to extract numerical measurements of cell morphology from the brightfield and darkfield images, and then we apply supervised machine-learning algorithms to identify cellular phenotypes of interest, in the present case, cell cycle phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The designed workflow is open-source and freely available (visit www.cellprofiler.org/imagingflowcytometry) and accompanied by step-by-step tutorials and example data sets online.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Avoiding fluorescent stains provides several benefits: it reduces effort and cost, avoids potentially confounding side effects of live cell markers and frees up the remaining available fluorescence channels of the imaging flow cytometer that can be used to investigate other biological questions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Label-free analysis workflow', 'The first step in the workflow of label-free cell cycle classification (Fig 1) is to acquire brightfield and darkfield images from the cells (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To allow visual inspection and to optimize the file size for processing, we tile individual cells brightfield and the darkfield images into 15 × 15 montages, with up to 225 cells per montage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, we load the montages into the open-source imaging software CellProfiler9 for processing (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is sufficient contrast between the cells and the flow media to robustly segment the cells in the brightfield images without the need for any stains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We extract 213 features from the segmented brightfield and the full darkfield image (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The features can be summarized into five categories: size and shape, granularity, intensity, radial distribution and texture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These image features are the input for supervised machine learning, namely classification and regression (see Methods section), which we use to predict each cells DNA content and the mitotic phases in the cell cycle without the need for any stains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The machine-learning algorithms have to be trained on an annotated subset of the investigated cells where the true cell state, that is, the ground truth is known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ground truth can be obtained either by manual identification (by a trained biologist or using software tools11) or from labelling a subset of the investigated cells with fluorescent stains (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Label-free imaging flow cytometry workflow.First the brightfield and darkfield images of the cells are measured by an imaging flow cytometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The brightfield and darkfield images depict the light transmitted through the cell and light scattered from the cells within a cone centered at a 90° angle, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then the images are preprocessed, where we reshape the images to have their sizes coincide and tile them to montages of 15 × 15 images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The montages are loaded into the open-source image software CellProfiler that we use to segment the cells brightfield images and to extract morphological features from the images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we apply supervised machine learning such as classification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose we need an annotated set of cells where the actual cell state is known to train the classifier and to test its predictive power.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once the classifier is trained it is used to predict the state of unlabelled cells and to digitally sort the cells into bins.Full size image', 'Cell cycle analysis of fixed Jurkat cells', 'As an initial demonstration of our technique, we sought a label-free way to measure important cell cycle phenotypes including a continuous property (a cells DNA content, from which G1, S and G2 phases can be estimated) and discrete phenotypes (the mitotic phase of a cell: prophase, anaphase, metaphase and telophase).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the ImageStream platform to capture images of 32,255 asynchronously growing Jurkat cells (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As controls, the cells were fixed and stained with PI (propidium iodide) to quantify DNA content and a MPM2 (mitotic protein monoclonal #2) antibody to identify mitotic cells (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These fluorescent markers were used to annotate a subset of the cells with the ground truth (expected results) needed to train the machine-learning algorithms and to evaluate the predictive accuracy of our label-free approach (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since it is infeasible to accurately identify individual cells in the G1, S and G2 phase based only on one nuclear marker5, we do not aim to predict those phases individually but to predict each cells DNA content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, we use the Watson pragmatic curve fitting algorithm15 (see Methods section) to estimate the percentage of cells in each of the G1/S/G2M phases based on the predicted DNA content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using only cell features measured from brightfield and darkfield images, we were able to devise a regression ensemble (using least squares boosting16) that accurately predicts each cells DNA content, obtaining a Pearsons correlation of r=0.896±0.007 (error bars indicate the s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  obtained via 10-fold (n=10) cross-validation here and in all following statements of the Results section unless stated differently; see Methods section and Supplementary Note 1) between predicted and actual nuclear stain intensity (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This highly accurate prediction of the DNA content can be used to further categorize G1, S and G2/M cells or to allocate each cell a time position within the cell cycle via the ergodic rate analysis, where cells are sorted according to their DNA content17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we were able to classify mitotic phases (using random undersampling18 to compensate for the high class imbalance) with true positive rates of 55.4±7.0% (for prophase), 50.2±17.2% (for metaphase), 100% (for anaphase and telophase) and 93.1±0.5% for the non-mitotic phases (Fig 2bg and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analysed which features have the most significant contributions for the prediction of both the nuclear stain and the mitotic phases by leave one out cross-validation (Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that leaving one feature out has only a minor effect on the results of the supervised machine-learning algorithms we used, likely because many features are highly correlated to others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most important features are intensity, area, shape and radial distribution of the brightfield images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Machine learning allows for robust label-free prediction of DNA content and cell cycle phases of Jurkat cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) We find a Pearsons correlation of r=0.896±0.007 (error bars indicate the s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  obtained via 10-fold cross-validation) between actual DNA content and predicted DNA content based on regression using brightfield and darkfield morphological features only (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

b shows cells in G1/S/G2), the bar plots show the classification results based on brightfield and darkfield morphological features only (for example, b shows that the few cells in prophase (Pro), metaphase (Meta), anaphase (Ana), and telophase (Telo) are errors).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (g) Bar plot of the true positive rates of the cell cycle classification.Full size image', 'Detection of mitotic phase block', 'The assessment of the therapeutic blocking of the cell cycle (in a particular phase) is of particular importance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested the methods ability to predict the DNA content of Jurkat cells treated with 50 M Nocodazole, a mitotic blocking agent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm the magnitude of the block of cells in mitosis, we performed three additional replicates demonstrating an average increase of cells in the G2/M phase of 19.0±11.0% (error bars indicate the s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  obtained from n=3 replicates for each condition) compared with the control (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The label-free prediction of the DNA content has a Pearsons correlation of r=0.894±0.032 with the true DNA content (PI is used as a fixed cell nuclear stain to provide the ground truth for the machine-learning algorithms) and the percentage of cells in the G1, S and G2/M phases are in excellent agreement (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the technique is successfully detecting the expected increase in the G2/M cells due to the blocking agent based on the predicted DNA content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, we were able to classify mitotic phases and found true positive rates of 65.5±6.3% (for prophase), 100% (for the other mitotic phases) and 85.8±1.4% for the non-mitotic phases (Fig 3be and Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of the cells with the mitotic blocking agent led to an increase in the percentage of prophase cells from 1.88 to 11.07, which is confirmed by comparison with the ground truth (Supplementary Table 2 and Table 4) and in agreement with the identified magnitude of the block of cells in mitosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Label-free prediction of DNA content and cell cycle phases for fixed Jurkat cells

ability of the technique to detect cell cycle changes in live Jurkat cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To provide ground truth (that is, the expected cell cycle distribution), the cells were stained with DRAQ5, a live-cell DNA stain (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like most live-cell-compatible DNA stains, DRAQ5 is not an ideal marker because of the variability of uptake of the dye in live cells19, nonetheless, we obtain a Pearsons correlation of r=0.786±0.010 for predicting the DNA content of untreated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a regression ensemble trained on the stained live cells, we are also able to predict the effect of treatment with a phase-blocking agent on an entirely unstained data set (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detect an increase of cells in the G2/M phase from 20.9 to 34.3% when the cells are treated with 50 M Nocodazole; this is consistent with the average increase of 19.0±11.0% obtained from repeating the phase block experiments with stained cells (Supplementary Fig 3).

Pearson correlation of r=0.786±0.010 (error bars indicate the s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  obtained via 10-fold cross-validation) between actual DNA content and predicted DNA content using regression (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe this reduction in correlation from the value of 0.896 obtained for fixed cells to be a consequence of the greater variability of the uptake of the live DNA dye compared with the staining achieved with fixed cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the reduction in correlation a value of 0.786 is still high enough to make this a viable method for the cell cycle analysis of live cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As previously, we determine the fraction of cells in the G1, S and G2/M phases using the Watson pragmatic curve fitting algorithm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) We predict an increase of 13.4% in the G2/M phase after the cells were treated with 50M Nocodazole, which is in good agreement with the average increase of 19.0±11.0% in G2/M as was found for three independent cell populations under the same treatment (Supplementary Figure 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phase-blocked data set was not labelled with any marker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we trained our machine learning algorithm on the untreated data set, which was labelled with a DRAQ5 DNA stain (see a) and used the trained machine learning algorithm to predict the DNA stain of the blocked

manually gating on image based metrics from the PI channel of the Imagestream data20, which provided the ground truth (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The label-free regression predicts a DNA

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We demonstrate here that it is possible to determine a cell populations DNA content and mitotic phases based entirely on features extracted from cells brightfield and darkfield images, as obtained in high-throughput via imaging flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method requires an annotated data set to train the machine-learning algorithms, either by staining a subset of the investigated cells with markers, or by visual inspection and assignment of cell classes of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once the machine-learning algorithm is trained for a particular cell type and phenotype, the consistency of imaging flow cytometry allows high-throughput scoring of unlabelled cells for discrete and well-defined phenotypes (for example, mitotic cell cycle phases) and continuous properties (for example, DNA content).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The same basic strategy can be readily adapted to measure other phenotypes, making this a generally useful approach for label-free, single-cell phenotyping in the modern biological laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method can also be used retrospectively on data sets that do not have the necessary stains for phenotype identification, providing an annotated data set is available to train the algorithms (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While current imaging flow cytometers do not have physical cell-sorting capabilities, and for now our approach is suited to experimental contexts where samples are analysed only, this approach may offer the possibility to entirely avoid any fluorescent stain and opens up the perspective for a new generation of image flow cytometers that could operate without fluorescence channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The workflow we designed is open-source and freely available (www.cellprofiler.org/imagingflowcytometry and Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Label-free identification of phenotypes enables continuous, non-destructive monitoring of cell samples, minimizes potentially confounding influences of the stains on the cells and maximizes available fluorescence channels to investigate biological questions such as the search for novel hallmarks in cell cycle21, the identification of stem and progenitor cells22 or the proliferation of cancer cells23.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
