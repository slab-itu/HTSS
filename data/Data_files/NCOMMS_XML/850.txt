A cocktail of three virulent bacteriophages prevents Vibrio cholerae infection in animal models  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Effective prevention strategies will be essential in reducing disease burden due to bacterial infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we harness the specificity and rapid-acting properties of bacteriophages as a potential prophylaxis therapy for cholera, a severely dehydrating disease caused by Vibrio cholerae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we test a cocktail of three virulent phages in two animal models of cholera pathogenesis (infant mouse and rabbit models).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oral administration of the phages up to 24 h before V. cholerae challenge reduces colonization of the intestinal tract and prevents cholera-like diarrhea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the surviving V. cholerae colonies are resistant to all three phages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome sequencing and variant analysis of the surviving colonies indicate that resistance to the phages is largely conferred by mutations in genes required for the production of the phage receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For acute infections, such as cholera, phage prophylaxis could provide a strategy to limit the impact of bacterial disease on human health.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cholera is an acute, severely dehydrating diarrheal disease caused by the water-borne bacterium Vibrio cholerae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cholera remains a substantial global health burden and is endemic to many parts of Africa and Asia1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent widespread epidemics in disaster-stricken or war-torn countries such as Haiti2 and Iraq3 highlight the vulnerabilities of populations to sudden outbreaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current recommended preventatives include mass vaccinations with the World Health Organization-prequalified oral cholera vaccine4 and increased awareness of sanitation and hygiene practices5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, access to clean water is difficult and vaccination campaigns require forethought and time for efficacy; both methods may not be logistically feasible for immediate protection in the event of an outbreak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Household transmission is a major contributor to the rapid spread of V. cholerae within communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Household contacts of index cases often present with cholera symptoms 23 days after the initial patient becomes sick6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, there is currently an unmet need for a clinical intervention to stem the household spread of cholera by use of a rapid prophylactic treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although chemoprophylaxis with antibiotics may effectively reduce cholera burden7, the World Health Organization does not recommend this practice due to the development and spread of drug-resistant bacteria ( http://www.who.int/cholera/technical/prevention/control/en/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the broad-spectrum action of antibiotics would cause dysbiosis of the resident intestinal microbiota, which could put patients at risk of other intestinal infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'There has recently been a renewed interest in the use of bacteriophages (phages) for environmental and clinical applications8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to antibiotics, phages are specific in their targets and, because they are replicating viruses, are capable of auto-dosing, a phenomenon where phage replication increases their number and contributes to the dose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous attempts to use phages to prevent or treat cholera have produced mixed results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dutta et al.9 showed that a single phage type given 1 h before V. cholerae challenge in an infant rabbit model prevented onset of cholera symptoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies by Jaiswal et al.10 showed that a cocktail of five lytic bacteriophage types given 6 or 12 h before V. cholerae challenge in an adult rabbit model reduced diarrheal severity slightly but did not significantly lower the bacterial load; however, the same phage cocktail could successfully reduce the V. cholerae load when administered 6 or 12 h after challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second study in adult mice also showed promise for treatment of cholera with a phage cocktail11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies suggest that a prophylaxis approach merits further, in-depth investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We previously isolated three V. cholerae-specific, lytic (virulent) phages ICP1, ICP2 and ICP3 from rice-water stool samples of cholera patients in Bangladesh12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The receptors for ICP1 and ICP2 were identified as the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O1 antigen13 and the major outer membrane porin OmpU14, respectively, which are considered virulence factors of V. cholerae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The receptor for ICP3 is as yet unknown, although we hypothesize at least a partial role for the LPS O-antigen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have recently shown that these virulent phages impose significant bactericidal pressure on V. cholerae during its natural course of infection in humans14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A cocktail comprising phages that target different receptors would reduce the likelihood of multi-phage-resistant V. cholerae isolates in the surviving population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we hypothesized that a cocktail of the three ICP phages may be used as a prophylaxis treatment to specifically target V. cholerae that transits into the small intestine to prevent signs of cholera in animal models of disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we show that orally applied, prophylactic use of the ICP cocktail reduces colonization by V. cholerae in the infant mouse model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ICP cocktail also prevents the onset of cholera symptoms in the infant rabbit model when administered up to 24 h before V. cholerae challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This proof-of-principle study demonstrates the successful use of phage prophylaxis to prevent disease caused by a mucosal pathogen.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The three-phage ICP cocktail kills V. cholerae in vitro', 'Initial in vitro killing time-course experiments provided support for the hypothesis that the three-phage ICP cocktail was more effective in killing V. cholerae than each phage in isolation (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cultures of V. cholerae E7946 (AC53) were grown in (i) the absence of phage or in the presence of (ii) ICP1, (iii) ICP2, (iv) ICP3 or (v) the ICP cocktail, at a multiplicity of infection of 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacteria (Fig 1a) and phage (Fig 1b) titres were enumerated every hour for 8 h and then again at 12 and 24 h. Although the bacterial population declined in all conditions initially, growth resumed for cultures grown in the presence of ICP1 or ICP3 within 46 h, respectively (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells incubated in the presence of ICP2 resumed growth more slowly, but reached the same density as the control within 24 h. In contrast, cells grown with the ICP cocktail did not reach the same density as the no-phage control by the end of the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phage titres dropped but remained stable for all conditions over the course of the experiment (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not surprising that V. cholerae was able to escape phage predation over time, given that the starting inoculum was high (5 × 107 colony-forming units (CFU)) and probably contained phage-resistant mutants that were positively selected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: The ICP cocktail kills V. cholerae in vitro.Growth curves of V. cholerae E7946 (AC53) in the absence and presence of phage predation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cultures were grown in the absence of phage (black) or with ICP1 (blue), ICP2 (pink), ICP3 (green) or the ICP phage cocktail (orange) at an multiplicity of infection of 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples of each culture were taken periodically and (a) enumerated for CFU per ml or (b) the phage fraction isolated and enumerated for PFU per ml by plaque assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are plotted as the average of five independent replicates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars represent the s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dotted line represents the limit of detection.Full size image', 'The ICP cocktail reduces mouse small intestinal colonization', 'The ICP cocktail was more effective than each phage alone in killing V. cholerae in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether this was also true in vivo, prophylaxis experiments were performed in the infant mouse model of V. cholerae colonization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that the ICP cocktail would be effective in preventing V. cholerae infection of the infant mouse small intestine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were divided into five groups and received either (i) no phage, (ii) ICP1, (iii) ICP2, (iv) ICP3 or (v) the ICP cocktail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were given phages (between 1 × 106 and 1 × 107 plaque-forming units (PFU)) by orogastric inoculation 3 h before infection with 5 × 105 CFU V. cholerae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 24 h, mice were killed, and V. cholerae and phages in the small intestine enumerated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2a, the number of surviving V. cholerae cells in the small intestine was reduced by at least two orders of magnitude in all conditions where phage was administered, in comparison with the non-treated control, with ICP3 being the most successful single phage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No V. cholerae were detected in the intestinal homogenates of four out of five mice treated with the ICP cocktail (P less_than 0.01, KruskalWallis test with the Dunns post-hoc multiple comparisons test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data show that in comparison with ICP1 or ICP2 alone, ICP3 alone or the ICP cocktail is superior at preventing V. cholerae colonization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phages were still detected in the small intestine at the end of the experiment (Fig 2b), suggesting that these phages can survive and persist in the intestinal tract.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the bacterial count medians of the ICP3 alone and the ICP cocktail groups are similar, we chose to proceed with the ICP cocktail to reduce the probability that phage-resistant V. cholerae isolates would survive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Efficacy of the ICP cocktail and the ICP phages in reducing V. cholerae colonization of the infant mouse small intestine.Mice were dosed with between 1 × 106 and 1 × 107 PFU of the indicated phages 3 h before infection with 5 × 105 CFU V. cholerae E7946 (AC53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A control group did not receive phage (n=4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each phage-treated group of animals, n=5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) V. cholerae that survived in the small intestine were enumerated as CFU per small intestine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Phages that survived in the small intestine were enumerated as PFU per small intestine by plaque assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dotted line represents the limit of detection and the horizontal solid bar represents the median.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each square or circle represents one animal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significance was calculated using the KruskalWallis test with the Dunns post-hoc multiple comparisons test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  **P=0.0010.01.Full size image', 'Next, we aimed to test whether the ICP cocktail could still be effective when administered up to 24 h before V. cholerae infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, it was necessary to establish if phages could survive in the small intestine for long periods in the absence of their host bacterium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do this, mice were dosed with phages (between 3 × 107 and 3 × 108 PFU) by oral gavage and killed after 3, 6, 12 or 24 h.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Here we show that prophylactic administration of a V. cholerae-specific phage cocktail is protective against cholera, by reducing both colonization and cholera-like diarrhoea in two animal models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have shown that the ICP cocktail can successfully kill V. cholerae in vitro, prevent colonization of the infant mouse and preclude the onset of cholera-like diarrhoea in the infant rabbit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  V. cholerae were isolated from intestinal homogenates of some phage-treated animals; however, the surviving population is smaller than observed from a wild-type V. cholerae infection (Figs 2, 3, 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we hypothesize that these surviving isolates may be unable to elicit acute infection, as many of the mutations that confer resistance to the ICP phages affect genes such as those involved in LPS synthesis (VC0240 to VC0269), which have been previously shown to be important for virulence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crucially, at the end of these experiments, the population also remains sensitive to at least one of the three ICP phages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that the effectiveness of the ICP cocktail in killing V. cholerae cells is at least in part reliant on the concentration of phages that are in the intestine at the time of V. cholerae infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complex architecture of the intestinal tract probably presents a challenge to the phages ability to access V. cholerae cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The details of the interplay between the ICP phages, V. cholerae and the host remain to be elucidated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Future optimization of the composition and dose of the cocktail could further improve its effectiveness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio of each phage in the cocktail could be optimized and additional phages could be added to improve V. cholerae killing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, as complete reduction of the bacterial load was only observed at shorter prophylaxis times, optimization of the timing for each dose is needed before human use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that an individual will be repeatedly exposed to V. cholerae; therefore multiple doses may be necessary to control the infection to a point where it can be completely eradicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Current phage therapy research is largely focused on treating ongoing infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results highlight the potential of phage therapy in preventing infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data presented herein suggest that the premise of using a phage cocktail to prevent cholera warrants further investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We anticipate that a rapid-acting phage prophylaxis approach would be best used in at-risk individuals, such as the household contacts of individuals who display cholera symptoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By limiting spread within households, the overall burden of the disease could be reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The application of phages as prophylactic treatments for mucosal pathogens represents a fast and specific means by which to restrict the impact of bacterial infections on human health.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

4 °C for 13 days, to allow for phage precipitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phages were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 15 min at 4 °C and the phage pellet re-suspended in STE buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phages were titred by plaque assay, as previously described10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In vitro phage-killing assay', 'Overnight cultures originating from single colonies of V. cholerae

the indicated time-points, samples were collected to measure (i) CFU per ml and (ii) PFU per ml.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Infection of infant mice with V. cholerae', 'All animal experiments were in accordance with the rules of the Department of Laboratory Animal Medicine at Tufts University and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four- and 5-day-old CD-1 infant mice (Charles River Laboratories) were infected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each group of mice was comprised of animals from at least two different litters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both male and female animals were used in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no observable correlation between sex of the animal and outcome of each experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numbers of mice used in each condition in each experiment are listed in the legends of Figs 2 and 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mice were not tested for the presence of resident V. cholerae phages as the animals were not previously exposed to V. cholerae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, we do not predict that they will harbour any V. cholerae-specific phages in their microbiome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Infant mice in phage-treated groups were orogastrically dosed with phage diluted in 2.5% sodium bicarbonate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infant mice in cholera-treated groups received ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  105 CFU (normal infectious dose) or ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  108 CFU (high infectious dose) of V. cholerae diluted in 2.5% sodium bicarbonate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As phages were given at least 3 h before bacteria, any multiplicity of infection calculated would be inaccurate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the titres of bacteria and phage inoculated into animals were calculated from the input materials and the ranges specified in the figure legends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were killed 24 h post infection, the longest infection time permitted in our protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small intestines were dissected and homogenized in LB broth supplemented with 20% glycerol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were serially diluted and plated on LB agar supplemented with 100 g ml1 Sm and CFU per small intestine was calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To extract phage from small intestine homogenates, an aliquot of the intestinal homogenate was treated with chloroform and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatant was collected and used in plaque assays, to allow for calculation of PFU per small intestine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the resistance profile of V. cholerae cells that survive phage prophylaxis, up to ten colonies were randomly picked per animal for use in EOP assays with ICP1, ICP2 and ICP3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Infection of infant rabbits with V. cholerae', 'Three-day-old New Zealand White infant rabbits (Charles River Laboratories) were used in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each group of rabbits comprises animals from at least two different litters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both male and female animals were used in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no observable correlation between sex of the animal and outcome of each experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infant rabbits in phage-treated groups were orogastrically dosed with phage diluted in 2.5% sodium bicarbonate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three hours before infection with V. cholerae, infant rabbits were pre-treated with ranitidine hydrochloride to reduce stomach acidity (Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories) by intraperitoneal injection (2 g per gram body weight).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infant rabbits were infected with 5 × 108 CFU V. cholerae AC53 diluted in 2.5% sodium bicarbonate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As for the mice experiments, exact titres of bacteria and phage inoculated were calculated from the input material and a range is detailed in the figure legends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals were weighed at the start of the experiment and periodically throughout the course of the infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Percentage body weight was calculated by dividing body weight at the end of the infection period by body weight at the start.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals were killed 1220 h post infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infant rabbits that suffer from cholera typically lose 1015% of their body weight within 1214 h and are killed at this time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infant rabbits that lost  less_than 10% of their body weight are killed 20 h post infection, in accordance with our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This time restriction is necessary, as infants cannot be placed back with their mother after V. cholerae infection due to culling behaviour and so are without food for the infection period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'After dissection, the intestines of each rabbit were homogenized in LB broth supplemented with 20% glycerol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Caecal fluid, if present, was collected with a 1 ml syringe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Caecal fluid and intestinal homogenates were serially diluted and plated on LB agar containing 100 g ml1 Sm for calculation of CFU per intestine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phages were collected from homogenates as described for infection of infant mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surviving V. cholerae colonies were colony-purified and assessed by EOP assays for resistance to ICP phages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'EOP assays', 'EOP assays were performed for isolates that survived phage predation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each phage was titered on the isolate, on AC53 and also a phage-resistant strain as a negative control (wbeL AC4653 for ICP1 and ICP3; ompU AC2846 for ICP2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The EOP was calculated by dividing the titre of the phage on the animal isolate by the titre of the phage on AC53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The limit of detection was 1 × 10-6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isolates were described as resistant when the EOP was less_than 1 × 106,
