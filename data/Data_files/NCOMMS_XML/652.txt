Autophagy controls centrosome number by degrading Cep63  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Centrosome number is associated with the chromosome segregation and genomic stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ubiquitinproteasome system is considered to be the main regulator of centrosome number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, here we show that autophagy also regulates the number of centrosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Autophagy-deficient cells carry extra centrosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The autophagic regulation of centrosome number is dependent on a centrosomal protein of 63 (Cep63) given that cells lacking autophagy contain multiple Cep63 dots that are engulfed and digested by autophagy in wild-type cells, and that the upregulation of Cep63 increases centrosome number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cep63 is recruited to autophagosomes via interaction with p62, a molecule crucial for selective autophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo, hematopoietic cells from autophagy-deficient and p62/ mice also contained multiple centrosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that autophagy controls centrosome number by degrading Cep63.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The centrosome is an organelle that plays a major role in microtubule network organization during mitosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During prophase, centrosomes migrate to opposite poles of the cell to form the microtubule spindle apparatus on which chromosomes segregate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Centrosome number abnormalities are associated with chromosome mis-segregation and genomic instability to some extent1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Usually, G1 cells have one mature centrosome containing a pair of centrioles embedded in a protein-dense amorphous pericentriolar matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Centriole replication occurs during the S phase, and each centriole generates one daughter centriole at the G2M phase4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many protein components of the centriole, such as centrosomal protein 63 (Cep63), centrosomal protein 152 (Cep152), polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4) and spindle assembly abnormal protein 6 homologue (SAS6), have been identified as factors involved in centriole duplication5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among them, Cep63 and Cep152 initially form a ring-like structure at the proximal end of the mother centriole and recruit Plk4 (refs 6, 7, 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SAS6 and SCL/TAL1 interrupting locus (STIL) are then stabilized to form a cartwheel structure that generates the daughter centriole9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of centrioles is tightly regulated by the amounts of these centrosomal proteins mainly through the ubiquitin (Ub)proteasome protein degradation system10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is a catabolic process in which cellular contents, including proteins, lipids and even entire organelles, are digested within lysosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Autophagy occurs constitutively at low levels, but is accelerated by a variety of cellular stressors, such as nutrient starvation, accumulation of abnormal proteins and organelle damage12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Autophagy was originally considered to be a bulk and non-selective catabolic process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, increasing lines of evidence indicate the existence of a cargo-specific type of autophagy (termed selective autophagy) that degrades specific targets13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selective autophagy operates to eliminate specific targets, such as proteins and organelles, by their delivery to autolysosomes, and functions to regulate various cellular events14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The molecular machinery of autophagy has been well studied using autophagy-defective mutant yeasts and mice15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of the unc-51-like kinase 1 (Ulk1) complex is crucial for the initiation of autophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, vesicle nucleation occurs via activation of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K) complex, which comprises PtdIns3K, Beclin 1, Vps15 and Atg14L (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subsequent elongation and closure of isolation membranes are mediated by two Ub-like conjugation pathways, namely, the Atg5Atg12 pathway and the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) pathway15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atg7 is required for the conjugation of Atg12 to Atg5 as an E1-like enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conjugation of phosphatidylethanolamine to LC3 is mediated by the actions of Atg3 and the Atg512 complex, as E2- and E3-like enzymes, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This event is coupled with the translocation of LC3 from the cytosol to the isolation membrane, and hence this translocation makes this complex a reliable marker of autophagy15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the final step, ultraviolet radiation resistance-associated gene (UVRAG) and the PtdIns3K complex, excluding Atg14L facilitate autophagosomelysosome fusion16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Various lines of evidence indicate that among these molecules, members of the Atg5Atg12 conjugation system are essential for autophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In selective autophagy, p62 acts as cargo receptors for the autophagic degradation of substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recently, we discovered the existence of an Atg5/Atg7-independent type of autophagy (named alternative autophagy17), we hence extensively analysed the morphology of Atg5-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) by electron microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During these analyses, we incidentally found that these MEFs contain multiple centrosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of multiple centrosomes in Atg5/ MEFs led us to hypothesize that centrosome number is regulated not only by the Ubproteasome system, but also by autophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we investigated whether centrosome number is regulated by autophagy, which molecules are involved in this process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, we found that autophagy plays a crucial role for maintaining proper centrosome number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that cells lacking autophagy contain multiple Cep63 dots and that should be the cause of the increase in centrosome number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In wild-type MEFs, multiple Cep63 dots are engulfed and digested by autophagy in a p62-dependent manner, and hence p62/ MEFs also carry extra centrosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo, hematopoietic cells from autophagy-deficient and p62/ mice also contained multiple centrosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present study demonstrated that autophagy controls centrosome number by degrading Cep63.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Involvement of autophagy in centrosome number regulation', 'To determine whether autophagy is involved in centrosome number regulation, we first immunostained centrosomes with an anti--tubulin antibody, a classical molecular marker of centrosomes, and counted the centrosomes in Atg5/ and control (wild-type) MEFs (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that cells in the G1 and G2 phases contain one and two centrosomes, respectively18, cells with three or more centrosomes (-tubulin-positive dots) were considered as being defective in centrosome number regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of wild-type MEFs contained one or two centrosomes; in contrast, 18% of the Atg5/ MEFs contained three or more centrosomes (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained in three other Atg5/ MEFs from different Atg5/ embryos and Atg7/ MEFs (Fig 1c) and when centrosomes were counted using stably expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP)centrin-2, which is a core component of centrioles19 (Fig 1d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further confirm centrosome number dysregulation in the Atg5/ MEFs, we focused on cells in the G1 phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  G1 cells can be visualized by the expression of Fucci-orange plasmids20, by which the nuclei of G1 cells are specifically labelled in orange (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The population of cells with multiple centrosomes in the G1 phase was markedly larger in the Atg5/ MEFs than in the wild-type MEFs (Fig 1f,g), confirming centrosome number dysregulation in the absence of autophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the observation of multiple centrosomes, the number of cells with multipolar chromosome segregation was distinctly higher in the Atg5/ MEFs than in the wild-type MEFs (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The possibility that the increase in centrosome number arose in the Atg5/ MEFs via a different cell cycle progression was rejected because the cell cycle had progressed equally in the wild-type and Atg5/ MEFs (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All these data were obtained from SV40-transformed MEFs, and consistent results were obtained when primary MEFs (Supplementary Fig 3) and primary hematopoietic cells (described later) were analysed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Suppression of autophagy increases centrosome number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Centrosomes were immunostained with anti--tubulin antibody in wild-type (WT) and Atg5/ MEFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arrows indicate cells with three or more centrosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) The percentage of cells with the number of centrosomes was obtained from the images of -tubulin staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Open and closed columns indicate WT and Atg5/ MEFs, respectively (n=400 cells each).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) The percentage of cells with three or more centrosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indicated MEFs isolated from different embryos were immunostained with anti--tubulin antibody and centrosomes per cell were counted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) The WT and Atg5/ MEFs were transfected with GFPcentrin-2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arrows indicate cells with three or more centrosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) The percentage of WT and Atg5/ MEFs with three or more centrosomes was obtained from GFPcentrin-2-expressing cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) The WT and Atg5/ MEFs were transfected with Fucci-orange and immunostained with anti--tubulin antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The arrow indicates G1 cell with multiple centrosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (g) The percentage of cells with multiple centrosomes in the G1 phase was obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (h) The WT MEFs were transfected with siUlk1 and siBeclin-1 and were immunostained with anti--tubulin antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arrows indicate cells with three or more centrosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (i) The percentage of cells with three or more centrosomes is shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (j) The WT MEFs were treated with 10 mM of 3-MA or 10 nM of bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) for 24 h and were immunostained with anti--tubulin antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentage of cells with three or more centrosomes is shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (k) The WT and Atg5/ MEFs were treated without (no treatment; NT) or with 10 mM of 3-MA for 24 h.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have shown that autophagy participates in centrosome number regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ubproteasome system is one of the mechanisms contributing to the absence of the production of extra centrosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SKP1/Cullin/F-box (SCF)Slimb Ub ligase reportedly regulates centrosome overduplication via the regulation of Plk4 expression levels10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BRCA1-dependent ubiquitination of -tubulin also regulates centrosome number30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We here show that in addition to the Ubproteasome system, selective autophagy is another protein degradation system that participates in centrosome number regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both selective autophagy and the Ubproteasome system may digest different specific molecules for maintaining proper centrosome numbers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ciliogenesis is also regulated by these two protein degradation systems31,32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'How does autophagy control centrosome number?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first hypothesized that mature centrosomes are digested by autophagy when excess centrosomes are present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, mature centrosomes did not interact with p62 (Fig 4) and were not engulfed in autolysosomes (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We accordingly concluded that mature centrosomes are not the target substrate of autophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we found that several Cep63 dots were generated in autophagy-deficient cells and that these dots were directly associated with p62 and were engulfed into autolysosomes in autophagy-driving cells, indicating the role of Cep63 in the autophagic regulation of centrosome number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that Cep63 functions at the proximal end of the mother centriole21,22 and that many Cep63 dots were observed close to mature centrosomes in the Atg5/ MEFs upon nocodazole treatment (Supplementary Fig 12), many Cep63 dots are expected to be generated near the mother centriole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In autophagy-performing cells, almost all these Cep63 dots are rapidly degraded by autophagy to regulate centrosome number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in autophagy-deficient cells, many Cep63 dots remain and interact with p62, but not Cep152; these are the extra Cep63 dots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a few Cep63 dots are thought to interact with Cep152, instead of p62, to eventually become a mature centrosome, which results in the generation of extra centrosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recently, Zhao et al.34 reported that Cep63 interacts with UVRAG, and hence UVRAG is capable of regulating centrosome number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The disruption of this interaction causes an increase in centrosome number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although UVRAG functions to regulate autophagy maturation (autophagosomelysosome fusion)16, UVRAG-dependent centrosomal regulation was not mediated by autophagy, because UVRAG-dependent centrosome regulation can be observed even in Atg5-deficient cells34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the increase in centrosome number in Atg5/ MEFs was also observed in their data, although they did not point this out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, Cep63 appears to be regulated by an independent dual system, involving an autophagy-dependent and UVRAG-dependent mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, our findings have shown a novel role for autophagy in centrosome number regulation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
