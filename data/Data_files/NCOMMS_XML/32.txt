Polarization-resolved spectroscopy imaging of grain boundaries and optical excitations in crystalline organic thin films  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Exploration of optical properties of organic crystalline semiconductors thin films is challenging due to submicron grain sizes and the presence of numerous structural defects, disorder and grain boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report on the results of combined linear dichroism (LD)/ polarization-resolved photoluminescence (PL) scanning microscopy experiments that simultaneously probe the excitonic radiative recombination and the molecular ordering in solution-processed metal-free phthalocyanine crystalline thin films with macroscopic grain sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LD/PL images reveal the relative orientation of the singlet exciton transition dipoles at the grain boundaries and the presence of a localized electronic state that acts like a barrier for exciton diffusion across the grain boundary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show how this energy barrier can be entirely eliminated through the optimization of deposition parameters that results in films with large grain sizes and small-angle boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies open an avenue for exploring the influence of long-range order on exciton diffusion and carrier transport.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Research on organic semiconductors has advanced tremendously for the past two decades as these materials have great potential for the development of novel electronic and photonic devices1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among them, small molecules with finite, well-defined -conjugated systems, such as pentacene, rubrene, perylene or phthalocyanine, exhibit very large charge carrier mobilities3,4,5, and represent a cost-effective flexible electronics alternative for certain traditional silicon-based semiconductor applications such as field-effect transistors and photovoltaic devices5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While it is clear that the electronic properties of such films are highly tunable by chemical methods that simply modify their molecular building blocks or by physical methods through different fabrication techniques (chemical vapour deposition, spin coating, zone casting and molecular beam epitaxy)5,6, there is a critical need for a deeper fundamental understanding of the influence of long-range ordering on collective phenomena such as exciton diffusion and recombination, or carrier transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  X-ray, electron microscopy and other structural characterization techniques that provide feedback on the molecular packing and crystalline symmetry cannot selectively probe correlations between itinerant electrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Optical spectroscopy techniques, such as photoluminescence (PL), differential absorption and circular or linear dichroism (LD), are powerful investigation methods for collective excitations in solids9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in organic films they are severely limited by the large degree of disorder present on the length scale of optical microscopy techniques (1 m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In many cases, the large concentration of defects effectively quenches the luminescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For small-molecule polycrystalline films, it is very difficult to study correlations between long-range order and excitons because the typical grain sizes are only in the tens to hundreds of nanometres range and the recorded optical response contains contributions from many randomly oriented grains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Novel solution-based deposition methods6,11 that produce polycrystalline films with macroscopic millimetre-sized grains offer the opportunity for the first time to employ the wealth of powerful optical spectroscopy techniques to gain insight into the fundamental links between the electronic states, long-range order and the role of grain boundaries in crystalline thin films of organic semiconductors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this paper, we report on a spectrally resolved PL/LD polarization microscopy study of excitonic states in individual crystalline grains of metal-free phthalocyanine (H2Pc) films fabricated with a novel hollow capillary pen-writing deposition technique11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An in-house built laser scanning polarization-resolved microscopy setup records 90 × 90-m-LD images, and probes the symmetry of optically allowed electronic states with a spatial resolution of 5 m. These images reveal how the relative orientation of exciton dipoles at the grain boundaries can be controlled in a marked manner through fine tuning of the deposition parameters (that is, pen-writing speed and solution concentration).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same microscopy setup simultaneously records the polarization-resolved PL from single crystalline grains or individual grain boundaries, which can be correlated with the orientation of optically allowed dipoles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PL spectra of grain boundaries show the existence of a monomer-like emission exclusively localized at the boundary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this dual PL/LD microscopy setup, we conducted a systematic survey of grain boundaries and established a dependence of the localized luminescence intensity on the relative orientation of exciton dipoles at the boundary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations indicate the grain boundaries are not molecularly abrupt but rather disordered regions of finite width.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also established that this localized state can be eliminated in films with large long grains where the relative angle between crystalline axes in adjacent grains is  less_than 5°.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Soluble phthalocyanine: a ubiquitous molecule revisited', 'Figure 1 displays standard polarized optical microscope images of four thin films of 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-Octakis(octyloxy)-29H,31-phthalocyanine (H2Pc-OC8), a commercially available peripherally substituted phthalocyanine (Pc) soluble in common organic solvents, our molecule of choice for the present study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The films were deposited at different writing speeds from chloroform or toluene solutions of various concentrations using a pen-writing, hollow capillary technique11,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In essence, this technique involves translating a 500-m-wide glass capillary loaded with solution at a constant speed across a substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optimal results are obtained when crystallization takes place at the contact line between the meniscus and the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all instances, we used crystalline c plane sapphire as substrate; however, similar results were obtained for other dielectric transparent substrates such as plain microscope glass or indium tin oxide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To produce films with macroscopic grain sizes, the capillary translation speed, the concentration of molecules in solution, and the choice of solvent must be optimized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The four films in Fig 1 illustrate this optimization process that can be quite different for each molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of H2Pc-OC8, the largest grain sizes and most uniform films were obtained when 1% chloroform solution was used (Fig 1eh).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the optimum deposition speed of 30 m s1 in chloroform (Fig 1g,h), the grain size exceeds the microscope field of view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For toluene solutions, at lower concentrations (Fig 1a,b), the optimized deposition results in a disordered film with small grains and poor substrate coverage, whereas for deposition speeds significantly larger than optimal the nucleation happens randomly and simultaneously over the entire area of the sample resulting in a fan-like polycrystalline structure (Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This latter case is quite an interesting one since it represents a situation reminiscent of the vapour-deposited films that are polycrystalline structures with randomly oriented grains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fan-like structure can thus be regarded as a scaled-up model for the vapour-deposited films, with grain sizes large enough for optical spectroscopy investigations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, our studies of correlations between different grain boundaries and the nature of excited states at the boundary focused precisely on these types of disordered samples rather than the long-grain well-ordered structures that we explored elsewhere14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Long-range ordering in phthalocyanine thin films.Polarized microscopy images of crystalline H2Pc-OC8 thin films deposited on c plane sapphire using the solution-processing technique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optimization of deposition speed, solution concentration and choice of solvent, results in millimetre-sized grains suitable for optical spectroscopy experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) 0.5%, 11 m s1, toluene;

with high-angle (25°) grain boundaries (sample B (b,d)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional monomer-like feature is present at the high-angle grain boundary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar spectra are recorded from sample A, but no monomer-like feature is observed at the low-angle grain boundaries.Full size image', 'Figure 3c,d reproduces LD two-dimensional (2D) scans of 90 × 90-m areas marked with white squares in the microscopy images (Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pen-writing direction for each sample is also indicated in the microscope image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample A exhibits parallel stripes of 10 m in width, orthogonal to the pen-writing direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LD values are positive across the scanned area with a 25% difference between adjacent stripes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the LD is proportional to cos (2)21, where  is the angle that defines the stacking axis orientation with respect to the polarizer axis (Fig 2), the LD contrast observed in sample A corresponds to a relative angle  50 between stacking axes from adjacent stripes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In striking contrast, sample B exhibits a distinctly different, fan-like structure with well-defined grain boundaries in polarization-mode microscopy images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LD scan across an area traversed by a single-grain boundary, revealed a very large contrast between the adjacent grains corresponding to a relative angle  250 between the stacking axes of the two grains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A preliminary LD imaging survey conducted on films deposited at different concentrations ranging between 0.1% and 1% indicated that there is a direct relationship between the relative orientation of the stacking axes at the grain boundaries and solution concentration and deposition speed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A film of intermediate concentration and thickness (0.5%, 150 nm) deposited with the same writing speed (20 m s1), sample C, has parallel grains with large positive LD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample thicknesses quote here were estimated based on the thickness versus deposition speed curve found by Cour et al.12 The absorbance measurements performed on our samples (Supplementary Fig 2) are consistent with this estimation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'All our films exhibit strong room temperature PL resonant to the absorption edge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since radiative transitions typically originate from the lowest vibrational state of an electronic excited state26, the absence of a large Stokes shift is indicative of strong exciton vibronic coupling and the existence of delocalized excitons26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a consequence of the long-range ordering present in our films, that is, the size of crystalline grains, is significantly larger than the typical exciton diffusion lengths9, such that excitons generated inside a grain recombine before reaching the grain boundary or a defect state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3e highlights the most interesting results of the luminescence microscopy experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the luminescence is linearly polarized perpendicular to the stacking axis, indicating that the room temperature emission is indeed associated with the recombination of the singlet exciton ground state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The -orbital overlap between adjacent molecules preserves to some extent the monomer selection rules for the ground-state transition dipole at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 3 micro-PL spectra recorded at coordinates (x,y)=(35,08) and (84,15) indicate the luminescence polarization is correlated to the stacking axis orientation, changing sign and magnitude in tandem with the LD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The delocalization of this bandgap singlet exciton state has been described in detailed elsewhere14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, in addition to the expected singlet exciton recombination feature, the emission spectrum recorded from the grain boundary (for example, (x,y)=(25,68)), exhibits an additional strong sharp feature centred at 700 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This feature is exclusively observed when the laser excitation beam is focused anywhere along the grain boundary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To investigate its origins, we placed the sample in a variable temperature liquid He continuous flow cryostat and recorded PL spectra from grain boundaries at various temperatures ranging from 5 to 300 K (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sharp PL feature redshifts and decreases in intensity, reminiscent of the behaviour of typical emission from localized states in semiconductors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its polarization at low temperatures (Fig 4 inset) was opposite to that of the bandgap exciton recombination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following this observation, we conducted a systematic PL/LD study of grain boundaries in films deposited under different conditions, surveying 20 grain boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images from three representative grain boundaries and the luminescence spectra associated with them are shown in Fig 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first observation is that the relative intensity of the grain boundary luminescence that we define as Irelative=Imonomer/Itotal varies greatly from one-grain boundary to another and remains approximately constant along the grain boundary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second observation is the existence of a correlation between this relative intensity and the relative orientation of adjacent grains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This correlation is readily apparent from the data summarized in Table 1 which indicates that the monomer-like emission intensity increases with increasing boundary angle, reaching a maximum in the more disordered samples where we can no longer speak of a boundary between two crystalline grains but rather of disordered areas with sizes comparable to the crystalline regions (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our experiments, these disordered areas are unambiguously distinguished from crystalline grains oriented at 22.5o because they exhibit LD=0 regardless of the

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In spite of our study being focused on a specific soluble derivative of phthalocyanine, it is very useful to consider the results of our LD imaging and spatial- and polarization-resolved PL studies in light of the knowledge they bring on the correlations between electronic states and molecular ordering for small molecules systems in general.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In recent years, numerous fundamental and applied studies of electron mobilities and exciton diffusion on small-molecule organic semiconductor thin films such as pentacene, rubrene and even phthalocyanines report ever increasing record mobilities and diffusion lengths, far exceeding early predictions that follow from a simple oriented gas model17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cases, the key factor seems to be the reduction and control of grain boundaries such that continuous improvement in the thin film quality should reveal exciting new physics and bring a better understanding of electronic phenomena in these materials, in the same way that molecular beam epitaxial growth led to very high mobilities and excitons diffusion lengths in inorganic semiconductors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These materials seem to belong to an intermediate regime where the delocalized carriers and excitons are neither completely localized like the Frenkel excitons nor delocalized like the Wannier excitons in inorganic semiconductors14,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, optical spectroscopy techniques are ideal because they probe the longer-range interactions and excitations while providing spatial resolution on the micron range, which is now sufficient given the increasingly large crystalline grain size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scanning narrowband laser microscopy we employed here is a powerful technique that has been used to explore optical properties in a variety of systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its different flavours (Kerr Rotation, Faraday rotation, MCD, or LD) are employed for studying a vast array of phenomena ranging from spin-polarized electron transport in GaAs to grain boundaries in halide systems29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Phthalocyanines are the ideal test system for such investigations because they are resistant to oxidation and retain a high yield of radiative recombination in crystalline films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of them are readily available and, as mentioned earlier, very well studied as far as the molecular properties are concerned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the success we had in depositing thin films with macroscopic order (Fig 1) proved the robustness of this technique that relies on nucleation and surface tension control, a technique originally designed and optimized for depositing pentacene thin films13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Our group ultimately obtained macroscopic grain sizes for two distinct substituted metal phthalocyanines as well as two additional molecules in the porphyrin family: tetra-phenyl porphyrin (TPP) and naphthalocyanine (NPc).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optical studies on these species that investigated different aspects of longer-range interactions are beyond the scope of the present paper and will be reported elsewhere).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The necessity of an optical spectroscopy spatially resolved study stems from the progress made in fabricating OFET-like structures that investigate the influence of single-grain boundaries on electron mobilities6,11,12,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies looked into how the nature and number of grain boundaries limit the ultimate mobility through the presence of localized states (traps) at the boundary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also established the nature of grain boundaries in the thin films deposited through all flavours of solution-processing techniques is very different from that of grain boundaries in vapour-deposited thin films, a difference that originates in the different molecular ordering along the high-mobility axis (-stacking versus herringbone).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, transport measurements indicated the grains are separated by disordered regions of finite thickness (of the order of 10 nm) rather than molecularly abrupt boundaries11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Very recent spatially resolved transient absorption measurements on soluble pentacene thin films also indicate the boundaries should be viewed as disordered regions32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, the observation of radiative emission localized at the grain boundary (Figs 3 and 5) is somewhat expected and must be associated with these disordered regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unexpected element is the wavelength (or energy) associated with this emission, 700 nm (or 1.77 eV), significantly larger than the bulk luminescence located at 785 nm (1.58 eV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a simplistic approach, we can interpret the 200 meV difference as a quantitative estimate for an energy barrier the excitons/carriers need to overcome to reach the adjacent grain boundary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scattering from this 200 meV barrier will represent one of the mechanisms limiting the diffusion length/mobility, in addition to trap states present at the boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imaging of different films and grain boundaries such as the ones presented in Fig 5 allow us to hypothesize on the nature of electronic states at the boundary and refine this energy barrier concept.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For most films, the grain boundary is certainly narrower than our laser beam diameter (5 m), that explains the bulk exciton contribution to the PL spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the more disordered regions such as the one probed in Fig 5c the grain boundaries seem to have evolved into macroscopic disordered regions (LD=0) that are certainly in the micron range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are the very same regions where the sharp 700 nm PL feature becomes the dominant feature in the spectrum (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, our grain boundary survey summarized in Table 1 indicates that the relative intensity of this boundary feature increases with increasing angle  between stacking axes of adjacent grains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also important to note that there are preferred recurrent relative angle orientations, listed in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In spite of surveying numerous grain boundaries, these were the only orientations we found within an uncertainty of 2°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On the basis of these results, we propose that the grain boundaries are indeed disordered regions (as previously inferred by transport studies) where we observe a PL spectrum reminiscent of a solution spectrum or weakly interacting molecules with reduced orbital overlap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relatively large polarization observed at low temperatures (Fig 4 inset) is not a signature of a selection rule at the grain boundary but rather a consequence of the absorption and emission selection rules for the bulk exciton originating from the crystalline regions immediately adjacent to the grain boundary14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, we point out the sharp luminescence feature completely disappears in the highly ordered films such as the ones in Fig 1g,h.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect the nature of grain boundaries to be entirely different in these films because they are deposited in what has been identified as the convective regime12, that is, the liquid transforms into a solid film at a well-defined boundary that is  less_than 3-m thick.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies that investigated correlations between grain boundaries and electronic mobilities29 indicate that not only is the mobility greatly enhanced when the number of grain boundaries the electron cross is reduced, but more importantly, the mobility is significantly increased in films deposited in the convective regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our optical spectroscopy results now provide a quantitative feedback on the bandgap electronic states at the grain boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of the observations of localized emission, we propose that the electron mobility as well as exciton diffusion will also be reduced in these systems because of the lack of ordering and poor orbital overlap at the grain boundary, even at high excitation rates where trap states are saturated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While lower energy trap states are not luminescent, their presence can be inferred from the evolution of the PL intensity with excitation power shown in the Supplementary Fig 4b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At low power, the PL intensity is proportional to N0.8, where N represents the number of incident excitation photons, suggesting the presence of a non-radiative relaxation mechanism for excited carriers that may involve low-energy traps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism is most likely the ShockleyReadHall recombination, previously identified in solution-processed thin films33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For excitation densities larger than 1025 photons per second per centimetre3, the emission intensity increases as the square root of excitation power, a possible signature of the Auger excitonexciton annihilation at large excitation powers34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these films, the observation of the sharp luminescence feature is independent of the nature of non-radiative traps or the complex nature of non-radiative quenching mechanisms, because the spectral shape and relative PL intensity does not change with excitation power as evidenced by Supplementary Fig 4a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, absorbance spectra measurements, PL power studies or PL lifetime measurements (Supplementary Figs 2, 4 and 5) indicate the two transitions originate from entirely spatially separated states that do not interact with each other through energy transfer mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PL decays for both features are characterized by a single exponential and the same lifetime, in contrast to systems where the presence of energy transfer shortens the higher energy feature lifetime35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parameters such as film thickness or excitation power only seem to affect the overall PL intensity for both features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, the adaptation of polarization-resolved laser scanning techniques to crystalline organic semiconductor thin films have the potential for revealing a wealth of information in regards to the nature of excited states in these systems, with emphasis on longer-range phenomena.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the LD/PL scanning microscopy in tandem with novel thin film deposition techniques such as the hollow capillary pen-writing technique that relies on careful control of nucleation, we were able to unveil the nature of excited states at a single-grain boundary in phthalocyanine thin films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we concluded that scattering from an energy barrier created in a disordered region is one of the mechanisms limiting exciton diffusion length in the presence of grain boundaries, in addition to the low-energy traps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a broader sense, the macroscopic grain sizes open up the organic semiconductor systems for the first time to the wealth of bandgap spectroscopy experiments that can investigate the nature of excited states and the correlations between the crystalline structure and these excited states in a sample free of grain boundaries or defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, our group is making strides towards understanding the bandgap luminescence and the spatial extent of the bulk exciton wavefunction in these films some of which were recently reported elsewhere14.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Materials and thin film fabrication', 'The dye molecules of 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-Octakis(octyloxy)-29H,31H-phthalocyanine (H2Pc-OC8) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The materials were purified by column chromatography using chloroform as an eluent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thin films were deposited on substrates by a solution processing pen-writing technique at room temperature using either toluene or chloroform as the solvent13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method employs a hollow borosilicate glass capillary pen and solutions with concentration of 0.11 wt% are held in the pen by capillary forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Film deposition is accomplished by allowing droplets of solution at the end of the pen to make contact with the substrate and then laterally translating the pen at a controlled speed ranging between 0.02 and 2 mm s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deposition, conducted at room temperature, produces highly ordered films with uniform thicknesses ranging between 20 nm and 1 m depending on the deposition parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The substrates were thoroughly cleaned and treated with methanol to improve the wettability and to assist with forming uniform films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'LD and PL experiments', 'The absorption and LD spectra were measured at room temperature in the range of 4001,100 nm using a quasi-monochromatic (1-nm bandwidth), tuneable, incoherent, tungsten halogen monochromator light source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A continuous wave (CW)-focused HeNe laser was employed as probe beam for LD microscopy measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same laser served as quasi-resonant excitation for spatially resolved PL measurements (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To record LD images of individual crystalline grains, we adapted a polarization-resolved microscopy technique formerly employed to image spin drift and diffusion in GaAs29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A piezoelastic modulator was placed in the beam path to modulate the light polarization from x to y polarized at a frequency of 100 kHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The laser beam was focused to a 5-m spot using a × 10 objective lens mounted on a piezo nanopositioning stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A long working distance (15 mm) objective lens was chosen to insure that the experiment can be performed at temperatures as low as 5 K in an existing Oxford cryostat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These low-temperature experiments were reported elsewhere14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2D LD images were obtained by raster scanning the focusing objective lens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spatially resolved PL was simultaneously collected with the same lens in backscattering geometry and spectrally resolved using an Acton spectrometer coupled with a Roper Scientific liquid nitrogen cooled charge-coupled device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PL decay times presented in the Supplementary Information section were measured using the 2 ps, 86 MHz, 400 nm frequency doubled output of a Ti-Sapphire oscillator as excitation and a PicoQuant Time Correlated Single Photon Counting System with an Instrument Response Function (IRF) of 120ps connected to a PMT detector mounted on the side port of the Acton Spectrometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All PL/LD experiments were carried out at low excitation powers ( less_than 100 W) to avoid excitonexciton annihilation or excitonpolaron interactions (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the PL decay measurements presented in Supplementary Fig 5, we estimated the number of photons per pulse absorbed by the films is 3 × 106, while the number of molecules illuminated, estimated from the film crystal structure and the beam size, is a thousand times larger.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All spectra were corrected for the charge-coupled device response and grating reflectivity across the spectral range of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compensate for the difference in grating reflectivity for s- and p-polarized light, a quarter waveplate was inserted between the PL polarization analyser and the spectrometer slit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A correction factor was also introduced to account for the differences in the s and p reflectivity and transmittance of the beam splitter used in these experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temperature-dependent PL studies were conducted in a continuous flow Oxford Instruments optical cryostat where the sample temperature was continuously varied from 5 to 300 K.', 'X-ray diffraction', 'We independently confirmed the edge-on stacking through out-of-plane X-ray scattering studies performed at the NSLS-I facility of the Brookhaven National Laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2D scattering map for sample A, shown in Supplementary Fig 1, reveals clear peaks at 2=3°, 6° and 9°, corresponding to the (100) orthorhombic reflection with a lattice parameter a=23.7 Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This number matches the lattice constant of -phase H2Pc and confirms the in-plane orientation of the stacking axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2=3° region of the scattering map is re-plotted in Supplementary Fig 1b on a logarithmic scale to highlight the arc-like diffuse scattering, which indicates the presence of some disorder in the film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A complete 3D structural determination is not yet available for H2Pc-OC8.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
