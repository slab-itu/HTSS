Processable high internal phase Pickering emulsions using depletion attraction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'High internal phase emulsions have been widely used as templates for various porous materials, but special strategies are required to form, in particular, particle-covered ones that have been more difficult to obtain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report a versatile strategy to produce a stable high internal phase Pickering emulsion by exploiting a depletion interaction between an emulsion droplet and a particle using water-soluble polymers as a depletant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This attractive interaction facilitating the adsorption of particles onto the droplet interface and simultaneously suppressing desorption once adsorbed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This technique can be universally applied to nearly any kind of particle to stabilize an interface with the help of various non- or weakly adsorbing polymers as a depletant, which can be solidified to provide porous materials for many applications.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'High internal phase emulsions (HIPEs) that have a high volume fraction ( greater than 74%) of dispersed droplets in a low volume fraction of continuous phase1 have been attractive for use in a wide range of areas2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 because of their interesting features, such as a large surface area per volume of continuous phase1,3,4 and solid-like flow behaviour because of osmotic pressure10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking advantage of these features, HIPEs have been used as templates for porous materials2,3,4 used in various applications, such as organic semiconductors5, filter membranes6, scaffolds for tissue engineering7, food products8 and drug delivery systems9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'High internal phase Pickering emulsions (HIPPEs) stabilized by colloidal particles possess superior stability compared with HIPEs stabilized by low molecular surfactants because of the irreversible adsorption of particles to the interface12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it has been thought to be extremely difficult to fabricate HIPPEs because phase inversion occurs at  greater than 0.7 (refs 12, 14, 15), as predicted by theory14 and demonstrated in experiments12,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phase inversion could be prevented by the use of particles that are well dispersed in a continuous phase, but they would not adsorb to the interface easily, resulting in difficulty to form even Pickering emulsions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, several groups have succeeded in creating HIPPEs under very limited conditions, either by the delicate surface modification of colloids16,17,18,19,20,21 or by the use of synthetic colloids that possess the appropriate surface properties22,23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this article, we exploit the depletion interaction26, another type of physical interaction that can produce attraction between a droplet and a hydrophilic particle (Fig 1a), enhancing particle adsorption to the droplet interface; thus, this attractive interaction could potentially improve the stability of emulsions while the hydrophilic particles would inhibit phase inversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, particle desorption from the interface would be also suppressed by the depletion attraction, thus providing a great stability of HIPPEs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking advantages of these, we systematically investigate a role of depletion attraction between a colloidal particle and a liquid droplet to fabricate stable and even processable HIPPEs using various particle-depletant combinations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Depletion attraction used for Pickering emulsions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic illustration of particle adsorption to the interface by depletion attraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Photographs of compared emulsions (0.18 vol% of 1 m-silica particles) formed with the presence of PEG (10,000 g mol1, left) and the absence of PEG (right), taken after several hours from voltex emulsification (3,000 r.p.m.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here,  is the oil fraction of the initial oilwater mixture before emulsifying.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 1 cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Photograph of =0.6 emulsion (0.18 vol% silica particles) with oil-soluble fluorescence dyes and its confocal micrograph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 100 m.

'Enhanced stability of Pickering emulsion with PEG', 'We first compare the emulsion stability in the presence/absence of polymers as a depletant27,28,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hexadecane as an oil phase are added to aqueous solutions of hydrophilic silica particles in the presence/absence of polyethylene glycol (PEG), and then oil is broken into smaller droplets by simple vortexing (low-energy emulsification).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oil in water (O/W) emulsion using 0.18 vol% silica particles of 1 m in diameter, and 1 wt% of PEG, are well stabilized for volume fractions up to =0.7 (Fig 1b; Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They remain unchanged for at least several days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, O/W emulsions without polymers or without particles become unstable immediately, leading to complete phase separation (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify the emulsion stability microscopically, we directly visualize the O/W emulsion with an oil-soluble fluorescence dye using confocal microscopy and find that the size of the oil droplets remained the same over several days (Fig 1c,d; Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using fluorescently labelled silica particles, we also confirm that emulsions are stabilized mainly by adsorbed particles, instead of PEG (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the particle adsorption could be enhanced by depletion attraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is noteworthy that the depletion attraction might be applied between droplets and between the particles, as well as between a droplet and a particle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The depletion attraction between droplets could not work because particles at the droplet interface provide a space between two droplets for PEGs to freely go in and come out, even when two droplets are in contact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the depletion attraction between particles, if particles are flocculated by the depletion attraction during the emulsifying process, it helps to stabilize emulsions31, but no significantly flocculated particles are observed in any of our systems (Fig 1e; Supplementary Figs 4 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although particles could form aggregates by the depletion attraction, a large external force for emulsification with the help of the repulsive interaction between silica particles could break particle aggregates into an individual particle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the particle could better remain at the interface against the external force because of the surface tension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Enhanced particle adsorption via depletion attraction', 'To investigate the role of PEG more quantitatively, we first measure the particle adsorption to the oilwater interface and PEG adsorption to the particle surface (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starting from nearly zero adsorption without PEG, at low PEG concentrations ( less_than 0.0033, wt%, regime 1), particle adsorption to the oilwater interface increases with PEG concentration to 20%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High PEG concentrations (0.0033, wt%  less_than CPEG  less_than 3.3 wt%, regime 2), enhances the particle adsorption dramatically up to 70% until CPEG=3.3 wt%, but adsorption of particles sharply decreases at higher PEG concentrations (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In regime 1, PEG adsorption to the silica surface increases from 0 mg m2 to 0.45 mg m2 (Fig 2b), and its adsorption to the oilwater interface increases with increasing PEG concentration as well (Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that particle adsorption onto the oilwater interface is mainly determined by the amount of PEG adsorbed onto the silica surface, which changes the particle wettability, and the depletion pressure is too weak to enhance the particle adsorption in regime 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Desorption and adsorption of silica particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Particle fraction adsorbed to the interface by emulsification as a function of PEG concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Top: simple schematics for various roles of PEG in bulk with varying concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Amount of PEG adsorbed to the silica surface as a function of PEG concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars denote s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of the value estimated in three different experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Interfacial tension measurements of an oilwater interface with time by a pendent drop method at each concentration of PEG in a water droplet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Interfacial tension with various PEG concentrations at 5, 25 and 55 min, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Simple schematic presenting the suppressed desorption of particles from the interface, induced by depletion pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) Langmuir isotherm of solvent-spread silica particles at the air/aqueous solution with various PEG concentrations.Full size image', 'Above 0.033 wt% of PEG (regime 2), depletion pressure determines the adsorption behaviour of particles (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PEG adsorption to the silica surface (Fig 2b) and the oilwater interface (Fig 2c,d) indicates the amount of adsorbed PEG is already saturated at a much lower concentration, while the depletion pressure in the bulk phase should increase continuously with PEG concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum repulsive force per unit area between a silica particle and an oil droplet was previously measured to be 10 kPa by AFM (in Derjaguin approximation, an energy per unit area is equivalent to a measured force/particle radius, and the repulsive pressure could be thus computed from the slope of the force/radiusdistance graph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  )32, and our depletion pressure PcRT10 kPa for 1 wt% of 10 kDa PEG in an ideal case and P100 kPa when considering an excluded volume of PEGs33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it can be  greater than 100 kPa for deformable interfaces35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the depletion attraction could overcome the energy barrier of particleoil interaction so that particles could reach the interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These particles are proved to be irreversibly adsorbed to the interface when CPEG is in regime 2, suggesting that capillary force at the three phase contact line holds the particles at the interface (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On the other hand, the adsorption of particles sharply decreases at higher PEG concentrations, 10 wt%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2c,d; Supplementary Fig 7, the interfacial tension decreases suddenly at higher concentration of PEG, 10 wt% while the amount of PEG at the oilwater interface stays almost similar even with increasing the PEG concentration from 0.001 wt% to 5 wt% and 0.01 wt% to 5 wt% for 10 k PEG and 1.5 k PEG, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is presumably that a large amount of PEG adsorbed to the interface before adsorption of the particles acts as a polymer brush, thus disturbing the particle adsorption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Suppressed particle desorption via depletion attraction', 'Depletion attraction could also suppress desorption of particles from the interface as well, once particles are adsorbed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As soon as the adsorbed particles escape from the interface, the depletion attraction would place them back to the interface (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prove this suppression more quantitatively, we measure the Langmuir isotherms of solvent-spread 1-m silica particles on an air/aqueous solution with various PEG concentrations (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of or with low concentrations of PEG, the surface pressure remains at zero upon the spreading particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that most particles submerge in the bulk water phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, when the same amount of particles is spread on the PEG or dextran solution, far more silica particles is left on the surface such that they could even be observed by eye (Supplementary Figs 8 and 9a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This different particle amount remained at the surface after spreading supports that the depletion attraction plays an important role in forming a more stable particle layer at the air/water interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amounts of particles at the interface increases substantially as increasing the concentrations of PEG solutions from 0.0033, wt% to 3.3 wt%, while PEG adsorption to silica particles (Fig 2) and to interfaces (Supplementary Fig 9b) remain the same at this concentration regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, depletion attraction is likely to be responsible for the suppressed desorption, although other possible mechanisms such as particles bridging by PEGs could help them stay at the interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We should note that particles could increase the surface pressure when at least10 times more particles are spread at the air/water interface without PEG, and it could increase the surface pressure even more on compression (Supplementary Fig 9c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a few compression-expansion cycles make a significant difference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the first compression with large hysteresis that corresponds to large structural reorganization (Supplementary Fig 8), silica particle layers on the PEG solution show minimal hysteresis, demonstrating that most of the silica particles are left on the interface even for multiple compressionexpansion cycles (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, significant amount of silica particles at the air/water interface are desorbed from the interface during the first cycle, thus showing the surface pressure saturation after a few cycles (Supplementary Fig 9c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also find from the estimation that the maximum magnitude of desorption force to remove particles held by the surface tension is smaller than the magnitude of depletion force (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These observations with simple estimations strongly suggest that the depletion pressure is the key factor to determine the particle adsorption/desorption behaviours rather than other possible roles of PEG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PEGs adsorbed to the silica surface and the oilwater interface might play a minor role for the adsorption/desorption behaviour31,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, PEG adsorption to the oilwater interface and to the silica surface is almost constant over three orders of magnitude PEG concentrations, while particle adsorption and desorption behaviour dramatically changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it strongly supports that PEG adsorption onto silica surface and the oilwater interface might be helpful, but the depletion pressure is essential for better stability of Pickering emulsions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Criteria for achieving processable HIPPEs', 'The increased stability of a Pickering emulsion with hydrophilic silica particles by depletion attraction could form stable HIPPEs up to =0.9 even with a low concentration of the particles (Supplementary Figs 2, 4, 5), such as 0.54 vol% of silica particles, compared with the total HIPPE volume with the presence of 3.3 wt% PEG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This condition provides a stable HIPPE whose structures remain at least several weeks in the absence of any external force, although this amount of silica covers only about 6% of 40 m diameter of oil droplet surface (Fig 2a; see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'However, such a low amount of particles could stabilize HIPPEs, such as a bridging particle monolayer mechanism13,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our micron-sized silica particles could form a relatively dense monolayer between two droplets, because of the capillary attraction to reduce menisci around the particles, thus decreasing the overall surface energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, other stable Pickering emulsions with a low amount of micro-particles have been also reported as well39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Once stable HIPPEs are obtained, we are able to process the HIPPEs, which have been very difficult to achieve24,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3ad;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We, for the first time, experimentally demonstrate that the depletion interaction could enhance the particle adsorption to the oil/water droplet interface and simultaneously suppress the particle desorption from the interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This enhanced adsorption and suppressed desorption could stabilize emulsion even with highly hydrophilic silica particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these understandings, we propose a universal route to fabricate processable HIPPEs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike previous researches16,17,18,19,20,22,23,24,25, each of which requires a specific strategy to form a stable HIPE, our technique works for particles with a wide range of size, shape and surface chemistry so long as they are dispersed in a continuous phase with diverse non- or weakly-adsorbing polymers as depletant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By evaporating a disperse phase and solidifying a continuous phase, (or by evaporating both phases and solidifying the interface) it is also possible to create various porous organic-inorganic hybrid materials with high porosity, the surface of which is covered with particles that could be post-functionalized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our strategy can be applied to create more complicated and hierarchical structures by controlling the intra-structures of droplets or by the use of meso-/micro-porous particles, thus could enable unprecedented material designs for myriad applications such as absorbents, separation membranes, energy conversion/storage and other functional materials42,43,44,45,46,47.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

14,000 r.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  for 10 min, and a supernatant solution is obtained again.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using ultravioletvis absorbance spectroscopy, the remaining amount of molybdophosphoric acid reagent in the supernatant solution is measured at 215 nm, and the amount of PEG that is reacted with the reagent is calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the amount of PEG that is attached to the silica surface could be calculated by subtracting the amount of PEG that has reacted with the reagent from the initial concentration of PEG solution in the second stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result agrees well with the previous result51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Particle desorption test', 'A particle desorption test is conducted at the air-water interface due to the technical difficulty of doing so at the oil/water interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Langmuir trough (KSV NIMA) is first filled with various concentrations of PEG solution (from 0 to 3.3 wt%, compared with the only water phase), and 400 l

performed with frequencies ranging from 0.1 to 100 rad s1 at a fixed strain amplitude (0.1%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shear moduli at a fixed frequency (10 rad s1) are then measured with various strain amplitudes ranging from 0.01 to 300%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Non-linear rheology experiments are also conducted with a strain amplitude range of 1002,000% and with 1050 frequencies to investigate the structural resistance of the materials to the external stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rheological properties of the HIPPEs and emulsions are first measured for 200 s with a linear regime amplitude of 0.1% and a frequency of 10 rad s1, followed by much higher shear strain amplitudes and frequencies for 10 s that are able to destroy the emulsion microstructures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immediately after the application of high shear stress, the same small amplitude and frequency (0.1%, 10 rad s1) are applied again for 200 s to measure the linear rheological properties of the emulsion system.
