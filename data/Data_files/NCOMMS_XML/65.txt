Selective hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene on platinumcopper alloys at the single-atom limit  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Platinum is ubiquitous in the production sectors of chemicals and fuels; however, its scarcity in nature and high price will limit future proliferation of platinum-catalysed reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One promising approach to conserve platinum involves understanding the smallest number of platinum atoms needed to catalyse a reaction, then designing catalysts with the minimal platinum ensembles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we design and test a new generation of platinumcopper nanoparticle catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene,, an industrially important reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isolated platinum atom geometries enable hydrogen activation and spillover but are incapable of CC bond scission that leads to loss of selectivity and catalyst deactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -Alumina-supported single-atom alloy nanoparticle catalysts with  less_than 1 platinum atom per 100 copper atoms are found to exhibit high activity and selectivity for butadiene hydrogenation to butenes under mild conditions, demonstrating transferability from the model study to the catalytic reaction under practical conditions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Platinum (Pt) is one of the most widely used transition metal catalysts due to its superior catalytic performance for both oxidation and hydrogenation reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is used extensively in electrochemical and heterogeneous catalysts with applications in fuel cells, automotive catalytic converters and industrial hydrocarbon cracking processes1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pt will also undoubtedly play a large role in the ongoing development of clean energy technologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite its favourable reactivity, there are two major drawbacks of Pt catalysts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, Pt is very expensive and scarce in nature, which imposes major limitations on its future role in catalysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, Pt is susceptible to carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells because CO binds strongly to metallic Pt3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, a key step towards the next-generation catalysts will be the development of hybrid systems that retain the high activity of Pt while improving its selectivity and increasing its tolerance to CO poisoning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One approach is to design catalysts that contain only the Pt sites necessary to perform or to assist a target reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently single-site heterogeneous catalysts containing atomically dispersed active metal species have been shown to be effective in catalysing a number of reactions5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-site Pt and Au cations stabilized by -O- linkages on various supports with vicinal -OH groups have been identified as the active sites for the watergas shift reaction6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a similar fashion, isolated precious metal-Ox species on various support matrices have shown superior activity for CO oxidation8, and the steam reforming of methanol9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atomically dispersed Au in metallic Ni has been shown to markedly suppress carbon deposition in the steam reforming of methane11, whereas isolated Pd atoms in a metallic copper host catalyse selective hydrogenation reactions12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Pt and Pd are often interchangeable in terms of catalytic activity, they have different physical properties that impact their alloying behaviour, surface segregation and electronic structure that can potentially impact their ability to activate H2 and catalyse hydrogenation reactions15,16,17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pt/Cu bimetallic alloys offer an alternative method for reducing the amount of Pt and potentially enhancing catalyst selectivity for partial hydrogenation reactions20,21,22,23, but to date it has not been reported that single metallic Pt atoms are capable of such chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theoretical work has shown that by simultaneously optimizing the activation of reactants and binding strength of intermediates, the catalyst activity for hydrogenation reactions should be controllable24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Herein we show that very low concentrations of individual, isolated Pt atoms in a Cu surface catalyse the industrially important butadiene hydrogenation reaction with high selectivity to butenes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Butadiene poisons polymerization catalysts even at low concentrations ( less_than 10 p.p.m.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in industrial alkene streams25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of particular interest is the butadiene impurity in propene feedstocks used to produce 42.3 million tons of polypropylene annually26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The selective hydrogenation of butadiene to butene serves to increase the purity of alkene feedstocks without reducing their overall concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, catalysts that selectively hydrogenate butadiene to butenes and prevent the hydrogenation of butenes to butane are of great interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been proposed that the observed product distribution is controlled by the adsorption energy of butadiene to the catalytic surface and weaker binding is known to direct the product distribution in favour of the formation of butenes27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our surface science experiments show that Cu binds butadiene weaker than Pt, but the dissociation of molecular H2 on Cu surfaces and nanoparticle (NP) systems is often the rate limiting step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use high-resolution microscopy to interrogate the atomic geometry of Pt/Cu alloys and discovered the minimum ensemble of Pt, a single atom, embedded in Cu(111) single crystal surface will dissociate H2 thus enabling selective hydrogenation reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our surface science experiments reveal that isolated Pt atom geometries, unlike continuous Pt ensembles, exhibit weak binding of CO and maintain activity after many hydrogenation cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Guided by these model catalyst experiments, we prepare highly diluted Pt/Cu NPs using this single-atom alloy (SAA) principle12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NP Cu catalysts, with Pt as the minority species, are found to exhibit high activity and selectivity for butadiene hydrogenation to butenes under relatively mild conditions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Hydrogen uptake and desorption from Pt/Cu(111) surfaces', 'Model Pt/Cu surfaces with a range of Pt coverages were prepared using physical vapour deposition of Pt onto a clean Cu(111) surface held at 380 K. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) imaging (Fig 1b) shows that at low Pt coverages (0.02 monolayer (ML)), Pt atoms exist as individual, isolated species substituted in the Cu surface lattice, which we refer to as a SAA19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The STM images indicate that Pt atoms incorporate both directly into Cu(111) terraces and in areas above surface step edges via place exchange.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even in regions of higher local concentration near step edges, the Pt atoms are always isolated from one another and do not form dimer or trimer clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This high dispersion of individual Pt atoms is driven by the negative mixing enthalpy of Pt in Cu and elastic strain relief of incorporating a larger Pt atom into a smaller Cu lattice.15', 'Figure 1: Hydrogen dissociation and spillover on a Pt/Cu(111) SAA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) TPD traces of H2 uptake on 0.02 ML and 5 ML Pt/Cu(111) surface exposed to H2 at 85 K.

ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34), which is a prerequisite for selective hydrogenation chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The low-temperature desorption of H2 from the Pt/Cu(111) SAA surface is a result of a decrease in the H2 recombination barrier as compared with a Cu surface and a decrease in H atom binding energy compared with a pure Pt surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experimental results are consistent with theoretical studies that predict a minimal activation energy ( less_than 0.05 eV) for H2 dissociation at individual, isolated Pt sites in Cu and much weaker binding of H atoms to the Cu surface as opposed to pure Pt32,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The weaker binding of H atoms at the single Pt atom dissociation sites compared with Pt(111) results from the preferential adsorption of H at threefold hollow sites, which in the SAAs are composed of one Pt atom and two Cu atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By combining complementary energetic landscapes for H2 dissociation and spillover, we later show that Pt/Cu bimetallic catalysts exhibit enhanced reactivity since Pt readily activates H2 and Cu exhibits weak binding of reaction intermediates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the Pt/Cu bimetallic combination addresses both the reduced selectivity of Pt catalysts and the barrier for H2 activation on Cu (refs 30, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition, our experiments reveal that Pt/Cu(111) SAAs bind CO significantly weaker than Pt as evidenced by the lower desorption temperature of CO from single Pt atoms (350 K) compared with Pt(111) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32) (450 K) (Supplementary Fig 1 and Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result holds great promise for the utility of Pt/Cu SAAs given problems such as CO poisoning of the Pt anodes of PEM fuel cells4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Butadiene hydrogenation on Pt/Cu(111) alloys', 'To probe the chemical reactivity of Pt/Cu SAAs, we performed TPD/reaction (TPD/R) studies on the model catalyst systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2a shows TPD/R traces resulting from adsorption of 50 L H2 (which results in 0.2 ML of adsorbed H atoms (Ha)) and 0.1 L butadiene (0.2 ML) on a 0.02 ML Pt/Cu(111) SAA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sole product of co-adsorption of Ha and butadiene is butenes at 25% conversion with no detectable yield of butane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hydrogenation reaction is facile on the SAA as evidenced by reactively formed butenes desorbing from the surface below room temperature (240 K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unreacted butadiene desorbs from Cu terraces (220 K), Pt sites (290 K) and Cu steps (330 K), and unreacted H2 desorbs from Pt sites (230 K) (Supplementary Figs 2 and 3, and Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The desorption temperature of these unreacted species is consistent with desorption from a clean Pt/Cu(111) surface, demonstrating that the co-adsorption of butadiene and Ha does not alter the desorption behaviour of either species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of Ha, butadiene reversibly adsorbs and desorbs from the surface without decomposing or inducing self-hydrogenation to unwanted butane (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reactively formed butenes desorb at the same temperature as adsorbed 1-butene (Supplementary Fig 4), indicating that the reaction is desorption rate limited and the selective hydrogenation must occur at a temperature below 240 K (refs 37, 38, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Desorption of butane is never observed and co-adsorption of Ha and 1-butene did not yield the fully hydrogenated product butane (Supplementary Fig 5), indicating that weak binding to Cu enables selective hydrogenation to the desired product.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Selective hydrogenation of butadiene on Pt/Cu(111) SAAs versus larger Pt ensembles.TPD/R traces from the adsorption of H2 and butadiene on (a) 0.02 ML Pt/Cu(111) SAA and (c) 0.3 ML Pt/Cu(111).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  STM image of (b) 0.02 ML and (d) 0.3 ML Pt/Cu(111).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars, 1 nm.Full size image', 'Increasing the concentration of Pt to 0.3 ML decreased the selectivity of the surface to butenes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With increased Pt content, we predominantly observe decomposition of hydrocarbons resulting in surface-bound hydrocarbon fragments as evidenced by desorption of H2 at higher temperatures (Fig 2c)40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-temperature desorption of H2 (420 K) is indicative of the decomposition of butadiene and butenes into surface CHx fragments that further decompose to C and release additional H2 at higher temperatures as previously observed for decomposed butenes on Pd model catalysts40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  STM images of 0.3 ML Pt/Cu(111) reveal the cause of this effect; in addition to single Pt atoms, the 0.3-ML Pt surface is composed of extended linear chains (210 atoms) of Pt atoms (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike individual Pt atoms, these larger Pt ensembles within the Cu matrix are capable of breaking CC and CH bonds that leads to decomposition and active site poisoning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These Pt sites exhibit reduced selectivity similar to Pt(111) on which the decomposition of butadiene is preferred over hydrogenation due to strong binding of butadiene to Pt(111) and facile decomposition41,42,43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To determine the active sites for hydrogenation, CO was used to selectively block Pt sites as the hydrogenation was performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, H was adsorbed onto a Pt/Cu(111) SAA and then small amounts of CO were adsorbed (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to the stronger binding energy of CO to Pt than Cu, CO selectively adsorbs atop to the isolated Pt atoms45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H was adsorbed onto the surface before CO since CO blocks the adsorption of H. The surface was then exposed to butadiene and the temperature was ramped to perform the hydrogenation reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since CO desorbs from Pt sites at higher temperature (350 K) than butenes or H2, CO inhibits any hydrogenation from occurring at the Pt sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CO also blocks the adsorption of butadiene at Pt sites as seen by the disappearance of its desorption peak at 290 K. Our results indicate that the conversion of butadiene to butenes is unaffected by the CO adsorption at the Pt atom sites, meaning that the selective hydrogenation of butadiene occurs predominately on the Cu sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Butadiene hydrogenation in the presence of CO.TPD/R traces for the co-adsorption of H2 and butadiene (a) without and (b) with CO on 0.02 ML Pt/Cu(111).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H2 was adsorbed on the surface before adsorption of CO.Full size image', 'Pt/Cu(111) SAAs exhibit excellent stability after multiple TPD/R cycles as shown by the steady and selective conversion of butadiene to butenes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cycles of the co-adsorption of hydrogen and butadiene followed by CO titration and H2 uptake showed no change in reactivity (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After six cycles, the conversion of butadiene to butenes remained constant at 25±1% as determined by the amount of butenes desorbing at 240 K. The number of Pt atoms in the surface was also quantified via CO titration between each reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After each TPD/R cycle, the concentration of Pt atoms in the surface layer was 1.4±0.2%, consistent with the number of Pt atoms present prior to each hydrogenation reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the Pt atoms serve as the entrance routes of Ha onto the surface, the ability for the surface to uptake Ha remained constant at 15±1%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of Pt sites or decrease in H2 activation was not observed because Pt atoms are neither poisoned by decomposition of hydrocarbon fragments nor lost by sub-surface migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since multiple hydrogenation runs result in no decrease in activity or selectivity, single isolated Pt atoms in Cu are capable of H2 activation and spillover but not of breaking CC bonds, thus preventing the butadiene decomposition and surface poisoning that occur at higher Pt coverage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The robust nature of the Pt/Cu system further highlights the durability of SAAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Repeated cycles of butadiene hydrogenation on a Pt/Cu(111) SAA reveal no loss in activity.Multiple cycles of TPD/R after the co-adsorption 50 L H2+0.1 L butadiene, followed by TPD of 50 L H2 and then TPD of 1 L CO on 0.02 ML Pt/Cu(111) SAA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple co-adsorptions of H2 and butadiene lead to no decrease in the amount of butenes produced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Pt atom concentration in the surface after each reaction cycle was quantified by CO titration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each reaction cycle, the temperature was ramped from 85 to 450 K.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this work, surface science and atomic resolution microscopy studies of the selective hydrogenation of butadiene to butenes on model Pt/Cu(111) alloy surfaces have shown that individual, isolated Pt atoms in the Cu(111) surface are all that is required to ensure stable activity and 100% selectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have extended these findings to realistic pressures (1 bar) by synthesizing and testing Pt/Cu SAA NP catalysts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At low loadings, Pt exists as individual, isolated atoms substituted into the Cu(111) surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These single Pt atoms activate the dissociation and spillover of H to Cu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The weak binding of butadiene to Cu allows for the highly selective hydrogenation to butenes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No decomposition or poisoning of these alloys was observed, which can be attributed to the lack of extended Pt surface sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At higher Pt content in Pt/Cu alloy surfaces, we directly visualized extended Pt ensembles responsible for the reduced selectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isolated Pt atoms also bind CO significantly more weakly than metallic Pt, which is an important consideration in many Pt-catalysed reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This combined model system/NP catalyst strategy is a powerful approach to the design of new alloy catalysts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach is especially useful for highly diluted single-site systems in which identification of the active sites and elucidation of the surface chemistry is very challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, this work reveals that, in addition to their promising selective hydrogenation properties, SAAs provide the ultimate limit for the most efficient use of costly catalytic elements such as Pt.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
