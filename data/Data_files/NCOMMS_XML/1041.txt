Real-time atomistic observation of structural phase transformations in individual hafnia nanorods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'High-temperature phases of hafnium dioxide have exceptionally high dielectric constants and large bandgaps, but quenching them to room temperature remains a challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scaling the bulk form to nanocrystals, while successful in stabilizing the tetragonal phase of isomorphous ZrO2, has produced nanorods with a twinned version of the room temperature monoclinic phase in HfO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use in situ heating in a scanning transmission electron microscope to observe the transformation of an HfO2 nanorod from monoclinic to tetragonal, with a transformation temperature suppressed by over 1000°C from bulk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the nanorod is annealed, we observe with atomic-scale resolution the transformation from twinned-monoclinic to tetragonal, starting at a twin boundary and propagating via coherent transformation dislocation; the nanorod is reduced to hafnium on cooling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike the bulk displacive transition, nanoscale size-confinement enables us to manipulate the transformation mechanism, and we observe discrete nucleation events and sigmoidal nucleation and growth kinetics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The continued miniaturization of device components such as metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors1,2,3,4 has inspired a major push to replace silicon dioxide with high- dielectrics as the gate material1,2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing the dielectric constant of gate oxides is imperative for continued reduction of the gate thickness, without deleterious leakage currents typical of ultrathin SiO2 when it is reduced to the nanometre scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mixed ioniccovalent nature of the HfO bonds in HfO2 polymorphs contribute to a high Born effective charge tensor Z*, and the combination of large Z* with the presence of soft low-energy phonon modes yield large dielectric constants6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the -values of oxides tend in general to vary inversely with band gap, in oxide-based components there is often a trade-off between a sufficiently high -value and a sufficiently large band gap, and therefore not all high- materials are useable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amorphous and nanocrystalline HfO2 and their SiO2 composites have already emerged as viable alternatives to SiO2 and have been scaled to manufacturing environments6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HfO2 has a high dielectric constant and a high bandgap and is furthermore stable on silicon4; in its room temperature monoclinic phase, however, HfO2 has a dielectric constant of only about 18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the higher temperature tetragonal (stable above 1700 °C) and cubic ( greater than 2600 °C) phases have -values of 75 and 29, respectively7, and band gaps which reach a maximum value of 6 eV in the tetragonal phase8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is great interest, therefore, in trapping the tetragonal phase of HfO2 at room temperature, which has thus far only been possible for extremely small crystallites that are  less_than 3.6 nm in size, or within defective matrices9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A slight displacive distortion of the unit cells for the three polymorphs of HfO2 is necessary to undergo a diffusionless martensitic transition from monoclinic to tetragonal to cubic on heating13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since only a small distortion (a 9° shear of the unit cell from monoclinic to tetragonal and a ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2.7% expansion of the cell volume)15 defines this structural phase transformation, preventing reversion back to the monoclinic phase on quenching the tetragonal phase to room temperature has proven a formidable challenge13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HfO2 is isomorphic to ZrO2 (refs 13, 14), and the two oxides have similar lattice parameters and the same space group in each phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insight may be gleaned, therefore, from examining the case of ZrO2, which has been successfully stabilized in the tetragonal phase at room temperature in nanocrystalline form7,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This represents a suppression of the ZrO2 transition temperature by over 1000 °C from its bulk value of 1050 °C (refs 16, 17, 18, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even for such classical martensitic transitions, however, the atomistic details of the transition and their specific size dependence remain to be elucidated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The longer metaloxygen bond length in the tetragonal (versus the monoclinic) phase is thought to be a key parameter that may be manipulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model developed by Grain and Campbell20 suggests that stretching of the MO bond with simple thermal expansion is key to stabilizing the tetragonal phase above the bulk phase transition temperature, explaining the large discrepancy between the transformation temperatures of ZrO2 and HfO2 (refs 13, 20); the idea is simply that the ZrO bond is longer than the HfO bond, and results in a correspondingly lower transition temperature of 1050 °C, in comparison to 1700 °C in HfO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following this logic, methods to effectively stretch this bond without relying on thermal expansion, such as working at reduced pressure, or introducing strain, or cation dopants7,21,22, could also be effective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the latter case the resulting oxygen vacancies stabilize the tetragonal and cubic ZrO2 phases, although with the deleterious side effect of introducing charge traps, increasing ionic conductivity, and disrupting the dielectric properties of the material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Tetragonal ZrO2 is stabilized via scaling the crystal to finite size23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these crystals the surface energies, and the increased surface-to-volume ratio, successfully stabilizes nanocrystalline ZrO2 in the desired phase25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, in each of the above approaches, the goal is to manipulate the structure such that the tetragonal phase is the thermodynamically stable phase at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternate approach would be to manipulate the mechanism by which the phase transition proceeds, so as to engineer a material in which the tetragonal phase may be trapped kinetically; to our knowledge this has not yet been attempted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Similar approaches to the stabilization of ZrO2 have been attempted for HfO2, with mixed results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At atmospheric pressure, heating the pure material will induce a transformation from monoclinic to tetragonal at 1700 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemical doping has also been employed, although the resulting dielectric constant has yet to be fully determined26,27,28,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stabilizing tetragonal HfO2 through size-confinement is more difficult; in previous work it has been shown that when scaled to finite size, HfO2 will remain in the monoclinic phase down to the few-nanometre scale, and contains multiple twin boundaries (giving a nano-scale barcode appearance)31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction (XRD) of these monoclinic HfO2 nanorods shows the monoclinic to tetragonal phase transformation commencing at 400 °C (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ensemble measurements are, however, unable to capture the richness of the modified phase diagrams accessible at ultra-small dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interplay between deformation, creation of twin boundaries, bond stretching and phase transformations has thus remained unexplored even for the classical displacive transition characterized by this simple binary oxide system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, despite considerable attempts to map energy landscapes18,19, much of the work in this area remains theoretical, and there exists no precedent for real-space and real-time examination of the phase transformation at the atomic scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we use in situ heating in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) to observe directly the phase change of a single hafnia nanorod.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transformation pathway of the nanorod from twinned-monoclinic to tetragonal is revealed with atomic-scale resolution, with nucleation at a twin boundary, followed by propagation of the tetragonal phase via a coherent transformation dislocation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, size-confinement enables us to manipulate the transformation mechanism such that discrete nucleation events and conventional sigmoidal nucleation and growth kinetics are observed (attributed in part to plane-by-plane motion of the transformation dislocation), rather than the expected displacive transition, which (in the bulk) prevents quenching of the tetragonal phase.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

the three polymorphs of HfO2 are shown in Fig 1, illustrating the slight displacive distortions necessary to undergo a diffusionless martensitic transition from monoclinic to tetragonal to cubic on heating13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2 shows high angle annular dark field (HAADF) Z-contrast imaging of the nanorod before heating, with accompanying simulated image (calculated with QSTEM software)32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rods are monoclinic with multiple twin boundaries occurring along the (100) planes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These twins are believed to form to accommodate shear strain during the tetragonal to monoclinic phase transformation upon cooling during synthesis31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon increasing the length of the nanocrystals while keeping the diameter constant, the number of twins are monotonically increased31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stabilization of such ferroelastic domains and coherent twin boundaries has previously been examined by dark-field TEM studies31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nanorods represent excellent model systems since defects tend to migrate to surfaces and are annealed out during hot colloidal synthesis33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, no cation vacancies can be observed through atomic resolution imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coherent twin boundaries visible in Fig 2 are the primary imperfections discernible in these crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements of bulk samples or even ensemble measurements of nanostructures furthermore cannot capture specific nucleation events given the large nucleation volumes and the facile propagation of transformations across the 3D material akin to twinning dislocations during transformation twinning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dimensionally confined nanorods thus represent ideal model systems for examining discrete nucleation events and the propagation of the nucleated phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Crystal structures of HfO2 polymorphs.The unit cell of three phases of HfO2, showing the

wire in Fig 3 as a function of time, we used a fast Fourier transform (FFT) approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each frame, an FFT of the nanorod was acquired, and the spots in this pattern were identified to belong to one or more specific hafnium oxide phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So identified, the spots were masked, and an inverse FFT (IFFT) was used to regenerate those parts of the image containing the selected phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this technique, we are able to map out the different phases (and their crystallographic zone axes) present in the nanorod over time, directly observing the phase transformation as it occurred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An unknown phase appears transiently (Fig 3, blue regions), and is neither monoclinic nor tetragonal, but is most similar to the orthorhombic hafnia phase19, although it cannot be identified unambiguously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that the orthorhombic hafnia (or a distorted version of it) might provide a transition pathway for the monoclinic to tetragonal phase transformation for some orientation relationships but a direct monoclinictetragonal transformation appears to be the predominantly observed pathway as further discussed below.

surface defect that extends into one of the previously identified twin boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the FFT analysis (Fig 4) and atomic resolution imaging, we are able to identify the emerging phase as tetragonal HfO2, and over a period of about 40 min the nanowire converts completely from single-crystalline twinned monoclinic to polycrystalline tetragonal hafnia, preserving much of the nanorods overall morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, no migration of oxygen vacancies is observed in this regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The tetragonal phase must first be nucleated to initiate the phase transformation and it is clear that the nucleation event in Fig 3 is associated with the twin planes, which correspond to a relatively higher free energy starting point as compared to the interior of an untwinned monoclinic domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, Supplementary Fig 2 provides another example of nucleation of the tetragonal phase in close proximity to a coherent twin boundary at the bottom end of a particle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both of these images permit examination of discrete nucleation events and the identification of the nucleation sites, which would otherwise not be possible in extended solids with a large free volume available for nucleating phase transformations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While nucleation phenomena have not been extensively studied in these systems, examination of the displacive monoclinic to tetragonal phase transition of a related binary oxide, VO2, suggests a pronounced hysteresis between the forward and reverse transitions since the forward monoclinictetragonal transition can readily be nucleated at M1/M2 (two distinct monoclinic polymorphs) phase boundaries and at twin boundaries, whereas the reverse tetragonalmonoclinic transition has to be nucleated at point defects in the absence of high-energy twin planes36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even within these systems, nucleation phenomena have been surmised from the behaviour of strained and defective materials and direct observation remains elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these materials, dimensional confinement reduces the volume density of point defects and thus results in kinetic stabilization of high-temperature phases38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Close inspection of the FFT in Fig 4 shows close to overlapping pairs of monoclinic (green) and tetragonal (red) spots, indicating sets of parallel planes with similar d-spacings from the two phases, suggesting likely candidates for the monoclinictetragonal phase boundary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One such pair are {011}t/{111}m, which forms the lower bounding interface of the larger of the two tetragonal regions, presumably at the location of a transformation dislocation39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementary Fig 4 highlights the growth of this tetragonal domain during the annealing process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the dislocation migrates, the {011}t/{111}m phase boundary (highlighted in blue) grows (from 0 to 840 s), until it changes orientation over the period of 840 to 1320, s. An atomistic model of the {011}t/{111}m interface (Supplementary Fig 5) illustrates that this boundary is coherent, consistent with a model of migrating transformation dislocation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Considering Fig 3ad, a clear faceted crystallographic relationship is observable across the phase boundary (monoclinic in green and tetragonal in red) with (111) and (111)* planes of the monoclinic phase interfaced with (011) planes of the tetragonal phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incipient tetragonal domain advances simultaneously across two distinct twin boundaries that are separated by three lattice planes, eliminating the boundaries in the process since the higher symmetry of the tetragonal phase does not permit twinning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The energetic costs for propagation of the tetragonal phase and for having a phase boundary are thus clearly offset in part by elimination of the interfacial energy at the twinned interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the propagation of the tetragonal phase occurs one discrete lattice plane at a time (contrasting Fig 3c,d,f) with conservation of a one-to-one lattice correspondence across the phase boundary (illustrated in Supplementary Fig 5); the conservative motion and lattice correspondence suggest that deformation is induced via a transformation dislocation39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By Fig 3h, the twin planes have been eliminated and conservative motion of this domain can no longer be continued without a change of lattice plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strain resulting from partial deformation of the lattice likely contributes to further nucleation events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An evaluation of the energetics of the phase transformation', 'Figure 3 indicates that the transition temperature is depressed by over 1000 °C as compared to the bulk and exhibits kinetics that are strongly atypical for a displacive transition, suggesting a pronounced modification of both thermodynamic stabilities and activation barriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the former, the change in free energy (G) across the MT transformation can be written as', '', 'where  and  values are the chemical free energies of the monoclinic and tetragonal phases (dependent on temperature), respectively; the  and  values are the strain energies for the monoclinic and tetragonal phases, and the  and  values are the surface free energies for the monoclinic and tetragonal phases41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculated temperature dependencies for the bulk free energy, enthalpy, entropy and specific heat capacity, as determined from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, are shown in Supplementary Fig 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the transition temperature, thermodynamics requires .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a temperature of 600 °C, the chemical free energy difference,  for the MT transformation is expected to be strongly positive and as per the energetics of the bulk phase diagram (Supplementary Fig 6), the monoclinic phase ought to remain stable in preference to the tetragonal phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that the differentials in strain energy and surface free energy underpin the observed strong depression of the transition temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementary Fig 7 identifies the surface planes stabilized for the monoclinic and tetragonal phases of HfO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the exception of a few planes in immediate proximity of the twin planes, the side surfaces of monoclinic HfO2 are {110} planes with {001} planes binding the ends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to these planes, transformation to the tetragonal phase further exposes {010}, {101} and {112} planes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DFT calculations of surface energies by Ramprasad and co-workers19 suggest that the surface energies of {110} and {001} planes are substantially higher for the monoclinic phase (1.38 and 1.51 J m2, respectively) as compared to the values for the tetragonal phase (1.08 and 1.21 J m2, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, as also observed for ZrO2 (refs 9, 42), the tetragonal phase of HfO2 has a substantially lower surface energy and thus .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This term is furthermore expected to be

gs=AM/AT the ratio of the interfacial surface areas with the subscripts denoting the values for the monoclinic and tetragonal polymorphs41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly Equations (1) and (2) together predict that the transition temperature will be directly proportional to the diameter of the particle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ramprasad and co-workers have predicted extended phase stabilities of the tetragonal phase at finite dimensions as indeed observed here and for ultra-small nanocrystals wherein the tetragonal phase can be stabilized at room temperature9,19 based on surface energy considerations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While such surface energy effects have been noted for other systems as well42, the effect of twinning is no less important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plastic deformation that induces the twin planes shown in Fig 2 partially alleviates the strain induced upon deformation of a tetragonal particle (the TM transition) during synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result of the energy stored in these deformations that can in turn be dissipated during the MT transformation, the differential in strain energy  further contributes to driving down the transition temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lange41 has developed a size-dependent expression for the energy of the twin surface per unit volume that equates to  where twin is the twinning energy per unit area, D is the particle diameter and gtwin is a dimensionless quantity that can be expressed as , where Atwin is the total area of the twin boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 5 plots the energy landscape and activation

Supplementary Fig 2 both suggest that these regions serve as the nucleation sites for initiating the phase transformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, the high local density of twins and the small

a monoclinic hafnia phase, the HfO bonds in the nanorods are seen to distort, and the nanorod then proceeds to lose oxygen, reducing abruptly to hafnium metal at 530 °C, as evidenced by electron

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The reduction of HfO2 to hafnium metal is likely driven by the high vacuum, low oxygen partial pressure of the STEM column, which is in the 1081010 Torr range during operation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although beam damage of the rod cannot be completely ruled out, the zero valent hafnium metal phase may well be the thermodynamically stable phase for crystals of this reduced size (note that the transformation yields tetragonal crystallites that are further reduced in size as compared to the monoclinic nanorod) and under low oxygen fugacities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would be in line with the work by Navrotsky42 and others, showing that phase diagrams constructed for binary transition metal oxides, as a function of both crystal size and low oxygen pressure, typically enter a small-size regime at low pressure in which the metallic phase is more stable than one or more of the binary oxide phases, which under these conditions are now only metastable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an alternative mechanism, for an analogous MT transition in VO2, Wu and colleagues37 have suggested that while as observed here, nanometre-sized twin walls can nucleate the MT transition, the absence of twinning in the T phase requires that the reverse transition be nucleated at point defects, which are greatly reduced upon dimensional reduction to ultra-small volumes, resulting in substantial supercooling of the high-temperature phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large activation energy for nucleation of the M phase upon elimination of twin boundaries may under conditions of low oxygen fugacity result in preferential stabilization of metallic Hf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using in situ heating techniques in the STEM, we observed a series of phase transformations within an individual hafnium dioxide nanorod, in real time and with atomic resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phase transition appears to be nucleated at a twin boundary and proceeds through stabilization of discrete domains within the nanorods providing direct evidence that such twin boundaries mediate monoclinictetragonal transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduced transition temperature can be attributed to particle size not just as a result of surface free energy considerations but also in terms of energy dissipation facilitated by twin variants that span the width of the nanowires and that are also engendered as a result of dimensional confinement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, rather than the expected martensitic, athermal, transformation, our nanorod underwent a typical nucleation and growth process, to transform from monoclinic to tetragonal hafnia, suggesting that at sufficiently small crystal sizes it may be possible to stabilize phases via kinetic trapping, that in the bulk may not be possible to quench.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The propagation of a transformation dislocation one lattice plane at a time (with retention of lattice correspondence across the monoclinic/tetragonal phase boundary) seems to underpin the slow growth of the tetragonal domains allowing for a direct link between atomic resolution imaging and kinetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On slow cooling the crystal reduces to hafnium metallikely its thermodynamically stable ground state, due to small crystal size and low oxygen fugacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The profound fundamental dependence of the phase diagram of this simple binary material upon crystallite size, illustrated by our real-time atomistic study, has wide implications for devising mechanism-informed means for the study and prediction of nanomaterial stability and for the stabilization of metastable structures that are inaccessible in the bulk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, stabilization of phase-pure tetragonal HfO2 below a threshold size of 3.6 nm from direct synthesis based on severe retardation of condensation kinetics suggests that at substantially smaller dimensions strain and size can allow for trapping of this phase9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work will focus on quenching studies under higher oxygen fugacity (as such measurements become technologically feasible), and an investigation of the transient orthorhombic phase, which is known to be of interest due to its polarity19.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Nanorod synthesis', 'Hafnium(IV) chloride and tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) were purchased from Strem and used without any further purification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hafnium(IV) tert-butoxide was purchased from Alfa Aesar and used as received.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To synthesize the HfO2 nanorods equimolar amounts of HfCl4 and Hf(OtBut)4 were mixed with ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10 g of TOPO in a three-neck round bottom flask within an Ar ambient glovebox.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction mixture was then transferred and heated under an Ar ambient Schlenk line to ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  60 °C upon which the TOPO melted and stirring was initiated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, the reaction mixture was heated to 340 °C and held at temperature for 2 h. Finally, the reaction mixture was cooled to ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  60 °C and a solvent/non-solvent washing of acetone and hexanes was performed to remove excess TOPO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In situ STEM', 'STEM images were acquired using a Nion UltraSTEM 200 microscope (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) operated at 200 kV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conventional imaging was performed to characterize the growth

the STEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each frame selected, an FFT was acquired in Digital Micrograph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify the phases present in each region of the nanorod, analysis of the FFTs was performed for each frame of the movie, as depicted in Figs 3 and 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis consisted of (1) identifying the component patterns which make up the FFT, (2) indexing and thereby identifying each component and (3) masking each component in the FFT in turn, and performing an IFFT to regenerate only those regions of the rod comprising that component (as further illustrated in Supplementary Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementary Figs 1012 and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 aid in demonstrating how the FFT patterns were identified and indexed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IFFTs were
