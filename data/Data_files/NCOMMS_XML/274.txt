MICU1 regulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake dictates survival and tissue regeneration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake through the recently discovered Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter (MCU) is controlled by its gatekeeper Mitochondrial Calcium Uptake 1 (MICU1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the physiological and pathological role of MICU1 remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that MICU1 is vital for adaptation to postnatal life and for tissue repair after injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MICU1 knockout is perinatally lethal in mice without causing gross anatomical defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy as a physiological stress response model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon MICU1 loss, early priming is unaffected, but the pro-inflammatory phase does not resolve and liver regeneration fails, with impaired cell cycle entry and extensive necrosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ca2+ overload-induced mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) opening is accelerated in MICU1-deficient hepatocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PTP inhibition prevents necrosis and rescues regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our study identifies an unanticipated dependence of liver regeneration on MICU1 and highlights the importance of regulating MCU under stress conditions when the risk of Ca2+ overload is elevated.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake relays cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals to the mitochondrial matrix to control vital functions like ATP production but can also overload mitochondria with Ca2+ to promote cell death1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake needs to be tightly regulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ca2+ uptake through the outer membrane occurs through the voltage-dependent anion selective channel (VDACs) and across the inner membrane is mediated by a long sought channel, the uniporter3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, essential components of the uniporter have been identified, including the pore-forming subunit, Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter (MCU)5,6,7 and its Ca2+-sensing regulators, MICU1 (refs 8, 9, 10, 11) and MICU2 (refs 12, 13, 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More precisely, MICU1 has been demonstrated to be a gatekeeper, which is required to close MCU at low cytoplasmic Ca2+ (Ca2+c) and facilitates its activation at high Ca2+c (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, a loss-of-function mutation of MICU1 has been recently linked to human disease through alterations in mitochondrial Ca2+ handling15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake regulation by MICU1 has been well studied in cell culture models8,9,12,13, its physiological and pathological role remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previously, MCU was ablated in whole-body knockout mice, which died at around e11.513.5 days on a C57BL/6 background and were viable when maintained on a mixed background16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the latter model, and also in cardiac-specific conditional MCU knockout mice17,18, basal organ functions were maintained and impairments were observed only in the physiological adaptation of skeletal muscle to exercise16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the conditional MCU-deficient heart displayed increased resistance to ischaemia-reperfusion injury17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although, the currently available results do not provide a coherent picture on the physiological relevance of MCU, at least some laboratory mouse strains seem to be able to cope with the loss of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and show functional impairment only when adaptation is needed to meet an abrupt increase in tissue energy needs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, MCU-mediated Ca2+ uptake appears to play a pathophysiological role in ischaemia-reperfusion-induced tissue injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is of interest to determine the in vivo role of MICU1, which in cultured cells can both suppress and enhance MCU-mediated Ca2+ uptake dependent on Ca2+c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, the liver is an organ of particular interest because Ca2+c signals are central to stimulation of metabolism as well as for stress responses, and both decoding of Ca2+c oscillations by mitochondria and protection of mitochondria from calcium overload depend on MICU1 in isolated hepatocytes8,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we find that whole-body knockout of MICU1 is lethal in the first hours after birth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, embryos antepartum are at the expected Mendelian ratio but MICU1/ pups display failure of basic vital functions after birth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further evaluate the role of MICU1 in vivo in a physiological stress response model, liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy (PHx) was studied in mice with a liver-specific MICU1 deletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that MICU1 is required for liver regeneration as MICU1 loss leads to an enhanced and sustained pro-inflammatory response post PHx with a failure of hepatocytes to enter the cell cycle and large-scale hepatic necrosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that Ca2+ overload-induced mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) opening is sensitized in MICU1-deficient hepatocytes and that PTP inhibition is sufficient to rescue liver regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our data in MICU1-deficient mice reveal that the tight Ca2+-dependent control of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is essential for survival under acute stress conditions and to allow a well-integrated tissue repair response, thus highlighting the critical role of MICU1 in physiological and pathological conditions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

#@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements of the ruthenium red-sensitive clearance of Ca2+ added to the cytoplasmic buffer in permeabilized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) showed that at low cytoplasmic calcium

better understand the physiological role of MICU1, we accomplished a sustained deletion of MICU1 specifically in MICU1loxP/loxP mouse liver through tail-vein injection of AAV8-Cre under a hepatocyte-specific promoter (thyroxine-binding globulin, TBG), leading to hepatocyte-specific MICU1 KD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three weeks post injection, MICU1 KD was confirmed at both mRNA (98%) and protein level (94%) in isolated hepatocytes and whole liver tissue (Supplementary Figs 2a and 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hepatocyte specificity of MICU1 downregulation was confirmed by no changes in MICU1 mRNA and/or protein level in other organs as well as in the blood (Supplementary Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MCU expression was unchanged, and MICU2 showed a small decrease only in whole liver (Supplementary Figs 2a and 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Permeabilized KD hepatocytes showed a lower threshold and decreased cooperativity of Ca2+-dependent activation of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake compared with control (Ctrl) cells (AAV8-TBG-Null; Supplementary Fig 2be).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, MICU1 KD hepatocytes had a similar mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake phenotype as MICU1/ MEFs and MICU1-silenced HeLa cells8,9,12,13, confirming the AAV8-Cre-treated MICU1loxP/loxP mouse as a robust in vivo model of acute hepatocyte-specific MICU1 downregulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite alterations in mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in hepatocytes from liver-specific MICU1 KD mice, no gross functional, morphological and/or histological differences were apparent between Ctrl and KD livers (Fig 2a, LL, Supplementary Fig

model22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Liver regeneration after PHx is a unique tissue repair response that induces a synchronized replication of differentiated hepatocytes in the remnant liver, while maintaining liver-specific functions23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PHx initiates regeneration through multiple stress signals that induce growth factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines that drive quiescent hepatocytes into the cell cycle to replicate within 3048 h after surgery, with liver mass recovery within 23 weeks (in rodents)24,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ signals may contribute to the onset and early progression of regeneration27,28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that aberrant Ca2+ signalling in MICU1 KD mice could delay or inhibit regeneration after PHx.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to Ctrl mice, KD mice subjected to PHx were lethargic and unresponsive by 30 h after surgery and at the time when DNA synthesis began in Ctrl mice; their obvious severe distress prevented us from extending the study to later time points for ethical reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histological examination of remnant livers from KD mice showed extensive necrotic foci, with non-necrotic areas of the tissue showing severe microvesicular steatosis, characterized by minute and diffuse fat droplets that do not distort or displace the nucleus (Fig 2a and Supplementary Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extensive liver damage and impaired function were evident by dramatically increased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin (total and direct).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissue

incorporation, was significant in Ctrl mice 30 h post PHx, but was completely absent in remnant livers from KD mice (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This correlated with a total lack of Cyclin D1 expression, 30 h post PHx, in KD liver lysates, compared with its robust expression in Ctrl mice (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assessment of the type of cell death suggested a predominant involvement of necrosis rather than apoptosis, as no changes in Bax (Supplementary Fig 5c) and cytochrome c content (Supplementary Fig 5e) in isolated mitochondria were observed and no cleaved Caspase-3 (Supplementary Fig 5c) was evident, whereas poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage, a non-specific cell death marker, was increased in KD liver tissue lysate 30 h post PHx (Supplementary Fig 5d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No differences in tissue histology, serum liver damage markers, Cyclin D1 or other cell cycle markers were detected at 30 h after sham surgery (Fig 2bd and Supplementary Fig 5e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the absence of MICU1 causes complete failure of liver regeneration, with suppression of hepatocyte proliferation and massive necrosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Sustained pro-inflammatory response post PHx in MICU1-KD', 'To elucidate how MICU1 ablation interfered with hepatocyte proliferation, we evaluated signalling events associated with the early phase of regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These events are characterized by expression of immediate-early genes and activation of stress response signals, followed by release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-, interleukin (IL)-6) that drive growth factor production and help transition hepatocytes into the cell cycle24,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the early response after PHx was largely unaffected in MICU1 KD mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cellular homolog of FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene (cFOS) and cellular homolog of the viral oncoprotein v-jun (cJUN) upregulation, and JNK activation were not significantly different between Ctrl and KD livers at 1 h (Supplementary Fig 4c), although a transient hyperactivation/phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in the KD liver was noted at 1 h (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several recent studies have reported that phospho-CREB activation downstream of IL-6 or other mediators contributes to the pro-inflammatory environment in the early regenerative response to PHx30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression changes of stress-response and proliferation-related genes were not significantly different in Ctrl and KD mice by 1 h post PHx (Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, by 6 h post PHx, downregulation of Rho-b, Myc and Ccl2, and upregulation of Pim1, at levels usually seen after a massive hepatectomy ( greater than 80%), and S100a8 were apparent in KD livers relative to Ctrl (Fig 3b and Supplementary Fig 4b) and levels of ALT and bilirubin showed early signs of liver damage and functional impairment in KD mice (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, some necrotic foci were observed by histology in KD remnant liver as early as 6 h post PHx but not in the Ctrl (Supplementary Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, serum IL-6 was elevated in KD mice compared with Ctrl by 6 h post PHx, together with increases in tissue TNF-, phospho-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and nuclear factor-B activity (Fig 3a,c), indicating a more elevated pro-inflammatory response in KD mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, KD mice failed to mount an effective transition to the replication-competent state in response to pro-inflammatory signals after injury, resulting in more sustained inflammation and unresolved tissue damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A role for mitochondrial regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis in

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this study, we have determined the pathophysiological consequences of MICU1 deletion in mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differently from MCU loss16, MICU1 deletion validated by genetic, biochemical and Ca2+ transport measurements did not interfere with embryonic development on C57BL/6J background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, every MICU1 KO pup died after birth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although most of the organs showed normal morphology and histology, several signs, including uninflated lungs, fewer neurons in the brainstem and prolonged gasping indicated that respiratory activity/control might be affected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenotype also shares some commonality with the neuronal and muscular impairments displayed by the patients harbouring MICU1 loss-of-function mutations15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The present work and some previous studies by us8,34 and others9,15 indicate that loss of MICU1 can impair bioenergetics and cell function both by enhancing mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake at resting Ca2+c or during prolonged Ca2+c elevations, and by decreasing mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake during Ca2+c spikes and oscillations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several lines of evidence link mitochondrial Ca2+ overload to neuronal dysfunction35,36, and this study shows that upon hepatocyte-specific MICU1 deletion, the liver failure caused by tissue injury is mediated by mitochondrial Ca2+ overload.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these reasons, we propose that the impaired adaptation to extra-uterine life is likely due to altered mitochondrial Ca2+ handling with an overload component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recent observations on the MCU-deficient mouse phenotype and the present findings on the MICU1/ mice converge to support the notion that increased Ca2+ flux through the uniporter fuels an important pathogenic pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The dramatic failure of liver repair after PHx in the MICU1-deficient mice demonstrates this pathogenic potential of deregulated mitochondrial Ca2+ and points to an unexpected sensitivity of the regenerating liver to calcium overload.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite a large number of gene ablation studies in the context of liver regeneration it is unusual for these to result in massive liver necrosis as reported here, as liver regeneration can often be compensated by eliciting the differentiation and proliferation of progenitor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although previous studies had identified a role for Ca2+ signalling in the early response to PHx27,28, the underlying mechanism has remained poorly characterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, the initial priming response to PHx was largely unaffected by the MICU1 defect in hepatocytes, but the onset of the cell cycle appeared to be suppressed, coinciding with evidence of a persistent pro-inflammatory state with the onset of patchy necrosis at 6 h after surgery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were unable to detect significant changes in the Ca2+ content of mitochondria isolated from the remnant liver, presumably due to a lack of Ca2+ retention during the isolation procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the complete protection against PHx-induced liver failure in MICU1 KD mice afforded by NIM811 treatment clearly points to PTP opening because of mitochondrial calcium overload as the cause of tissue injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is interesting to note the observation of enhanced hepatocyte proliferation at 30 h after PHx in NIM811-treated MICU1 KD mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Possible reasons for this effect remain to be established and our data do not allow us to assess whether it is due to enhanced mitochondrial functions under conditions of calcium overload or to changes in cytosolic or nuclear Ca2+ signalling processes that drive regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of MICU1 could lead to a suppressed Ca2+c response when mitochondria are protected from calcium overload, with potentially decreased activation of calcineurin, resulting in an enhanced or more sustained increase in protein phosphorylation in the early phase of regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We cannot exclude the possibility that NIM811 may act on other targets that affect cell proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, NIM811 has been shown not to exert inhibitory effects on calcineurin32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we show that MICU1 helps maintain mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis in liver and other tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following PHx-induced surgical stress, MICU1 is required for protection against mitochondrial calcium overload in order to allow liver regeneration to proceed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of MICU1, Ca2+-dependent activation of the PTP occurs and the ensuing cell death would augment the pro-inflammatory phase and impair this transition (see schematic in Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, how elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ promotes the transition of primed hepatocytes to the proliferative state and whether mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake itself is required for this transition or serves a bystander role is open to debate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MCU deletion in mice either was embryonic lethal or showed a mild muscle phenotype dependent on the genetic background16,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the physiological relevance of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake needs to be further tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study of the MICU1-deficient mice reveals that the tight Ca2+-dependent regulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is essential for survival under acute stress conditions and to allow a well-integrated tissue repair response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, alterations in MICU1 activity can play a critical role in pathological conditions where mitochondrial control of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis is required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Loss of control over mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake turns regeneration signals to death signals in MICU1-deficient hepatocytes.Partial hepatectomy, a surgical model for extensive tissue injury/loss in the liver, reprogrammes the fully differentiated hepatocytes in the remnant liver to proliferate in order to regenerate liver parenchyma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reprogramming involves the synchronized priming of hepatocytes by growth factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines to obtain replicative competence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mediators engage a broad range of intracellular signals, including Ca2+, which in addition to driving cytosolic effectors, can propagate to the mitochondrial matrix and control metabolic enzyme activities to support the proliferative response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is mediated by the Ca2+-gated mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ca2+ gating occurs through MICU1 (yellow trapezoid), which associates with the MCU pore (grey cylinder) from the intermembrane space side to set the threshold for Ca2+ activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake occurs largely through local, high Ca2+ elevations, whereas smaller events and global Ca2+ fluctuations are repelled (left-side purple arrows).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon loss of MICU1 control over the Ca2+ uptake threshold, smaller Ca2+ elevations can activate uniporter-mediated uptake (right-side purple arrows).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ca2+ signalling events occurring after PHx can thereby lead to mitochondrial Ca2+ overload to enhance permeability transition pore (PTP) opening and switch the cells fate from proliferation to a death track.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large-scale hepatocyte death will overwhelm the functional capacity of the remaining liver cells resulting in organ failure (dashed arrow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pharmacological inhibition of the PTP by NIM811 rescues mitochondrial competence to support proliferation even under the higher Ca2+ load in MICU1-ablated cells (thick blue arrow), which may provide the stimulus for accelerated cell proliferation under these conditions.Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
