Gate-controlled conductance switching in DNA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Extensive evidence has shown that long-range charge transport can occur along double helical DNA, but active control (switching) of single-DNA conductance with an external field has not yet been demonstrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate conductance switching in DNA by replacing a DNA base with a redox group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By applying an electrochemical (EC) gate voltage to the molecule, we switch the redox group between the oxidized and reduced states, leading to reversible switching of the DNA conductance between two discrete levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further show that monitoring the individual conductance switching allows the study of redox reaction kinetics and thermodynamics at single molecular level using DNA as a probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our theoretical calculations suggest that the switch is due to the change in the energy level alignment of the redox states relative to the Fermi level of the electrodes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'DNA is a unique molecule not only because of its role in living systems but also due to its double helical structure with -electron stacking of the base pairs that has inspired many to explore DNA as a molecular wire1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, recent advances have made it possible to design and synthesize DNA with programmable three-dimensional nanostructures13, which have further stimulated efforts to study DNA as device building blocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extensive theoretical and experimental works have indeed established that long-range charge transport can occur along double helical DNA via the overlapping  molecular orbitals of the stacked bases1,3,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While short-range charge transport in DNA has been attributed to non-resonant tunnelling,4,7 long-range charge transport is due to hopping between DNA bases3,14,15, dominated by Guanine because its highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level is closest to the electrode Fermi level among the four DNA bases16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to further understand charge transport in DNA and to explore possible device applications, one wishes to electrically switch DNA conductance between different states with an external field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has not yet been demonstrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report a molecular switch by replacing a DNA base in double helical DNA with a redox group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By controlling the electrochemical (EC) gate voltage, we reversibly switch the DNA conductance between two discrete levels via the redox group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The population of the reduction and oxidation states follows the Nernst equation, and analysis of the conductance switching allows determination of the rate constants of the redox process at the single-molecule level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theoretical calculation shows that the conductance switching arises from a change in the molecular energy alignment associated with the redox state switching.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Structures and conductance measurements of DNA', 'To switch DNA conductance, we replaced one of the regular DNA bases with anthraquinone (Aq), a redox group that can be reversibly oxidized and reduced (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclear magnetic resonance and molecular dynamics analysis of a similar structure suggest that the Aq moiety stacks on the adjacent GC base pair, and the non-paired Guanine ring rests atop the Aq ring17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conformation is highly stable as indicated by the melting temperature increasing effect after this modification17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also allows overlapping of the anthraquinone molecular orbitals with those of the neighbouring bases, thus providing a continuous  stacking pathway along DNA for efficient charge transport (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure high stability of double-stranded DNA and high charge transport efficiency, we choose the DNA sequences that consist of GC base pairs only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a control experiment we also studied DNA without the Aq moiety.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We refer the redox modified DNA as Aq-DNA, and unmodified DNA as u-DNA (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gel electrophoresis confirmed that both Aq-DNA and u-DNA form double helical structure, and no other structures were present under the experimental conditions (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: EC gate control of

measured the DNA conductance using a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) break junction technique19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The technique used a gold tip coated with wax to minimize ionic conduction7,

current between the tip and substrate was continuously monitored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual current versus tip-substrate distance traces were recorded during the pulling process (Fig 1c) and a

conductance histogram (Fig 1d), where the peak position indicates the most probable conductance value of the DNA molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We first measured the conductance of both Aq-DNA and u-DNA without applying EC gate voltage, and found that the conductance values for Aq-DNA and u-DNA were 4.0±0.2 × 104 G0 and 14±1 × 104 G0, respectively, where G0=7.748 × 105 S, which is the conductance quantum (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values are within the conductance range of DNA reported by others using similar thiolate linker groups21,22,23, but larger than the conductance of anthraquinone-based molecular wire24,25,26,27,28 and other conjugated systems29, such as 4, 4-bipyridine30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transport mechanism in the present anthraquinone-DNA system is thermal activated hopping via anthraquinone and stacked bases, which decays with the molecular length slowly31,32 compared with anthraquinone and other tunnelling systems24,25,26,27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control experiments in the buffer solution without DNA molecules, and with single-stranded DNA terminated with two thiolate linkers (Supplementary Fig 2) shown in Fig 1b did not reveal peaks in the conductance histogram.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The observed conductance difference between Aq-DNA and u-DNA indicates that the Aq moiety was intercalated into the base pairs in DNA, as shown in literature17 (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further verify this conclusion, we performed melting temperature analysis on both Aq-DNA and u-DNA (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The melting temperature of Aq-DNA (44 °C) is much higher than that of u-DNA (32 °C), indicating that the intercalation of Aq stabilizes the ending base pairs17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the stabilization effect, Aq-DNA retains the double helical structure close to B-form structure as shown by the circular dichorism spectra of Aq-DNA and u-DNA (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Characterizations of DNA molecules.

redox state of Aq-DNA by inserting a silver electrode into the solution (Fig 1a)33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The silver electrode serves as an EC gate, and the tip and substrate serve as source and drain electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gate voltage and the source-drain bias were controlled using the standard four-electrode EC configuration with a platinum coil as an auxiliary electrode (not shown in Fig 1a) in addition to the tip, substrate and silver quasi-reference electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first characterized redox-switching properties of Aq-DNA immobilized on the gold substrate with cyclic voltammetry, a widely used EC technique that measures EC current while linearly sweeping the substrate potential back and forth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured cyclic voltammograms show a peak in the forward potential sweep, and a negative peak in the reverse potential sweep (Fig 2d), corresponding to reversible oxidation and reduction of the Aq group in Aq-DNA (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The redox potential of Aq-DNA, determined by taking the average of the oxidation and reduction peak potentials, is 0.46 V versus Ag/AgCl reference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is consistent with that reported for other anthraquinone-DNA intercalation complexes35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The separation between the oxidation and reduction peaks increases with potential sweeping rate and the peak heights increase linearly with the sweep rate (Supplementary Fig 3b,c), indicating that the Aq-DNA was immobilized on the gold substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the areas of the oxidation and reduction peaks, we determined the Aq-DNA surface coverage to be 1.48±0.03 pmolcm2, which is within the range of thiolate-modified DNA molecules on gold electrodes measured by EC methods37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This corresponds to 112 nm2 per DNA molecule, which is relative low compared with the surface coverage of a compact layer consisting of DNA aligned vertically with a small tilt angle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'After characterizing the conductance and redox property of Aq-DNA, we studied conductance switching of Aq-DNA by controlling the gate voltage (Vg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For simplicity, we quoted the gate voltage with respect to the redox potential of Aq-DNA, at which the chances of oxidation and reduction are equal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At each gate voltage, we performed repeated STM break junction measurement in a nitrogen atmosphere, and constructed a conductance histogram from thousands of (4,000) individual conductance traces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the gate voltage is well above 0 V, most Aq-DNA molecules are in the oxidation state (Fig 3d) and the conductance histogram shows a peak at 3.7±0.5 × 104 G0 (Fig 3a), which is the conductance of Aq-DNA in the oxidation state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lowering the gate voltage towards 0 V, a second peak at a higher conductance value (30±3 × 104 G0) appears (Supplementary Figs 4 and 5 and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We attribute the high conductance peak to Aq-DNA in the reduction state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high conductance peak increases in height, while the low conductance peak decreases in height with decreasing the gate voltage, which is expected as increasing number of Aq-DNA became reduced (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high and low conductance peaks reach a similar height when the gate voltage is 0.0 V, corresponding to an equal number of Aq-DNA in the reduction and oxidation states (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further decreasing the gate voltage below 0 V, the high conductance continues to increase while the low conductance peak decreases and eventually disappears (Fig 3c) as all the molecules become reduced (Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the fitting errors (Gaussian fitting) in each of the histograms at different gate voltages as the experimental errors38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The broad distribution (the width in the Gaussian fit) is an inherent property of single-molecule measurements originated from the variation in the moleculeelectrode contact coupling, and dependence of the conductance on the couplings39,40, rather than an experimental error.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This broad distribution is commonly observed for single molecular measurements of DNA15,21,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Two conductance states of Aq-DNA under gate voltages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ac) Conductance histograms of Aq-DNA

one could switch the DNA conductance between two levels by controlling the Aq redox state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aq-DNA in the reduction state is nearly an order of magnitude more conductive than that in the oxidation state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another interesting observation shown in Fig 3ac and Supplementary Figs 4 and 5 is that despite the sensitive dependence of the peak heights in the conductance histograms with the gate voltage, the peak positions change little with the gate voltage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation indicates that Aq-DNA takes two discrete conductance values that correspond to the oxidation and reduction states, and the gate voltage can only switch the conductance between the two values as Aq-DNA is either oxidized or reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The switching of conductance between two discrete levels is more clearly shown in the plot of conductance versus gate voltages in Fig 3g and Supplementary Fig 5d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies of redox molecules, including anthraquinone, typically show continuous changes of conductance with the gate voltage20,24,25,33,42,43,44,45, and redox switching of the conductance between two discrete levels has not been reported before.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We will return later to the mechanism and implication of this discrete conductance switching in Aq-DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To confirm that the gate switching is due to the Aq moiety rather than DNA, we carried out a control experiment with u-DNA, and did not observe any significant changes in the conductance histogram over the same gate voltage range (see Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A previous study of gate dependent measurement of DNA conductance also failed to detect conductance switching in regular double helical DNA46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The control experiment shows that the two-level conductance switching was originated from the redox species Aq moiety.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aq-DNA and u-DNA have different conductance values, but a similar stretching length (0.12 nm, Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stretching length is the average distance over which one can stretch a molecular junction before it becomes mechanically unstable, which is measured from the plateau length in the conductance trace as marked in Supplementary Fig 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The short stretching length observed for both Aq-DNA and u-DNA is consistent with reports in literature, which is attributed to force-induced melting of DNA47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Thermodynamic study of the redox states', 'We further analysed the gate voltage dependence of the peaks in the conductance histograms of Aq-DNA by calculating the peak areas at different gate voltage (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis allows us to determine the relative probability of Aq-DNA in the oxidation and reduction states at each gate voltage because the peak area is expected to be proportional to the number of Aq-DNA in the corresponding states49 (Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probability of oxidized Aq-DNA versus the gate voltage shows a sigmoidal dependence (black points in Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result shown in Fig 4b was obtained from the statistical analysis of single-molecule measurement, which can be compared with the cyclic voltammetry that measures a large number of DNA molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2d, the cyclic voltammetry reveals oxidation and reduction peaks, and integration of the peak areas provide the amount of charge transfer (Q).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knowing that the number of charge involved in each oxidation (reduction) event for Aq moiety is 2, we determined the percentage of the molecules in the oxidation state at different gate voltages50, and the result is plotted together with the single-molecule data from the conductance histograms in Fig 4b (see Supplementary Fig 3df for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that forward (blue curve) and reverse (magenta curve) gate sweeping curves display hysteresis, but both have the sigmoidal shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hysteresis (separation between oxidation and reduction peaks) decreases with the potential sweeping rate (Supplementary Fig 3b), indicating that the hysteresis is at least partially because the charge transfer between the electrode and Aq moiety is relatively slow compared with the sweeping rate43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data obtained from the single-molecule measurement falls in between the forward and reverse gate sweeping curves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is expected because each data point was measured by holding the gate at a fixed voltage, corresponding to an extremely slow scanning rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Thermodynamic analysis of the two-level conductance switching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Conductance histograms at different

representative Gt curves at a gate voltage of 0.000±0.005 V, each starts when the conductance is at the high conductance level, or Aq-DNA in the reduction state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The four Gt curves illustrate three types of conductance changes over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Type 1 (3040% probability): the conductance fluctuates but these changes are not large enough to be attributed to the switching of the redox state within the 0.1 s time window (black curve).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This type of small conductance fluctuations is commonly observed in single-molecule junctions, which are attributed to the atomic scale rearrangement in the moleculeelectrode contact39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Type 2 (20%): the conductance drops abruptly to the noise level, signalling the breakdown of a molecular junction (red curve).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This type is also a characteristic of single-molecule junctions, arising from the finite lifetime in the moleculeelectrode contact52,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Type 3 (4050%): the conductance switches from the high level to a lower level (blue curve), or switches back and forth between the high and low levels (magenta curve).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high level conductance is about an order of magnitude higher than the low level conductance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This two-level conductance switching is a unique feature of Aq-DNA, which measures reversible switching of the molecule between oxidation and reduction states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm this conclusion, we performed control experiment with u-DNA and did not observe Type 3 switching behaviours (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To further analyse the two-level transient conductance switching, we constructed a two-dimensional (2D) Gt histogram for Types 1 and 3 conductance curves (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2D histogram reveals two distinct bands at the high and low conductance levels, which confirms the two-level switching of the Aq-DNA redox state discussed earlier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the gate voltage is close to zero, one expects equal probabilities of finding Aq-DNA in the high and low conductance states, as expected by the Nernst equation (see Supplementary Note 2 for further discussions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 5d shows the conductance histogram at t=0.0 and 0.1 s, which indeed shows that if the molecule starts at the high conductance level (reduction state), the probabilities of high (reduction state) and low (oxidation state) conductance levels equalizes over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a similar result when the molecule starts at the low conductance level (oxidation state, Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The 2D Gt histogram shown in Fig 5c describes the evolution of the high and low conductance states over time, from which we extracted kinetic constants of redox switching at the single-molecule level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a given time, we obtained a conductance histogram like the ones plotted in Fig 5d, which shows the histogram at t=0.0 and 0.1 s. The peak area reflects the probabilities of the molecule in reduction and oxidation states at the given time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 5e plots the normalized peak area of the high conductance state (reduction state) versus time at different gate voltages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peak area decays over time with a rate that depends on the gate voltage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The more positive is the gate voltage (Vg), the faster it decays, which is expected because the probability of Aq-DNA switching from the high conductance reduction state to the low conductance oxidation state increases with the gate voltage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process can be described with a kinetic model54 that is used in EC study of DNA charge transport55,56,', '', 'where kf and kb are forward and backward rate constants, respectively, which are related by', '', 'where K is the equilibrium constant that depends on Vg according to equation (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probability of Aq-DNA remaining in the reduction state, Pt(red) can be expressed as', '', 'By fitting the decay curve at Vg=0.000±0.005 V (black curve in Fig 5e) with equation (4), we found that kf=9.8±0.3 s1 and kb =10±1 s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values are within the range of charge transfer rate constants obtained from electrochemistry study on DNA with thiolate linkers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the electron transfer rate constant of dsDNA (20 base pairs long) tethered with anthraquinone36 was shown to be 1.3±0.3 s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other electron transfer rate constants of dsDNA tethered with different redox active groups37,57,58 ranges from 1 to 100 s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The seemingly surprising low electron transfer rate and high conductance value are probably due to the two different electron transfer channels in the present hoping dominated charge transport, as shown by Agostino Migliore and Abraham Nitzans work59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One determines the redox state of Aq, which is the slow EC electron transfer rate, and the other channel dominates the conduction through the entire molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is consistent with recent works by Zhou et al.60 and by Venkatramani et al.61, both concluded that relationship between the electron transfer rate and conductance depends on the transport mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the rate constants, we obtained ox/red with equation (3), and substituting it into equation (1) leads to Vg=0.000±0.002 V, which is consistent with the actual applied gate voltage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We carried out the experiment at other gate voltages (Supplementary Fig 10) and found the fitted and actual gate voltages agree with each other (Supplementary Table 2), which further confirms the kinetic model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Theoretical calculations of the energy diagrams', 'The above analysis shows that the kinetic model developed for redox reactions can describe the observed conducting switching in Aq-DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the kinetic model cannot explain why the conductance in the reduction state is much greater than that in the oxidation state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To qualitatively understand the conductance difference between the two states, we carried out first principle calculations within density functional theory at the M06-2X/6-311+G(p,d) level of theory62,63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This functional is suitable for our energy level and electronic coupling calculations, which involve non-covalent interactions, such as  stacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We built two molecular fragments that represent the differences in our sequences, G-Aq-G:C (oxidation state) and G-H2Aq-G:C (reduction state).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both systems were built based on the fragments of 2KK5 in Protein Data Bank (PDB)17 where the Aq is located, with the DNA bases being replaced by our sequences using B-form DNA structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Circular dichorism spectra show that this is the most probable DNA helical form in our experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is widely accepted that charge transport through DNA is due to hopping through the guanine HOMO3,14,15, so we focused only on the Aq and H2Aq molecular levels that are the closest to the guanine HOMO level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our quantum mechanical calculation shows that the Aq HOMO and the H2Aq HOMO-1 levels are the closest to the guanine HOMO level (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the molecular orbitals of the Aq HOMO and H2Aq HOMO-1 have similar spatial distributions;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'To verify that the Aq-DNA is bridged between the two electrodes via the two terminal thiolate groups as shown in Fig 1a, we carried out the conductance measurement on Aq-DNA with either 3-thiol or 5-thiol modification (Supplementary Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No peaks were revealed in the conductance histograms, indicating that both thiolate groups are necessary for forming molecular junctions and the Aq-DNA is linked to the tip and substrate electrodes via the Au-S bonds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Aq moiety is located near one end of the molecule, and this end can either bind to the tip or the substrate electrodes (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since both the tip and the substrate are Au electrodes with a small potential difference ( less_than 0.1 V) controlled in the experiment, we expect similar results with either orientations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we measured currentvoltage (IV) curves and found that IV curves and 2D conductancevoltage (GV) histogram are symmetric (Supplementary Fig 12), indicating the orientation of Aq-DNA in the molecule junction does not affect the measured conductance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is consistent with the hopping model, which describes the resistance of the molecule as a sum of individual hopping steps67,68.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Charge transport in redox molecules, including anthraquinone molecules with two thiolate groups24, have been studied20,25,33,34,44,45 under EC control, where the conductance was observed to change continuously with applied potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in sharp contrast to the discrete two-level switching found in Aq-DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a redox molecule directly connected to two electrodes, its conductance is directly related to the probability of oxidation (reduction) determined by the rates of electron transfer into and out of the molecule, which changes continuously with the potential43,69.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present case, the anthraquinone is either in the reduction or oxidation state as described by the Nernst equation, which determines the Aq-DNA to be either in the low or high conductance states, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possible explanation is that the oxidized or reduced anthraquinone provides a hopping site along the entire DNA sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further explore the role of DNA in the charge transport, we carried out the gate-controlled conductance measurements on another anthraquinone-modified DNA sequence with longer length, Aq-DNA-2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar two-state conductance switching behaviour with smaller conductance values was observed (Supplementary Fig 13), which further confirms the involvement of the DNA sequence in the charge transport of Aq-DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiment also demonstrates that one can tune the conductance of the switcher by changing the DNA sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our work demonstrates one can introduce an active control to DNA conductance by modifying a base with a redox group, and switch the DNA conductance reversibly between two levels by oxidizing or reducing the redox group with an EC gate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strategy could be implemented in more sophisticated DNA nanostructures for active device building blocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the DNA conductance is an indicator of the molecule in the reduction or oxidation state, it is possible to study redox reaction kinetics at the single-molecule level by monitoring the DNA conductance.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
