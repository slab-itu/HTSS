Reciprocal genomic evolution in the antfungus agricultural symbiosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The attine antfungus agricultural symbiosis evolved over tens of millions of years, producing complex societies with industrial-scale farming analogous to that of humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we document reciprocal shifts in the genomes and transcriptomes of seven fungus-farming ant species and their fungal cultivars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that ant subsistence farming probably originated in the early Tertiary (5560 MYA), followed by further transitions to the farming of fully domesticated cultivars and leaf-cutting, both arising earlier than previously estimated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evolutionary modifications in the ants include unprecedented rates of genome-wide structural rearrangement, early loss of arginine biosynthesis and positive selection on chitinase pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modifications of fungal cultivars include loss of a key ligninase domain, changes in chitin synthesis and a reduction in carbohydrate-degrading enzymes as the ants gradually transitioned to functional herbivory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to human farming, increasing dependence on a single cultivar lineage appears to have been essential to the origin of industrial-scale ant agriculture.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Farming created advanced human civilizations in just a few thousand years1, producing a huge diversity of domesticated crops with improved nutrition, growth characteristics and yield, often through polyploidization and asexual propagation2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Industrial-scale farming, comparable to that in humans, has evolved in only two non-human organisms, the fungus-growing ants and termites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the agricultural mutualisms of ants and termites were gradually modified by natural selection over time spans orders of magnitude longer than those associated with human agriculture3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Social insect farmers cultivate fungi in subterranean gardens to produce edible proteins, lipids and carbohydrates through decomposition rather than the photosynthesis of most human crops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fungus-farming attine ants in particular have become model systems for mutualistic symbiosis research6,7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Ant farming originated in South America when a huntergatherer ancestor irreversibly committed to cultivating fungi3,5,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fungi were not truly domesticated until many millions of years later, when one cultivar became reproductively isolated from free-living relatives and began to consistently produce specialized organs (gongylidia clustered into staphylae) to feed the ants3,5,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evolution of ant agriculture is thus characterized by three major transitions: (1) the obligate commitment of ancestral attine ants to farming a variety of loosely domesticated fungal cultivars; (2) the irreversible domestication of the first higher attine fungal cultivar, which fully committed it to the mutualism and severed gene flow with free-living relatives while initiating a new adaptive radiation via bilateral coevolution; and (3) the emergence of obligate functional herbivory in the ancestral leaf-cutting ant5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The later transitions gradually led to the abandonment of the use of dead plant material as fungal substrate and increased colony sizes by orders of magnitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process was completed by the evolution of polymorphic ant worker castes with complex division of labour, genetically diverse half-sibling colonies produced by multiply-inseminated founding queens and highly productive polyploid cultivars3,5,9,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recent comparative research suggests that early attine farmers were metabolically less efficient than ant species with traditional diets, a deficiency that persisted until the subsequent transition to irreversible cultivar domestication16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, early human farmers of loosely domesticated crops had poorer health and smaller body stature compared with sympatric huntergatherers17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It seems reasonable, therefore, to expect that large-scale ant farming required a considerable accumulation of adaptive modifications, and that this process accelerated after crops became truly domesticated and no longer exchanged genes with free-living fungi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the molecular bases of the co-adaptations that facilitated this evolutionary process are virtually unknown and can only be elucidated using genomic data on ants and fungi representing all stages in the process that culminated in industrial-scale leaf-cutting agriculture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we analyse five new (Cyphomyrmex costatus, Trachymyrmex zeteki, Trachymyrmex cornetzi, Trachymyrmex septentrionalis and Atta colombica) and two existing (Acromyrmex echinatior and Atta cephalotes) attine ant genomes, representing all genus-level branches in the neoattine crown group of the phylogenetic tree, and a more basal attine ant (C. costatus), along with corresponding cultivar genomes and/or transcriptomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data allowed us to reconstruct the structural and functional genetic changes that characterize the origin and later elaborations of fungus farming and to identify reciprocal modifications in both partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that all major transitions in attine fungus farming occurred earlier than previously estimated, that attine ant evolution has involved unprecedented rates of genome rearrangements and that both ants and fungi underwent a series of coevolutionary changes in chitin-processing genes as the scale of farming increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the fungal cultivars, we document reductions in their capacity to decompose lignin and positive selection on chitin synthases.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Sequencing data and phylogenetic analyses', 'At around 300 Mb, the five newly sequenced attine ant genomes were of fairly standard size and composition compared with published attine and other ant genomes18,19,20 (Supplementary Tables 119 and Supplementary Figs 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dikaryotic fungal symbiont of the lower attine C. costatus was assembled into a draft genome with a relatively large size of ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  126 Mb (Supplementary Tables 5 and 7), whereas we obtained genome-wide transcriptomes for the cultivars of the higher attine ants as their increasing degrees of polykaryotic chimerism (functional polyploidy)14 precluded accurate genome assembly (Supplementary Table 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Phylogenies based on 2,795 and 1,075 one-to-one orthologues for the ants and their cultivars, respectively, provided four novel insights (Fig 1 and Supplementary Figs 811).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the fungal phylogeny (Fig 1, grey branches, node 2) indicates that the leucocoprineaceous cultivar clade arose simultaneously with the farming ants ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5560 million years ago (MYA, see also refs 5, 11), although this node has a considerable confidence range of 4472 MYA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, domestication of the higher attine cultivars that produce staphylae with gongylidia occurred ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30 MYA (node 3 and 4), earlier than indicated by previous studies (ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2025 MYA5,21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, the leaf-cutting ants arose ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15 MYA (node 9) rather than ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10 MYA5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourth, the single cultivar species, Leucoagaricus gongylophorus grown by Atta and Acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants, originated subsequent to the origin of its farmers (nodes 11 and 9, respectively) from a fungal lineage cultivated by Trachymyrmex ants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding confirms that leaf-cutting ants horizontally acquired a replacement cultivar after Atta and Acromyrmex had diverged (node 9)21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Time-calibrated phylogeny of attine ants and mutualistic fungal cultivars.The ant phylogeny (brown, attine ants in red brown) is genome-based, whereas the cultivar phylogeny (grey) is derived from transcriptomic data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A. cephalotes and A. colombica share the same fungal symbiont species L. gongylophorus70.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only the closest sequenced outgroup, the fire ant S. invicta, is depicted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full phylogenies including additional ant and free-living fungal outgroups are given in Supplementary Figs 811.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars (top) indicate minimum and maximum time estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The character matrix (right) summarizes key morphological, behavioural and life-history traits across the three major agricultural transitions (yellow, light green and darker green background).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximate maximum colony sizes are given as powers of 10;

thus, conditions for ant-fungus coevolution did not become unambiguously favourable until a cultivar lineage committed to genetically isolated long-term vertical transmission ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30 MYA (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This event coincided with the first use of fresh plant material as garden substrate23; thus, we compared genome-wide changes in carbohydrate-degrading potential of attine cultivars and the related free-living Agaricales fungi Coprinopsis cinerea, Agaricus bisporus, and Schizophyllum commune.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these farmed and free-living fungi, the C. costatus cultivar has the most substantial carbohydrate-degrading repertoire (Fig 3a and Supplementary Data 1), consistent with the recruitment of highly versatile decomposers by early farming ants once they became obligately dependent on their fungus gardens to convert dead plant material into food.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the number of carbohydrate-degrading enzymes in truly domesticated, staphylae-producing cultivars is consistently reduced (binomial test, P less_than 0.0014) across three of the six CAZy classes (encoding auxiliary activities, carbohydrate esterases and glycoside hydrolases; Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clustering analysis confirmed that the C. costatus cultivar and the free-living fungi have similar CAZy profiles, and that fully domesticated cultivars share a distinctly different biodegradation potential (Fig 3b and Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Evolutionary changes in carbohydrate-degrading potential of attine fungal cultivars.The carbohydrate-degrading potential of attine cultivars is compared with free-living outgroups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparisons are based on genomic (G) or transcriptomic (T) gene counts, both of which were obtained independently for C. costatus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Percentage of all annotated genes in the main CAZy classes: AA, auxiliary activities;

likelihood ratio test (LRT), P less_than 0.05; Supplementary Tables 2628 and Supplementary Data 2), consistent with early adaptation to fungivory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The positively selected sites (nine in the -hexosaminidase and four in the chitinase) are mostly located on the protein surfaces (Supplementary Figs 17 and 18) and their messenger RNAs are highly expressed in the ant labial glands (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inferred isoelectric points of the proteins match earlier direct measurements27 and are significantly higher than those of orthologous proteins in non-farming myrmicine ants (Fig 4c;

Supplementary Data 2), indicating modification of chitinaceous cell wall components, and the -1,6-mannosidase domain (IPR005198) in fully domesticated attine cultivars is completely lost (Supplementary Table 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of function of this enzyme leads to enhanced chitin synthesis and cell walls of increased thickness in ascomycete fungi29, suggesting that the increased volumes and masses of higher attine ant gardens may be enabled by fortified cell walls27,30.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The results of our study shed considerable new light on the evolution of ant agriculture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, based on the most probable divergence-date estimate, fungus farming may have originated shortly after the Yucatan impact that caused the major Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction 65 MYA and before the early Eocene climatic optimum 5055 MYA (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, farming probably became irreversible when the ants lost the arginine biosynthesis pathway, relying instead on predictably present symbionts to supply this amino acid (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, despite the evolution of modified chitin-processing genes that facilitated the digestion of fungal food (Fig 4), early attine lineages remained constrained to rearing small, slow-growing gardens until a single cultivar became irreversibly domesticated ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30 MY after the origin of subsistence agriculture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourth, genetic isolation of this cultivar promoted coevolution with the farmers, producing not only specialized ant-feeding organs and six new genus-level lineages of ant farmers but also more massive fungus gardens and a gradual shift in decomposition profile towards active functional herbivory, ultimately resulting in the loss of an ancestral ligninase domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the genomes and transcriptomes that this study adds to the public domain span the main evolutionary transitions across ant fungus farming, we expect future research to clarify additional symbiotic adaptations associated with transitions from simpler to more elaborate levels of fungus farming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our confirmation of the secondary acquisition of the ancestor of extant L. gongylophorus  less_than 10 MYA ((ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21); this study) strongly suggests that crop innovation was critical to the establishment of industrial-scale agriculture in Atta and, to a lesser extent, in Acromyrmex (Fig 1), even though we found relatively little evidence for substantial genome- or transcriptome-wide changes in the ancestral lineages that gave rise to the leaf-cutting ants and L. gongylophorus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that the main factor underlying the ecological dominance of the leaf-cutting ants may have been that this novel cultivar was a genetically chimeric polyploid14, a trait that commonly characterizes modern asexually propagated human-domesticated plants, but that is highly unusual for fungi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It thus emerges that the journeys of both ants and humans towards industrial-scale agriculture included long prior histories of subsistence farming that preceded specialization on genetically isolated crop varieties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, although ant agriculture continued as a mutualistic symbiosis characterized by gradual reciprocal modifications and a single superior cultivar lineage with little genetic variation across the clones maintained by sympatric colonies, human agriculture proceeded by cultural evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Artificial selection by humans drove much faster domestication rates in a multitude of diverse cultivars2,17 accompanied by, at least so far, relatively modest reciprocal modifications of our genomes31.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
