An extra-uterine system to physiologically support the extreme premature lamb  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In the developed world, extreme prematurity is the leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity due to a combination of organ immaturity and iatrogenic injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Until now, efforts to extend gestation using extracorporeal systems have achieved limited success.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the development of a system that incorporates a pumpless oxygenator circuit connected to the fetus of a lamb via an umbilical cord interface that is maintained within a closed amniotic fluid circuit that closely reproduces the environment of the womb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that fetal lambs that are developmentally equivalent to the extreme premature human infant can be physiologically supported in this extra-uterine device for up to 4 weeks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lambs on support maintain stable haemodynamics, have normal blood gas and oxygenation parameters and maintain patency of the fetal circulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With appropriate nutritional support, lambs on the system demonstrate normal somatic growth, lung maturation and brain growth and myelination.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In the United States, extreme prematurity is the leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality, with over one-third of all infant deaths and one-half of cerebral palsy attributed to prematurity1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Advances in neonatal intensive care have improved survival and pushed the limits of viability to 22 to 23 weeks of gestation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, survival has been achieved with high associated rates of chronic lung disease and other complications of organ immaturity, particularly in infants born before 28 weeks1,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, with earlier limits of viability, there are actually more total patients with severe complications of prematurity than there were a decade ago4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Respiratory failure represents the most common and challenging problem, as gas exchange in critically preterm neonates is impaired by structural and functional immaturity of the lungs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This condition, known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, is now understood to be related to an arrest in lung development secondary to premature transition from liquid to gas ventilation, explaining why even minimally invasive modes of neonatal ventilation have not reduced the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is clearly an urgent need for a more physiologic approach to support the extreme premature infant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The concept of extracorporeal support of the fetus is appealing due to the analogy with innate fetal physiology, in which extracorporeal gas exchange is maintained by the placenta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the development of an artificial placenta has been the subject of investigation for over 50 years6,7, with only limited success.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primary obstacles have been progressive circulatory failure due to preload or afterload imbalance imposed on the fetal heart by oxygenator resistance and pump-supported circuits, the use of open fluid incubators resulting in contamination and fetal sepsis and problems related to umbilical vascular access resulting in vascular spasm6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address these obstacles we have designed a system consisting of three main components, specifically, a pumpless arteriovenous circuit, a closed fluid environment with continuous fluid exchange and a new technique of umbilical vascular access.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate that extreme premature fetal lambs can be consistently supported in an extracorporeal device for up to 4 weeks without apparent physiologic derangement or organ failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are superior to all previous attempts at extracorporeal support of the extreme premature fetus in both duration and physiologic well-being16,17.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Pilot studies', 'A series of pilot studies leading to our final device were performed that identified potential obstacles and allowed sequential design modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All pilot studies utilized the pumpless arterialvenous (AV) circuit described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primary design modifications were related to the fluid environment and our approach to vascular access.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A consistent observation throughout our pilot studies was the haemodynamic stability and efficient gas exchange achieved by the pumpless AV circuit over a wide range of circuit flows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial series of experiments were performed in late gestational lambs (125140 days of gestation; term=145 days) and utilized an open fluid bath with continuous recirculation of an electrolyte solution (designed to mimic amniotic fluid) through micropore filters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid the potential for umbilical venous spasm we utilized the carotid artery (CA) and jugular vein (JV) for vascular access (Table 1, open CA/JV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies lasted 23 to 108 h but were limited by sepsis and cannula-related complications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This led to our second design that included a semi-closed fluid bath with continuous exchange of amniotic fluid, rather than recirculation (Table 1, semi-closed CA/JV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the improved incubator, five experimental animals with CA/JV cannulation (ranging in age from 120 to 125 days of gestation) were maintained on the system for 346.6±93.5 h, a marked improvement over the original design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, one animal was maintained on the circuit for 288 h (120132 days of gestation) and was successfully weaned to spontaneous respiration, with long-term survival confirming that animals can be transitioned to normal postnatal life after prolonged extra-uterine support.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, sepsis remained limiting in 3 of 5 lambs resulting in design of a closed fluid circuit (the Biobag).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With introduction of the Biobag, pilot studies were performed with the aim to apply our system to earlier gestational fetuses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the perspective of lung development, lambs at 100 115 days of gestation are in the mid to late canalicular phase of lung development18, which is the biological equivalent of the 2224-week gestation premature human infant19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in 110-day gestational age (GA) lambs with CA/JV cannulation, diminishing circuit flows and progressive oedema developed within the first few days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low circuit flows were due to reduced perfusion pressures across the oxygenator owing to lower mean arterial pressure in earlier GA lambs combined with elevated right-sided venous pressures in the 110-day GA CA/JV animals relative to published in utero controls (inferior vena cava pressures 9.6±2 mm Hg versus 4±2 mm Hg, respectively)20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To offload the right atrium, we opted to utilize the umbilical vein (UV) for venous inflow to mimic normal fetal umbilical venous return and improve streaming of oxygenated blood across the foramen ovale20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid umbilical venous spasm23,24,25, we advanced the umbilical venous cannula to a position with the tip just inside the abdominal fascia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CA/UV cannulation resulted in the stable support of five 106113-day GA lambs for 13 to 26 days in the Biobag (Table 1, Biobag, CA/UV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All five lambs demonstrated long-term haemodynamic stability and stable circuit flows and oxygenation parameters (CA/UV group in Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, flow to the oxygenator in CA/UV lambs was well below the normal physiologic flow to the placenta (70120 versus 150200 ml kg1 min1)26,27,28, primarily due to the inherently small-caliber carotid artery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The limiting problem of carotid vascular inflow led to the development of our final device to achieve physiologic fetal support (Fig 1 and Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three components of the system are described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Overview of experimental

image', 'A pumpless arteriovenous circuit', 'From the inception of the study, we reasoned that a pumpless circuitin which blood flow is driven exclusively by the fetal heartcombined with a very low resistance oxygenator would most closely mimic the normal fetal/placental circulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most of our studies we utilized a small-volume, near-zero-resistance oxygenator and short segments of circuit tubing to minimize surface area and priming volumes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This system is comparable to the volume of the placenta itselfthe reported placental blood volume of the sheep is 23.1 to 48.1 ml per kg29, and most of the studies in this report utilized the Quadrox-ID Pediatric oxygenator (Maquet Quadrox-ID Pediatric Oxygenator: Maquet Cardiopulmonary AG, Rastatt, Germany) that has a priming volume of 81 ml.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, with smaller lambs (0.5 to 1 kg) we have utilized a modified Quadrox Neonatal oxygenator (Maquet Quadrox-I Neonatal and Pediatric Oxygenator: Maquet Cardiopulmonary AG) with a priming volume of 38 ml.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our circuit priming volumes for 1 to 3 kg lambs are within the normal placental blood volume range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Throughout the development of our device, with the exception of our earlier gestational CA/JV animals described above, all animals demonstrated complete haemodynamic stability, without need for vasopressors or evidence of progressive acidosis or circulatory failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A closed sterile fluid environment', 'To further address issues of sterility, size adaptability and efficiencies of space and fluid volume, a Biobag design was developeda single-use, completely closed system that minimizes amniotic fluid volumes and can be customized to more closely replicate the size and shape of the uterus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Biobag consists of polyethylene film that is translucent, sonolucent and flexible to permit monitoring, scanning and manipulation of the fetus as necessary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An open, sealable side was incorporated to facilitate insertion of the fetus at the time of cannulation, and various water-tight ports were designed to accommodate cannulas, temperature probes and sterile suction tubing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After cannulation, the Biobag is sealed and transferred to a mobile support platform that incorporates temperature and pressure regulation, padding and the fluid reservoirs and fluid exchange circuitry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The development of the Biobag essentially solved the problem of gross fluid contamination, and has eliminated pneumonia on lung pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Throughout the subsequent experiments, low-level amniotic fluid contamination was observed only in circumstances where Biobag re-entry was required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When this occurred, contamination could be cleared by increasing the fluid exchange rate and injecting antibiotics into the bag fluid on a daily basis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Umbilical vascular access', 'To more closely approximate flow dynamics in utero, carotid cannulation was abandoned in favour of double umbilical artery and single umbilical vein cannulation (abbreviated UA/UV) cannulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We developed a technique for umbilical cord vessel cannulation that maintains a length of native umbilical cord (510 cm) between the cannula tips and the abdominal wall, to minimize decannulation events and the risk of mechanical obstruction (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The umbilical and venous cannulas are only 2 cm long, most of which is used for securing the cannulas, and therefore the interface is functionally end to end.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Umbilical cord spasm was mitigated by a combination of topical papaverine administration, atraumatic operative technique and maintaining warmth and physiologic oxygen saturation of the umbilical venous inflow on initiation of circuit flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Biobag was modified to accommodate exclusively umbilical cannulas (Fig 1b,c and Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Physiologic extracorporeal support of the fetus', 'The combination of the pumpless oxygenator circuit, the closed fluid circuit and Biobag and umbilical cord access constitute our device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have run 8 lambs with maintenance of stable levels of circuit flow equivalent to the normal flow to the placenta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have run 5 fetuses from 105 to 108 days of gestation for 2528 days, and 3 fetuses from 115 to 120 days of gestation for 2028 days (Table 1, Biobag UA/UV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The longest runs were terminated at 28 days due to animal protocol limitations rather than any instability, suggesting that support of these early gestational animals could be maintained beyond 4 weeks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Haemodynamic and circuit flow parameters for all eight UA/UV lambs are summarized in Fig 2 and compared directly with CA/UV lambs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The UA/UV lambs demonstrated levels of circuit flow comparable to what is considered normal placental flow (Fig 2c, 150250 ml kg1 min1) throughout the duration of their runs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With physiologic circuit flows in UA/UV animals, we were able to maintain lower post-membrane saturation (Fig 2d) with normal fetal oxygen delivery (Fig 2f) and reduced transfusion requirement (Fig 2e) relative to CA/UV lambs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prevent excessive oxygen delivery, we typically lowered initial sweep-gas oxygen concentration to 1114% by blending nitrogen with room air.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Normal oxygen delivery is required for physiologic metabolic support, substrate utilization and growth and development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3a shows the calculated parameters related to oxygen delivery for our UA/UV lambs on both the 5 earlier gestation lambs (105 to 108 days of gestation) and the 3 later gestation lambs (115 to 120 days of gestation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values for both groups are comparable to the previously published normal values for fetal lambs30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During studies, efforts were made to maintain normal fetal oxygen tension and carbon dioxide exchange while providing normal oxygen delivery (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In CA/UV lambs a progressive fall in haemoglobin (Hgb) levels was noted, ultimately requiring transfusion with a large volume of adult blood (40 ml kg1 per week) to maintain O2 delivery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reasoned that this was likely due to impaired erythropoietin production from the fetal liver due to supraphysiologic O2 content of the post-membrane UV blood31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent experiments with the first three UA/UV animals demonstrated reduced transfusion requirement (10 ml kg1 per week), likely due to lower PaO2 in UV blood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the last five UA/UV animals we administered daily erythropoietin that slowed the progression of anaemia and nearly eliminated (6 ml kg1 per week) or, in the last 3 animals, completely eliminated the need for blood transfusion (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fetuses had normal pH values (Fig 3d) and lactate levels (Fig 3e) throughout the studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Oxygen parameters in UA/UV

the circuit was based on substrate uptake of late-gestation fetal lambs33,34,35, and hence consisted predominantly of carbohydrate and amino acid, with trace lipid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our strategy in CA/UV and UA/UV lambs was to titrate dextrose and amino acid administration to levels of plasma glucose ( less_than 40 mg dl1) and blood urea nitrogen ( less_than 30 mg dl1) to avoid an osmotic diuresis and/or hyperosmolar state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Substrate tolerance generally correlated with oxygen delivery, and at relatively higher oxygen delivery, UA/UV lambs tolerated physiologic levels of

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A pumpless circuit powered by the fetal heart is not a new concept and has been the initial approach taken by many investigators23,24,25,44,45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The advantages include simplicity, absence of pump-induced haemolysis and the potential for at least some autoregulation of circuit blood flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The disadvantages of pumpless systems include cardiac failure due to afterload imbalance if the circuit/oxygenator has supraphysiologic resistance, or the potential for high-output cardiac failure if the oxygenator has subphysiologic resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most attempts have been limited by subphysiologic circuit flows and rapid haemodynamic decompensation despite the use of vasopressor support and other measures24,25,44,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, Miura et al.45 reported survival of lamb fetuses on a pumpless parallelized circuit up to a predetermined limit of 60 h. In this report, the animals remained relatively haemodynamically stable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, external flow regulators were required to reduce blood flow through the circuit to reverse lactic acidosis, and evidence of white matter brain injury was observed on histology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most investigators have added pumps to arteriovenous systems to address the limitation of subphysiologic flow in pumpless systems7,8,9,11,12,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While most attempts have been short-lived culminating in circulatory failure, prolonged survival of up to 543 h was achieved in two fetal goats12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to achieve this result, the animals required dialysis, continuous paralysis, were hydropic and ultimately succumbed to respiratory failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hollow fibre plate technology has allowed the development of near-zero-resistance oxygenators, enabling our pumpless system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to previous studies, throughout the development of our system, we saw no instances of cardiac failure in our developmentally relevant lambs (105 days of gestation and beyond).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, a low level of resistance developed across the circuit when umbilical vascular access was used, consistent with some autoregulation of blood flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A major concern in premature infants is intracranial haemorrhage, raising concern for the use of anticoagulation in extracorporeal support systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use substantially reduced heparin doses compared with conventional extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to maintain activated clotting times in the 150180 s range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We attribute our reduced heparin dosage to the reduced surface area of our circuit and the inclusion of a heparin-bound coating to all of the blood contacting components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the future there will likely be non-heparin-based coatings that will further improve safety.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there is also evidence that germinal matrix haemorrhage is related to positive pressure ventilation, inotrope use47 and other interventions in the extreme premature infant48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, physiologic support in a extracorporeal system without ventilation or pressors may, in itself, reduce the likelihood of haemorrhage, making prediction of the impact of our system on intracranial haemorrhage difficult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A critical feature of our system is the closed fluid environment with continuous fluid exchange.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has many advantages, the most important of which is preservation of fluid-filled lungs and the normal glottic resistance required for maintenance of normal airway pressures and lung growth and development5,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a fluid environment maintains the protective barrier between the fetus and the outside world.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, fetal swallowing of amniotic fluid helps maintain fetal fluid homeostasis and potentially may provide an additional route for nutrition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we used a simple electrolyte solution in this study, amniotic fluid contains many trophic factors and other components that may be beneficial to the fetus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The development of an optimal amniotic fluid for use in the device is an important focus of our current research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Continuous fluid exchange is employed to remove waste and maintain sterility and is analogous to the physiologic turnover of amniotic fluid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rate of fluid exchange can be increased to clear any contamination that occurs and we have not had any clinically significant infections since development of the Biobag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disadvantages of a fluid environment include limited access to the fetus by caregivers (that is, physical examination, blood draws, haemodynamic monitoring) with contamination of the environment if such access is required, and lack of rapid access in the case of an emergency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our system, we can examine the fetus in great detail by ultrasound that is superior to physical examination, and can access the circuit for all our vascular access needs (haemodynamic monitoring, blood draws and fluid/nutritional support).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sterile access ports for suction of meconium and other purposes are included, and we have designed a clinical device that could be rapidly opened should the fetus need to be resuscitated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional disadvantage that has been raised is parental perception of having their fetus in a bag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to consider that the comparator is the extreme premature infant on a ventilator and in an incubator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We feel that parents will be relatively reassured that their fetus is being maintained in a relatively protective and physiologic environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The clinical device will be designed with many features that should allow the parent to be connected with the fetus including ultrasound, a darkfield camera allowing real-time visualization of the fetus within its darkened environment and the ability to play maternal heart and abdominal sounds to the fetus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore feel that the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages of exposure of the fetus to the conventional care imposed on the critically preterm infant in the neonatal intensive care unit environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, the umbilical cord offers the only physiologic vascular access for extracorporeal support for the fetus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of carotid arterial inflow or any other peripheral artery does not provide normal placental flows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, all other access sites require an operative procedure on the fetus for both insertion and removal of cannulas, require stabilization of cannulas to avoid catastrophic decannulation events and raise concern for compromise of blood flow to the brain or other structures, depending upon the vessel utilized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While many investigators have utilized the umbilical vessels, most have placed their cannulas into the central vasculature to avoid umbilical vascular spasm7,8,11,12,13,14,15,23,24,25,45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is possible in sheep or goats, but not possible and would likely be hazardous for arterial cannula placement in the human fetus due to the tortuous course of the umbilical arteries and the large cannulas required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, we sought to take advantage of the natural resistance of the umbilical cord to occlusive events by developing an end adapter design for our umbilical cannulation incorporating very short cannulas and a method for securing the cannulas to the umbilical cord.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This avoids irritation of the vasculature or turbulence of flow at the end of the cannulas that might induce vascular spasm, erosion, aneurysm formation or thrombosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also allows a length of free umbilical cord between the cannulas and the fetus, preventing concern regarding decannulation or positional occlusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, we have been able to eliminate sedation during our runs and to maintain much more stable flows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An alternative approach to AV pumped or pumpless systems has recently been developed that utilizes veno-venous ECMO with circuit inflow via the external jugular vein and circuit outflow via the umbilical vein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They report support of extreme premature lambs in relatively stable physiologic condition for up to 1 week49,50,51 with average circuit flows of 87.4±17.9 ml kg1 min1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also report the requirement for vasopressors for the first 3 days, sedation throughout the run and findings of closure of the ductus venosus on necropsy, with the development of ascites and pleural effusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, five of nine lambs died before 1 week due to catheter-related complications or arrhythmia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to our closed fluid environment, an amniotic fluid-filled endotracheal tube is maintained that would not be expected to replicate the normal airway dynamics of fetal breathing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With further development, the veno-venous ECMO system may offer an alternative for support of premature infants, particularly after vaginal delivery as a salvage for ventilatory failure49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Clinical application of the technology will require further scientific and safety validation, and evolution and refinement of the device itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While we report here the application of our system to biologically equivalent premature lambs, the 105-day fetal lamb is considerably larger (1.01.5 kg) than an extremely low birth weight premature infant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In pilot studies on size-equivalent but developmentally far less mature lambs (8595-day GA, 480750 g), we encountered no limitations related to umbilical vessel caliber or oxygenator flows, confirming the technical feasibility of UA/UV cannulation at this size (Supplementary Movie 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did see evidence of too much flow (300350 ml kg1 min1) in our very early gestational, human-size-equivalent lambs resulting in hydrops and limiting our experiments to 5 to 8 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the more mature and developmentally equivalent lambs, no evidence of autoregulation of circuit flow was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that there is a delicate balance between adequate and excessive circuit flow and that the ability to compensate for increased flow and supraphysiologic right atrial pressures may be dependent on developmental maturity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the weight-adjusted cardiac output and umbilical arterial size are nearly identical between the fetal lamb and humans, we anticipate the ability to place 810 Fr cannulas into human umbilical vessels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have developed cannulas for rapid insertion and anticipate the ability to cannulate a human umbilical cord and initiate circuit flow in  less_than 2 min that is well within the window of time that is critical for fetal brain oxygenation52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would, at least initially, be done via a modified EXIT procedure53 in the 5060% of extreme preterm deliveries that can be anticipated and delivered by caesarean section54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The requirement for an EXIT procedure will require centre expertise and introduce additional risk and potential long-term hysterotomy-related morbidity for the mother and these risks will need to be incorporated into nondirective counselling before the procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability to place an infant on the system after vaginal delivery, or to clear contamination under that circumstance, or circumstances of chorioamnionitis, remain to be experimentally determined, but would remain a possibility if umbilical vascular spasm can be prevented or reversed and contamination can be contained and/or fetal infection treated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The initial clinical target population for this therapy will likely be the 2325-week extreme premature infant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the present time the morbidity and mortality of this population would seem to justify general application of this technology if it were proven to dramatically improve outcomes in clinical trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future developments may allow better prediction of those infants who are destined for extreme premature delivery55 and may allow genetic prediction of infants who are most at risk for mortality and morbidity if born premature56,57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would in turn allow risk stratification of potential patients and improved selection of patients who would be most likely to benefit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important point is that placement on the system would not be prohibitive to standard therapies for extreme premature infants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, prenatal glucocorticoids could still be administered, and rapid delivery from the system and conversion to standard premature neonatal care would be necessary and warranted if the system failed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before 2223 weeks of gestation, there are likely physiologic and technical limitations that will increase the risk and reduce the potential benefit of this therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our goal is not to extend the current limits of viability, but rather to offer the potential for improved outcomes for those infants who are already being routinely resuscitated and cared for in neonatal intensive care units.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the implications of this technology extend beyond clinical application to extreme premature infants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Potential therapeutic applications may include treatment of fetal growth retardation related to placental insufficiency or the salvage of preterm infants threatening to deliver after fetal intervention or fetal surgery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The technology may also provide the opportunity to deliver infants affected by congenital malformations of the heart, lung and diaphragm for early correction or therapy before the institution of gas ventilation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerous applications related to fetal pharmacologic, stem cell or gene therapy could be facilitated by removing the possibility for maternal exposure and enabling direct delivery of therapeutic agents to the isolated fetus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, our system offers an intriguing experimental model for addressing fundamental questions regarding the role of the mother and placenta in fetal development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long-term physiologic maintenance of a fetus amputated from the maternalplacental axis has now been achieved, making it possible to study the relative contribution of this organ to fetal maturation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
