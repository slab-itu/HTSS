Prevalence of sexual dimorphism in mammalian phenotypic traits  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The role of sex in biomedical studies has often been overlooked, despite evidence of sexually dimorphic effects in some biological studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we used high-throughput phenotype data from 14,250 wildtype and 40,192 mutant mice (representing 2,186 knockout lines), analysed for up to 234 traits, and found a large proportion of mammalian traits both in wildtype and mutants are influenced by sex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result has implications for interpreting disease phenotypes in animal models and humans.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A systematic review of animal research studies identified a vast over-representation of experiments that exclusively evaluated males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where two sexes were included, two-thirds of the time the results were not analysed by sex1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, sex is often not adequately reported, despite the majority of common human diseases exhibiting some sex differences in prevalence, course and severity3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fundamental differences exist between males and females that may influence the interpretation of traits and disease phenotypes4,5 and their treatment6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some, however, have argued that considering both sexes lead to a waste of resources and underpowered experiments7, while others have questioned the value of preclinical research into sex differences8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we quantify how often sex influences phenotype within a data set by analysing data from 14,250 wildtype animals and 40,192 mutant mice, from 2,186 single gene knockout lines, produced by the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC)9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phenotyping performed by the IMPC explores a range of vertebrate biology, and aims to collect data from seven males and seven females from each mutant line with data from strain-matched controls accumulated over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are collected at 10 phenotyping centres, providing a unique opportunity to explore the role of sex on a phenotype within an experimental data set, and the role of sex on a treatment effect, where the treatment is a gene disruption event, analogous to a Mendelian genetic disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings show that regardless of research field or biological system, consideration of sex is important in the design and analysis of animal studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All data are freely available at mousephenotype.org.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Sex as a biological variable within an experiment', 'We first assessed the contribution of sex using linear modelling to determine how often sex contributed to the variation in the phenotype in wildtype mice (control data) for an individual data set (a phenotypic test/trait at an individual phenotyping centre) (Supplementary Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phenotypes were classified as either continuous, such as creatine kinase levels, or categorical, such as vibrissae shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because body size is dimorphic between male and female mice, and many continuous traits correlate with body weight, we included weight as a covariate in our analysis for continuous traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this approach, our analysis revealed that 9.9% of data sets from categorical traits (54/545 data sets) were significantly influenced by sex at a 5% false discovery rate (FDR) (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of these cases included phenotypes that would not a priori be assumed to be sexually dimorphic (SD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, abnormal corneal opacity occurred at a higher rate in female wildtype mice at most phenotyping centres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Looking at the SD rate by institute, we find that within categorical data the rate was relatively consistent (average percentage of traits which were SD 8.9% (s.d.=5.9)) (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Sex as a

(Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, this proportion was higher when the absolute phenotypic differences were considered without taking body weight into account (73.3%, 662/903 data sets, Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the continuous data set, the inter-institute SD rate was more variable (average percentage of traits which were SD 44% (s.d.=14)) (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variation in sensitivity is to be expected, arising from the observation that variance for a trait depends on the institute10 and the size of the control data set (Fig 2b,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless of biological area studied, sex was found to have a role (Figs 2c and 3a,b) and where calls could be compared across institutes the effect of sex was in general reproducible, with only 8.7% of variables having opposing effects across the phenotyping centres (Fig 3c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variation in husbandry, diet and other environmental factors will contribute to this variability11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous manuscripts have conducted extensive analysis assessing consistency across institutes and found good agreement in findings10,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It could be argued that the consistency is surprising; for example, considering how critical the microbiome is to phenotypic outcome13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While these studies are contained within facilities with high biosecurity, the microbiomes will differ from institute to institute.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, microbiomes will differ between individual litters depending on the maternal microbiome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study comparing control data across many litters in effect accounts for this variation, which might go some way to explaining the consistency of the findings across sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Sex as a biological

(Supplementary Fig 1ce).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bespoke statistical analyses, distinct from those implemented on the IMPC portal, were used to assess sexual dimorphism and control the false positive rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this analysis, we used data collected from 2,186 mutant mouse lines, first assessing whether genotype significantly influenced phenotype, and if significant whether the effect was modified by sex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the categorical phenotypes that showed a significant genotype effect (0.46% 1,220/266,952 data sets at 5% FDR), 13.3% (162/1,220) were classed as SD at a 20% FDR (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our previous investigations15 found it necessary to use a higher FDR for categorical traits because of the conservative nature of this statistical pipeline and multiple testing burden.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For continuous traits, 7.2% (7,929/110,586 at 5% FDR) had a significant genotype effect, of which 17.7% (1,407/7,929 at 5% FDR) were classed as SD (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing the stringency of the continuous data analysis by decreasing the FDR to 1%, reduced the number of phenotype calls (3.4%; 3,719/110,586 data sets) but we still observed a high proportion (12.0%; 446/3,719) of sexual dimorphism (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For continuous traits, phenotypes ascertained using mice phenotyped in multiple batches are more robust as data is collected across multiple litters and modelling of environmental variation is more reliable, thereby giving better control of the false positive rate16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Focusing only on multi-batch data sets, 8.9% (4,177/46,925) had a significant genotype effect of which 13.8% were classed as SD (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Role of sex as a modifier of the genotype effect.The role of

the null hypothesis of no genotype*sex interaction was not rejected; this may be because the effect is the same across sexes, or due to a lack of power to detect the differential effect across sexes.

expense of sensitivity15 (Figs 6 and 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that we detected a significant number of SD genotypephenotype relationships, despite this limitation and relatively small sample size, suggests that other traits may display more subtle sexual dimorphism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primary impact of sex as a modifier of genotype effect for continuous traits was that of one sex only (12.8% for all continuous traits using a 5% FDR) where only males or females showed a statistically significant phenotype (Fig 4b), as demonstrated by the Usp47tm1b/tm1b mouse; the mutant that showed the largest proportion of SD calls (Fig 8 and Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the SD calls in the IMPC data set, 3.5% demonstrated a phenotype that was significant in both sexes but with opposing phenotypic changes (Fig 4b); for example a significant increase in the males and a significant decrease in the females (Fig 8b, total protein and red blood cell).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 0.8% of cases, we observed phenotypes that were significant in both sexes, when compared to controls, but the phenotype was more pronounced in one sex when compared to the other (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the goal of assessing the prevalence, a simple summary has been used; however sensitivity will vary by trait.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For categorical screens the hit rate by screen averaged 12.5% (s.d.=3.2%,

exclusively on mutants of autosomal loci finding a high proportion associated with one or more SD calls (33.2% of genes studied: 725/2,186).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is in keeping with the view that once the sex determination cascade is initiated, genes exhibiting SD effects can be located anywhere in the genome17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, it illustrates the pervasive nature of sexual dimorphism that impacts a wide range of loci and genetic systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Sexual dimorphism and gene function', 'We considered whether our findings relate to similar examples of SD in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidence for SD in humans has typically come from complex disease and trait studies where the numbers of tested subjects are amenable to statistical analysis18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, meta-analysis studies have typically failed to replicate findings with only the association of angiotensin-converting enzyme gene (ACE) and hypertension in men being consistently replicated18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the IMPC portal, we do relate the knockout phenotypes to Mendelian disease data19 using resources such as Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)20 and Orphanet21 where we are most likely to reproduce the phenotypes observed in these single gene diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these human resources do not consistently document SD in the signs and symptoms and it is unlikely the numbers of patients recorded for these rare diseases would make detection of significant SD possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To determine whether prevalent sex differences are the result of a common biological process, we performed a functional analysis of a set of 29 genes for which sex differences were detected on more than 4% of all measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The statistical analysis, and subsequent call of SD, is at the level of an individual trait for a genotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, classifying a gene as SD is somewhat arbitrary as it involves accounting for the number of traits having a genotypic effect, and the prevalence of SD within these.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this limitation, an evaluation of this set of 29 genes in comparison to all curated and experimentally derived functional annotation sets in GeneWeaver22 revealed statistically significant overlap (J=0.0385; P less_than 1.12 × 107) to 25 genes associated with absence of the oestrous cycle (MP:0009009), based on representation of Kiss1r and Postn on both gene lists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A further review of genes for which any significant sex*genotype interaction was detected revealed additional genes associated with MP:0009009, absence of the oestrous cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This additional set includes Fshr, Lhcgr, Cyp27b1, Fancl and Foxo3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that constitutive perturbations of oestrous cyclicity, including developmental absence or loss of cyclicity in adulthood, may broadly influence sex differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gene products encoded by Fshr (follicle stimulating releasing hormone receptor) and Lhcgr (Luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor) have well known effects on reproductive cycles, and behaviour due to their role in maintaining hormonal cycles in females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cyp27b1 is a steroid synthesizing enzyme, which is primarily involved in vitamin D metabolism, known to influence many sex-specific phenomena in autoimmune and other diseases (for a recent example23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fancl (Fanconi anema complementation group L) causes male and female infertility and gonadal hormone abnormalities in Zebrafish24 through developmental signalling mechanisms via aromatase conversion of androgen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Foxo3 is associated with ovarian pathology in humans25 and premature ovarian failure in mice26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, each of these gene perturbations has the capability of influencing hormonal effects on behaviour and physiology, though it remains to be evaluated whether the sex differences herein are stable throughout the hormonal cycle or result from interference in a sex-specific gonadal steroid-regulated process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An evaluation of other genes with high sex difference hit rates may reveal additional pervasive effects on reproductive traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other sex differences identified in the IMPC analysis may be the result of more specific effects of gene perturbation on a sex-specific process in males or females.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Many authors have raised the need to address the role of sex in basic biological research and recommendations have been made, but with limited progress to date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bespoke analysis of IMPC data, revealed that 9.9% of qualitative and 56.6% of quantitative data sets were SD in wildtype mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, as a mediator of a mutant phenotype, sex modifies the genotype effect in 13.3% of qualitative data sets and up to 17.7% of quantitative data sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings are consistent with a recently published study examining the role of sex in human genetic variation that found the effect was of modest magnitude but across a broad spectrum of traits27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies to understand the biological mechanism of the interactions reported herein are challenging because of the difficulty of designing experiments with sufficient sensitivity to consistently detect those interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our findings also span a broad phenotypic spectrum and indicate that regardless of research field or biological system, consideration of sex is important in the design and analysis of animal studies for studies where sex differences could occur, thus supporting the recent National Institute of Health mandate to consider sex as a biological variable28.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
