Optimization of hierarchical structure and nanoscale-enabled plasmonic refraction for window electrodes in photovoltaics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'An ideal network window electrode for photovoltaic applications should provide an optimal surface coverage, a uniform current density into and/or from a substrate, and a minimum of the overall resistance for a given shading ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that metallic networks with quasi-fractal structure provides a near-perfect practical realization of such an ideal electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that a leaf venation network, which possesses key characteristics of the optimal structure, indeed outperforms other networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further show that elements of hierarchal topology, rather than details of the branching geometry, are of primary importance in optimizing the networks, and demonstrate this experimentally on five model artificial hierarchical networks of varied levels of complexity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to these structural effects, networks containing nanowires are shown to acquire transparency exceeding the geometric constraint due to the plasmonic refraction.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'High electrical conductivity and optical transmittance of window electrodes play a crucial role in various optoelectronic devices such as solar cells1,2,3, light-emitting diodes (LEDs)4,5,6, displays7,8,9, sensors10,11,12 and smart windows13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In photovoltaic (PV) applications (solar cells and LEDs), window electrodes must display an efficient and uniform current transport, as well as a very high light transmission into/from the semiconductor substrate16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Various window electrode materials have been developed in the last century, which have been based on thin, uniform films of metal oxides, highly doped large gap semiconductors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most common of those today is the indium tin oxide (ITO).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The need for ITO replacement has recently emerged due to relatively high cost, shortage of indium, brittleness and the fact that transparency and the overall conductivity is not very good.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, these materials are continuous, uniform films, and thus not optimal for collection of non-uniform currents developing around contacts, and other non-uniformities in the PV structures, thus affecting their efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this context, it has been argued that quasi-fractal (QF) or hierarchical metallic networks could be a good ITO replacement, optimal for the required function of efficient and uniform current transport, as well as a very high light transmission into/from the semiconductor substrate18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an analogous problem of the heat flow, it was demonstrated that QF structures lead to a marked reduction of the thermal resistance19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar problem of nutrient delivery into a leafs tissue, with minimal light shading, has been solved by the natural evolution with a QF hierarchical network of the leaf-venation system18,19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also known that river tributaries from a basin develop a self-similar structure of branching to homogenize water flow22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this work, we first propose a theoretical analysis of window electrode networks subject to the following optimization conditions: (i) a maximal surface coverage; (ii) a uniform current density; and (iii) a minimum of the overall resistance at fixed shading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first condition implies a fractal structure of dimension approaching 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the third condition is incompatible with both the first and the second.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a QF tree with a slightly modified scaling in the vertical can, in the limit, satisfy the first and the last conditions perfectly, and also the second allowing for discontinuities of in-plane current densities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then verify our theoretical analysis with a series of systematic and detailed experiments and simulations.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Properties of QF hierarchical structures', 'To understand why fractal-like electrodes prove superior to other networks, consider a hypothetical ideal window electrode for PV applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the efficiency of collecting current can always be increased at the cost of shading, assume fixed shading, defined as a fraction of the area of the light-harvesting surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For such a constant shading, the theoretical ideal electrode would have the following three properties: (i) optimal coverage of the surface; (ii) uniform current density; and (iii) minimum in-plane resistance overall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optimal coverage, whereby current is effectively collected from the entire surface, requires a progressively finer network of branches at smaller and smaller scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the overall network is to be near homogenous, a self-similar, surface-covering structure is required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, condition (i) implies fine structure and self-similarity (fractal network) in the plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, near-perfect coverage of the surface implies a fractal of dimension D approaching 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simplest network is one with the branching number N=2, which is a pattern where at each order a given parent branch splits into two daughter sub-branches, a fractal tree21,22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Consider first, for simplicity, an electrode in the form of a fractal tree with the square cross-section (the actual geometry of the cross-section does not matter for any of the results below, although it may affect the quality of the electrical contact).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a junction of order n of such a tree, a branch of width rn and length ln splits into two branches of widths and lengths rn+1 and ln+1, respectively (it is sufficient here to consider trees with identical daughter branches at each junction).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Continuity of current through the junction, assuming fixed current density Jo, condition (ii), gives', '', 'Consequently, the linear dimensions of the branches scale with the factor 1/s where , and the widths at each junction satisfy  with q=2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Uniformity of current density along each branch of the junction is now assured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, since the area of contact between a given branch and the substrate is equal to the area of contact of its two daughter branches, , continuity of current guarantees also the uniformity of current density Js from the substrate into the electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, , where As is the total shading area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fractal dimension corresponding to this scaling is', '', 'Evidently, conditions (i) and (ii) favour an electrode, which is a QF (truncated) tree of the fractal dimension approaching 2, in our hypothetical, idealized scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We now turn to condition (iii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown rigorously that an electrode in the form of fractal tree has optimal properties for electrochemical applications, including minimal resistance23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we derive the exponent q, which minimizes electrical resistance with the in-plane cross-sectional area (shading) kept constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do this, we consider resistances of the branches meeting at a junction and employ the Lagrange multiplier method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resistance of the parent branch at order n is given by , where o is the resistivity of the electrode material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming the ratio ln/rn=b is a constant, , where a=ob is a constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It follows that the resistance of the segment of the network consisting of the parent and two daughter branches (at order n+1), and the area of its cross-section, can be written as  and A(x, y)=b(x2+2y2), respectively, with , .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore define the functional', '', 'and seek its minimum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Setting the derivative with respect to the Lagrange multiplier  to zero assures that the shading area is kept constant (and equal to Ao).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Setting the derivatives with respect to x and y to zero and eliminating  from the resulting equations gives x3=4y3 or', '', 'It follows that q=D=1.5 minimizes the net resistance, whereas D2 is required for the uniform current density and optimal surface coverage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two requirements cannot be satisfied simultaneously and thus a window electrode, of square or circular cross-section, which satisfies all three conditions formulated above, is impossible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'However, a branch cross-section does not need to be defined by a single parameter, and in practice it is quite unlikely to be.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To take the simplest example, we assume that each branch has a rectangular cross-section, with width rn and height hn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, uniformity of current density is not physically necessary (as long as current is continuous as demanded by Kirchhoffs Law).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By relaxing condition (ii), allowing discontinuities in current density across the junctions, and by controlling relative thickness of branches hn at each order, one can design a network whose projection onto the cells plane is a fractal of the desired fractal dimension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One way to do this is to set the height of the branch at n-th order to scale as', '', 'and require that the projection onto the plane of the cell be a (perfect) fractal of dimension D less_than 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imposing condition (iii) for the scaling (5) now gives', '', 'that is, D=(+2)/2 or =2(D1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, with D=1.5, =1 and (5) reduces to hn=rn for square electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Continuity of current requires now

real version of such a network would be optimal (save for the uniformity of current density), though of course highly cumbersome to manufacture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It follows that our electrode based on the venation of a Magnolia alba leaf18, with the measured value D=1.4±0.21.5, is close to the best achievable under the constraint of equal width and height of branches, with small discontinuity in current density at each junction (of about 25% using our model).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only deficiency of this network is the less than maximal surface coverage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'QF network of leaf venation', 'To demonstrate experimentally that a fractal-like network outperforms a non-hierarchical structure, we use the QF network developed earlier by members of our team and described in detail

microscopy (SEM) image of this QF network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, we chose a non-hierarchical structure of the self-assembled crack (C) network25, shown in right inset in Fig 1a, as well as the conventional ITO film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C network is made by coating a substrate with a thin, sacrificial film, which micro-cracks under certain conditions, and acts as a mask during sputtering of a metal (cracking template).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lift-off of the sacrificial film produces the desired electrode network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work we modified our original process25 by using a much cheaper and environmentally friendly new material, egg white, as the sacrificial layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Normally, we can roughly control the fabrication process and obtain networks with different

Note that C networks slightly outperform QF networks in the figure of merit test, since these are optimized for the vertical, not the in-plane transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To test the optoelectronic performance of the films in the vertical electron transport mode (into or from a substrate), we have performed two additional experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first, we measure the contact resistance Rcont of a film (for example, a network) to the 80 nm thick, flat Al-doped zinc oxide electrode, as shown schematically in Fig 1c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All films have been selected to have essentially identical T. As expected from theoretical analysis, the QF network in the vertical transport mode strongly outperforms both the C-network and ITO: Rcont=2.6 (QF); 14.8 (C); and 28.4  (ITO).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the second experiment, we developed a series of PV cells with window electrodes based on those films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, all electrodes have been selected to have essentially identical T. Since depositing the window electrode (QF, C or ITO) on a glass substrate was the initial stage of the cell development, it allowed us to select the electrodes based on T. Figure 1d shows an SEM image of the cross-section of the cell (the cell processing and IV characteristic details in the Supplementary Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identical processing has been used for all cells, and the completed cells have been finally selected to have identical short circuit current density and the shunt resistance, which is expected if the junctions are identical and all the window electrodes have the same T. The measured IV characteristics of the selected PV cells under AM1.5 illumination are shown in Fig 1e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inset shows that as expected, the QF window electrode provides the smallest series resistance Rs=23 , 35% smaller than the random C electrode with Rs=35.6 , even though the same amount of metal was used (the same T implies the same metal coverage ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both QF and C networks have much smaller series resistances than the uniform thick film of ITO, with Rs=47.4 .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The energy conversion efficiencies of 5.91%, 5.46% and 5.37% for QF, C and ITO cells, respectively, reflect this trend also.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the relatively low overall efficiency of the cells is a result of missing light-trapping schemes, omitted intentionally to emphasize the electrode performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The additional insets in Fig 1e show photographs of the PV cells, with clearly visible leaf venation structure for the QF network cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Model networks', 'Our theoretical analysis, based on the network topology, shows that the geometrical details of the network play a secondary role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that the increasing number of hierarchical orders, not network symmetry (periodic or non-periodic), should be the main consideration for a hierarchical network optimization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this conclusion experimentally, we developed a number of networks with varying network geometries, and a number of hierarchical orders (the schematic of the fabrication process is shown in Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Morphology of these networks is shown in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first network (Fig 2a) is the C network25,28,29, already discussed above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a first-order random network (R1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2b presents an optical image of a large-scale simple grid network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a first-order periodic network (P1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2c is an SEM image of an ultra-small scale grid network (UP1), developed to study plasmonic refraction, discussed later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a first-order ultrafine periodic network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second-order random network (R2) is made by depositing silver nanowires (NWs) (the detail of synthesis of Ag NWs in Supplementary Methods) on the R1 network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its SEM image (Fig 2d) reveals the two-order hierarchy: the C network (first order) and the silver NW (second order).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NWs have an average length of 50 m and diameter of 200 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2e presents a high (atomic)-resolution transmission electron microscopy study of a single NW, showing an excellent quality with clearly visible, defect-free atomic planes (in lower and higher magnification), as well as almost perfect X-ray diffraction pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2f is a high-resolution SEM image of the details of R2 network, further enhanced in the inset and an atomic force microscopy (AFM) image, showing height profile of this network (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2g is an optical image of the second-order periodic network (P2), obtained by adding the narrow horizontal and vertical metallic lines (of 200 m length) to the P1 network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P1 and P2 large-scale networks were made by photolithography (the details are shown in the Methods section and Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Morphology of the model networks.Single-order networks: (a) C network (R1; SEM image; scale bar, 200 m); (b) large-scale simple grid network (P1; optical image; scale bar, 200 m); and (c) ultrafine scale grid network (UP1; SEM image; scale bar, 5 m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two-order random networks: (d) C-based network (R2; SEM image; scale bar, 30 m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) High (atomic)-resolution transmission electron microscopy images of a single NW.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inset shows an X-ray diffraction pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 10 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) High-resolution SEM image of the R2 network at the tilt angle of 60°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 2 m.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The theoretical analysis presented here starts with three postulates for a hypothetically ideal window electrode: an optimal surface coverage; a uniform in-plane current density; and minimal overall resistance (at given shading).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first two of these conditions require a fractal structure of dimension approaching 2, which of course is an idealization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third condition, implying D=1.5, while manifestly incompatible with the first two, suggests that an electrode consisting of a truncated fractal structure of this dimension would be optimal except for less than perfect surface coverage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This explains why a network based on the veins of Magnolia alba leaf, with D1.4, proves to be exceptionalat least within the class of quasi fractal networks in three dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Indeed, in a series of detailed experiments, we showed that our natural electrode had a significantly higher PV efficiency and smaller contact resistance, than any uniform, non-hierarchical random network, as well as the conventional ITO layer, confirming our conclusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These results notwithstanding, the requirement of uniform current density is not really necessary, and in fact usually not satisfied in artificial networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it is desirable only insofar as to assure uniform current density into and/or from the substrate, itself not critical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mathematically, uniformity of current density means that the network must be a fractal tree in three dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore designed a network, which is not fractal as a whole, but whose projection onto the windows plane is fractaland of any desired dimension D, up to and including 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Continuity of current through every junction now determines the necessary jumps of current density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It follows that a truncated version of such a network, set to D=2, would theoretically be optimal, though it may be impractical to manufacture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Beyond this theoretical result, our analysis indicates that a hierarchal structure (with multiple branching orders), rather than detailed geometry, is critical for optimizing network electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated this experimentally in a series of systematic electro-optical and PV experiments, in five hierarchical networks: a one- and two-order random, one- and two-order periodic and a three-order mixed structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experimental results are summarized in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3d, in particular, demonstrates this conclusion explicitly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At fixed transmittance, changing from random to periodic structures, while keeping the number of hierarchical orders fixed, lowers the contact resistance only slightly, but adding another hierarchical order, for both period and random structures, reduces it by 3050%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All the while, the in-plane resistance remains essentially unchanged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to these structural effects, controlled by network hierarchy with topological elements (branching), the networks based on NWs achieve transparency exceeding the geometric limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is due to plasmonic refraction, which involves propagating surface plasmons transporting energy around NWs, effectively squeezing light into the spaces between NW, and thus minimizing reflection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate this effect on our ultrafine grid network, whose transparency has been measured and simulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To visualize the plasmonic refraction, we performed also simulations of the electromagnetic fields of waves propagating through the network at various times, and for varied wavelength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our simulations show that an electromagnetic wave couples to the surface plasmon wave in the metal, which in turn transports its energy seamlessly around the NW.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The net result is an increased transmission of the wave through the network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our low-cost, self-assembled networks are mechanically very stable and flexible, surviving numerous bending cycles (for an example see Supplementary Fig 5 and Supplementary Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, the resistance of ITO film changes by two orders of magnitude already after a few cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such desirable mechanical stability and flexibility, combined with excellent electro-optical parameters demonstrated here, make these networks very attractive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are suitable, in particular, for solar cells, LED lighting and transparent flexible heaters (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study opens a path towards a new generation of smart TC, through hierarchical multi-order networks with the lowest orders at nanoscopic scales, and possibly also through intrinsic TC functionalities, such as light trapping and/or nonlinear light processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These smart TC could eventually lead to a new class of applications such as the energy recovery, temperature and haze controlling electro-chromic windows, and high-power light sources, to name a few.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, we note that while our most efficient electrode to date is based on a natural biological network, the mathematical construct we developed suggests that a superior electrode can yet be envisioned, though it seems impractical at this stage.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
