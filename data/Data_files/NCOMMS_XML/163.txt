TAK1 modulates satellite stem cell homeostasis and skeletal muscle repair  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Satellite cells are resident adult stem cells that are required for regeneration of skeletal muscle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, signalling mechanisms that regulate satellite cell function are less understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate that transforming growth factor--activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is important in satellite stem cell homeostasis and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inactivation of TAK1 in satellite cells inhibits muscle regeneration in adult mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TAK1 is essential for satellite cell proliferation and its inactivation causes precocious differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, TAK1-deficient satellite cells exhibit increased oxidative stress and undergo spontaneous cell death, primarily through necroptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TAK1 is required for the activation of NF-B and JNK in satellite cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forced activation of NF-B improves survival and proliferation of TAK1-deficient satellite cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, TAK1-mediated activation of JNK is essential to prevent oxidative stress and precocious differentiation of satellite cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our study suggests that TAK1 is required for maintaining the pool of satellite stem cells and for regenerative myogenesis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Skeletal muscle regeneration is mediated by a specialized population of adult stem cells known as satellite cells, which reside adjacent to myofibers1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although normally quiescent, satellite cells are activated upon muscle damage to proliferate, differentiate and fuse to form new myofibers leading to regeneration of damaged tissue and restoration of normal function2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Satellite cells are inextricably linked to the paired box transcription factor Pax7 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Satellite cells of all mammalian species studied so far have been found to express Pax7 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inactivation of Pax7 results in severe depletion of muscle stem cells in adult animals4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pax7 along with myogenic regulator factor, MyoD, determines the fate of satellite cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although all quiescent satellite cells express Pax7, they do not express MyoD protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon muscle injury, satellite cells proliferate and rapidly induce MyoD expression, leading to their progression in the myogenic lineage to generate fusion competent myoblasts3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the majority of activated satellite cells (that is, Pax7+/MyoD+) differentiate into myogenic lineage through ensuing repression of Pax7 and upregulation of other myogenic regulatory factors, such as myogenin and MRF4, a small proportion self-renew and return to the quiescent state (that is, Pax7+/MyoD) to respond to future muscle injury and repair2,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Satellite cell self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation are regulated through the activation of multiple signalling pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of Notch signalling promotes satellite cell self-renewal and inhibits differentiation through repressing the expression of MyoD5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the Wnt7a/Fzd7 planar-cell-polarity pathway drives the symmetric expansion of satellite stem cells to enhance regeneration of injured myofibers9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MAPK signalling pathways also regulate the self-renewal and differentiation of satellite cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Angiotensin-1 binds to Tie-2 receptor to increase the number of quiescent satellite cells through the activation of the ERK1/2 signalling pathway10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signalling seems to promote satellite cell expansion during regenerative myogenesis11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the activation of p38 MAPK inhibits self-renewal and promotes differentiation of satellite cells into myoblasts12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the canonical nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) pathway activated through inhibitor of kappa B kinase- (IKK) blocks terminal differentiation of myogenic cells15,16, in the context of cancer cachexia stimulation of NF-B promotes the expansion of satellite cells17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the activation of JAKSTAT signalling negatively regulates satellite stem cell proliferation and function during regenerative myogenesis18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Transforming growth factor--activated kinase 1 (TAK1), a member of the MEK kinase family, is an important signalling protein that activates several signalling pathways in response to cytokines, growth factors and microbial products20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TAK1 constitutively interacts with accessory protein TAB1 and also with TAB2 or TAB3 (refs 21, 22, 23, 24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TAB1 constitutively binds and activates TAK1, whereas TAB2 or TAB3 bind TAK1 after stimulation26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TAK1 complex is activated in response to proinflammatory stimuli via K63-linked polyubiquitination driven by the E2 ligase UBC13/UEV1A and the RING finger E3 ligases TRAF2 or TRAF6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  K63-linked polyubiquitination at the K158 residue of TAK1 by TRAF6/UBC13/UEV1A is an important response to stimulation of cells by cytokines and microbial products27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TAB2 and TAB3 preferentially bind to K63-linked polyubiquitin chains with strong affinity to activate TAK1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29), and even free, unconjugated, K63-linked polyubiquitin chains can activate TAK1 (refs 30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strong interactions between unanchored K63 polyubiquitin chains and TAB2/TAB3 change the conformation of TAK1 resulting in its autophosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TAK1 polyubiquitination induces autophosphorylation at Thr187, within its activation loop, and other sites, including Thr184 and Ser192 (refs 32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Proinflammatory and stress signals stimulate TAK1 to induce both proapoptotic and anti-apoptotic signals22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TAK1 mediates the pro-survival signal by inducing the nuclear translocation of NF-B and the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), whereas the proapoptotic signal is mediated by the activation of caspases22,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Germline deletion of TAK1 or its binding partners TAB1 or TAB2 in mice leads to embryonic lethality, suggesting that TAK1-mediated signalling is essential for embryogenesis21,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissue-specific knockout mice have demonstrated that TAK1 has important functions in innate and adaptive immune responses, vasculature development, survival of keratinocytes, haematopoietic cells and hepatocytes, and morphogenesis, growth and maintenance of cartilage21,35,36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although apoptosis is the major mode of cell death in physiological conditions, necroptosis, which involves the formation of a receptor-interacting protein (RIP)1 and RIP3 complex (called necrosome), is critical in many pathological conditions38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on upstream stimuli, TAK1 can promote or inhibit necroptosis in different cell types34,40,41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'TAK1 is highly expressed and activated in developing skeletal muscle of mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We and others have previously reported that TAK1 promotes differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes through the activation of p38 MAPK43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although TAK1 seems essential for myogenesis, the role of TAK1 in satellite stem cell homeostasis and function has not been investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through the generation of inducible satellite cell-specific TAK1 knockout mice, here we investigate the role and mechanisms of action of TAK1 in satellite cell survival, proliferation and function during regenerative myogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate that TAK1 is essential for the survival and proliferation of satellite cells both in vivo and in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inactivation of TAK1 in satellite cells induces oxidative stress and causes spontaneous cell death, primarily through necroptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TAK1 is required for the activation of JNKs and NF-B in satellite cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forced expression of a constitutively active mutant of IKK improves proliferation and survival of TAK1-deficient satellite cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, overexpression of JNK1 reduces oxidative stress and augments the expression of Pax7 in TAK1-deficient satellite cells.'

'TAK1 is required for the regeneration of myofibers upon injury', 'We first investigated whether TAK1 is activated in satellite stem cells in adult animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A combination of cell surface markers (CD45, CD31, Ter119, Sca1 and 7-integrin+) is widely used to identify satellite cells in adult mouse skeletal muscle6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based intracellular protein detection assay to examine the activation of TAK1 in satellite cells similar to as described35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-cell suspension prepared from hind limb muscle of wild-type (WT) mice were analysed by FACS for the expression of 7-integrin and phosphorylated form of TAK1 (Thr184/187).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis showed that phospho-TAK1 protein is expressed in the 7-integrin+ cells in satellite stem cells of naive WT mice (Fig 1a; Supplementary Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also investigated whether the phosphorylation TAK1 in satellite cells changes during muscle injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Barium chloride (BaCl2) is a commonly used chemical agent that causes muscle depolarization and myofiber death by stimulating exocytosis while blocking the Ca2+ efflux45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BaCl2 produces uniform and reproducible muscle injury and does not affect satellite and stromal cells and hence the regeneration of the treated muscle(s) proceeds normally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tibial anterior (TA) muscle of WT mice was injected with 100 l of 1.2% BaCl2 and after 5 days, the level of phosphorylated TAK1 in satellite cells was detected by FACS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis showed that the amount of phosphorylated TAK1 (Thr184/187) was significantly increased in satellite cells upon skeletal muscle injury (Supplementary Fig 1B,C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: TAK1 in satellite cells is required for regeneration of muscle fibres upon injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Primary mononucleated cells were isolated from hind limb muscle of WT mice and subjected for FACS analysis for the expression of 7-integrin and phospho-TAK1 (Thr184/187) immediately after isolation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Representative dot plots presented here demonstrate enrichment of phospho-TAK1+ cells amongst 7-intigrin+ population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  N=3 in each group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Following tamoxifen-mediated Cre recombination, tibial anterior (TA) muscle of adult TAK1f/f and TAK1scko mice were injected with 100 l of 1.2% BaCl2 solution after which muscles were isolated and analysed at day 5 and 14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative (b) absolute body weight; (c) uninjured TA muscle weight; and (d) injured TA muscle weight of TAK1f/f and TAK1scko mice 5d after injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  N=6 in each group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Representative photomicrographs of H&E-stained sections illustrating a severe regeneration defect in injured TA muscle of TAK1scko mice compared with TAK1f/f littermates at day 5 (N=6) and 14 (N=3) after BaCl2-mediated injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 50 M.

adult mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second exon of the TAK1 gene (which encodes the enzymes catalytic domain) is flanked with two loxp sites in the floxed TAK1 (henceforth, TAK1f/f) mice36 and thus can be deleted by Cre-mediated recombination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pax7CreER mice are tamoxifen-inducible satellite cell-specific Cre mouse line in which Cre expression can be induced at any time after birth by intraperitoneal injection of tamoxifen in mice46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We crossed TAK1f/f mice with Pax7CreER mice to generate satellite cell-specific inducible TAK1 knockout (Pax7CreER;TAK1f/f, henceforth, TAK1scko) mice (Supplementary Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eight-week-old TAK1scko mice were injected with tamoxifen to induce the TAK1 deletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Littermate TAK1f/f mice were also treated with tamoxifen and served as a control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mice were maintained on a tamoxifen-containing chow for the entire duration of the experiment (Supplementary Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TA muscle of TAK1scko and littermate TAK1f/f mice were given intramuscular injection of 100 l of 1.2% BaCl2 and regeneration was analysed at 5 and 14 days post injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inactivation of TAK1 in satellite cells did not affect the overall body weight (Fig 1b) or wet weight of uninjured TA muscle (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the wet weight of injured TA muscle was significantly reduced in TAK1scko mice compared with TAK1f/f mice (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next analysed injured TA muscle through performing haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, regeneration of TA muscle was markedly reduced in TAK1scko mice compared with the TA muscle of TAK1f/f littermates at 5 days post injury (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although newly formed centrally nucleated fibres populated regenerating TA muscle of TAK1f/f mice, the corresponding TAK1scko muscle showed poor signs of regeneration evident by reduced number and size of centrally nucleated fibres with robust persistence of cellular infiltrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Morphometric analyses of 5-day-injured TA muscle sections showed 40% reduction in the average fibre cross-sectional area (CSA) in TAK1scko mice compared with TAK1f/f littermates (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the number of fibres containing two or more centrally located nuclei was also significantly reduced in TAK1scko mice further indicating deficit in muscle regeneration (Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduced regeneration of TA muscle of TAK1scko mice was also evident at 14 days after muscle injury (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot analysis revealed that TAK1 protein levels were reduced by 50% in 5-day-injured TA muscle of TAK1scko mice compared with TAK1f/f mice (Fig 1h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the levels of TAK1-binding protein, TAB1, were also found to be considerably reduced in injured muscle of TAK1scko mice (Fig 1h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that TAK1 in satellite cells is essential for skeletal muscle regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Inactivation of TAK1 inhibits regenerative myogenesis in mice', 'Regeneration of myofibers upon injury involves hierarchical expression of myogenic regulatory factors Myf5, MyoD, and myogenin and embryonic/developmental myosin heavy chain (eMyHC)5,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no detectable expression of eMyHC in uninjured TA muscle of either genotype (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the expression of eMyHC was clearly evident on the 5-day-injured TA muscle sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, a more uniform and abundant expression of eMyHC was evident in TA muscle of TAK1f/f mice compared with TAK1scko mice (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The size and number of eMyHC+ fibres were significantly reduced in regenerating TA muscle of TAK1scko mice compared with corresponding TAK1f/f mice (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of eMyHC (gene name: Myh3) were significantly reduced in injured muscle of TAK1scko mice compared with TAK1f/f mice (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we found that the mRNA levels of Myf5, MyoD and myogenin were significantly reduced in injured TA muscle of TAK1scko mice compared with injured TA muscle of TAK1f/f mice (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, a significant decrease in the mRNA levels of Myf5 and myogenin was noticeable in uninjured muscle of TAK1scko mice compared with TAK1f/f mice (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot analysis also showed that the protein levels of eMyHC, MyoD and myogenin were drastically reduced in

significantly increased the number of PI+ cells in TAK1f/f cultures, suggesting that spurious activation of NF-B can lead to cell death through necroptosis in WT satellite cells (Fig 8g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, NF-B is a well-known regulator of both cell survival and death55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results also showed that the forced expression of caIKK enhanced the number of cells in G2/M phase of cell cycle and increased the proliferation of Pax7+ cells in TAK1scko cultures (Fig 8h,i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed a significant increase in the proportion of Pax7+/MyoD+ cells with concomitant decrease in proportion of Pax7/MyoD+ cells in TAK1scko cultures transfected with caIKK (Fig 8j,k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of caIKK significantly reduced ROS levels in TAK1scko cultures transfected with caIKK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we found that caIKK increased oxidative stress in TAK1f/f cells (Fig 8l).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that continued activation of IKK for longer duration increases oxidative stress that leads to satellite cell death through necroptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results suggest that TAK1 promotes satellite cell proliferation

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Satellite cells are primarily a quiescent cell population in adult skeletal muscle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, like other stem cells, satellite cells also self-renew to maintain a pool of healthy cells2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In response to exercise, traumatic muscle injury or degenerative muscle disorder, these cells undergo several rounds of cell division to produce fusion competent myoblasts to support growth, repair and regeneration1,3,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although replenishment of satellite cell population is pivotal for maintaining skeletal muscle regenerative capacity2, a reduction in the pool or function of satellite cells can compromise muscle regenerative capacity and may eventually lead to muscle wasting similar to that observed during aging57 and in various genetic muscle disorders such as muscular dystrophy3,58,59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of the present study demonstrate that TAK1 is activated in satellite cells and plays an important role in survival, proliferation and maintenance of satellite cell pool and repair of skeletal muscle upon injury in adult mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Inactivation of TAK1 in satellite cells impairs early muscle regenerative program leading to severe deficit in repair of injured myofibers (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While there was a drastic reduction in the Pax7+ satellite cells in injured myofibers, the number of satellite cells was also found to be significantly reduced in naive skeletal muscle or on freshly isolated myofibers of TAK1scko mice (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results further demonstrate that TAK1 is essential for the proliferation and survival of satellite cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A marked reduction in the number of EdU+ nuclei was clearly evident in the regenerating myofibers of TAK1scko mice compared with TAK1f/f mice (Fig 4ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduced proliferation of satellite cells was also evident on cultured single myofibers of TAK1scko mice (Supplementary Fig 3) and in purified TAK1scko satellite cell cultures (Fig 4dg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of TAK1 drastically reduced the proliferation of satellite cells (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we also observed that the continued inhibition of TAK1 increases oxidative stress and causes cell death through induction of both apoptosis and necroptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are in agreement with other published reports also suggesting that TAK1 is essential for cellular homeostasis in other organs22,35,36,37,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduced number of Pax7+ cells in naive and injured muscle of TAK1scko mice with concomitant inhibition in the early markers of muscle regeneration are potentially due to diminished sustainability and increased mortality of satellite cells, which in turn leads to a depletion in the pool of satellite cells that facilitate the regenerative program upon injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A recent study has shown that Pax7 is also expressed in a rare subpopulation of spermatogonial stem cells60 and therefore there is a possibility that the tamoxifen-treatment protocol used in our study may also reduce the levels of TAK1 in spermatogonia leading to potential non-cell autonomous effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we believe that this is not the case because ablation of TAK1 in cultured satellite cells leads to similar phenotypic outcomes as observed in skeletal muscle tissues of TAK1scko mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, for our studies, we gave localized injections of BaCl2 to TA muscle only which should not affect the proliferation of Pax7+ cells in spermatogonia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Pax7 is a pivotal regulator for satellite cell biogenesis, survival, specification and self-renewal2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although exact mechanisms remain unknown, our results suggest that TAK1 is required for maintaining the expression of Pax7 in satellite cells (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While TAK1 appears to be required for the gene expression of Pax7, it has no role in regulating the gene expression of MyoD in proliferating satellite cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibition of TAK1 reduces the mRNA level of Pax7 but not MyoD (Fig 5ik).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased levels of MyoD protein observed after inhibition of TAK1 may be a result of increased stability of MyoD protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, previous studies have shown that the activation of NF-B (a downstream target of TAK1) reduces the stability of MyoD in response to inflammatory cytokines16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, our results demonstrate that the inactivation of TAK1 inhibits basal levels, as well as TNF-induced NF-B activation in satellite cells (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous studies have shown that TAK1 is required for the differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Satellite cells first differentiate into myoblasts, which in turn fuse with injured myofibers to complete the repair process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we found reciprocal changes in the levels of Pax7 and MyoD, it is noteworthy that Pax7/MyoD+ TAK1scko cells may not undergo terminal differentiation because TAK1 is also required for the activation of p38 MAPK in myogenic lineage committed myoblasts to progress through differentiation43,44,61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, reduced differentiation potential of surviving TAK1-deficient myoblasts could be another reason for the deficit in muscle regeneration in TAK1scko mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Accumulating evidence suggests that disruption of TAK1-mediated signalling can cause cell death through apoptosis or necroptosis34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apoptosis has been traditionally considered as the physiological mode of cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, necroptosis, which is morphologically related to necrosis, is now recognized as another mode of programmed cell death39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RIPK1 is activated through oligomerization of upstream adaptor molecules such as FADD and TNF receptor-associated death domain that are triggered by TNF or Fas ligand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, activated RIPK1 activates RIPK3 resulting in necroptosis38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inactivation of TAK1 induces oxidative stress in keratinocytes leading to their reduced survival52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, oxidative stress has been found to induce necroptosis in some cell types53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate that the inhibition of TAK1 significantly increases ROS accumulation in satellite cells (Fig 6k,l).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we have found that while only a small percentage of TAK1scko satellite cells undergo apoptosis, a vast majority of them die through necroptosis (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there are reports suggesting that satellite cells undergo apoptotic cell death62,63,64, our study provides initial evidence that necroptosis could be another mechanism of satellite cell mortality especially in the conditions where TAK1-mediated signalling is disrupted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'NF-B is one of the important signalling pathways activated through TAK1-dependent mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of TAK1 complex leads to the phosphorylation of IKK in its activation domain leading to the activation of NF-B through phosphorylation and proteolytic degradation of IB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dissociation of IB unmasks the nuclear localization signal of NF-B, permitting nuclear import and transcriptional activity15,16,55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Constitutive activation of NF-B inhibits terminal differentiation of myogenic cells in response to inflammatory cytokines and in genetic muscle disorders such as muscular dystrophy15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the role of NF-B in satellite cell proliferation and survival remains poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate that inactivation of TAK1 inhibits NF-B pathways in satellite cells and this appears to be a critical mechanism for the poor survival and proliferation of TAK1-deficient satellite cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forced activation of NF-B through overexpression of a constitutive active mutant of IKK improved survival and increased proliferation of TAK1scko satellite cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, overexpression of caIKK increased the proportion of Pax7+/MyoD+ cells in TAK1scko cultures (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the role of NF-B in prevention of apoptosis is well known, we have found that overexpression of caIKK also prevents necroptotic cell death in TAK1-deficient cells (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are in agreement with a recently published report demonstrating that the inhibition of IKK can induce necroptosis in malignant B lymphocytes65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, there is also a report suggesting that NF-B is essential to prevent oxidative stress and necroptosis in response to interferon- (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we observed improvement in the proliferation and survival of TAK1scko satellite cells upon overexpression of caIKK, it is notable that spurious activation of NF-B by itself can cause satellite cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of caIKK significantly increased oxidative stress and cell death by necroptosis in WT (that is, TAK1f/f) cells (Fig 8g,l), which is consistent with previous reports that NF-B regulates both cell survival and death55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have found that the phosphorylation of JNK was also significantly reduced in the TAK1scko cultures compared with TAK1f/f satellite cells (Fig 9a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  JNK1 is an important regulator of cellular proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on the upstream stimuli and cell type, activation of JNK can promote cellular viability or apoptosis67.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study has shown that the activation of JNK through disruption of MEK-5 increases the proportion of Pax7+ cells during regenerative myogenesis11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate that while overexpression of constitutively active mutant of JNK1 had no effect on cell survival, it significantly increased the proportion of Pax7+ cells and mRNA levels of Pax7 in TAK1scko cultures (Fig 9c,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, caJNK1 significantly reduced oxidative stress in TAK1-deficient satellite cells (Fig 9g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, inhibition of JNK appears to be another reason for the reduced proliferation of satellite cells upon inactivation of TAK1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While our experiments indicate that TAK1 regulates satellite cell function through activation of NF-B and JNK1/2, a drawback of these experiments is that the overexpression of caIKK or caJNK1 can cause supra-physiological activation of NF-B or JNK pathways, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our rescue experiments are limited to cultured satellite cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies will determine whether forced activation of NF-B or JNK1 in physiological range can promote satellite cell survival and function in TAK1-deficient mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, our study provides initial evidence that TAK1 is required for satellite cell proliferation and survival and for regeneration of adult skeletal muscle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies should determine whether the disruption of TAK1 is a potential cause for the depletion of satellite cells and their function in various muscle degenerative disorders and during aging.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Supplementary Table 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ", 'Quantification of mRNA was done using the SYBR Green method on ABI Prism 7300 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately, 25 l of reaction volume was used for the real-time PCR assay that consisted of 2 × (12.5 l) Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 400 nM of primers (0.5 l each from the stock), 11 l of water and 0.5 l of template.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thermal conditions consisted of an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing and extension at 60 °C for 1 minute and a final step melting curve of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 15 s and 95 °C for 15 s. All reactions were carried out in duplicate to reduce variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data were analysed using SDS software version 2.0, and the results were exported to Microsoft Excel for further analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data normalization were accomplished using the endogenous control -actin and the normalized values were subjected to a 2Ct formula to calculate the fold change between the control and experimental groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The formula and its derivations were obtained from the ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detection System user guide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Statistical analyses and general experimental design', 'We calculated sample size using size power analysis methods for a priori determination based on the s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and the effect size was previously obtained using the experimental procedures employed in the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For animal studies, we estimated sample size from expected number of TAK1scko mice and littermate TAK1f/f controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated the minimal sample size for each group as eight animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering a likely drop-off effect of 10%, we set sample size of each group of six mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For some experiments, three to four animals were found sufficient to obtain statistical differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals with same sex and same age were employed to minimize physiological variability and to reduce s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  from mean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exclusion criteria for animals were established in consultation with a veterinarian and experimental outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In case of death, skin injury, sickness or weight loss of  greater than 10%, the animal was excluded from analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissue samples were excluded in cases such as freeze artefacts on histological section or failure in extraction of RNA or protein of suitable quality and quantity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals from different breeding cages were included by random allocation to the different experimental groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animal experiments were blinded using number codes till the final data analyses were performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical tests were used as described in the Figure legends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results are expressed as mean±s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analyses used two-tailed Students t-test to compare quantitative data populations with normal distribution and equal variance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A value of P less_than 0.05 was considered statistically significant unless otherwise specified.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
