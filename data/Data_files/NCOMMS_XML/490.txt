Visualization of anisotropic-isotropic phase transformation dynamics in battery electrode particles  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Anisotropy, or alternatively, isotropy of phase transformations extensively exist in a number of solid-state materials, with performance depending on the three-dimensional transformation features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fundamental insights into internal chemical phase evolution allow manipulating materials with desired functionalities, and can be developed via real-time multi-dimensional imaging methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report a five-dimensional imaging method to track phase transformation as a function of charging time in individual lithium iron phosphate battery cathode particles during delithiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrochemically driven phase transformation is initially anisotropic with a preferred boundary migration direction, but becomes isotropic as delithiation proceeds further.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observe the expected two-phase coexistence throughout the entire charging process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect this five-dimensional imaging method to be broadly applicable to problems in energy, materials, environmental and life sciences.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Direct observation of anisotropic (isotropic) phase transformation and mapping phase evolution is of importance in design and optimization of functional materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  X-ray tomography allows for characterization of the three-dimensional (3D) internal structure of large-volume structures1,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This technique has long been used in life, medical and earth sciences to deliver 3D morphology information at micron-scale resolution5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In recent years, lens-based full-field transmission x-ray microscopy (TXM) with nanotomography capability has seen growing use in studying energy-storage materials7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further progress in observing intermediates and chemical phases responsible for materials performance requires quantitative measurement methods combining chemical sensitivity and high spatial resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy is sensitive to chemical and local electronic change of the probed element, and has been extensively exploited in characterizing fine structural change in a large variety of materials11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In combination with TXM, XANES enables mapping and tracking of chemical evolution under in situ conditions13,14,15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the in situ XANES mapping approach has largely been restricted to two-dimensional (2D) observation as the obtained signal is usually spatially integrated along depth direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For anisotropic phase transformations, quite common in technologically important materials, the method is limited in its ability to accurately capture phase evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although tomographic scans at dual (below and above the adsorption edge of the studying element) and multiple energies have been achieved to identify the chemical element distribution18,19, it remains very challenging to carry out in situ studies on energy-storage materials, which requires accurately tracking chemical phase evolution in 3D with nanoscale resolution and correlating it to electrochemical performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To pursue such studies using XANES requires reliable collection of multiple images over a 180°-rotation range at each energy point with sufficient energy resolution with the energy scanned across the absorption edge of the element of interest to produce a spectrum for each voxel of the sample inside a working electrochemical cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such an undertaking poses numerous technical and experimental difficulties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, using full-field hard X-ray microscopy, we demonstrate an implementation of in situ XANES nanotomography able to build five-dimensional (5D) data sets tracking phase evolution in lithium iron phosphate particles in a working lithium-ion battery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Olivine lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) was selected as a model material because of its well-known two-phase process and representative behaviours for many energy materials20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many-particle scale intercalation behaviour and atomic-scale phase transformation behaviours have been discussed in previous reports, but 3D features of single-particle phase evolution are yet to be fully established21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1 illustrates the basic principle of our approach, which is demonstrated using our full-field TXM with recently developed automated markerless tomography capability23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One specific feature of the setup is a built-in run-out correction system which enables automated tomography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, this eliminates the need for a marker mounted on the sample or a special feature inside of the sample, enabling a wider range of samples to be studied and easier sample preparation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, manual alignment of hundreds of 2D projection images for 3D reconstruction becomes unnecessary, facilitating increased 3D spatial resolution through rapid collection of many projections and enabling time-resolved studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another important feature of the setup is that the image distance, the distance of the CCD detector to the zone plate lens, is automatically adjustable as a function of energy, which ensures that optimal resolution is preserved throughout energy scans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these features make it practically feasible to combine XANES and nanotomography to study in situ phase transformations in 3D at nanoscale resolutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: 5D XANES tomography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic of experimental setup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A tomography data set spanning 90° to +90° is collected at each photon energy step (7,102 to 7,192 eV, 2 eV per step) across the near absorption K-edge of iron to produce chemical information for each voxel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By fitting the resulting spectra as a linear combination of spectra of end-phases, phase composition can be assigned to each voxel (shown in the right side of panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Chemical phase distribution as a function of capacity (or equivalently, time).Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Principle of XANES tomography', 'To acquire 3D XANES maps under in situ electrochemistry conditions, we designed a very compact half-cell fitting inside a quartz capillary, which enables us to record 2D projections over a complete angular range of 180° (see Supplementary Figs 12, Supplementary Movie 1) to ensure quality of 3D reconstructed structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1 shows the basic principle of XANES tomography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At each charging stage (equivalently, point in time), a full series of 2D images were collected at each energy point to reconstruct the 3D structure, and a total of 46 energy points data sets were recorded across the near absorption K-edge of iron element (photon energy ranges from 7,102 to 7,192 eV with 2 eV per step).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These 46 energy-dependent tomography data sets combined result in a 256 × 256 × 256 voxels 3D XANES data, where each voxel contains its own XANES spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each XANES spectrum of 256 × 256 × 256 voxels was then fitted as a linear combination of the bulk spectra of two standard olivine phosphate phases (LiFePO4 and FePO4) for all voxels, yielding a 3D map of the phase distribution over the sample volume (see Supplementary Figs 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By repeating above procedure as charging proceeds, 3D chemical phase transformation evolution as a function of charging time can be rendered, as shown in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Chemical phase evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Phase distribution as a function of charging time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cut-away views reveal a change

chemical phase evolution', 'At the beginning of charging, phase boundary propagation is anisotropic with preferred paths, aligned imperfectly along a certain direction (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two-phase boundary moves primarily along the y-axis and then has an inclination toward z-axis, so a curved rather than flat phase interface is observed, as presented in cut-away view in Fig 2a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To provide more detail on the anisotropic phase transformation, 3D morphology of the micron-sized particle at an earlier stage under charging is shown in Supplementary Fig 7 and Supplementary Movies 25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The projected views and the corresponding 3D morphologies reveal a strong dependence on directions, which is associated with anisotropic lithium-ion diffusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More details are clearly demonstrated in 3D morphologies shown in the two split-phase images in Supplementary Fig 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'With further charging, the particle becomes more delithiated and the phase boundary is seen to move along more directions and presents relatively isotropic features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This complex phase transformation behaviour is related to lithium-ion diffusion and misfit strain within solids24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In micron-sized particles, the ratio of surface energy to elastic energy is low, and misfit strain of the olivine phases can be relieved by the formation of cracks or structural dislocations17,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the weak driving force leads to phase boundaries propagating along preferential planes, producing the observed anisotropic behaviour at the beginning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As delithiation proceeds, the large lithium chemical potential gradient and growing internal strains may provide sufficient driving forces to move boundary propagation along multiple directions, producing the evolution towards isotropy as delithiation proceeds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to visualizing the evolution of phase distribution, our approach also allows quantitative determination, at particle scale, of phase composition by calculation of the 3D volume assigned to each phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The determined volume fractions as a function of charging time are shown in the histograms in Fig 2b, indicating a continuous phase transformation from LiFePO4 to FePO4 (the normalized Fe K-edge XANES spectra for standard LiFePO4 and FePO4 phases in Fig 2c show a 2 eV energy shift, representing the classic two-phase transformation from Fe2+ to Fe3+), which is consistent with the state-of-charge obtained from the electrochemical charging protocol (Fig 2d,e, Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The consistency between the 3D quantitative analysis and electrochemical performance measurement provides a validation of the in situ XANES mapping approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Internal phase distribution in partially charged LiFePO4', 'In addition to the anisotropic (and isotropic) phase transformation behaviours described, we observe two-phase coexistence within the LiFePO4 particle during the charging process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particularly, when phase boundaries propagation changes from preferred directions (anisotropy) to multiple directions (isotropy) at highly delithiated state, a core-shell structure is clearly observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A magnified cross-section view of LiFePO4 at a highly delithiated state is rendered in Fig 3a, showing the core-shell internal structure with small amounts of the initial LiFePO4 phase (green) remaining inside.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantitatively investigate the internal structure, a series of XANES spectra are extracted from the stack of slides vertically (Fig 3b) and horizontally (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both stacks of spectra show a significant shift of about 2 eV (Fe K-edge) in energy, which is consistent with the standard spectra for LiFePO4 and FePO4, indicating that internal phase composition is either LiFePO4 or FePO4 with the absence of intermediate phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus 3D XANES imaging of the internal structure provides further evidence that the classic two-phase coexistence for LiFePO4 persists at these reduced length scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Sliced analysis of partially charged LiFePO4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Sliced view of LiFePO4 at highly delithitated state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sliced

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The observed two-phase behaviour provides a concrete example for illustrating the limitations of 2D imaging approaches due to the unavoidable loss of chemical information along projection direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 4a shows the XANES tomography data for the same sample at a different view of angle, and as a comparison, the corresponding 2D projection maps at the two different orientations are shown in Fig 4b,c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large apparent deviation is observed between these 2D and 3D XANES maps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2D XANES maps in Fig 4 appear to imply some new/intermediate phases, especially for highly delithiated states (dark yellow colour in Fig 4b,c and many consecutive irons K-edge energy shifts in Fig 4d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar phenomenon was also observed in an operando 2D study (Supplementary Figs 912), which was performed on a similar sample in a conventional coin cell (the setup in Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although new/intermediate phases appear in these 2D XANES maps, it is hard to make any accurate chemical determination from the projected maps (Supplementary Figs 1012).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In reality, these new or intermediate phases are an artefact caused by the difficulty of uniquely interpreting complex 3D structures on the basis of projected images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As demonstrated here for the single-particle transformation in LiFePO4, non-destructive XANES tomography avoids such difficulties, enabling more robust insight into internal and 3D evolution phase distribution during a chemical transformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: 2D projections of full data sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) 3D phase distribution evolution at a different visual angle from Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this view, it is difficult to make any conclusion about anisotropy/isotropy of phase transformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b,c) 2D projection XANES maps obtained from two different angles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These maps spatially compress chemical information, particularly for highly charged states where chemical phase identification becomes increasingly difficult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d,e) 2D projection XANES and composition analysis obtained from the line profile in c.
