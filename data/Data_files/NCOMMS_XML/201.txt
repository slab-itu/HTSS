Anthropogenic noise increases fish mortality by predation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Noise-generating human activities affect hearing, communication and movement in terrestrial and aquatic animals, but direct evidence for impacts on survival is rare.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined effects of motorboat noise on post-settlement survival and physiology of a prey fish species and its performance when exposed to predators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both playback of motorboat noise and direct disturbance by motorboats elevated metabolic rate in Ambon damselfish (Pomacentrus amboinensis), which when stressed by motorboat noise responded less often and less rapidly to simulated predatory strikes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prey were captured more readily by their natural predator (dusky dottyback, Pseudochromis fuscus) during exposure to motorboat noise compared with ambient conditions, and more than twice as many prey were consumed by the predator in field experiments when motorboats were passing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study suggests that a common source of noise in the marine environment has the potential to impact fish demography, highlighting the need to include anthropogenic noise in management plans.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Since the Industrial Revolution, anthropogenic (man-made) noise has changed the soundscape of many terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  International legislation, such as the US National Environment Policy Act and the European Commission Marine Strategy Framework Directive, recognizes the need to assess and manage the biological impacts of noise-generating human activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, while recent studies have demonstrated that anthropogenic noise can detrimentally affect animal hearing thresholds, communication, movement patterns and foraging3,4,5, it is often difficult to translate these effects into meaningful predictions about individual fitness and population-level consequences6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because animals may be able to move away from noise sources, acoustic disturbance may be sporadic, and compensation by organisms may prevent long-term impacts3,6,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent correlative evidence suggests that naval sonar may cause mortality in beaked whales9, but it is impossible to test this directly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, there is a clear need for experimental studies on tractable organisms that investigate directly whether common sources of anthropogenic noise reduce survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In marine environments, noise pollution is derived from a variety of sources including pile-driving, seismic surveys, shipping and motorboat traffic3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Much of this noise occurs in coastal regions, which are experiencing unprecedented human population growth10 and thus significant rises in transportation, fishing and recreation activities that involve boating11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, there were  greater than 12.5 million registered motorboats in the USA in 2013 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12) and there are expected to be 0.5 million recreational motorboats using the Great Barrier Reef by 2040 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Motorboats are therefore a prevalent and increasing source of anthropogenic noise, with emerging evidence that this noise could affect communication, orientation and territorial behaviour in fish14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike industrial sources of noise such as pile-driving and commercial shipping, it is relatively straightforward to design studies that use motorboats in controlled experiments to test impacts of noise on marine organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we examine the effect of motorboat noise on predatorprey dynamics and survivorship using a model coral reef system that lends itself to manipulation, observation and replication: the Ambon damselfish Pomacentrus amboinensis and its predator, the dusky dottyback Pseudochromis fuscus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Damselfishes share life-history traits with the majority of benthic and coastal fishes and invertebrates, typified by demersal, site-attached adults that produce pelagic larvae that develop in open water before settling to suitable habitat where they will live as juveniles and adults15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On settlement to reef habitat, young naïve fish encounter a suite of novel predators and suffer high rates of mortality that make the first few days post-settlement a critical population bottleneck16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested the impact of motorboat noise on the post-settlement survival, physiology and performance of P. amboinensis when exposed to the predator P. fuscus, thus providing a direct assessment of the fitness consequences of anthropogenic noise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that both motorboat noise and direct disturbance by motorboats elevated stress and reduced anti-predator responses, more than doubling mortality by predation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our study demonstrates a direct impact of anthropogenic noise on predatorprey dynamics and quantifies, for the first time, the negative consequences for prey survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining laboratory and field experiments, utilizing playbacks and real noise sources, we provide strong evidence that motorboat noise can have detrimental effects on anti-predator behaviour, potentially as a result of increased stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our model system, boat noise favoured the predator, with the prey suffering reduced fitness; the winners and losers in other predatorprey interactions will depend on the relative hearing sensitivities and noise tolerances of the species involved, as well as the particular noise source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, previous tank-based playback studies have shown that additional noise can reduce the foraging success of fish and crabs25,26, although whether this translates into consequences for fitness is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains to be determined whether repeated exposure to boat noise would result in increased tolerance by P. amboinensis, and thus a lessened impact over time8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, tolerance can only develop, and compensation is only possible, in animals that survive predatory attacks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Elevated stress in response to noise was indicated by the increased active metabolic rate of P. amboinensis27; previous work has also suggested that noise can cause stress in fish20,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A general allostatic stress response could result in decreased locomotor activity29 or affect attention22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both are possible explanations for the reduced likelihood of startle responses by prey to predatory attacks, also seen in laboratory work on eels and crabs utilizing playback and simulated predator assays20,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduced performance of prey in response to a predator could also arise from noise-induced distraction30 or from the masking of acoustic cues indicating the approach of a predator31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we focussed on the critical life-history period immediately following settlement of larval reef fish to benthic habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experiments suggest that motorboat noise could increase mortality at this transitional stage; future experiments are needed to test the spatial scale of impact for a range of species at key life-history stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In those coral reef environments where motorboat noise is a frequent event, for example the Great Barrier Reef, this level of disturbance could affect the demography of impacted populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A range of stressors increasingly threatens coral reefs (refs 32, 33), yet reefs generate important revenue for many countries through tourism, and provide food and livelihoods through fisheries to 500 million people33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If sufficient resilence is to be retained for reef ecosystems to survive predicted global climate change, managing current and local environmental stressors has been proposed as an essential goal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work highlights the need for anthropogenic noise to be included in environmental management plans and, in general, the importance of assessing the direct fitness consequences of anthropogenic noise.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Exeter (2013/247).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Acoustic stimuli and playback conditions', 'Daytime ambient recordings were made in the bay in front of Lizard Island Research Station (where all field trials were conducted) at five different inshore sandy-bottom locations, at 35 m depth and always  greater than 100 m from reefs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At each location, a recording was also made with one of five of the research station boats (5-m-long aluminium hulls with 30 hp Suzuki outboard motors) motoring at various speeds 10200 m from the hydrophone and accelerometer, replicating the kinds of boat operations common in coral reef environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Much of the Great Barrier Reef lagoon is  less_than 40 m deep and fishermen, divers and tourists typically operate motorboats in shallow water ( less_than 10 m deep) over and through reefs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At popular sites on the Great Barrier Reef, many boats may pass over a reef each hour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recordings were taken from a kayak moored using an anchor without chain to avoid unwanted noise (for example, waves on the hull of a boat), and were made 1 m above the seabed for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acoustic pressure was measured using a calibrated omnidirectional hydrophone (HiTech HTI-96-MIN with inbuilt preamplifier, manufacturer-calibrated sensitivity-164.3 dB re 1 V/Pa; frequency range 0.0230 kHz; calibrated by manufacturers; High Tech Inc., Gulfport MS) and a digital recorder (PCM-M10, 48 kHz sampling rate, Sony Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particle acceleration was measured using a calibrated triaxial accelerometer (M20L; sensitivity following a curve over the frequency range 03 kHz; calibrated by manufacturers; Geospectrum Technologies, Dartmouth, Canada) and a digital 4-track recorder (Boss BR-800, 44.1 kHz sampling rate, Roland Corporation, Los Angeles, CA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recording levels used with each set-up were calibrated using pure sine wave signals from a function generator with a measured voltage recorded in line on an oscilloscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For the playback experiments, a unique compilation of three of the five ambient recordings (made using Audacity v2.0.2, http://audacity.sourceforge.net) was used for each control track, and compilations of three of the five boat-noise recordings made at the same five locations were used for the

spectral content and sound levels showed that characteristics of the original recordings were at least partially retained in playback and that these characteristics differed between playback of ambient and motorboat noise in both the field and in tanks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As boat-noise playbacks in the tank were too loud to characterize fully using the accelerometer due to instrument sensitivity (clipping was observed), we could not describe the full extent of particle acceleration levels, although it is clear that they were louder than the ambient playback.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

at the point of startle were also calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Impact of boat noise on strikesuccess rate of predators', 'We tested the effect of boat-noise playback on the interaction between settlement-stage P. amboinensis and the predator P. fuscus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like many dottybacks, P. fuscus is resident in a small territory on coral heads, and hunts for newly settled damselfishes that typically shelter in the branches of a single coral head because of the risk of further relocation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adult P. fuscus were collected from reefs  greater than 2.5 km to the east of our study site by divers using a dilute clove oil solution and hand nets, and kept separately in a flow-through aquarium system (subsurface inflow of water, no bubblers) for a minimum of 3 days before use in the experiment (as per ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each day, P. fuscus were fed two live P. amboinensis that had been collected the previous night using light traps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The day before testing, P. fuscus were not fed; predators naturally feed episodically in the wild, and not feeding for 24 h ensured consistency between trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P. fuscus were transferred by scoop (to minimize stress from handling) into six 40 × 30 × 30 cm plastic tanks (2 mm walls, 25 cm water depth; subsurface inflow of water, no bubbler) inside larger plastic tubs (70 × 50 × 60 cm, 3 mm walls and 25 cm water depth) on separate benches to avoid sound transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each tank contained a live Pocillopora damicornis coral head (15 × 15 × 15 cm) collected locally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P. fuscus were given 24 h to acclimatize to their experimental habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Settlement-stage P. amboinensis were collected using light traps and kept in holding tanks as above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since they were collected before settlement and contact with reef habitat these fish were naïve to P. fuscus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before testing, 10 P. amboinensis were transferred by scoop into a 1 l jug and allowed to recover for 15 min, during which time they resumed normal swimming behaviour and ventilation rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An experimental arena was constructed from a smaller experimental plastic tank (40 × 30 × 30 cm, 2 mm walls, 25 cm water depth and acoustically transparent) inside a larger plastic tub (70 × 50 × 60 cm, 3 mm walls and 25 cm water depth).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A speaker (details above) playing either an ambient or a boat track was suspended in the larger tank to avoid contact with the sides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The allocation of ambient or boat playback treatments was alternated between the experimental benches each day, and the order of the trials was counterbalanced to avoid any effects of time of day on behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'At the start of each trial, 10 P. amboinensis were released into a section of the experimental tank separated from the P. fuscus by a transparent Perspex screen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 30 s, the screen was lifted and the activities of predator and prey observed from behind a hide for 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Every strike (targeted lunge) at a prey fish and capture (prey fish caught and eaten) were recorded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 15 min, the P. fuscus was removed and placed in a polythene bag for measurement of size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant difference was found in the length (mean±s.e., ambient: 75.9±1.1 mm, boat: 76.0±1.2, t-test: t=1.23, P=0.221) of P. fuscus allocated to the two treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thirty-six trials (six blocks of three trials per treatment) were conducted, with P. fuscus and P. amboinensis randomly allocated between treatments; predator and prey fish were only ever used once in the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Impact of boat noise on mortality due to predation', 'Data on survival of prey during interactions with predators were collected from two experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first was the tank-based experiment described above, in which the number of P. amboinensis remaining at the end of the 15 min trial was counted in addition to data on strike success of the predator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second modified the tank experiment to test the impact of boat noise in the field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, trials were conducted in upturned 30 l plastic aquaria, each containing a live Pocillopora damicornis coral head (15 × 15 × 15 cm), placed on sheets of Perspex on the sand in 23 m of water; separate aquaria were at least 10 m apart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Adult P. fuscus used in this experiment were collected and housed as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the day of the experiment, P. fuscus that had not been fed for 24 h were carried to a shaded location on the shore in individual holding pots held in 60 l bins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One P. fuscus was placed into each arena and given 15 min to acclimatize to its surroundings; during this time, either one of two different boats was driven continually at 10200 m distance from the arena (boat treatment) or the fish was exposed to ambient conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five settlement-stage P. amboinensis (collected and housed as above) were transferred by scoop into a 500-ml plastic pot and given 15 min to recover from capture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were then taken by snorkellers to the experimental arena and released.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The snorkellers left the arenas immediately after release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a treatment time of 15 min, the number of P. amboinensis remaining in the aquaria was counted by snorkellers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All fish were then removed and the size of each P. fuscus measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The order of trials was alternated between the two days of experiments to avoid any effects of time of day on experimental outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant differences were found in size (mean±s.e., ambient: 75.2±1.1 mm, boat: 75.1±1.5, t-test: t=0.07, P=0.942) of P. fuscus allocated to the two treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forty-four trials (two blocks of 11 trials per treatment; order of treatments alternated between blocks) were conducted, with P. fuscus and P. amboinensis randomly allocated between treatments; predator and prey fish were only ever used once.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
