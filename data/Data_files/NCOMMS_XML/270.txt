Generation and transplantation of reprogrammed human neurons in the brain using 3D microtopographic scaffolds  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cell replacement therapy with human pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons has the potential to ameliorate neurodegenerative dysfunction and central nervous system injuries, but reprogrammed neurons are dissociated and spatially disorganized during transplantation, rendering poor cell survival, functionality and engraftment in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present the design of three-dimensional (3D) microtopographic scaffolds, using tunable electrospun microfibrous polymeric substrates that promote in situ stem cell neuronal reprogramming, neural network establishment and support neuronal engraftment into the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scaffold-supported, reprogrammed neuronal networks were successfully grafted into organotypic hippocampal brain slices, showing an 3.5-fold improvement in neurite outgrowth and increased action potential firing relative to injected isolated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transplantation of scaffold-supported neuronal networks into mouse brain striatum improved survival 38-fold at the injection site relative to injected isolated cells, and allowed delivery of multiple neuronal subtypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, 3D microscale biomaterials represent a promising platform for the transplantation of therapeutic human neurons with broad neuro-regenerative relevance.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Neurodegenerative diseases and traumatic brain injuries result in a loss of functional neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) and are responsible for substantial deterioration in quality of life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although cell transplantation therapies have shown some promise towards functional recovery in animal models, the efficacy of these therapies has been limited by poor cell survival rates1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have recently emerged as a promising renewable source of expandable patient-specific cells that can be used to generate human neurons4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These iPS cell-derived neurons are a potentially invaluable tool as a cell source for the in vivo treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and traumatic CNS injury7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While many neuronal differentiation protocols have been established, a robust protocol was recently advanced for the accelerated production of human neuronal cells from iPS cells, called induced neuronal (iN) cells, by the direct conversion of iPS cells using ectopic expression of sets (Brn2, Ascl1, Myt1l) or single transcription factors (Ascl1, NeuroD1 or Ngn2) (refs 9, 10, 11, 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct conversion yields improved conversion efficiency and accelerates maturation relative to standard differentiation protocols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, effective approaches to generate these cells in three-dimensional (3D) configurations and to deliver these cells therapeutically in vivo have yet to be established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell replacement therapies of matured neurons in the brain have conventionally been limited to injection of dissociated cells2,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternative approach using biomaterial scaffolds can provide structural support to cells during transplantation, which could improve cell engraftment and survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, many types of cells behave differently when cultured in two-dimensional (2D) versus 3D substrates14,15, leading to the development of 3D biomaterials that better mimic aspects of the in vivo cellular microenvironment16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, microscale fibrous substrates enhance several neural cell behaviours in vitro, including neurite outgrowth17, neuronal maturation18 and neuronal differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results motivate the interfacing of microscale fibrous scaffolds with human induced neuronal cells for in vitro and in vivo applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concept of using 3D biomaterials to support transplantation has been used with synthetic hydrogels19, microparticles20 and natural protein matrices21,22 to transplant neural progenitor cells into the brain, however, these sorts of scaffolds are not conducive to extended culture or maturation of cells in vitro, and yield limited control of the cell microenvironment once transplanted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we advance the concept of designing electrospun synthetic polymer fibres to support the neuronal reprogramming of iPS cells within a 3D environment via the ectopic expression of NeuroD1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated that fine-tuning the fibrous architecture enhances neuronal maturation and functionality in vitro, and also reduces the population of residual unconverted cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we investigated the role of micron-scale fibrous scaffolds as injectable transplantation vehicles for adherent networks of iNs, and their ability to enhance the survival and engraftment of these neurons in murine brain tissue ex vivo and in vivo.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Induction of neurons via single defined transcription factors', 'We initially identified that of the four transcription factors (TFs), that is, Brn2, Ascl1, Myt1L and NeuroD1, used by Pang et al.12 to reprogram human fibroblasts to neurons, only Ascl1 and NeuroD1 could individually induce neuronal conversion of iPS cells, as also reported elsewhere10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early neurons induced by NeuroD1 expression exhibited complex neuronal morphologies and express mature neuronal markers, so all subsequent studies were done using NeuroD1 as the single TF for generating iN cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We transduced human iPS cells with lentiviruses encoding tetracycline-inducible, tetOn-NeuroD1, rtTA, and, in selected cases, tetOn-EGFP, and maintained them as undifferentiated iPS cells in mTeSR medium for multiple passages in the absence of doxycycline (dox; Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We refer to these cells as RN-iPS cells, since these cells were transduced with rtTA and NeuroD1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RN-iPS cells maintain expression of pluripotency markers SSEA-4 and Oct-4 over multiple passages in the absence of dox, indicating that they remain undifferentiated after transduction (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To assess neuronal induction from RN-iPS cells, dense cultures of RN-iPS cells were seeded and dox was added 24 h after plating (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early stage iN cells expressed neuronal marker III-tubulin and residual undifferentiated iPS cells expressed Oct-4 (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dox addition rapidly induces the loss of undifferentiated morphology and the acquisition of bipolar, early neuronal morphologies in a subset of cells within 48 h (Supplementary Fig 1ce).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dox also rapidly induces EGFP expression in control cells transduced with tetOn-EGFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, cells transduced with only tetOn-EGFP and rtTA (lacking tetOn-NeuroD1) show strong GFP fluorescence but maintain undifferentiated hPSC morphology upon dox addition (Supplementary Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite the rapid, dox-induced neuronal conversion of a subset of RN-iPS cells, the remaining undifferentiated cells proliferated and rapidly overtook iN cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this, cells were replated 4 days post dox treatment, which established more uniform human neuronal cultures and eliminated many undifferentiated cells (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The replating process may disrupt the cellcell contacts necessary for undifferentiated iPS cell survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After replating, enriched iN cells could be maintained for 4 weeks or longer before characterization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Characterization of neuronal conversion and maturation in human induced-neuronal cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic of long-term iN reprogramming to functional neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) After 12 days of conversion, iN cells express III-tubulin and MAP2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Further differentiation on glial cells for 28 days allows specification of several neuronal subtypes, including vesicular GABA transporter-expressing GABAergic neurons and tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing dopaminergic neurons, in addition to the predominantly glutamate vescular transporter-expressing glutamatergic neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Day 28 iN cells also extensively express mature neuronal makers such as the synaptic vesicle protein synaptophysin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Whole-cell current recordings demonstrate that iN cells after 14 days culture in the absence of glia are predominantly electrically active with functional voltage-dependent Na+ channels, as well as voltage-dependent K+ channels, and (f) fire repetitive induced-action potentials (n=27/27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 50 m.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cell therapies for treatment of CNS brain injury and disease are challenged by poor cell survival, engraftment and retention after transplantation both into the brain and spinal cord, with cell survival of less_than 1% routinely reported28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The objective of this study was to advance a new integrated biomaterials-based paradigm to both rapidly reprogram pluripotent stem cells to neurons and efficiently deliver enriched, organized neuronal networks to the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To achieve this, we engineered human iPS cells with the neuronal TF, NeuroD1, and demonstrated efficient and rapid neuronal conversion in 3D fibrous substrates fabricated from synthetic polymers that were geometrically tuned to accelerate neuronal maturation and network establishment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Utilizing this system, we report that 3D microfibrous substrates can guide many important characteristics of human iN cells derived from iPS cells that are relevant for in vivo applications, including (i) in vitro maturation, electrical activity and purification; (ii) neurite outgrowth, survival and electrical activity after transplantation into ex vivo brain tissue and (iii) survival and engraftment after transplantation in vivo into the striatum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results highlight the promise of biomaterials-based delivery as a platform for reprogramming and regenerative cell sourcing in the CNS and as a potential model that can be further adapted and evaluated for therapeutic efficacy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our primary hypothesis was that microfibrous substrates with thick fibres and interfibre spacing would provide a 3D microniche for rapid, high-purity conversion and accelerated maturation of iPS cell-derived iNs, and that such 3D substrate-supported neuronal networks would exhibit improved levels of retention and engraftment following transplantation into the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro, thick fibre substrates enhanced human iNs maturation and excitability, while selectively excluding residual undifferentiated iPS cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both of these phenomena arise from controlled cell confinement and 3D juxtacrine signalling organization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the enhanced MAP2 expression in iN cells in thick fibre substrates is consistent with previously reported results18,29,30,31, the concurrent increase in excitability indicates active both phenotypic and functional maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that the thick fibre substrates drive iN confinement24, leading to accelerated maturation due to increased engagement of neural cell-adhesion molecules such as L1 or N-cadherin, which have known roles in neural development32,33,34 and neuritogenesis29,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the thin fibre substrates fail to support neuronal infiltration and aggregation, resulting in the diminished excitability relative to more 3D, thick fibre substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For effective scaffolds that can form reprogrammed neuronal networks, a key feature is that the proliferation of undifferentiated iPS cells should be suppressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The geometry we have identified for electrospun scaffolds limits the proportion of undifferentiated iPS cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Undifferentiated human ES and iPS cells require media supplementation with the rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 to survive dissociation to single cells35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of Y-27632, the degree to which dissociated iPS cells can re-establish E-cadherin-mediated cellcell contacts that have been demonstrated to be required for survival and proliferation36 is severely diminished when seeded onto electrospun fibrous substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isolated pluripotent stem cells have been observed to form viable colonies largely based on motility-induced aggregation rather than single cell clonal expansion when intercellular distances were less than 6.4 m (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large surface area, added substrate dimension and constrained migration paths of the electrospun fibres effectively increase intercellular distances, which would limit motility-induced aggregation and could explain the observed increase in differentiation of iPS cells and loss of residual proliferative cells on microfibrous substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reduction in residual undifferentiated iPS cells could be used to supplement other methods for eliminating the risk of teratoma formation in vivo due to the presence of undifferentiated cells, however, additional studies are required to assess the tumorigenic potential of these cells once delivered in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'After establishing a substrate geometry that accelerated iN maturation, the ability of these substrates to promote engraftment of human iN cells into the CNS was first probed in an ex vivo organotypic brain slice model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Delivery of iN cells on microscale scaffolds markedly improved both neurite outgrowth and electrical functionality after transplantation compared with the effects of injected isolated cell suspensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that cell retention and survival are enhanced because transplantation of iN cells on microscale scaffolds preserves cellcell contacts while avoiding the need for dissociation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dissociation of cells before injection likely leads to increased anoikis38,39, contributing to diminished engraftment after transplantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The improvement in electrical activity after transplantation of iN cells in scaffolds is promising, and suggests that these benefits may translate in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Transplantation of iN cells in scaffolds into the mouse striatum showed that the percentage of viable cells after 3 weeks was an order-of-magnitude greater than that relative to injection of isolated single cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increased survival is likely indicative of decreased anoikis or apoptosis that otherwise arises from enzymatic disruption of cellcell and cellmatrix interactions38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are promising particularly in light of recent studies investigating the effects of human iPS cell-derived neurons on treating CNS disorders that have shown efficacy in vivo even with low levels of cell survival1,10, suggesting that increased cell survival could lead to amplified levels of efficacy of these cell therapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, host neuron post-synaptic markers were detected adjacent to pre-synaptic marker-expressing transplanted neurons, suggesting that single-factor reprogrammed neurons are capable of functionally integrating into host tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, some authors have found that extensive lesions can actually enhance neuronal graft survival and integration, as denervated targets may provide a positive stimulatory effect to new neurons40,41, suggesting that even greater cell survival may be possible when applying this scaffold system in a neurodegenerative disease or injury context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, the ability for 3D microscale scaffolds to support co-culture and concurrent transplantation of neuronal networks consisting of neurons of multiple subtypes was evaluated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transplantation of intact networks of mixed subtype neuron populations could be an invaluable tool for treating complex brain disorders or injuries that affect multiple subtypes, or for priming transplanted neurons with pre-established synaptic inputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, attempts for transplanting dopamine neurons derived from fetal brain tissue42,43 or derived from human iPS cells1,44 have been made and
