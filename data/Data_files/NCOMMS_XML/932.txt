Genome-wide association study identifies three novel loci in Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The structure of the cornea is vital to its transparency, and dystrophies that disrupt corneal organization are highly heritable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand the genetic aetiology of Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), the most prevalent corneal disorder requiring transplantation, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 1,404 FECD cases and 2,564 controls of European ancestry, followed by replication and meta-analysis, for a total of 2,075 cases and 3,342 controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify three novel loci meeting genome-wide significance (P less_than 5 × 108): KANK4 rs79742895, LAMC1 rs3768617 and LINC00970/ATP1B1 rs1200114.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observe an overwhelming effect of the established TCF4 locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we detect differential sex-specific association at LAMC1, with greater risk in women, and TCF4, with greater risk in men.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining GWAS results with biological evidence we expand the knowledge of common FECD loci from one to four, and provide a deeper understanding of the underlying pathogenic basis of FECD.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Corneal diseases are one of the most common causes of visual impairment and blindness worldwide, with Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) being the most common indication for corneal transplantation in the United States1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FECD is a bilateral, slowly progressive disorder of the corneal endothelium affecting 4% of population above the age of 40 years in the United States2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This debilitating disorder becomes symptomatic in the fifth or sixth decade of life4,5 and affects two to four times more women than men3,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinical presentation of FECD varies, but often includes corneal oedema that results in a loss of corneal clarity, painful episodes of recurrent corneal erosions and severely impaired visual acuity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Medical management is often inadequate requiring corneal transplantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histopathological changes in FECD include loss of endothelial cells, thickening of Descemet membrane (DM) due to excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix, formation of central excrescences on DM (corneal guttae) and subepithelial bullae and scarring7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FECD likely arises during neural crest differentiation8, but the reason for loss of functioning endothelial cells is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'FECD often clusters within families, with heritability estimated at 39% (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The understanding of genetics of FECD initially focussed on genetic linkage, as a consequence of the observation by Krachmer et al.5 that this disease showed a dominant mode of inheritance in families.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Linkage and fine-mapping studies in families identified rare point mutations in COL8A2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10), SLC4A11 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11) and TCF8 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12); these constituted the early genetic discoveries of Fuchs dystrophy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most recently, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) including 280 cases and 410 controls in both discovery and replication samples found common genetic variation in TCF4 to be associated with Fuchs dystrophy, along with two other loci that did not reach genome-wide significance13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The association with TCF4 has been replicated by multiple investigators, including our group14,15, and a subsequent publication suggested that a trinucleotide repeat expansion within intron 3 of the TCF4 gene is risk factor for this disease16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report the discovery of three new loci associated with FECD, KANK4 (KN motif- and ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 4), LAMC1 (laminin gamma-1) and LINC009970/ATPB1 (Na+, K+ transporting ATPase, beta-1 polypeptide), and confirm the strong effect of TCF4 variants in our large samples of FECD cases and controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we show evidence for sex-specific effects for associated markers at TCF4 and LAMC1, and describe the expression of the four risk loci in ocular tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loci identified in this GWAS have not previously been reported for any other corneal dystrophy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their discovery warrants further investigation into disease-causing mechanisms, including the maintenance of corneal endothelium integrity and fluid transportation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'GWAS and replication of associated regions', 'GWAS was performed on a discovery data set of 3,968 unrelated subjects, which include 1,404 cases and 685 controls selected from two FECD genetic study groups9,15 and 1,879 controls from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) Refractive Error Substudy17 (Supplementary Tables 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified six regions containing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with genome-wide significant associations (P less_than 5 × 108 from logistic regression), of which 18 SNPs were advanced to replication (Fig 1, Table 1 and Supplementary Figs 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed modest evidence for association at AGBL1 (P=7.5 × 105) and LOXHD1 (P=3.4 × 104), two of seven genes previously implicated in FECD through family-based and gene-targeted studies (Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Results from GWAS for FECD.Negative log P values (vertical axis) from 8,680,745 SNPs are shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The red horizontal line marks genome-wide significance (P=5 × 108).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Negative log P values are condensed above P=1012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vertical grey lines are chromosome boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genomic control parameter56 was 1.033, indicating adequate control of test statistic inflation from population stratification (Supplementary Fig 2).Full size image', 'Table 1 Major results from the FECD genome-wide association study.Full size table', 'Three independent data sets with a total of 671 FECD cases and 778 controls served as replication (Supplementary Table 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four out of six regions showed strong evidence (P less_than 5 × 108 from meta-analysis) for association with FECD in the discovery and replication cohorts (Table 1, Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The previously identified locus at TCF4 (refs 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20), encoding the transcription factor E2-2, remained the strongest association in both discovery and replication cohorts (most significant SNP rs784257; meta-P=2.5 × 10200), with the largest effect sizes in both the discovery (odds ratio (OR)=5.77, 95% confidence interval (CI)=5.05, 6.60) and replication (OR=3.89, 95% CI=3.30, 4.59) samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Replication was also successful in three regions on chromosome 1: intronic within the KANK4 gene (meta-P=1.2 × 1014 at rs79742895), intergenic region between LINC00970 and the ATP1B1 gene (LINC00970|ATP1B1, meta-P=9.9 × 1019 at rs1022114) and intronic within the LAMC1 gene (meta-P=6.9 × 1016 at rs3768617).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discovery sample was well powered ( greater than 0.9) to detect association of the index markers at these four loci with the observed effect sizes (Supplementary Table 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Properties of index variants', 'The most significant TCF4 SNP, rs784257, explained 21.9% of the variation in FECD in the discovery sample, whereas the top markers in the other three replicated genome-wide significant loci each explained between 0.9% and 1.5% of the variation in the discovery sample (Supplementary Table 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strong linkage disequilibrium (r2=0.88) exists between rs784257 and the previously reported variant rs613872, in the third intron of TCF4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both SNPs are in moderate disequilibrium with the expanded form of the CTG18.1 trinucleotide repeat in intron 2 of TCF4 (r2=0.47), consistent with the previously reported values of 0.65 and 0.31 between the triplet repeat and rs613872 in FECD cases and controls, respectively21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CTG18.1 repeat expansion is a strongly influential variant with good biologic plausibility22,23, but does not fully explain disease occurrence in all patients because of the lack of penetrance in some families21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Genetic risk scores were calculated for the discovery cohort based on the most significantly associated SNP from each of the four replicated regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The area under the curve (AUC) for FECD cases versus controls was 0.782 (95% CI=0.767, 0.797), showing strong predictive value compared to other complex traits analysed by GWAS24 (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Predictive value was primarily through genotypes at rs784257 in TCF4 (AUC=0.750;

http://www.broadinstitute.org/mammals/haploreg/haploreg.php).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reasoning that similar regulatory features may be shared between the corneal endothelium and other cell types of neural crest origin, we placed greater emphasis if the evidence came from these cell types, but used gene expression profiles from normal corneal endothelium as a guide for interpretation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then examined, by immunohistochemistry (IHC), patterns of relevant genes in corneal tissue sections from cases and controls using antibodies directed against specific gene products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Examining transcriptomic profiles from normal corneal tissue and focussing on a 1-Mb interval centred on the best SNP for each locus, we note that TCF4, ATP1B1 and LAMC1 are highly expressed in corneal samples comprising only the corneal endothelium and DM (Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LINC00970, the lncRNA closest to ATP1B1, shows no expression, while KANK4 shows minimal expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TCF4, a basic helixloophelix transcription factor, was detected in the nucleus of residual endothelial cells of Fuchs case samples by IHC (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No genotype data were available from the sample donors, and, therefore, we could not explore the influence of associated variants on gene expression in ocular tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our lead SNP in KANK4, rs79742895, was associated with promoter and enhancer mark enrichment in multiple tissues (Supplementary Data 2), conceivably altering motifs for transcription factors, hypermethylated in cancer1 and Y in Yang1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cellular function of KANK4 is poorly understood, but mutations in KANK proteins lead to steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modelling of mutations via knockdowns illustrate that 50% of kank2 morphant zebrafish develop periorbital oedema and kidney disease, which the authors ascribe to loss of kidney function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown analysis of the KANK3 orthologue in Caenorhabditis elegans suggests a role in cell-to-cell contact and tissue integrity28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Distinct from TCF4, KANK4 immunostaining revealed that localization of KANK4 is mainly within the endothelial cytoplasm in both control and FECD samples (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KANK family proteins may have a role in the regulation of actin stress fibres, which are hypothesized to hold the endothelial cell nuclei in place through cellular adhesion of the endothelial cytoplasmic layer29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'rs79742895, in KANK4, was also associated with an eQTL for the LINE-1 containing transposase domain containing 1 (L1TD1) gene 23.84 kb distal to KANK4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to KANK4, L1TD1 is only weakly expressed in the corneal endothelium (Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  L1TD1 is a RNA-binding protein involved in preserving pluripotency of stem cells via post-transcriptional regulation, showing high expression in pluripotent cells31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functions of moieties that interact with L1TD1 can be divided into three categories: RNA post-transcriptional modification, protein synthesis and gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emani et al.31 reported that LAMC1 is involved in protein synthesis under control of L1TD1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No other variants with r20.8 were located in linkage disequilibrium with rs79742895 and identified by HaploReg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The strongest functional evidence for rs3768617 in LAMC1 is with eQTLs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eight entries with significant eQTLs were found to map within LAMC1 or LAMC2, the vast majority in brain or nerve tissue (Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this variant, or others in linkage disequilibrium, appear to self-regulate the expression levels of LAMC1 and LAMC2, both of which have a key role as cell adhesion proteins in basement membranes, such as DM32; laminins are asymmetrically expressed on the endothelial side of DM33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockouts of this gene cause failure of ureteric bud development, or reduction in kidney size, with an insufficiency of water transport postnatally34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important feature of this model is the absence of basement membranes in the kidney early in development, and reduction in levels of integrin-6 and FGF2, key elements of cellular growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar LAMC1-knockout model in cardiomyocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells also exhibited lack of proper basement membrane formation, leading to inappropriate extracellular matrix deposition between cells that upset electrical signal conduction35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analogous defects likely occur in the corneal endothelium and DM in FECD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strengthening this hypothesis, IHC of control corneal endothelial samples pinpointed KANK4 and LAMC1 protein expression within the cytoplasm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In FECD cases, a decline in the number of endothelial cells resulted in concomitant decrease of KANK4 and LAMC1 positively stained cells (Supplementary Fig 8), which retained cytoplasmic expression of the proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'rs1200114 maps to an intergenic region between ATP1B1 and LINC00970, which does not show expression in the corneal endothelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, ATP1B1 shows high expression in the endothelium (Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This SNP shows no significant eQTLs in GTEx, but does show strong enrichment for enhancer and promoter marks, particularly in numerous brain tissues (Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The -subunit of the multimeric Na+,K+-ATPase has a key function in structural integrity of the protein, and its functional maturity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is a regulator of fluid balance, ion transport and maintains the cellular homeostatic equilibrium36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lack of ATP1B1 may lead to hypertonicity within the cornea and cause the corneal oedema seen in patients suffering from FECD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recognizing that ATP1B1 represented our most significant GWAS signal after TCF4, we sought additional supporting evidence at the gene expression level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unbiased mining of proteomic data by Poulsen et al.37 corroborated the expression of LAMC1 and ATP1B1 in disease-relevant tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By IHC using LAMC1 and ATP1B1 antibodies in three pairs of full-thickness corneas from FECD cases and controls, we confirmed expression of these proteins in the corneal endothelium (Supplementary Fig 9).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We identified three novel loci, KANK4, LAMC1 and ATP1B1, for FECD, and demonstrated cellular expression of TCF4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results support a multifactorial model for disease aetiology with strong predictive power (AUC=0.78 from an oligogenic risk-score model), although variants in TCF4 alone do a commendable job of predicting risk in Caucasians.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirm the strong association of variants such as rs613872 in TCF4, initially discovered by Baratz et al.13, and extend these results by demonstrating sex-specific effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, we observed only modest association at loci previously identified through family-based and candidate-gene studies10,11,12,38,39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our data favour LAMC1 as increasing risk in women, whereas TCF4 increases risk in men.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alleles at both loci are quite common, and their precise role in mediating sex-specific risk remains to be elucidated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results suggest that these proteins have essential roles in the corneal endothelium; for instance, water transport, appropriate basement membrane maintenance, as well as tissue integrity and cell-to-cell contact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disruption of these activities may lead to pathogenic processes characteristic of FECD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primary function of the corneal endothelium is to maintain a state of relative dehydration, with hindrance of routine fluid transport leading to corneal oedema.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that all three genes regulate fluid transport, with ATP1B1 having the most obvious role as it encodes a subunit of the sodium-potassium plasma membrane pump.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LAMC1 also has a role in normal basement membrane deposition, as shown in knockout models of the kidney and cardiomyocytes, possibly leading to thickening of the DM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although functional data supporting an effect of rs3768617 on LAMC1 expression exists in GTEx, this database does not include the cornea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Limited data on the function of KANK4 means that its function can currently only be inferred by analogy to its paralogues, KANK2 and KANK3, and is suggestive of maintenance of cell-to-cell contact and tissue integrity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In FECD, endothelial cells reduce in number and change shape to maintain regular contact with each other and to preserve the endothelial barrier to fluid entry into the corneal stroma41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identification of additional genetic risk factors adds to our understanding of FECD, thus enabling development of novel therapies for this disabling disease.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
