Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder first described in 1965 by Harry Angelman and is characterized by developmental delay, language impairment, intellectual deficits and oftentimes, seizures1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, AS patients have been referred to as Puppet children because these patients present with ataxia, happy affect and frequent bouts of laughter1,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prevalence of AS is estimated at 1/15,000 and is caused by the loss of the maternal 15q11q13 chromosomal region4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The 15q1113 chromosomal region is regulated by genomic imprinting, an epigenetic phenomenon in which the expression of an allele is determined by the parent of origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AS results from the loss of function of the UBE3A gene, a gene housed within this region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to genomic imprinting, UBE3A is solely expressed from the maternal allele in neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The paternal allele is silenced in these cells by the reciprocal expression of a long, non-coding antisense RNA3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the loss of the maternal allele of UBE3A results in the loss of UBE3A mRNA and protein in neurons5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The UBE3A gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase protein, also known as E6-associated protein, a molecule responsible for tagging target proteins for degradation by the proteasome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loss of ubiquitin ligase function in the neurons of patients with AS could cause the build-up of UBE3A target proteins that may contribute to disease pathogenesis6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Potential targets of UBE3A identified in mice include synaptic proteins such as EPHEXIN-5 and Arc7,8, suggesting that deficits in synaptic signalling may be involved in AS pathophysiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the frequent seizure phenotype associated with AS could result from changes in neuronal excitability or disturbances to the balance of excitation and inhibition9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, changes in intrinsic membrane properties and axon initial segment have also been reported in AS mouse models10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data, in combination with findings of impaired synaptic plasticity, altered dendritic spines, and the cognitive and seizure phenotypes associated with these models12,13,14,15,16, suggest that neurons from AS patients could have impairments in neuronal excitability and synaptic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The advent of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology allows for the generation of patient-specific nervous tissue, which can be used to model a variety of neurological disorders17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we generated iPSC-derived neurons from AS patients and unaffected control subjects to compare the development of intrinsic excitability, action potential (AP) firing and excitatory synaptic activity and synaptic plasticity in these cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that neurons derived from control subjects show an in vitro maturation of resting membrane potential (RMP), AP firing and spontaneous synaptic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurons derived from AS patients were similar to controls at early time points, but showed deficits that were generally apparent by 68 weeks in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, AS-derived neurons showed a more depolarized RMP, immature AP firing, decreased spontaneous excitatory synaptic activity and reduced capacity for activity-dependent synaptic plasticity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, these differences were maintained as late as 20 weeks in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These phenotypic differences can be directly attributed to loss of UBE3A because these differences were mimicked in control neurons by knocking out UBE3A in an isogenic CRISPR-Cas9 gene-edited cell line or knocking down UBE3A with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) against UBE3A, and the phenotype could be rescued in AS neurons by pharmacologically increasing paternal UBE3A expression with topoisomerase inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the selective effects of either disrupting UBE3A at late stages of in vitro development or mimicking the altered RMP during in vitro development suggest that changes in AP firing and synaptic activity may be secondary to altered RMP.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Characterization of AS and control cultures', 'Cells were plated via manual dissociation of neurosphere structures following the generation of embryoid body-like aggregates (Supplementary Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a differentiation protocol that, in the absence of specific morphogens, leads to a default generation of forebrain neurons18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar protocols have been used to generate cortical neurons and functional synaptic networks21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether the cellular composition of iPSC-derived cultures was affected by the AS genotype, we characterized neuronal cultures using immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For immunocytochemical experiments, cultures derived from AS and control subjects were fixed at 5 weeks in vitro and stained for TUJ1 (-tubulin), a neuron-specific microtubule protein, TBR1, a transcription factor specific for glutamatergic neurons and GAD65/67 or GAD67, markers for GABAergic neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were no significant differences between control and AS cultures in the proportion of glutamatergic neurons (Fig 1a; control: 66.9±6.4%; AS: 66.1±9.1%) or GABAergic neurons (Fig 1a; control: 24.8±0.7%; AS: 19.7±1.6%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also determined the percentage of astrocytes present in these cultures by staining for the nuclear marker 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and the mature astrocyte marker S100.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 17 weeks in vitro, the proportion of DAPI-positive cells that stained positive for S100 was not significantly different for AS and control cultures (Fig 1a; control: 12.6±2.7%; AS: 11.9±2.8%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Characterization of cell types in AS and control iPSC-derived cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Left: Immunocytochemical staining for TBR1/TUJ1 and GAD67/TUJ1, and S100/DAPI, in control and AS-derived cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 50 m.

±s.e.m.Full size image', 'Due to the heterogeneity of iPSC-derived neurons in culture, we noted the shape and location of each recorded cell by visual inspection to investigate whether phenotypic differences were specific to a particular cell morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were categorized according to three basic shapespyramidal, bipolar or multipolar (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, cells were classified according to location within the culture: mound, near mound and sparse (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mound cells were those located on the initial clusters of cells generated by neurosphere dissociation, near mound represents cells that migrated away from the mound but still extended processes into the dense mound structures and sparse represents groups of cells that were in areas devoid of mounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in the right panel of Fig 2b, the hyperpolarizing shift in RMP of control cells during development, and the lack of this developmental change in AS neurons, was seen uniformly across all cell morphologies and locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We next examined the specific role of UBE3A loss in the RMP phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two of the AS patient lines have a large deletion of chromosome 15q11q13 encompassing many genes, as is seen in the majority of patients with AS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third line was derived from a patient with AS caused by a 2 bp deletion in UBE3A that results in loss of the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This patient line shows a similar RMP phenotype to the large deletion lines (Fig 2a), suggesting that loss of UBE3A alone is the cause of the genotypic difference in RMP observed in our AS lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further explore the causative role of UBE3A loss, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing was used to target both maternal and paternal UBE3A alleles in a control line to generate an isogenic UBE3A KO line, which resulted in almost total loss of UBE3A protein (Supplementary Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the AS patient lines, neurons derived from the UBE3A KO line also showed a more depolarized RMP throughout development compared to both the grouped control data and the isogenic control line (Fig 2a), further indicating that loss of UBE3A alone is responsible for the RMP phenotype observed in the AS patient lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Since KO of UBE3A results in loss of UBE3A protein throughout the entire time course of iPSC-derived neuronal development, we next wanted to know whether acute loss of UBE3A could also induce the AS phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of control neurons at 6 weeks in culture (early) for 72 h with ASOs specific for UBE3A resulted in 60% reduction UBE3A mRNA expression (Supplementary Fig 3e) and UBE3A protein (Fig 2d), with no change in GABARB3, a gene also located in the chromosome 15q11q13 region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three to six weeks after ASO treatment, we recorded ASO and scramble-treated neurons and observed a significant depolarization in RMP in the ASO-treated neurons (Fig 2c), suggesting that acute knockdown of UBE3A at early stages of in vitro development is sufficient to produce the AS phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, knockdown of UBE3A by ASO treatment at 18 weeks in culture (late) also produced a significant depolarization in RMP in the ASO-treated neurons (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no difference in the knockdown of UBE3A by ASO between early and late treated cells (Supplementary Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As ASOs may have off-target effects, experiments were conducted using two different ASOs against UBE3A, which showed similar knockdown of UBE3A (Supplementary Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was also no significant difference between high and low dose (Supplementary Fig 3e), thus all ASO data were combined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ASO treatment of AS-derived neurons, which also acts as a control for off-target effects, showed no change in RMP (Supplementary Fig 3d), consistent with the lack of UBE3A in AS neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that knockdown of UBE3A alone can cause a depolarization of RMP independent of neuron maturity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, due to neuron-specific genomic imprinting, the paternal copy of UBE3A, though silenced, is still present in AS-derived neurons, and therefore is an attractive therapeutic target for restoring endogenous UBE3A to normal levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown that treatment of an AS model mouse with the topoisomerase inhibitor topotecan can restore some UBE3A expression from the paternal allele, most likely by reducing the expression of the antisense that normally silences paternal UBE3A23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of AS-derived neurons with 1 M topotecan for 36 weeks resulted in 50% increase in UBE3A mRNA expression (Supplementary Fig 3e) and a significant shift to a more hyperpolarized RMP (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data suggest that restoring UBE3A protein levels by unsilencing paternal UBE3A can rescue the AS RMP phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Impaired AP firing in AS neurons', 'AP firing in response to intracellular current injection was categorized as either No AP, Immature, Single Mature or Mature Train (see example traces in Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  APs were characterized as mature if AP amplitude was  greater than 35 mV and full-width at half-maximal amplitude (FWHM) was  less_than 5.5 ms. An immature AP was one that failed to meet these criteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A mature train was defined as having three or more mature APs during the 500 ms depolarizing step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 38 weeks in culture, neurons from controls and AS patients showed similar distributions (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Week-by-week data for each group are shown in Supplementary Fig 4g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is interesting to note that even immediately after plating (3 weeks), 5060% of cells from both control and AS-derived cultures had mature firing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At later time points, however, there were significant genotype differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control neurons showed a significant developmental shift to a larger proportion of cells expressing mature AP firing, reaching 90% of cells at 20 weeks in culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AS-derived neurons failed to show similar developmental maturation, resulting in a lower proportion of cells that fired AP trains and a higher proportion of immature APs in AS neurons (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar lack of maturation of AP firing was observed in the isogenic UBE3A KO line compared to control neurons (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Characterization of AP firing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Example traces representing four AP firing patterns used for characterization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 20 mV, 100 ms (b) Distribution of AP firing patterns for control (CTR; 4 subjects; n greater than 250 at each time point), AS (3 subjects; n greater than 250 at each time point) and UBE3A KO (1 line; n greater than 40 at each time point) neurons at three developmental time bins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  *P less_than 0.0001 for differences between control and AS; 2 test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  #P less_than 0.0001 for differences between control and UBE3A KO;  test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) AP firing distributions for (top to bottom) control neurons treated with UBE3A ASOs at 6 weeks in culture (7 coverslips, 15 cells per coverslip), control neurons treated with UBE3A ASOs at 18 weeks in culture (4 coverslips, 15 cells per coverslip), AS neurons treated with 1 M topotecan (24 coverslips, 15 cells per coverslip), KCl (10 mM) treated control neurons from four control subjects (n=15 cells per coverslip for 1 coverslip for both vehicle and KCl for each control line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  *P less_than 0.0001, 2 test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Example calcium imaging traces of spontaneous activity from control, AS and UBE3A KO cultures; scale bar, 30 s.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'AS is a genomic imprinting disorder caused by loss of function of the maternally inherited allele of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, UBE3A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously shown that normal imprinting of UBE3A is established during neuronal differentiation of iPSCs derived from AS and control subjects, and UBE3A protein expression is largely absent in neurons derived from AS iPSCs26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we examined genotypic differences in in vitro development and maturation in iPSC-derived neurons from AS patients and unaffected controls, from the time of initial plating up to week 20 post differentiation, considerably longer than previous examinations of iPSC-derived neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were also classified by shape and by location with respect to their proximity to cell mounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both genotypes, the majority of neurons were TBR1-expressing, presumably glutamatergic, neurons, while GAD65/67-expressing GABAergic neurons constituted the other major cell population, and there were no differences between AS and control cultures in the proportion of glutamatergic neurons, GABAergic neurons or astrocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Neurons from AS patients had several significant differences compared to neurons derived from unaffected controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, AS-derived neurons displayed a more depolarized RMP, a reduction in the proportion of cells that fired mature APs, a reduction in excitatory synaptic activity and a deficit in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences were seen in cells from two AS patients with a large deletion, as well as a patient with a mutation in UBE3A alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, these differences were generally not present at the earliest stages of development, but reflected a failure of AS-derived neurons to undergo the developmental maturation observed in control neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, some aspects of maturation, for example, synaptic activity, showed continued development up to 20 weeks in culture reaching levels of activity greater than typically reported in other studies of iPSC-derived neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This highlights the importance of allowing for prolonged maturation in these cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, these genotypic differences were consistent across different neuronal morphologies and locations, suggesting that the phenotype is shared by multiple cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Several lines of evidence support the idea that these genotypic changes are attributed directly to loss of UBE3A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, cells derived from the patient with a UBE3A mutation had the same cellular phenotype as cells derived from the large deletion patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, knocking out UBE3A in an isogenic CRISPR-Cas9 gene-edited cell line replicated the phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, knocking down UBE3A with an ASO produced the same cellular phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we were able to rescue this phenotype by unsilencing UBE3A expression from the paternal allele with the topoisomerase inhibitor topotecan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, early ASO knockdown of UBE3A affected RMP, AP firing and synaptic activity, whereas late knockdown only affected RMP, suggesting that changes in RMP may be directly related to UBE3A loss and AP and synaptic changes may be secondary effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this idea, we found that control neurons, grown under slightly depolarizing conditions to mimic AS neurons, showed similar disruptions in AP firing and synaptic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Findings from a recently published study of iPSC-derived neurons further support this argument27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study, which classified iPSC-derived neurons into five categories based on electrophysiological maturity, showed that cells with immature firing tended to have the lowest levels of synaptic activity, although whether RMP was also predictive was not addressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Several aspects of neuronal physiology showed significant developmental maturation in culture as well as genotypic differences between AS patients and control subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resting membrane potential, which plays an important role in regulating neuronal excitability and the ability to fire APs, showed a developmental shift to a more hyperpolarizing potential that was not seen in AS-derived neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although neurons from both AS and control subjects showed similar RMP values at the earliest time points, AS neurons remained significantly depolarized compared to controls at later times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AS-derived neurons were also different from controls with regard to the development of mature AP firing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to RMP, no significant difference in AP firing between AS and control neurons was observed at the earliest time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the proportion of neurons that fired mature APs or AP trains increased in control neurons at later times and was significantly greater than AS-derived neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As observed with RMP and AP firing, AS neurons and control neurons showed similar levels of excitatory synaptic activity early in development, as measured by the percent of synaptically active neurons and frequency of spontaneous synaptic events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As development progressed, however, AS neurons reached a plateau in the percentage of cells that displayed spontaneous synaptic currents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control neurons, on the other hand, continued to mature, reaching a significantly higher proportion of active neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the frequency of synaptic events and the proportion of synaptically active neurons in AS and control cultures was not different early in their development, but by weeks 914, the proportion of active cells was significantly higher in control cultures compared to AS-derived cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, there was also a small increase in synaptic event amplitude in AS neurons, possibly reflecting a compensatory response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed synaptic differences could be due to a number of factors including decreased release probability, fewer synaptic contacts or a larger proportion of silent synapses, that is, synapses that lack AMPA receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies will be necessary to determine the contributions of these factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The connections between neurons are highly plastic, changing their size, strength and structure in response to a variety of stimuli28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity is known to be important for the proper development of neural circuits and may play a role in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders14,30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, disrupted synaptic plasticity is a hallmark of AS mouse models14,32,33,34,35,36 and may underlie some of the cognitive impairments in AS patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These plasticity deficits include disrupted hippocampal LTP, impairments in experience-dependent synaptic plasticity and impaired long-term depression (LTD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Impaired hippocampal LTP may underlie learning deficits in AS mice35 and other work has shown that this AS LTP phenotype may be due to changes in calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II37 and has been rescued with inhibition of the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, it seems that plasticity deficits may become more important with sensory experience during development, as dark rearing AS mice prevents LTP deficits14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, type 5 metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent LTD was shown to be enhanced in an AS mouse model33 and changes in cerebellar LTD have been associated with both loss of maternal UBE3A and duplication of UBE3A in mouse models39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the relevance of these forms of plasticity to behavioural phenotypes in AS and other neurodevelopmental disorders, one of the critical challenges to the use of human stem cell models is generating neurons with the capacity to undergo activity-dependent plasticity41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the current study, we report the novel finding that iPSC-derived neurons exhibit NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity in culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both control and AS-derived neurons responded to the pharmacological induction protocol with large increases in activity, and though control neurons showed short-term (2030 min) and long-term (5060 min) synaptic plasticity expressed as an increase in the frequency of spontaneous synaptic events, long-term synaptic plasticity was significantly impaired in neurons from AS patients and UBE3A KO neurons compared to controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in synaptic current frequency with no change in amplitude suggests increases in presynaptic release probability and/or changes in synapse number due to formation of new synapses or insertion of AMPA receptors at silent synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pharmacological LTP induction also caused long-term increases in AP firing in control neurons, as monitored by intracellular calcium imaging, but did not increase firing in AS neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasticity of AP firing has also been shown in human stem cell-derived neurons using multielectrode arrays42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this protocol provides a valuable model for more detailed investigations exploring differences in synaptic plasticity between AS and control neurons, including underlying molecular signalling pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, iPSC-derived neurons may provide insights into alterations in synaptic plasticity implicated in the pathophysiology of other neurogenetic disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Stem cell-derived neurons have been increasingly used to identify pathophysiology in neurological disorders43,44,45,46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies of iPSC-derived neurons found that these cells can display repetitive AP firing, inward sodium currents  greater than 1 nA and input resistances consistent with the findings reported in this study48,49,50,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reported values for resting membrane potential and frequency of spontaneous synaptic currents are also similar43,52,53,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The development of active and passive membrane properties as well as spontaneous synaptic activity has also been studied, although typically only up to 1013 weeks in vitro55,56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both of these previous studies report RMP, AP firing and levels of spontaneous synaptic activity that are similar to those observed in our cultures at the corresponding developmental time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Devlin et al.56 shows no maturation of these properties over time, as the mean RMP, distribution of AP firing and proportion of neurons with spontaneous synaptic activity remains static throughout in vitro development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Tang et al.55 study does show maturation of these properties from plating to 60 days post plating, and the findings in our study best match the maturation observed when astrocytes were included in their cultures, suggesting that our culture conditions provide an environment that supports continued maturation of these neuronal properties without requiring exogenous astrocytes or astrocyte-conditioned media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this, we continue to see maturation of AP firing and half-width, transient outward currents, proportion of synaptically active neurons and frequency of spontaneous synaptic currents up to 20 weeks in vitro, which has not been reported in other studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At our latest time points, most of our control neurons best match what Bardy et al.27 defines as Type 5 cells, in both level of synaptic activity and type of firing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our AS-derived cultures seem to correspond to the more immature Type 1, Type 2 and Type 3 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar ranges of firing maturity as well as intrinsic currents and RMP have been observed in human embryonic stem cell-derived cultures57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional maturation in the present studies may be strongly enhanced by the presence of astrocytes intrinsic to the culture, as well as the addition of exogenous growth and survival factors, namely brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Because AS patients as well as mice with a maternally inherited UBE3A deletion show a seizure phenotype, changes in neuronal and/or synaptic properties that alter excitability are of great interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been reported that neurons from AS model mice have abnormal spine morphology13 and decreases in the frequency of both spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supporting this finding, reduction of UBE3A expression via transfection with short hairpin RNAs that target UBE3A reduced AMPA receptor surface expression and decreased AMPA-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission in transfected neurons7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, a study using mice with a maternally inherited deletion of UBE3A found that the RMP in hippocampal neurons from 8-week old animals was slightly hyperpolarized compared to controls11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, loss of Dube3a in Drosophila melanogaster leads to hyperpolarization in muscle cells58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of a depolarized RMP in these models may be due to the difference in species or age at the time of recording.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the similarities between findings in AS mouse models and the present results in human neurons suggest that patient-specific iPSC-derived neurons are capable of modelling deficits specific to the AS phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this, similar findings of altered excitatory synaptic transmission in a mouse model of Rett syndrome have also been observed in iPSC-derived neurons from Rett syndrome patients45,59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, the present study used iPSC-derived neurons from AS patients and unaffected control subjects to examine the maturation of neuronal and synaptic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, our results reveal marked differences between AS-derived and control neurons in RMP and the development of intrinsic excitability, maturation of AP firing and excitatory synaptic activity and plasticity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These genotypic differences may provide a cellular phenotype for further investigations of the specific role of UBE3A and its downstream signalling mechanisms, and for identifying and evaluating therapeutic strategies to ameliorate the symptoms of AS and related neurodevelopmental pathologies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
