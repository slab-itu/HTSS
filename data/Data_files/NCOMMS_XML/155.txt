Autocrine selection of a GLP-1R G-protein biased agonist with potent antidiabetic effects  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor (GLP-1R) agonists have emerged as treatment options for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GLP-1R signals through G-protein-dependent, and G-protein-independent pathways by engaging the scaffold protein -arrestin; preferential signalling of ligands through one or the other of these branches is known as ligand bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the discovery of the potent and selective GLP-1R G-protein-biased agonist, P5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified P5 in a high-throughput autocrine-based screening of large combinatorial peptide libraries, and show that P5 promotes G-protein signalling comparable to GLP-1 and Exendin-4, but exhibited a significantly reduced -arrestin response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preclinical studies using different mouse models of T2DM demonstrate that P5 is a weak insulin secretagogue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, chronic treatment of diabetic mice with P5 increased adipogenesis, reduced adipose tissue inflammation as well as hepatic steatosis and was more effective at correcting hyperglycaemia and lowering haemoglobin A1c levels than Exendin-4, suggesting that GLP-1R G-protein-biased agonists may provide a novel therapeutic approach to T2DM.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycaemia arising from a combination of insufficient insulin secretion together with the development of insulin resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incretin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an endogenous peptide hormone secreted from intestinal endocrine cells in response to food intake1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GLP-1 lowers postprandial glucose excursion by potentiating glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic -cells and has also recently been shown to promote -cell survival in rodents2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, GLP-1 exerts extra-pancreatic actions such as promoting gastric emptying, weight loss and increasing insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, incretin-based therapies represent a strategy for the treatment of T2DM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'GLP-1 exerts its action through the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R)4 expressed in the pancreas, other peripheral tissues, and the central nervous system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of GLP-1R triggers Gs-protein coupling leading to an elevation of cyclic AMP (cAMP), modulates intracellular calcium concentration5 and induces -arrestin recruitment6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Historically, -arrestins were believed to serve an exclusive role in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) desensitization8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it has since been shown that -arrestins can also function to activate signalling cascades9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, in the pancreatic -cell, elevation of both cAMP and cytosolic Ca2+ and -arrestin signalling downstream of GLP-1R activation are critical events in promoting glucose-dependent insulin secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recently, the concept of functional selectivity or ligand bias has emerged whereby ligand binding promotes engagement of only a particular subset of the full GPCR signalling repertoire to the exclusion of others11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A better understanding of GLP-1R pleiotropic signalling and the underlying physiological consequences might provide new avenues for the development of drugs with novel modes of action that have the potential to provide greater therapeutic value while possibly avoiding unwanted side effects12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore we developed an autocrine-based system, to screen large and diverse, combinatorial peptide libraries containing up to 100 million different members with the aim of identifying potent, selective, G-protein-biased GLP-1R agonists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified one such ligand, designated P5 and have characterized its in vitro pharmacological phenotype, and explored its therapeutic potential.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Autocrine-based selection of a novel GLP-1R agonist', 'To identify potential G-protein-biased ligands for the GLP-1R we expressed a peptide library at the cell surface of a reporter cell line co-expressing the GLP-1R and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene under the control of a CRE promoter (HEK293-GLP-1R-GFP) to screen for peptides that induce GLP-1R-mediated cAMP production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This autocrine system coupled to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) has the capability to screen as many as 20 million events per hour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Exendin-4 (Ex4) is a 39 amino acid peptide agonist of the GLP-1 receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C-terminal regions of Ex4 interact with the N terminus extracellular domain of the GLP-1R, facilitating the interaction of the Ex4 N terminus with the transmembrane domain of the receptor leading to receptor activation3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the peptide Exendin 939 (Ex 939; Ex4 lacking the 8 first amino acids) behaves as a competitive antagonist14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of these Exendin structureactivity insights, three combinatorial peptide libraries consisting of random 710 amino acids fused to the N terminus of Ex 939 were generated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As several GPCR natural ligands are cyclic peptides such as calcitonin, oxytocin and somatostatin15, two libraries encoding cyclic peptide N termini (either randomized tetrapeptide (CX4C), or pentapeptide (CX5C)) were designed (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third library consisted of seven random amino acids fused to the N terminus of the Ex 939 (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each library was inserted between a cleavable interleukin 2 signal sequence used to promote cell surface localization and a linker followed by the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) transmembrane domain to anchor the library at the cell surface (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the mCherry fluorescent protein was fused to the C terminus of the PDGFR sequence to enable monitoring of transduction efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Autocrine-based system for selection of agonists from large combinatorial peptide libraries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic representation of the peptide libraries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Schematic representation of the membrane-tethered Exendin-4 (top) and FACS analysis of mCherry and GFP expression 2 days after transduction of HEK293-GLP-1R-GFP cells with the membrane-tethered Exendin-4 displaying different linker size (bottom).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Schematic representation of the autocrine-based selection of combinatorial peptide library.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lentivirus peptide libraries are preparred from lentiviral plasmids (step 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CRE-responsive GLP-1R reporter cell line is transduced with lentiviral library (step 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GFP expressing cells are sorted (step 3) and peptide-encoding genes are amplified from genomic DNA of sorted cells to make the library for the next selection round (step 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After iterative rounds of selection, enriched peptide sequences are analysed by deep sequencing (step 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Enrichment of GFP positive cells during three rounds of FACS selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) N termini sequences of top 13 peptides (frequency greater than 1.0% representation).Full size image', 'To determine the optimal length of the linker between the peptide sequence and the PDGFR transmembrane anchor we first infected HEK293-GLP-1R-GFP cells with lentivirus encoding membrane-tethered Ex4 containing one, two or three repeats of the GlyGlyGlyGlySer linker sequence (Fig 1b, top panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tethered Ex4-mediated GLP-1R activation as determined by FACS analysis was found to be independent of the length of the linker between the PDGFR transmembrane domain and the peptide library (Fig 1b, bottom panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the three libraries described above were inserted upstream of a single linker sequence followed by the PDGFR anchor for large peptide library screening (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following lentiviral infection of the HEK293-GLP-1R-GFP cell line with the peptide libraries (encoding 106 distinct peptides), active peptides were selected by multiple rounds of enrichment using our standard protocol16 (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To achieve single copy integration, a multiplicity of infection  less_than 1 was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following each round of selection, genes encoding the active peptides were recovered from sorted cells by PCR and subcloned into a lentiviral vector to generate an enriched library used for the next round of selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the first round, no significant enrichment could be detected (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, following a second round, enrichment was observed (0.31% of the population) and by the third round of selection, 10.6% of the cells were GFP positive (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using deep sequencing, 13 peptide sequences with frequency higher than 1% were identified following the third round of selection and considered as hits (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, we identified putative agonist sequences from the linear heptapeptide (X7) and the heptapeptide (CX5C) library but not from the hexapeptide library (CX4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, all 13 sequences were unrelated to the N terminus of the parent molecule Ex4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'P5 is a selective and potent G-protein-biased GLP-1R agonist', 'To assess potential signalling bias, the active peptides were further characterized in vitro using distinct assays that monitor receptor proximal signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell-based assays for Gs-protein (cAMP production), Gq-protein (intracellular Ca2+ mobilization) and -arrestin (1 and 2) signalling were used to determine the potency (EC50;

Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When compared with GLP1, P5 was 3-folds more potent (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is generally accepted that the GLP-1R-mediated increase in Ca2+i in -cells is due to GLP-1R activation of the Gs pathway, inducing cAMP- and PLC/ Ca2+-dependent responses, rather than via Gq/11 signal transduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the P5-induced increase in Ca2+i in CHO-GLP-1R expressing cells was inhibited by the selective Gq inhibitor FR900359 (refs 17, 18; Supplementary Fig 1d) confirming that GLP-1R can functionally couple to Gq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous reports have demonstrated that the GLP-1R also directly couples to -arrestin 1 and -2 following activation with Ex4 (refs 6, 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore we examined the ability of P5 to induce recruitment of -arrestin 1 and -2 using a cellular assay that monitors the direct interaction between -arrestin and the receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P5 showed a greatly diminished efficacy and potency (Emax=29 and 32%; EC50=447 and 529 nM, for -arrestin 1 and -2 recruitment, respectively), when compared with the reference agonist Ex4 (EC50=29.57 and 5.6 nM for -arrestin 1 and -2 recruitment, respectively; Fig 2d,e) and to the endogenous peptide GLP-1 (Emax=71 and 77%; EC50=280 and 60 nM for -arrestin 1 and -2 recruitment, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We further quantified the relative bias of P5 using an equiactive comparison and Ex4 as the reference ligand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The endogenous ligand GLP-1, did not demonstrate detectable bias, whereas P5 yielded bias factors (), of 0.9 and 1.4 for Gs-protein over -arrestin 1 and -2, respectively, and of 1.7 and 2.4 for Gq-protein over -arrestin 1 and -2, respectively (Fig 2f; Supplementary Table 1), thus confirming that P5 has a preference for promoting GLP-1R-mediated G-protein activation over -arrestin recruitment (referred to as G-protein bias).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As -arrestin recruitment is believed to play a key role in GPCR desensitization, we further investigated the effect of P5 and Ex4 on GLP-1R desensitization using a label-free assay which allows non-invasive bioimpedance-based measurement of an integrated cellular response19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this assay, P5 and Ex4 induced concentration-dependent changes in cellular impedance and displayed similar potency (0.029 and 0.015 nM, respectively) and efficacy (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is well established that following a first stimulation, GPCRs that undergo desensitization display reduced responsiveness to a second stimulation with an agonist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, CHO-GLP-1R-expressing cells were stimulated for 60 min with 0.001, 0.01 or 0.1 nM of P5 or Ex4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, the ligand-containing medium was removed; the cells were washed three times and further incubated in assay buffer for 30 min before being stimulated a second time with a fixed concentration of Ex4 (0.1 nM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In CHO-GLP-1R exposed to P5, the variation of cellular impedance induced by the second stimulation was similar to the control (Fig 2h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in CHO-GLP-1R exposed to Ex4 the response to a second stimulation was significantly attenuated in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig 2h).These data suggest that P5 has less propensity to induce GLP-1R desensitization when compared with Ex4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'P5 is a weak insulin secretagogue and improves glucose tolerance', 'As P5 clearly demonstrated ligand bias in vitro with respect to Ex4, the challenge was to determine how the in vitro bias activity of P5 translates to in vivo efficacy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared the acute effects of escalating doses of P5 versus Ex4, on glucose tolerance, in lean mice; genetically induced obese mice (ob/ob); or diet-induced obese (DIO), insulin-resistant mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 8-week-old lean mice fed on normal chow, a single injection of P5 or Ex4 significantly improved glucose disposal in a glucose tolerance test (GTT) at doses ranging from 0.1 to 10 g kg1, when compared with injection of vehicle only (Fig 3ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, P5 dosed at 1 g kg1 lowered fasting blood glucose levels with a faster onset as indicated by a greater correction of glucose levels at the 15 min time point when compared with the same dose of Ex4 (178±10 versus 247±27 mg dl1; Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, at the lowest dose tested (0.1 g kg1), P5 showed improved efficacy at all time points and significantly decreased value of area under the curve (AUC; Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data indicate that P5 at 0.1 g kg1 improved blood glucose tolerance to the same extent as a 100-fold higher dose of Ex4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, P5 failed to improve glucose tolerance in the GLP-1R knockout mice (GLP-1R/; Fig 3d) indicating that the peptide does not display any apparent off-target effects that may contribute to its glucoregulatory activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data indicate that in metabolically healthy lean mice, P5, a G-protein-biased agonist of the GLP-1R, has a sustained and greater glucoregulatory activity compared with the reference agonist Ex4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Acute administration of P5 lowers glucose in diabetic mice.Effect on intraperitoneal glucose tolerance after a single intraperitoneal co-injection of saline (black), Ex4 (blue) or P5 (orange) with glucose challenge (n=5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glucose tolerance in lean mice treated with 10 g kg1 (a), 1 g kg1 (b) or 0.1 g kg1 (c), in GLP-1RKO treated with 1 g kg1 (d), in ob/ob mice treated with 1 g kg1 (e) and in DIO mice treated with 1 g kg1 (f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (gi) Effect of P5 on plasma insulin levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasma analysis was performed after a single intraperitoneal co-injection of saline (black), 1 g kg1 of Ex4 (blue) or 1 g kg1 of P5 (orange) with glucose challenge (n=5) in lean mice (g), in ob/ob mice (h) and in DIO mice (i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (j) Blood glucose levels measured in ob/ob mice after a single intraperitoneal co-injection of saline (black), Ex4 (blue) or P5 (orange) with insulin (n=5).Data are mean±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistic by two-tailed t-test: *P less_than 0.05;

Supplementary Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In good agreement with our previous results, GTT of ob/ob mice treated with 10 g kg1 of P5 or Ex4 showed a similar and complete correction of glucose clearance in response to glucose challenge (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this mouse model of T2DM, P5-treated animals also showed a slightly but significantly improved glucoregulatory activity at the 15 min time point compared with Ex4 when dosed at 1 g kg1 (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to our previous observations in lean mice, ob/ob mice dosed with 0.1 g kg1 of P5 or Ex4 showed a similar correction of glucose clearance in response to a glucose challenge (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, both P5 and Ex4 significantly decreased the value of AUC of glucose tolerance test when compared with the control group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next tested P5 efficacy in the DIO mouse model of pre-type 2 diabetes (obese hyperglycaemic and insulin-resistant mice).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As previously reported20, DIO wild-type mice fed on the high-fat diet displayed impaired glucose tolerance (Fig 3f) compared with wild-type mice fed with normal chow (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single injection of P5 or Ex4 (1 g kg1) significantly improved glucose clearance in response to the glucose challenge as indicated by a significant decrease in the AUC of GTT when compared with control; however, compared with Ex4, P5 was slightly less efficient in clearing glucose in the context of acute glycaemic control (Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As GLP-1 agonists contribute to glycaemic control by potentiating glucose-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion from pancreatic  cells21, we compared the effects of the biased agonist P5 with Ex4 on plasma insulin levels in response to the glucose challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In chow-fed lean mice, P5 or Ex4 dosed at 1 g kg1 significantly increased the level of insulin compared with control mice (Fig 3g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, although P5 displayed a greater glucoregulatory activity compared with Ex4 in lean mice (Fig 3ac), Ex4 potentiated the insulin secretory response to a greater extent than P5, reaching significantly higher plasma insulin level at the 15 min time point when compared with a similar dosing of P5 (Fig 3g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation suggests uncoupling of the P5s glucoregulatory activity from its insulin secretagogue activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In hyperinsulinemic ob/ob mice, P5 dosed at 1 g kg1 only modestly potentiated the insulin secretory response when compared with control group, whereas Ex4 significantly increased the level of insulin when compared with either the control group or to the P5-treated group (Fig 3h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a higher dose (10 g kg1), P5 significantly increased plasma insulin level in ob/ob mice when compared with control group (Supplementary Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, consistent with our previous observation, the insulin secretory response was significantly lower when compared with a similar dosing of Ex4 (Supplementary Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In DIO mice, a single injection of P5 or Ex4 (1 g kg1) significantly increased plasma insulin level when compared with control group (Fig 3i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as we observed in lean chow-fed and ob/ob mice, plasma insulin levels were significantly lower in response to P5 compared with the same dose of Ex4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that P5, a GLP-1R G-protein-biased agonist peptide, displays decreased insulin secretagogue activity relative to the reference agonist Ex4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, in an acute setting, P5 significantly improved glycaemic control in metabolically healthy animals as well as in both mouse models of T2DM suggesting that P5 might act as an insulin sensitizer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we examined the effect of a single injection of P5 on insulin sensitivity using an insulin tolerance test in hyperinsulinemic ob/ob mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-injection of P5 or Ex4 (1 g kg1) similarly enhanced the hypoglycaemia response to insulin (Fig 3j) in an acute setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'P5 is more effective at controlling chronic hyperglycaemia', 'To determine whether chronic treatment with the GLP-1R G-protein-biased agonist can improve hyperglycaemia, ob/ob mice were treated daily with 10 g kg1 of P5 or Ex4 for 3 weeks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both peptides significantly decreased food intake (Fig 4a) and body weight (Fig 4b) during the initial phase of treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, by day 21 of treatment, in contrast to Ex4, P5 did not significantly affect body weight or fat mass when compared with vehicle-treated ob/ob mice (Fig 4b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, treatment with P5 significantly decreased ad libitum-fed blood glucose levels (Fig 4d) without affecting insulin levels (Fig 4e) whereas Ex4 treatment had no effect on glycaemia (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the differences in Ex4 and P5 in vivo efficacy are not due to differences in peptide pharmacokinetics as both peptides display similar half-life in mouse serum (supplementary Fig 3).These data suggest that P5 has superior antihyperglycaemic efficacy in diabetic ob/ob mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Chronic administration of P5 improves glycaemic status in diabetic mice.Effect on food intake (a), body weight (b), fat mass (c), ad libitum-fed plasma glucose (d) and insulin (e) levels following daily subcutaneous injection of saline (black), Ex4 (blue) and P5 (orange) at 10 g kg1 in ob/ob mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (fh) Effect of 10 g kg1 (f,h;

10 g kg1, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The superior effect of P5 in lowering HbA1c level correlates well with its superior efficacy in lowering both fasting and non-fasting blood glucose level at 1,

In addition, histological analyses of the pancreas revealed that both the G-protein-biased agonist and Ex4 preserved proper insulin immunoreactivity (Fig 4l, red), and significantly increased islet area (Fig 4l).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together these data indicate that P5 has superior antihyperglycaemic efficacy compared with Ex4 in hyperglycaemic ob/ob mice as well as in insulin-resistant DIO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As the G-protein-biased agonist is a weak insulin secretagogue, it is likely that in the context of chronic treatment additional -cell-independent mechanisms contribute to its superior glucoregulatory activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we further investigated the effects of P5 on the circulating levels of glucagon and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), two other hormones involved in the regulation of glucose homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the highest dose tested, both peptides tend to decrease glucagon level (Supplementary Fig 4b), but interestingly, treatment with both 1 and 10 g kg1 of P5 resulted in a significant increase in GIP level whereas Ex4 showed efficacy only at the highest dose (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we monitored body weight, and determined the effect of chronic treatment with P5 or Ex4 on the levels of adipose tissue-secreted hormones including leptin and resistin in DIO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our previous observation in ob/ob mice, at the highest dose tested (10 g kg1), both P5 and Ex4 induced a modest decrease in body weight during the initial phase of treatment (Supplementary Fig 5a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in contrast to Ex4, P5 dosed at 10 g kg1 did not decrease fat mass when compared with vehicle-treated animals (Supplementary Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, at the highest dose tested P5 was capable of decreasing circulating leptin levels similarly to Ex4 (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, chronic treatment with 10 g kg1 of P5 resulted in a significant decrease in circulating levels of resistin (Fig 5c), an adipokine shown to negatively impact glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Ex4 had no significant effect on resistin levels (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because leptin and resistin levels are regulated by the activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR) in epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT), we further examined the expression of PPAR23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PPAR mRNA expression was significantly upregulated and protein levels were nearly 1.7-fold greater in mice treated with P5 or Ex4 when compared with vehicle-treated DIO mice (Fig 5d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, both treatments also lead to an upregulation of the PPAR-regulated gene Glut4, a protein implicated in glucose uptake in response to insulin (fig.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the PPAR-regulated gene CD36 was significantly upregulated only in eWAT from P5-treated DIO mice (Fig 5f) suggesting that P5 and Ex4 treatments might differentially affect PPAR activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As PPAR and CD36 are involved in adipocyte differentiation and adipogenesis we performed histological analyses of eWAT25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DIO mice treated with 10 g kg1 of P5 had smaller and more numerous adipocytes when compared with control or Ex4-treated animals (Fig 5g,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that in DIO mice treated with the G-protein-biased agonist, the adipose tissue mass increases via hyperplasia (increasing cell number) rather than via hypertrophy (increasing adipocyte size).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies demonstrated that in mice on high-fat diet, eWAT expansion correlates with the accumulation of pro-inflammatory macrophages into adipose tissue contributing to insulin resistance27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, P5 significantly reduced the number of pro-inflammatory F4/80+-CD11c+ macrophages (Fig 5i,j) and the expression of the cytokine tumour-necrosis factor- in eWAT (Fig 5k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data suggest that P5 and Ex4 induce distinct changes in eWAT consistent with improved insulin

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'GPCR peptide ligands have always been noted for their selectivity, potency and rapid optimization, however, typically peptides are chemically synthesized which is a low-throughput process that intrinsically lacks diversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although affinity-based screening technologies such as phage and yeast display enable the high-throughput screening of large combinatorial peptide libraries, they rely on the use of recombinant protein or membrane preparations and do not distinguish between agonists, inverse agonists and antagonists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this, we have developed a functional cell-based, autocrine system for the selection of ligands from large intracellular combinatorial peptide libraries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This functional cell-based system, can allow screening of 100 million peptides at 2 million events per hour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the proof-of-concept experiments presented here, we have generated and screened three distinct peptide libraries and show how this methodology allows one to detect and identify novel GLP-1R ligands with unique pharmacology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, this autocrine-based selection system is a powerful approach that can be used to deorphanize orphan GPCRs and be applied to other cell surface receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'GLP-1R agonist-based therapies have emerged as a pharmaceutical approach for the treatment of T2DM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the currently approved treatments with GLP-1R agonists demonstrate remarkable antidiabetic effects, further improvements in this class are expected such as long-term glucose control29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, adverse side effects and concerns regarding safety profile following prolonged use of GLP-1R-based therapeutics have emerged30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optimization of GLP-1R agonist therapy often focuses on increasing the plasma half-life of GLP-1 and GLP-1 mimetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, the concept of ligand bias has provided new avenues for the development of drugs with novel modes of action that have the potential to provide greater therapeutic value while possibly avoiding unwanted side effects13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In response to GLP-1 or Ex4, the GLP-1R signals through G-protein-regulated pathways as well as through G-protein-independent pathways by engaging the scaffold protein -arrestin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite major advances in understanding GLP-1R function, a better understanding in the relative implication of these distinct pathways in physiological functions may help the development of improved therapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we identified a potent and selective GLP-1R G-protein-biased agonist namely P5, and explored its efficacy in mouse models of T2DM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A direct comparison of P5 with the reference peptide Ex4 revealed that G-protein signalling downstream of GLP-1R activation in the absence of -arrestin signalling is sufficient to correct hyperglycaemia, improve insulin sensitivity, preserve pancreatic islet integrity and improve liver steatosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, although P5 and Ex4 treatment result in some comparable physiologic responses, our data demonstrate differences in the G-protein-biased agonist mode of action and highlights the divergent roles of GLP-1R-mediated -arrestin signalling in the -cell and adipocyte.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the -cell, loss of -arrestin signalling resulted in impaired insulin secretion, whereas it promoted hyperplasia in eWAT and reduced plasma adipokine levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To enable the discovery of novel GLP-1R G-protein-biased agonists displaying selectivity and high potency for the GLP-1R, combinatorial peptide libraries were designed based on the competitive GLP-1R antagonist Ex 939 sequence to which 710 random amino acids have been added to the N terminus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These libraries were screened in a high-throughput, autocrine manner using a CRE-driven GFP reporter system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extensive in vitro pharmacological characterization of the active peptides revealed that P5 displayed comparable efficacy to the endogenous ligand GLP-1 and its analogue Ex4 with regards to G-protein signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in contrast to GLP-1 and Ex4, P5 exhibits a severely blunted -arrestin response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxyntomodulin, another endogenous ligand of the GLP-1R and the glucagon receptor and allosteric ligands of the GLP-1R have been reported to exhibit some degrees of G-protein bias at the GLP-1R31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertherless, in contrast to these molecules, P5 displayed high potency at the GLP-1R and was devoid of activity at glucagon receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, P5 represents the only selective and potent GLP-1R G-protein-biased orthosteric agonist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, examination of the peptide sequence revealed that P5 N-terminal residues are distinct from residues 18 of the endogenous hormone or Ex4 suggesting that extensive sequence modifications rather than minimal structural changes (single amino acid change) are required to produce biased agonism at the GLP-1R.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations clearly demonstrate that the autocrine-based screening method is a powerful tool enabling the identification of novel peptides displaying new pharmacological virtues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the superior glucoregulatory activity achieved with P5 chronic treatment suggests that this novel sequence retains the resistance to dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV)-mediated degradation as exhibited by Ex4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In an acute setting, this G-protein-biased agonist significantly improved glycaemic control in metabolically healthy animals as well as in mouse models of T2DM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In metabolically healthy mice P5 improved blood glucose tolerance to the same extent as a 100-fold higher dose of Ex4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations along with the pharmacokinetics study suggest that the difference in P5 efficacy is inherent to the peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this reductionist approach, P5 significantly increased insulin level when compared with control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the P5 secretagogue activity was significantly decreased relative to the reference peptide Ex4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that in vivo, -arrestin 1/2 signalling downstream of GLP-1R activation plays a critical role in potentiating glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are consistent with previous reports demonstrating that -arrestin 1/2 are indispensable for the potentiating action of GLP-1 on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in cultured pancreatic  cells6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Chronic treatment with the G-protein-biased agonist resulted in enhanced correction of hyperglycaemia in the hyperglycaemic ob/ob mice as well as in the insulin-resistant DIO mice when compared with the reference agonist Ex4, as reflected by a significant decrease in blood glucose and HbA1c levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P5 increased glucoregulatory efficacy could not be attributed to an enhanced insulinotropic effect, as P5 secretagogue activity was significantly decreased compared with Ex4 suggesting that additional and distinct mechanisms might contribute to improve glycaemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this view, we found that chronic treatment with P5-induced changes in gene expression that are consistent with improved insulin sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In eWAT, PPAR expression and activity were increased leading to changes in PPAR-regulated genes including Glut4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33), CD36 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34) and tumour-necrosis factor- (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, consistent with the increase in PPAR and CD36 expression25,26, P5 chronic treatment significantly increased the number of small adipocytes in eWAT without decreasing net body fat suggesting that the G-protein-biased agonist promotes de novo differentiation of preadipocytes which reside in the stromal vascular fraction of adipose tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, P5 prevented the accumulation of macrophages in eWAT contributing to decrease inflammation and insulin resistance26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As smaller adipocytes are highly insulin sensitive36, P5 by shifting the balance towards hyperplasia might restore insulin signalling and increase lipid storage capacity in eWAT resulting in improved glucose homeostasis and redistribution of lipids from ectopic deposits in liver to adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, chronic treatment with the G-protein-biased agonist decreased circulating levels of insulin, and adipokines including leptin and resistin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the roles of resistin, a hormone produced and secreted from mature adipocytes and macrophages37,38, may vary between physiological and pathophysiological states and among species39, several reports suggest that in mice, resistin directly affects glucose metabolism by antagonizing insulin action40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecular mechanisms underlying these changes in eWAT are complex but are likely related to the substantial increase in PPAR levels in adipocytes as previously reported42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, further studies are warranted to determine how chronic treatment with P5 affects PPAR activity and systemic insulin sensitivity in DIO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In line with previous reports43,44,45 our data support the notion that non -cell actions of GLP-1 agonists can improve glycaemic control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, GLP-1R is expressed in adipose tissue, in both the stromal vascular and the adipocyte fraction and its expression level has been found to correlate with the degree of insulin resistance46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the GLP-1 peptide has been reported to regulate adipogenesis in vitro47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that P5, a G-protein-biased agonist with a severely blunted -arrestin response has less propensity to induce GLP-1R desensitization, sustained activation of the receptor in adipose tissue may lead to the changes we observed in eWAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this notion, increased expression of adipogenic genes and a decrease in resistin expression was reported in -arrestin 1 knockout mice49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, considering the multitude of metabolic pathways regulated by -arrestin, further studies are warranted to determine the role of -arrestin signalling downstream of GLP-1R activation in adipogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we found that chronic treatment with P5 increased circulating level of GIP to a greater extent than Ex4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several studies demonstrated that GIP acts as an insulin sensitizer in adipocytes and disruption of the GIP/GIP-R axis has been reported in insulin-resistant states such as obesity50,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, PPAR activation was shown to increase GIP-R levels during adipocyte differentiation52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, by increasing GIP and PPAR levels, P5 chronic treatment may restore GIP/GIP-R signalling in adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that the simultaneous activation of the GLP-1R and the GIP-R results in enhanced glycaemic control, and lower HbA1c levels in human and rat, when compared with GLP-1R alone53, suggesting a GIP and GLP-1 synergism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the superior glycaemic control observed with the G-protein-biased agonist may result from P5-induced increases in GIP level and concomitant receptor activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the GLP-1R can form homodimers as well as ligand-induced heterodimers with the GIP-R54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is conceivable, that P5 may promote the formation of new and pharmacologically distinct homo/heterodimers displaying different signalling capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, further studies are required to delineate more precisely the molecular and cellular mechanisms and the consequences of P5-induced increase in GIP levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, high-throughput autocrine-based functional screening of combinatorial peptide libraries enabled the discovery of a high potency G-protein-biased GLP-1R agonist demonstrating new pharmacological virtues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a series of translational preclinical studies we demonstrate that P5 is a weak insulin secretagogue yet displays superior antidiabetic effect (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, GLP-1R G-protein-biased ligands may offer new and unappreciated advantages in the context of chronic treatment such as promoting adipocyte hyperplasia, restoring insulin responsiveness and long-term glycaemic control while preserving pancreatic -cell function by minimizing the insulin secretory burden.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: Schematic depicting the
