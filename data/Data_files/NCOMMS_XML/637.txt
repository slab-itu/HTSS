Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The recent challenges for improving the operation speed of nanoelectronics have motivated research on manipulating light in on-chip integrated circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hybrid plasmonic waveguides with low-dimensional semiconductors, including quantum dots and quantum wells, are a promising platform for realizing sub-diffraction limited optical components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have received broad interest in optoelectronics owing to tightly bound excitons at room temperature, strong light-matter and exciton-plasmon interactions, available top-down wafer-scale integration, and band-gap tunability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate principal functionalities for on-chip optical communications via reconfigurable exciton-plasmon interconversions in 200-nm-diameter Ag-nanowires overlapping onto TMD transistors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By varying device configurations for each operation purpose, three active components for optical communications are realized: field-effect exciton transistors with a channel length of 32 m, field-effect exciton multiplexers transmitting multiple signals through a single NW and electrical detectors of propagating plasmons with a high On/Off ratio of190.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results illustrate the unique merits of two-dimensional semiconductors for constructing reconfigurable device architectures in integrated nanophotonic circuits.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Photonics for light manipulation have the potential to meet the recent information technology demands of high-speed and massive data processing1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electrical switches, wavelength converters and multiplexers are crucial components for integrating optical circuits2,3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantum well (QW)-based excitonic transistors, in which exciton flux excited by photons diffuses along the QW channel and switched by the gate modulation of channel potential, are promising devices to realize high-speed interconnections7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, short-lived excitons and the finite exciton binding energy critically limit the operation to low temperatures within the limited channel length of typically less than 3 m7,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, a wavelength conversion, that converts an optical signal to a desired wavelength, and a multiplexing technique, that delivers various signals through a single optical guide, are essential to designing the reconfigurable optical communication systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although various methods for the wavelength conversion and multiplexing have been developed in conventional technologies based on fibre optics and photonic waveguides, the optical diffraction limit is a fundamental obstacle to reducing the optical component sizes to nanometers4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), which are the electromagnetic waves coherently coupled with electron plasma in metals, have the potential to overcome these issues because they allow a strong localization of optical energy at the metal-dielectric interface at a sub-wavelength scale4,5,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the use of metallic nanostructures for plasmonic waveguides allows for light manipulation at a nanoscale1,2,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Meanwhile, recently emerged 2D semiconductors have unique merits for nanophotonics3,10,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of dangling bonds allows for various combinations of van der Waal heterostructures14,15 and adaptability with various substrate choices16, in contrast with the cumbersome epitaxial growth of QWs in limited substrates and processes7,8,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2D layered structure of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offers an easy integration for wafer-scale devices19 and an efficient electrical tunability of optical-electrical properties3,13, while the top-down approach for arranging quantum dots (QDs) and injecting electrons to individual QDs for optical modulation are still challenging20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bandgap is tunable from visible to infrared range by varying the TMDs, alloying23 and heterostructures14, which allows a wide-spectral selectivity10,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The device integration and the electrical modulation of exciton fluxes of 2D semiconductors are easier24 compared to QDs22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tightly bound excitons of TMDs at room temperature allow for room temperature operable excitonic devices24, which is a stark contrast to QW-based devices operating at a low temperature7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the efficient excitons-to-plasmon conversion effects with a conversion efficiency as high as 32% have been demonstrated in Ag-NW/TMD hybrids25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we demonstrate the crucial optical components for nanophotonic circuits using reconfigurable exciton-to-plasmon and plasmon-to-exciton interconversions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To realize these concepts, we introduce Ag-nanowires (NWs) for SPP waveguides to 2D semiconductor devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ag-NW waveguides and their hybrids have been well investigated for various purposes because of low ohmic losses and sub-diffraction limited dimensions2,27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using Ag-NW-hybridized 2D semiconductor devices with various configurations, three active components for optical communications are realized: field-effect exciton transistors, field-effect exciton multiplexers and electrical detectors of propagating plasmons.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

in MoS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the Fermi level increases due to the increased electron carriers at high +VG, the PL intensity gradually decreases in proportion to EF, which is attributed to the Pauli blocking effect for excitons24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With increasing n-doping (VG greater than 50 V), the photoexcited electrons are suppressed by Pauli blocking effect and do not contribute to excitonic emission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, neutral excitons decrease and negative trions increase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, with increasing p-doping (VG less_than 50 V), the Pauli blocking disappears.
