Direct evidence for sequence-dependent attraction between double-stranded DNA controlled by methylation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Although proteins mediate highly ordered DNA organization in vivo, theoretical studies suggest that homologous DNA duplexes can preferentially associate with one another even in the absence of proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we combine molecular dynamics simulations with single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments to examine the interactions between duplex DNA in the presence of spermine, a biological polycation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that AT-rich DNA duplexes associate more strongly than GC-rich duplexes, regardless of the sequence homology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Methyl groups of thymine acts as a steric block, relocating spermine from major grooves to interhelical regions, thereby increasing DNADNA attraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, methylation of cytosines makes attraction between GC-rich DNA as strong as that between AT-rich DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent genome-wide chromosome organization studies showed that remote contact frequencies are higher for AT-rich and methylated DNA, suggesting that direct DNADNA interactions that we report here may play a role in the chromosome organization and gene regulation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Formation of a DNA double helix occurs through WatsonCrick pairing mediated by the complementary hydrogen bond patterns of the two DNA strands and base stacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interactions between double-stranded (ds)DNA molecules in typical experimental conditions containing mono- and divalent cations are repulsive1, but can turn attractive in the presence of high-valence cations2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theoretical studies have identified the ionion correlation effect as a possible microscopic mechanism of the DNA condensation phenomena3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theoretical investigations have also suggested that sequence-specific attractive forces might exist between two homologous fragments of dsDNA6, and this homology recognition hypothesis was supported by in vitro atomic force microscopy7 and in vivo point mutation assays8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the systems used in these measurements were too complex to rule out other possible causes such as WatsonCrick strand exchange between partially melted DNA or protein-mediated association of DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we present direct evidence for sequence-dependent attractive interactions between dsDNA molecules that neither involve intermolecular strand exchange nor are mediated by proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, we find that the sequence-dependent attraction is controlled not by homologycontradictory to the homology recognition hypothesis6but by a methylation pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike the previous in vitro study that used monovalent (Na+) or divalent (Mg2+) cations7, we presumed that for the sequence-dependent attractive interactions to operate polyamines would have to be present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polyamine is a biological polycation present at a millimolar concentration in most eukaryotic cells and essential for cell growth and proliferation9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polyamines are also known to condense DNA in a concentration-dependent manner2,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we use spermine4+ (Sm4+) that contains four positively charged amine groups per molecule.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Sequence dependence of DNADNA forces', 'To characterize the molecular mechanisms of DNADNA attraction mediated by polyamines, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations where two effectively infinite parallel dsDNA molecules, 20 base pairs (bp) each in a periodic unit cell, were restrained to maintain a prescribed inter-DNA distance; the DNA molecules were free to rotate about their axes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two DNA molecules were submerged in 100 mM aqueous solution of NaCl that also contained 20 Sm4+ molecules; thus, the total charge of Sm4+, 80 e, was equal in magnitude to the total charge of DNA (2 × 2 × 20 e, two unit charges per base pair; Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repeating such simulations at various inter-DNA distances and applying weighted histogram analysis12 yielded the change in the interaction free energy (G) as a function of the DNADNA distance (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a broad agreement with previous experimental findings13, G had a minimum, Gmin, at the inter-DNA distance of 2530 Å for all sequences examined, indeed showing that two duplex DNA molecules can attract each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The free energy of inter-duplex attraction was at least an order of magnitude smaller than the WatsonCrick interaction free energy of the same length DNA duplex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A minimum of G was not observed in the absence of polyamines, for example, when divalent or monovalent ions were used instead14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Polyamine-mediated DNA sequence recognition observed in MD simulations and smFRET experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Set-up of MD simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A pair of parallel 20-bp dsDNA duplexes is surrounded by aqueous solution (semi-transparent surface) containing 20 Sm4+ molecules (which compensates exactly the charge of DNA) and 100 mM NaCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under periodic boundary conditions, the DNA molecules are effectively infinite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A harmonic potential (not shown) is applied to maintain the prescribed distance between the dsDNA molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b,c) Interaction free energy of the two DNA helices as a function of the DNADNA distance for repeat-sequence DNA fragments (b) and DNA homopolymers (c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Schematic of experimental design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A pair of 120-bp dsDNA labelled with a Cy3/Cy5 FRET pair was encapsulated in a 200-nm diameter lipid vesicle;

traces indicative of frequent conformational transitions were also observed (Supplementary Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such diverse behaviours could be expected from non-specific interactions of two large biomolecules having structural degrees of freedom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No binding events were observed in the absence of Sm4+ (Supplementary Fig 1B) or when no DNA molecules were present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantitatively assess the propensity of forming a bound state, we chose to use the fraction of single-molecule traces that showed any binding events within the observation time of 2 min (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This binding fraction for the pair of AT-rich dsDNAs (AT1, 100% AT in the middle 80-bp section of the 120-bp construct) reached a maximum at 2 mM Sm4+ (Fig 1f), which is consistent with the results of previous experimental studies2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with the prediction of our MD simulations, GC-rich dsDNAs (GC1, 75% GC in the middle 80 bp) showed much lower binding fraction at all Sm4+ concentrations (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless of the DNA sequence, the binding fraction reduced back to zero at high Sm4+ concentrations, likely due to the resolubilization of now positively charged DNASm4+ complexes2,3,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Because the donor and acceptor fluorophores were attached to the same sequence of DNA, it remained possible that the sequence homology between the donor-labelled DNA and the acceptor-labelled DNA was necessary for their interaction6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this possibility, we designed another AT-rich DNA construct AT2 by scrambling the central 80-bp section of AT1 to remove the sequence homology (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fraction of binding traces for this nonhomologous pair of donor-labelled AT1 and acceptor-labelled AT2 was comparable to that for the homologous AT-rich pair (donor-labelled AT1 and acceptor-labelled AT1) at all Sm4+ concentrations tested (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, this data set rules out the possibility that the higher binding fraction observed experimentally for the AT-rich constructs was caused by inter-duplex WatsonCrick base pairing of the partially melted constructs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Next, we designed a DNA construct named ATGC, containing, in its middle section, a 40-bp AT-rich segment followed by a 40-bp GC-rich segment (Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By attaching the acceptor to the end of either the AT-rich or GC-rich segments, we could compare the likelihood of observing the parallel binding mode that brings the two AT-rich segments together and the anti-parallel binding mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements at 1 mM Sm4+ and 25 or 50 mM NaCl indicated a preference for the parallel binding mode by 30% (Fig 1h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, AT content can modulate DNADNA interactions even in a complex sequence context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that increasing the concentration of NaCl while keeping the concentration of Sm4+ constant enhances competition between Na+ and Sm4+ counterions, which reduces the concentration of Sm4+ near DNA and hence the frequency of dsDNAdsDNA binding events (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Methylation determines the strength of DNADNA attraction', 'Analysis of the MD simulations revealed the molecular mechanism of the polyamine-mediated sequence-dependent attraction (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of the AT-rich fragments, the bulky methyl group of thymine base blocks Sm4+ binding to the N7 nitrogen atom of adenine, which is the cation-binding hotspot21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, Sm4+ is not found in the major grooves of the AT-rich duplexes and resides mostly near the DNA backbone (Fig 2a,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such relocated Sm4+ molecules bridge the two DNA duplexes better, accounting for the stronger attraction16,23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, significant amount of Sm4+ is adsorbed to the major groove of the GC-rich helices that lacks cation-blocking methyl group (Fig 2b,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Molecular mechanism of polyamine-mediated DNA sequence recognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ac) Representative configurations of Sm4+ molecules at the DNADNA distance of 28 Å for the (AT)10(AT)10 (a), (GC)10(GC)10 (b) and (GmC)10(GmC)10 (c) DNA pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The backbone and bases of DNA are shown as ribbon and molecular bond, respectively;

SssI methyltransferase (Supplementary Fig 3; Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As predicted from the MD simulations, methylation of the GC-rich constructs increased the binding fraction to the level of the AT-rich constructs (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The sequence dependence of |Gmin| and its relation to the Sm4+ adsorption patterns can be rationalized by examining the number of Sm4+ molecules shared by the dsDNA molecules (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An Sm4+ cation adsorbed to the major groove of one dsDNA is separated from the other dsDNA by at least 10 Å, contributing much less to the effective DNADNA attractive force than a cation positioned between the helices, that is, the bridging Sm4+ (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An adsorbed Sm4+ also repels other Sm4+ molecules due to like-charge repulsion, lowering the concentration of bridging Sm4+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To demonstrate that the concentration of bridging Sm4+ controls the strength of DNADNA attraction, we computed the number of bridging Sm4+ molecules, Nspm (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the number of bridging Sm4+ molecules ranks in the same order as |Gmin|: Nspm of (A)20Nspm of (AT)10Nspm of (GmC)10Nspm of (GC)10Nspm of (G)20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the number density of nucleotides carrying a methyl group (T and mC) is the primary determinant of the strength of attractive interaction between two dsDNA molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, the spatial arrangement of the methyl group carrying nucleotides can affect the interaction strength as well (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of methyl groups and their distribution in the (AT)10 and (GmC)10 duplex DNA are identical, and so are their interaction free energies, |Gmin| of (AT)10|Gmin| of (GmC)10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For AT-rich DNA sequences, clustering of the methyl groups repels Sm4+ from the major groove more efficiently than when the same number of methyl groups is distributed along the DNA (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, |Gmin| of (A)20|Gmin| of (AT)10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For GC-rich DNA sequences, clustering of the cation-binding sites (N7 nitrogen) attracts more Sm4+ than when such sites are distributed along the DNA (Fig 3b), hence |Gmin| is larger for (GC)10 than for (G)20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Methylation modulates the interaction free energy of two dsDNA molecules by altering the number of bridging Sm4+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Typical spatial arrangement of Sm4+ molecules around a pair of DNA helices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phosphates groups of DNA and the amine groups of Sm4+ are shown as red and blue spheres, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bridging Sm4+ molecules reside between the DNA helices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Orange rectangles illustrate the volume used for counting the number of bridging Sm4+ molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) The number of bridging amine groups as a function of the inter-DNA distance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total number of Sm4+ nitrogen atoms was computed by averaging over the corresponding MD trajectory and the 10 Å (x axis) by 20 Å (y axis) rectangle prism volume (a) centred between the DNA molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Schematic representation of the dependence of the interaction free energy of two DNA molecules on their nucleotide sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number and spatial arrangement of nucleotides carrying a methyl group (T or mC) determine the interaction free energy of two dsDNA molecules.Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Genome-wide investigations of chromosome conformations using the HiC technique revealed that AT-rich loci form tight clusters in human nucleus27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene or chromosome inactivation is often accompanied by increased methylation of DNA29 and compaction of facultative heterochromatin regions30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The consistency between those phenomena and our findings suggest the possibility that the polyamine-mediated sequence-dependent DNADNA interaction might play a role in chromosome folding and epigenetic regulation of gene expression.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
