The mitotic kinesin-14 KlpA contains a context-dependent directionality switch  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Kinesin-14s are commonly known as nonprocessive minus end-directed microtubule motors that function mainly for mitotic spindle assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy that KlpAa kinesin-14 from Aspergillus nidulansis a context-dependent bidirectional motor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KlpA exhibits plus end-directed processive motility on single microtubules, but reverts to canonical minus end-directed motility when anchored on the surface in microtubule-gliding experiments or interacting with a pair of microtubules in microtubule-sliding experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plus end-directed processive motility of KlpA on single microtubules depends on its N-terminal nonmotor microtubule-binding tail, as KlpA without the tail is nonprocessive and minus end-directed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that the tail is a de facto directionality switch for KlpA motility: when the tail binds to the same microtubule as the motor domain, KlpA is a plus end-directed processive motor; in contrast, when the tail detaches from the microtubule to which the motor domain binds, KlpA becomes minus end-directed.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Kinesins are microtubule motor proteins that convert the energy of ATP hydrolysis into mechanical work for various essential cellular processes1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mitotic spindle is a microtubule-based bipolar machine in eukaryotes that separates duplicated chromosomes to ensure that daughter cells each receive proper genetic material during cell division4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several different kinesin motor proteins are orchestrated inside the mitotic spindle for its assembly and maintenance5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of all mitotic kinesins, kinesin-14s (that is, kinesins with a C-terminal motor domain) are commonly considered to be nonprocessive minus end-directed microtubule motors7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of kinesin-14s has been shown to cause erroneous chromosome segregation12,17,18,19,20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cancer cells, the human kinesin-14 HSET/KIFC1 is needed for clustering multiple centrosomes, a process crucial for cancer cell proliferation and survival23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'KlpA is a mitotic kinesin-14 from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth noting that A. nidulans is also the model organism for the discovery of BimC, the founding member of mitotic kinesin-5s (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like mitotic kinesin-14s in other eukaryotic cells15,26,27, KlpA counteracts the function of BimC24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although KlpA is nonessential in wild-type cells24, its loss becomes synthetically lethal with gamma tubulin mutations28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KlpA is an attractive model protein for dissecting the mechanism and function of kinesin-14s, as its loss-of-function mutations can be conveniently isolated as suppressors of the bimC4 mutation29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, compared with other mitotic kinesin-14s such as Ncd from Drosophila melanogaster, Pkl1 and Klp2 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Kar3 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, KlpA is much less well studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we report our in vitro characterization of KlpA motility in a variety of contexts using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that, unlike all other kinesin-14s that have been studied to date, KlpA is a novel context-dependent bidirectional kinesin-14 motor: on single microtubules, KlpA unexpectedly moves towards the plus end in a processive manner, but when anchored on the coverslip (as in microtubule-gliding experiments) or interacting with a pair of microtubules (as in microtubule-sliding experiments), it reverts to exhibit canonical minus end-directed motility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further show that KlpA requires its N-terminal nonmotor microtubule-binding tail (tail) for plus end-directed processive motility, as KlpA without this tail is minus end-directed in microtubule-gliding experiments and fails to generate processive motility on single microtubules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results indicate that the tail of KlpA plays a novel function as a switch for controlling its direction of motion in different contexts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study sheds new insight into KlpA motor mechanisms and also markedly expands our knowledge of the diversified design principles of kinesin-14s.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'KlpA glides microtubules with minus end-directed motility', 'We set out to determine the directionality of KlpA in vitro using TIRF microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To that end, we purified the recombinant full-length KlpA tagged with an N-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP-KlpA, Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because KlpA substitutes for Kar3 in S. cerevisiae24 and Kar3 forms a heterodimer with the nonmotor proteins Cik1 or Vik1(ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30), we performed two different assayshydrodynamic analysis and single-molecule photobleachingto determine the oligomerization status of KlpA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hydrodynamic analysis yielded a molecular weight that is close to the theoretical value of a GFP-KlpA homodimer (Supplementary Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The photobleaching assay showed that the GFP fluorescence of GFP-KlpA was photobleached predominantly in a single step or two steps (Supplementary Fig 1c,d), similar to other dimeric kinesins31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, KlpA formed a homodimer in our in vitro experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Surface-immobilized KlpA molecules exhibit minus end-directed motility to glide microtubules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a)

molecules were immobilized on the coverslip via an N-terminal polyhistidine-tag, and KlpA directionality was deduced from the motion of polarity-marked microtubules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The assay showed that GFP-KlpA caused polarity-marked microtubules to move with the bright plus ends leading (Fig 1d and Supplementary Movie 1) and a mean velocity of 309±35 nm s1 (mean±s.d., n=123, Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a control microtubule-gliding experiment using the plus end-directed human conventional kinesin hKHC32, microtubules were driven to move with the bright plus ends trailing (Supplementary Fig 2 and Supplementary Movie 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results demonstrate that KlpA, when anchored on the surface via its N terminus, is a minus end-directed motor protein, in agreement with a previous study using KlpA from clarified bacterial lysates28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'KlpA is a plus end-directed processive kinesin-14 motor', 'With the lone exception of Kar3, which moves processively on single microtubules towards the minus end by forming a heterodimer with the nonmotor proteins Cik1 or Vik1 (refs 30, 33), all other kinesin-14s that have been studied to date are exclusively nonprocessive minus end-directed motors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus wanted to determine whether KlpA is a typical kinesin-14 that lacks the ability to move processively on single microtubules as a homodimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this, we performed an in vitro motility assay to visualize the movement of KlpA molecules on surface-immobilized polarity-marked microtubules (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The assay showed that, contrary to the notion of kinesin-14s as minus end-directed motors, GFP-KlpA molecules unexpectedly formed a steady flux of plus end-directed motion and accumulated at the microtubule plus end (yellow arrow, Fig 2b and Supplementary Movie 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Occasionally, there were GFP-KlpA particles moving towards the microtubule minus ends (white arrow, Fig 2b), but these minus end-directed particles were significantly brighter than the ones moving towards the plus end, implying that they were aggregates rather than simple homodimers.

motility experiments were performed at relatively high input levels of GFP-KlpA (4.5 nM; Fig 2b), we repeated the same motility assay at much lower protein input levels (0.2 nM) so that the motile behaviour of individual GFP-KlpA molecules could be distinguished.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The assay showed that individual GFP-KlpA molecules moved preferentially towards the microtubule plus end in a processive manner (Fig 2c and Supplementary Movie 4) with a mean velocity of 300±70 nm s1 (mean±s.d., n=257, Fig 2d) and a characteristic run-length of 10.5±2.2 m (mean±s.e.m., n=257, Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This run-length likely was an underestimate because most KlpA molecules reached the microtubule plus end.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also performed the mean square displacement (MSD) analysis, which showed that the motility of KlpA is dominated by directional movement (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results demonstrate that, in direct contrast to all other kinesin-14s that have been analysed to date, KlpA is a novel kinesin-14 motor that uniquely exhibits plus end-directed processive motility on single microtubules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth emphasizing that such novel processive motility is not due to coupling31,34, but rather an intrinsic behaviour of a single KlpA homodimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Plus end-directed KlpA motility requires its N-terminal tail', 'Like other kinesin-14s such as Klp2 in S. pombe and Ncd in D. melanogaster35,36, KlpA was also able to slide apart antiparallel microtubules and to statically crosslink parallel microtubules via its N-terminal nonmotor microtubule-binding tail (Supplementary Fig 4ag and Supplementary Movies 5 and 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As several other kinesins are known to rely on nonmotor microtubule-binding domains to either achieve processive motility30 or enhance processivity37,38, we sought to determine whether the microtubule-binding tail of KlpA plays a similar role in enabling its unexpected plus end-directed processive motility on single microtubules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do this, we purified GFP-KlpA-tail (Fig 3a), a truncated construct lacking the N-terminal tail, for in vitro motility experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like GFP-KlpA, GFP-KlpA-tail formed a homodimer (Supplementary Fig 5), and exhibited minus end-directed motility in the microtubule-gliding assay (Fig 3b and Supplementary Movie 7) with a mean velocity of 287±10 nm s1 (mean±s.d., n=138, Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This latter observation implies that motorneck core of KlpA is inherently minus end-directed, as would be expected based on its highly conserved neck32,39,40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the in vitro motility assay showed that GFP-KlpA-tail did not form a steady flux towards either end of the microtubule, nor did it accumulate at the microtubule ends (Fig 3d and Supplementary Movie 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although some occasional brighter and presumably aggregated particles moved processively towards the microtubule minus ends (white arrow, Fig 3d and Supplementary Movie 8), individual GFP-KlpA-tail molecules behaved like other nonprocessive kinesin-14s (refs 31, 36, 42) and mostly interacted with the microtubules in a diffusive manner with no apparent directional preference (yellow arrow, Fig 3d and Supplementary Movie 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MSD analysis showed that the motility of GFP-KlpA-tail on single microtubules is best described by one-dimensional diffusion (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, besides allowing for microtubule-sliding and crosslinking, the tail of KlpA has an additional novel functionality of enabling the kinesin-14 motor to move on single microtubules towards the plus end in a processive manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Plus end-directed processive

microtubule assays (Fig 1d and Supplementary Fig 4c) and the single-molecule motility experiments (Fig 2b,c), we inferred that KlpA contains a context-dependent mechanism to switch directions on the microtubule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus directly compared the motility of GFP-KlpA inside and outside the microtubule overlap on the same track microtubule using a microtubule-sliding assay (Fig 4a), as has been done previously for S. cerevisiae kinesin-5 Cin8 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, in this assay the track (blue) and cargo (red) microtubules were both polarity-marked but labelled with different dyes; track microtubules were first immobilized on a coverslip inside the motility chamber and bound with purified GFP-KlpA molecules; moreover, cargo microtubules were added into the chamber before three-colour time-lapse imaging was acquired to simultaneously visualize the motility of GFP-KlpA molecules and cargo microtubules on the same track microtubules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like KlpA, GFP-KlpA was also able to slide antiparallel microtubules relative to each other (Fig 4b) and to statically crosslink parallel microtubules (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both scenarios, when outside the microtubule overlap regions, GFP-KlpA molecules showed a plus end-directed flux and accumulated at the plus end on the track microtubule (yellow arrow, Fig 4b,c and Supplementary Movies 9 and 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This matched the behaviour of GFP-KlpA on single microtubules (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, inside the antiparallel microtubule overlap regions, GFP-KlpA molecules carried the cargo microtubule towards the minus end of the track microtubule (white arrow, Fig 4b and Supplementary Movie 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the parallel orientation, the cargo microtubule remained stationary on the track microtubule, but GFP-KlpA molecules moved preferentially towards and gradually accumulated at the minus end inside the parallel microtubule overlap (white arrow, Fig 4c and Supplementary Movie 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is similar to the observation that Ncd preferentially accumulates at the minus ends between statically crosslinked parallel microtubules36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results demonstrate that KlpA can, depending on its context, display opposite directional preferences on the same microtubule: it is plus end-directed outside the microtubule overlap regions and minus end-directed inside the microtubule overlap regions regardless of the relative microtubule polarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: KlpA

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Kinesin-14 has been an intriguing kinesin subfamily since the discovery of its founding member Ncd44,45 because all kinesin-14s studied to date are exclusively minus end-directed based on the microtubule-gliding experiments31,35,42,44,45,46,47,48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, no kinesin-14 has been shown to be able to generate processive motility on the microtubule as a single homodimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kar3 is the only kinesin-14 known to generate minus end-directed processive motility on single microtubules without clustering, and it does that by forming a heterodimer with its associated light chains Vik1 or Cik1 (refs 30, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, KlpA is the first kinesin-14 that exhibits both plus end-directed processive motility on single microtubules and context-dependent directional switching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our study markedly expands the diversity of kinesin-14s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results show that while the full-length KlpA clearly moves towards the plus end on single microtubules in a processive manner (Fig 2b,c), a truncated KlpA lacking the N-terminal microtubule-binding tail glides microtubules with minus end-directed motility (Fig 3b) but becomes nonprocessive on single microtubules (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are several important implications from these observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, without the tail, the motorneck core of KlpA is inherently minus end-directed, which is consistent with the notion that all kinesin-14s share a highly conserved neck that serves as the minus end directionality determinant32,39,40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, on single microtubules, the tail enables KlpA to exhibit both processive motility and plus end directionality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that on a single microtubule, KlpA assumes a cis conformation in which the catalytic microtubule-binding motor domain and the tail bind to the same microtubule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding of the tail to the cis-microtubule subsequently prevents KlpA from premature dissociation, and this enables the kinesin to move processively on the microtubule, as has been observed previously for Kar3, which depends on the nonmotor microtubule-binding domain in Vik1 or Cik1 for processive motility on microtubules30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'At present, it is unclear how exactly the tail enables the full-length KlpA to move preferentially towards the plus end on a single microtubule at the atomic level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies50,51,52 suggest that kinesin-14 motors use a lever mechanism for minus end-directed motility, where the neck acts as an extended lever arm and undergoes rotation towards the microtubule minus end upon ATP binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Building on this, we speculate that when KlpA adopts the cis conformation on a single microtubule, binding of the tail on the surface of the same microtubule as the motor domain induces a conformational strain through the stalk that causes the neck to rotate towards the microtubule plus end, thereby enabling the kinesin for plus end-directed motility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precise underlying mechanism of plus end-directed KlpA processivity awaits future single-molecule studies of designed KlpA variants as well as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies of these variants on single microtubules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Among all the experiments, KlpA exhibits plus end-directed motility only on single microtubules (Fig 2b,c); moreover, in this scenario, the tail of KlpA and its catalytic motor domain are expected to bind to the same microtubule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, KlpA exhibits canonical minus end-directed motility when it is either anchored on the coverslip via the N terminus in the ensemble microtubule-gliding experiments (Fig 1c,d) or between a pair of microtubules in the microtubule-sliding experiments (Fig 4b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both scenarios, the N-terminal microtubule-binding tail of KlpA is not attached to the microtubule to which its motor domain binds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the tail of KlpA is a de facto directionality switch: to achieve plus end-directed processive motility, the switch-like tail of KlpA must bind to the same microtubule as its catalytic motor domain; moreover, to achieve minus end-directed motility, the switch needs to be detached from the microtubule to which its motor domain binds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results show that KlpA accumulates at the plus end on single microtubules (Fig 2b,c), and we suggest that this is enabled by its tail via a mechanism similar to that of the budding yeast kinesin-8 Kip3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tail likely binds strongly to the splayed protofilaments at the microtubule plus end to enhance the retention of KlpA there.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth noting that such accumulation requires the motor activity of KlpA to reach the microtubule plus end, as purified tail does not accumulate at either end of the microtubule and instead decorates the entire length of the microtubule rather uniformly (Supplementary Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It has long been established that KlpA counteracts the activity of BimC24, but the underlying mechanism has been largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How could our results relate to the in vivo functions of KlpA?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While KlpA localization inside the mitotic spindle has not yet been studied, one potential site of localization is the spindle pole, as several mitotic kinesin-14s, including HSET, CHO2, Kar3, Ncd, XCTK2 and Pkl1, are all known to localize to the spindle poles54,55,56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If KlpA does localize to the spindle poles, then how does it localize there?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study has shown that that Pkl1a mitotic kinesin-14 from fission yeastforms a complex with Msd1 and Wdr8 for translocating to and anchoring at the spindle poles55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As homologues of Msd1 and Wdr8 are both present in A. nidulans57, it is plausible that binding of Msd1 and/or Wdr8-like proteins to KlpA dislodges its N-terminal tail from the cis-microtubule surface, and this activates the kinesin for minus end-directed motility both on single microtubules and at the spindle poles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spindle midzone is another potential site of localization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, our results suggest that while other mitotic kinesin-14s appear to depend on partner proteins to localize to the microtubule plus end14,47,58,59, KlpA can in principle autonomously localize to the spindle midzone via its inherent plus end-directed processive motility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Several mitotic kinesin-5s were recently shown to be context-dependent bidirectional motor proteins43,60,61,62, indicating that context-dependent directional switching is evolutionarily conserved among kinesin-5s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our current work on KlpA provides the first evidence to suggest that context-dependent directional switching could also exist among some, if not all, mitotic kinesin-14s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the mechanism and regulation of bidirectional mitotic kinesins will be an important subject for future studies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
