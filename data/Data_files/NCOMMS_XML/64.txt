Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization reports the whole-genome sequences of 1,070 healthy Japanese individuals and construction of a Japanese population reference panel (1KJPN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we identify through this high-coverage sequencing (32.4 × on average), 21.2 million, including 12 million novel, single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) at an estimated false discovery rate of  less_than 1.0%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This detailed analysis detected signatures for purifying selection on regulatory elements as well as coding regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also catalogue structural variants, including 3.4 million insertions and deletions, and 25,923 genic copy-number variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 1KJPN was effective for imputing genotypes of the Japanese population genome wide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data demonstrate the value of high-coverage sequencing for constructing population-specific variant panels, which covers 99.0% SNVs of minor allele frequency 0.1%, and its value for identifying causal rare variants of complex human disease phenotypes in genetic association studies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization (ToMMo) established a biobank that combines medical and genome information for the community medical system in the Tohoku region, located in the northeast part of Japan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We initiated the prospective genome cohort study in the region to identify genetic and environmental factors in diseases, and to enable personalized medicine based on an individuals genomic information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the experimental design, we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 1,070 samples by PCR-free sequencing with more than 30 × coverage genome wide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This enabled us to identify very rare as well as novel single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), which was impossible to find by single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays or are difficult to find by low coverage sequencing on the same sample size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, all sequencing and bioinformatics analyses were conducted using the same protocols in a single institute, allowing stringent control over systematic errors that might arise from using different equipment, protocols or bioinformatics pipelines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Since the International Human Genome Project was completed1, a great deal of effort has been devoted to discovering, cataloguing and haplotyping common nucleotide sequence variants in populations by targeted sequencing and SNP arrays, such as in the International HapMap Project2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The knowledge of these variants enabled genome-wide association studies (GWASs), through which many SNPs associated with human traits and diseases have been discovered3,4 under the assumption of common-disease/common-variants hypothesis5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these identified SNPs can only explain a small fraction of genotypephenotype relationships underlying the problem of missing heritability6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent GWAS conducted on a large number of case and control samples revealed that lower-frequency variants contribute to a substantial fraction of the heritability of common diseases, such as type 2 diabetes7 and cancers8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP) has catalogued human genetic variations at minor allele frequency (MAF)  greater than 1% through WGS from multiple ethnic groups9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, low frequency (0.5% less_than MAF5%), rare (0.1% less_than MAF0.5%) or very-rare (MAF0.1%) variants have not been thoroughly catalogued, in comparison with common variants (MAF greater than 5%) because the existence of lower-frequency variants is population-specific9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeted high-coverage sequencing has been conducted to detect very-rare variants in the coding sequences of European Americans and African Americans10,11, while, in contrast, the majority of rare and very-rare variants in intergenic regions have not yet been discovered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the ENCODE project showed that a substantial fraction of noncoding regions (80.4%) are biochemically active12, these data suggest that these regions may also be associated with phenotypes or diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Structural variants (SVs), including copy-number variants (CNVs), have also been catalogued in several studies13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a number of studies have revealed associations of SVs with occurrence of disease, including autism15, schizophrenia16 and Crohns disease17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CNVs may also explain traits of populations, such as dietary habits of agricultural societies and huntergatherers18, or drug responses19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For identifying SVs, a middle-coverage sequencing strategy (13 × ) with 250 parentoffspring families by the Genome of the Netherlands succeeded in extending the catalogue of deletions from 20 to 100 bp compared with the 1KGP data set20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As high-coverage WGS is becoming less expensive, it is now feasible to detect lower-frequency SVs as well as SNVs21,22,23 in specific target populations24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'From the identified SNVs, we construct a reference panel of 1,070 Japanese individuals (1KJPN), including some very-rare SNVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 1KJPN cohort provides unique insights into the landscape of functional variations, especially in noncoding regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate here that 1KJPN is useful for genotype imputation for the Japanese population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this analysis, a functional variant associated with Moyamoya disease (MMD) was identified through the imputed genotypes based on 1KJPN.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Data processing and variant discovery', 'From the collected DNA samples in the ToMMo biobank, we selected 1,344 candidates for constructing 1KJPN, considering the traceability of participants information, and the quality and abundance of DNA samples for SNP array genotyping and WGS analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All participants provided written informed consent, and all DNA samples and personal information were analysed anonymously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All the DNA samples were genotyped with Illumina HumanOmni2.58 BeadChip (Omni2.5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the genotyped samples, 1,070 samples were then selected by filtering out close relatives and outliers (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'PCR bias is one of the major sources of sequencing error25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the selected 1,070 samples were sequenced by Illumina HiSeq 2500 using the latest PCR-free protocol (162 bp paired-end reads and 550 bp insert size, improving the accuracy for detecting SVs26; Fig 1a and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An in-house density check protocol was employed before sequencing27, and subsequent data quality-control (QC) was performed with originally developed software28 named SUGAR to maximize the quality and throughput of each experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, 100.4 trillion bases of DNA sequence reads were generated (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequence reads were aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh37/hg19) with decoy sequences (hs37d5), and then variants were called by several computational algorithms (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strategy led to the discovery of 29.6 million SNVs (the high-sensitive SNVs), 1.97 million short deletions (72.6% novel), 1.38 million short insertions ( less_than 100 bp; 75.0% novel), 47,343 large deletions and 9,354 large insertions (equal to or longer than 100 bp) in autosomes (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: SNVs in 1KJPN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Statistics on read depth in 1KJPN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The

#@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of population MAF was estimated on the basis of the demographic model shown in Supplementary Fig 3.Full size image', 'Table 1 Summary of WGS of Japanese individuals and variant detection in autosomes.Full size table', 'To obtain reliable SNV calls, we applied multiple filtering steps (Supplementary Fig 2), including the depth of coverage of reads (Fig 1a), software-derived biases, departure from HardyWeinberg equilibrium (HWE) and complexity of genomic regions around variants (Methods and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The performance of genotype calls in the high-confidence SNVs was improved after filtering (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, we obtained a 21.2-million SNV call set, which hereafter referred to as the high-confidence SNVs (56.6% are novel; Table 1 and Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high novel SNV ratio is consistent with a previous observation that rare variants tend to be population-specific20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The false discovery rate (FDR) of the high-confidence SNVs was confirmed using several different experimental technologies (see Methods); the FDR for SNVs, deletions and insertions were 0% (0 out of 174; confidence interval (CI) 0.01.10%), 0% (0 out of 32; CI 0.05.78%) and 3.85% (1 out of 22; CI 0.4919.34%), respectively (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further conducted validation experiments for novel SNVs using a custom-designed Illumina SNP array.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined with the genotyping results obtained with Omni2.5, the overall FDR was 0.8% with CI 0.630.97% (Supplementary Table 3 and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that the estimates of FDRs were not strongly affected by MAF, indicating that the discoveries of novel variants in this study are fairly robust with respect to the allele frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Estimation of variant discovery rate', 'We estimated the rate of variant discovery with the sample size of 1,070.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the distribution of allele frequency in a population is affected by underlying demographic history29,30, we inferred the demographic model of 1KJPN population from the site frequency spectrum (SFS) constructed from the intergenic regions (Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected from excess in rare variants, the population of 1KJPN has experienced recent population expansion (Supplementary Fig 3b), which is consistent with previous studies10,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This demographic model is used for the calculation of the variant discovery rate (Fig 1d and Supplementary Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to Fig 1d, 99.0 % of SNVs with MAF 0.1% or larger were expected to be captured by the present sampling strategy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Functional impact of very-rare variants', 'The high-coverage PCR-free protocol of WGS has generated higher-power SNP discovery, especially for rare and very-rare SNVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On comparison of the SFSs of intergenic region of 1KJPN and 1KGP SNVs, the data demonstrate a higher proportion of very-rare SNVs in the 1KJPN data set than in 1KGP phase 1 data set (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, although the number of SNVs in 1KGP was generally larger than that in 1KJPN, the number of very-rare variants detected in intergenic region was higher in 1KJPN than in 1KGP (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations imply that there was less bias in discovering the very-rare variants of 1KJPN even in the intergenic region, although a possibility of faster expansion rate in 1KJPN cannot be excluded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: The impact of very-rare variants on genomic regions and functional categories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The SFSs of intergenic region for SNVs of 1KJPN (blue) and 1KGP (red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) The numbers of SNVs observed in 1KJPN and 1KGP are depicted as four functional categories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fraction of very-rare variants observed in 1KJPN are depicted with 95% binomial confidence interval according to (c) genomic region, (d) probable consequences for coding regions, (e) in noncoding regions and (f) for scaled C scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the number of genotyped individuals in the confidence SNVs is different among sites because of the individual depth filter, we applied a hypergeometric projection65, which subsamples each variant down to a sample size of 963 (90% of 1,070 samples) to obtain the SFSs of the confidence SNVs for a,cf.Full size image', 'Because deleterious mutations are removed from populations faster than neutral mutations, SNVs observed at lower frequency in a population are indicative of purifying (negative) selection, and their selection strength differs among the various functional genomic categories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along with this idea, the SFS has been analysed to evaluate relative influence of (mostly) negative selection on SNVs of each functional category in large sequencing projects9,10,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because we conducted the WGS without PCR amplification or exome capture, it is expected that there are less bias in variant detection between coding and noncoding regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the SFS of functional categories can be directly compared with intergenic region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We classified the high-confidence SNVs into predicted functional categories and evaluated the effect of purifying selection as a fraction of very-rare variants (FVRV; Fig 2cf).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FVRV of intergenic regions was 40.1%, which was the lowest among all categories (Fig 2c), supporting the notion that most of the sites in intergenic regions are evolutionarily neutral.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, FVRVs of noncoding regions other than intergenic were significantly higher than the FVRV of intergenic regionsintrons (41.6%), synonymous (43.7%), 3-untranslated region (UTR, 43.9%) and 5-UTR (45.0%)implying that a substantial fraction of noncoding regions are functional and under weak purifying selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar tendencies were observed for insertions and deletions (Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conducted the same analysis with 1KGP phase I data set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to 1KJPN, the FVRVs of 5-UTR, 3-UTR and intron from 1KGP data set were lower than the FVRV of synonymous SNVs (Supplementary Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might not be a signature of weak purifying selection on UTR and intron regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is rather due to the low power of SNP discovery of 1KGP in these regions where majority of them have been sequenced with low coverage in the project.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mutations that disrupt protein and/or transcript structure are highly detrimental.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis reconfirmed that the FVRV of nonsynonymous transcribed SNPs (52.5%) was distinctly higher than synonymous (43.7%) and intronic (41.6%) variants (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the FVRV of loss of function mutations (61.4%) was much higher than nonsynonymous SNVs (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we detected heterogeneity in the FVRV of nonsynonymous SNVs in terms of functional consequences predicted by PolyPhen-2, as previously reported10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FVRV of SNVs that were predicted to be probably damaging was the highest (61.8%), followed by the fraction that was possibly damaging (56.8%) and finally benign (48.2%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can also infer the impact of purifying selection on disease-causing mutations, those categorized as disease mutations in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD)31 in terms of FVRV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FVRV of disease mutations was 48.4%, which is very close to benign SNVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although the intergenic region exhibits the lowest FVRV, the ENCODE project revealed that a large proportion of intergenic regions may be associated with biochemical activity32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we inferred the influence of natural selection on intergenic regions using the predicted chromatin state33 from the chromatin immunoprecipitation-Seq data produced by the ENCODE Consortium32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among seven categories of predicted chromatin states, the SNVs observed on genomic segments bearing some functionally predicted activity exhibited higher FVRVs than repressed or low-activity regions (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in FVRV among chromatin states was small, but significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates weak selection on specific intergenic regions, such as promoters and enhancers, for gene regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we observed that the FVRV of microRNAs (miRNAs), but not lincRNAs, was higher, not only than for intergenic regions but also for functionally predicted ENCODE regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Notably, the degree of deleterious SNVs predicted by scaled C score in Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion34, which incorporates several annotations such as conservation metrics and regulatory information, was highly correlated with the FVRV of the 1KJPN variants (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations clearly illustrate that this reported sequencing paradigm successfully discovered biologically relevant SNVs, most of which are rare in the Japanese population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Structural variants', 'High-coverage sequencing data allowed us to catalogue both novel and known deletions and insertions within 1KJPN (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The size-frequency spectrum showed that larger indels were less abundant than smaller ones, consistent with observations from both 1KGP9 and Genome of the Netherlands20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, most of the longer insertions ( greater than 10 bp) detected in this pipeline35 were novel, which represents the usefulness of this high-coverage sequencing strategy (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Properties of genomic variation discovered in 1KJPN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The

(blue), and 1,018 Japanese individuals typed by PCR-SSOP (red)42.Full size image', 'We also constructed a genome-wide map of CNVs overlapping with the genic region in 1KJPN, in which 25,923 CNV loci were identified; precise copy numbers were quantified on the basis of the alignment status and depth of coverage of sequence reads on individual CNV loci (Fig 3b, Methods and Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Among the revealed CNVs, we found that most Japanese individuals have more than two diploid copies of the salivary amylase gene (AMY1; Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean diploid copy number of AMY1 within 1KJPN was 8.27, which is significantly higher than the number reported in populations who consume low amounts of starch (mean 5.44, N=93)18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is consistent with the higher copy number of AMY1 reported in high-starch populations, suggesting adaptation of an increased copy number according to dietary habits18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we found that the copy-number unit of AMY1 was two (that is, even AMY1 diploid copy numbers), in which the closely linked AMY1A and AMY1B loci duplicated together (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the diploid copy number of AMY1 is proportional to the copy number of intermediate region between AMY1A and AMY1B (designated by Region X in the schematic diagram of the human reference genome in Fig 3c), in which the relationship can be described as y=2n+2, as the diplotype model, where y is the diploid copy number of AMY1, and n is the diploid copy number of Region X.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also performed the digital PCR analysis to validate the estimated copy numbers in 10 samples (Methods and Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that two AMY1 gene loci, AMY1A and AMY1B, and Region X are close to one another on a chromosome, and this region as a whole is the copy unit of the AMY1 gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further confirmed that there is almost no variation in copy number outside of the AMY1 genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, diploid copy numbers of AMY2B and Region Y are mostly two (Supplementary Fig 6b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is consistent with the previously proposed haplotype model for the salivary amylase gene, (AMY1A-AMY1B)n-AMY1C36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the copy number of CNV loci present in a sample (gene dosage) is likely to affect the relative abundance of gene expression, this information will be useful for finding association of genetic variants with phenotypes or diseases in future follow-up studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CNVs reported here can be used to investigate associations with human disease phenotypes as previously reported37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'HLA types', 'Another important aspect of deep sequencing is the ability to determine highly polymorphic gene alleles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) genes are highly polymorphic in the human genome, and their haplotype structures are different among human populations39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we have typed HLA alleles of HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C loci of 1KJPN using newly developed software called HLA-VBSeq40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method is based on the alignment of sequence reads to the genomic HLA allele sequences registered in the IMGT/HLA database41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We successfully typed HLA-A alleles for most of the individuals in 1KJPN (2,063 out of 2,140 alleles) at full resolution (8-digit in HLA nomenclature).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that the frequencies of HLA-A, -B and -C alleles at 4-digit resolution (nucleotide differences that change amino-acid sequences) estimated in our study were very similar to previously published frequencies (Fig 3d and Supplementary Fig 6c,d), in which HLA types were determined using PCR-SSOP among a different set of 1,018 Japanese individuals42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because HLA genes are crucial in determining the outcome of organ transplantation and susceptibility to infectious and autoimmune diseases43,44, this HLA typing will be particularly important for GWAS45 and clinical practice, such as donorrecipient matching46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Haplotyping and imputation', 'Genome-wide genotype imputation is a statistical technique to estimate untyped genotypes from known haplotype information, which is cost-effective for GWAS with SNP arrays when compared with exome sequencing and WGS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We constructed a phased reference panel with high-sensitive SNVs plus short insertions and deletions in 1KJPN using HapMonster47 and ShapeIT2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

them; estimated identity-by-descent  less_than 0.125) was assessed by comparing their imputed genotypes and those obtained with the same sequencing protocol and variant calling pipeline that was used to generate 1KJPN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the imputation, genotypes at sites designed in Omni2.5 were used (Supplementary Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared 1KJPN and the following three types of reference panels for genotype imputation: (i) the 1,092 cosmopolitan samples in 1KGP, (ii) the 89 JPT samples in 1KGP and (iii) the 1KJPN plus 1KGP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the comparison, the highest r2 value (the measure of imputation accuracy) was achieved with 1KJPN plus 1KGP, especially in variants with MAF5%; the mean r2 values were 0.47 for very-rare SNVs, 0.66 for rare SNVs and 0.78 for low frequency SNVs (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significant improvement of imputation accuracy using the 1KJPN data suggests the importance of construction and examination of a population-specific

were more prevalent (1 in 4,0005,000)53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Information of risk allele frequencies among populations will be useful for estimating penetrance and identifying additional causes of disease,

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'From the high-coverage WGS data collected in the ToMMo cohort project, we have constructed 1KJPN, a reference panel of 1,070 Japanese individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This panel includes a highly accurate and comprehensive collection of 21.5 million SNVs ranging from very-rare (observed MAF0.1%) to common ( greater than 5%) variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the demographic history of 1KJPN inferred from the SFS of intergenic region, the data cover almost all SNVs (99.0%) that exist in the Japanese population having a minor frequency of 0.1% or greater (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we would find rarer variants if additional samples will be sequenced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, while we have detected 60.5 % of SNVs with MAF greater than 0.01% in this study, it is expected that the detection rate will rise to 81.6 % and 96.2 % for the sample size 3,000 and 8,000, respectively (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since most of very-rare variants likely arose within 5,00010,000 years10, they are essentially population-specific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, most of them would be difficult to be imputed from a reference panel that was constructed from diverse genetic backgrounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we showed here significantly improved imputation accuracy from 1KJPN data when compared with 1KGP (Fig 4 and Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In 1KJPN, we found the signature of purifying selection on SNVs in regulatory elements located in both coding and noncoding sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation illustrates that this SNV set is expected to contain many very-rare variants that can be associated with diseases, and thus should be useful in future GWASs to fully capture causal variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This high-coverage strategy has also defined fine characteristics of SVs, CNVs and HLA types in a population scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a substantial number of novel SVs was discovered by the high-coverage sequencing, we still had difficulty in discovering insertions longer than 100 bp because of the limitation of sequence read lengths (162 bp paired-end).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, simple repeat regions and structurally complex regions (for example, centromeric and telomeric sequences) were not covered in our SV discovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To build a more comprehensive reference panel with SVs, alternative approaches, such as the use of longer sequence reads, would be necessary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Since the cost of WGS is gradually decreasing, population-wide sequencing, as in the present study, will become a reasonable approach to discover the full spectrum of SNVs, SVs and CNVs in a reliable manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it remains challenging to sequence more than tens of thousands of samples in cohort projects even with the sophistication of current sequencing technologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a hybrid strategy that combines both sequencing and genotyping with a customized SNP array optimized to a specific population background, for example, Japonica Array58, becomes highly desirable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our hope is that 1KJPN will foster basic research by amalgamating more accurate genotype imputation in cohort studies with medical information, and thereby aid in constructing an advanced medical system to improve the quality of health-care services.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

#@NEW_LINE#@#  We then normalized read counts in these regions, by dividing them by half of the counts in Region Z, so that the normalized counts became two in diploid regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sum of the normalized counts in AMY1A, AMY1B and AMY1C, and the normalized counts in Region X, were calculated for each sample (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Region X is located between the AMY1A and AMY1B regions, and most of the reads were uniquely aligned to this region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three AMY1 gene loci (AMY1A, AMY1B and AMY1C) in the reference genome are very similar to each other (having more than 99.9% sequence identity), and hence it is difficult to distinguish one locus from another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The normalized coverages in AMY1 and in Region X were highly correlated (Fig 3c), which suggests that the locus that contains AMY1A and AMY1B is a copy unit of the salivary amylase gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While all samples had two diploid copies of Region Y, 17 samples had more than two diploid copies of AMY2B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Digital PCR was performed with the QuantStudio 3D Digital PCR System (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturers protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diploid copy numbers of the AMY1 gene in 10 samples (whose diploid copy numbers were predicted to be six, seven or eight) were determined using predesigned TaqMan Copy Number Assay (Hs07226362_cn for AMY1A, AMY1B and AMY1C, Life Technologies) and normalizing with TaqMan Copy Number Reference Assay RNase P (Life Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PCR reaction mixture contained 12 ng of MspI-digested genomic DNA, 7.5 l of QS3D digital PCR Master Mix (Life Technologies), 0.75 l of TaqMan Copy Number Assay and 0.75 l of TaqMan Copy Number Reference Assay in a final volume of 15 l. The data were analysed with QuantStudio 3D AnalysisSuite (Life Technologies), and the quantification of the target genomic region was presented as the number of copies per microlitre of PCR mixture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The estimated diploid copy numbers of AMY1 with WGS were consistent with the result obtained with the digital PCR analysis (Supplementary Fig 5).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
