Translational reprogramming in tumour cells can generate oncoselectivity in viral therapies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Systemic treatment of cancer requires tumour-selective therapies that eliminate cancer cells yet preserve healthy tissues from undesired damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumoral transformation is associated with profound effects in translational reprogramming of gene expression, such that tumour-specific translational regulation presents an attractive possibility for generating oncoselective therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recently discovered that mRNA translational control by cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding proteins (CPEBs) is reactivated in cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present a novel approach to restrict genetic-engineered therapies to malignant tissues based on CPEB translational regulation of target mRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that tumour reprogramming of CPEB-mediated mRNA stability and translational regulation modulates tumour-specific expression of viral proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For oncolytic adenoviruses, insertion of CPE regulatory sequences in the 3-untranslated region of the E1A gene provides oncoselectivity, with full potency in cancer cells but attenuated in normal tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate the potential of this strategy to improve oncolytic virus design and provide a framework for exploiting CPE-regulated transgenes for therapy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Regulation of transgene and viral protein expression is required to increase the safety and efficacy of gene and viral therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Delivery and expression of transgenes with anticancer activity, or the use of conditionally replicating viruses for cancer therapy, must be specific for tumours to avoid side effects to healthy tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most efforts to achieve such selective control have been based on the use of tumour-specific promoters1 and, more recently, by the engineering of target site-recognizing, tissue-specific microRNA (miRNA)2,3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although both strategies contribute highly to tumour selectivity, it has become evident that the post-transcriptional regulation of specific mRNA subpopulations contributes substantially to the broad expression changes of genes responsible for the cancer phenotype7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the translational reprogramming of tumour cells has been proposed as a potential target for tumour-specific drugs8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These tumour-specific translational profiles could therefore be used to generate tumour specificity to transgene and viral protein expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One of the mechanisms to regulate the translation of specific subpopulations of mRNAs is through the presence of cis-acting elements in the 3-untranslated region (3-UTRs) of mRNAs, such as the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE; 5-UUUUA12U-3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CPE is bound by CPE-binding proteins (CPEBs), a family of four members conserved in their RNA-recognition domain but distinct in their regulatory motifs (reviewed in refs 9, 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All four CPEBs recognize RNA via tandem RNA recognition motifs located in their C-terminal halves that are followed by ZZ domains11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RNA recognition motifs define two CPEB subfamilies (CPEB1 and CPEB24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both CPEB subfamilies regulate overlapping populations of mRNAs and recognize similar cis-acting elements, albeit with different affinities12,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The N-terminal domain is highly variable in both length and composition across various CPEB orthologues and paralogues16 and contains all the identified regulatory motifs, including phosphorylations17,18, monoubiquitination15 and sumoylation19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These post-translational modifications dictate whether CPEBs act as translational repressors or promote cytoplasmic polyadenylation and subsequent translational activation (reviewed in refs 9, 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In turn, the specific arrangement of CPEs, in number and in their relative position to other CPEs and the polyadenylation signal20, together with the presence of additional cis-acting elements such as AU-rich elements (AREs)21, quantitatively determine whether a particular mRNA is repressed or activated in a combinatorial code that responds to the activation of specific CPEBs12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although CPEBs have been mainly characterized as regulators of maternal mRNAs during the transcriptionally silent germ cells, they also regulate cytoplasmic polyadenylation in somatic and tumoral cells13,22,23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, CPEBs are extremely conserved within vertebrates (96% for CPEB1 and 99% for CPEB4), the CPEs and the CPE-combinatorial code are conserved and functionally replaceable from frogs to mammals and promote translational repression and activation in rodents and humans13,21,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CPEB levels and activities are differentially regulated in tumours9,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CPEB1 levels are decreased in several human cancers29,30, and reduced levels of this protein have been associated with increased malignancy both in human29 and mouse23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, high CPEB4 expression levels in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and glioblastoma tumours correlated with stimulation of tumour growth, angiogenesis and decreased survival14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, CPEB4 has been identified as one of the seven genes with an expression profile that is associated with colorectal cancer31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we show the feasibility of using the tumoral reprogramming of CPE-mediated translational regulation to provide tumour selectivity to transgene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have engineered a particular CPE arrangement that activates translation in tumour cells while promoting translational repression in non-transformed cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then generated a modified adenovirus in which the E1A protein expression is regulated by CPEBs, to obtain oncoselectivity and attenuated toxicity in non-transformed tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This novel targeting modality increases the therapeutic index of an oncolytic adenovirus and provides a new paradigm for its applicability to gene transfer-based therapeutic approaches.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'CPEs provide oncoselectivity to replicative adenoviruses', 'To identify the optimal sequences required for CPEB-dependent tumour selectivity, we tested chimeric mRNAs with three combinations of 3-UTRs fused to the d2EGFP open reading frame.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mRNAs were expressed in a battery of normal (HPDE) and tumour (RWP-1, PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2) pancreatic cells expressing variable levels of CPEB1 and CPEB4 (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first UTR was derived from Xenopus cyclin B1 (cB1) 3-UTR mRNA and contained two consensus CPEs and one nonconsensus CPE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This CPE arrangement promotes both translational repression by unphosphorylated CPEB1 and translational activation by CPEB412,13,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second UTR was synthetized by combining cB1 CPEs with an ARE sequence that opposes CPE-mediated polyadenylation and translational activation from the tumour-necrosis factor- (TNF-) 3-UTR mRNA (TNF--cB1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third UTR was generated from a fragment of the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) 3-UTR mRNA that contains two CPEs and two ARE sequences14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 1b and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: CPEs containing 3-UTR confer in vitro oncoselectivity to engineered transgenes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The upper panel shows representative western blots showing CPEB1 and CPEB4 expression in pancreatic primary fibroblasts, normal cells (HPDE) and tumour cells (RWP-1, MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lower panel shows quantification of CPEB1 and CPEB4 signals normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Schematic representation of the assessed 3-UTR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regulatory sequences are indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Quantification of relative d2EGFP/dRFP fluorescence intensity levels in cell lines transduced with the indicated lentiviruses and relative to the mean intensity/content of the d2EGFP/dRFP from cells transduced with Lv-WT 3-UTR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are shown as mean±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  from three independent biological replicates and were analysed by a linear mixed model fit by REML and a Tukeys contrast test to assess the significance of the differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  **P less_than 0.01, ***P less_than 0.001. cCPE, consensus CPE;

Fig 2g) as compared to the control virus Adwt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lowest performance of AdCPE was also observed in human primary fibroblasts and the non-tumoral human kidney epithelial HK-2 cells (Fig 2e,f and Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the tumour cells, cB1-3-UTR was as efficient as the WT-3-UTR in supporting optimum levels of viral-driven E1A expression (Fig 2e), which in turn resulted in equal viral genome copy numbers and IC50 from both 3-UTRs (Fig 2f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CPEB-mediated control of E1A expression and viral release was also observed in AdCPE-infected colorectal and glioblastoma cells as well as in the patient-derived pancreatic tumour CP15 (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The similar effects of Adwt and AdCPE in cancer cells also highlight that the small size of the cB1-3-UTR did not compromise virus fitness and packaging efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: CPEs in the 3-UTR of E1A confers in vitro oncoselectivity to adenoviruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic representation of the whole adenoviral genome with the CPE-engineered sites in the E1A viral gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Quantification of E1A pre-mRNA and mature mRNA 4 h postinfection in the indicated cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  qPCR data are shown as the mean±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of five independent biological replicates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  *P less_than 0.05 (two-tailed MannWhitney test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Schematic representation of the RNA ligation-coupled RTPCR technique used to assess poly(A) tail lengths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Polyadenylation of E1A mRNA 4 h postinfection in tumour RWP-1, PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells or in non-tumour HPDE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Retarded migration indicates longer polyadenylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adwt C and AdCPE C correspond to an RNA mix from non-infected cells amplified with specific primers for Adwt and AdCPE, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Representative E1A western blots of pancreatic tumour cells (RWP-1, MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1) and non-tumour cells (HPDE and fibroblasts) infected with Adwt and AdCPE at 72 h postinfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) Quantification of viral production in supernatant 72 h postinfection in tumour (RWP-1, MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1) and non-tumour cells (HPDE and pancreatic fibroblasts) infected with Adwt and AdCPE 72 h postinfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  qPCR data are shown as mean±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of five independent biological replicates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  **P less_than 0.01 and ***P less_than 0.001 (two-tailed MannWhitney test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (g) Cytotoxicity assay in the indicated cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated for each cell line from doseresponse curves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are shown as mean±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  from five independent biological replicates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  *P less_than 0.05 (two-tailed MannWhitney test).Full size image', 'CPE-mediated oncoselectivity is provided by CPEB4', 'To determine whether the higher CPEB4 levels in tumour cells caused the specificity of cB1-3-UTR regulation of mRNA translation, we first confirmed the specificity of CPEB4 binding to the CPEs in cB1-3-UTR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown by RIP, CPEB4 bound cB1-3-UTR WT in a CPE-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, HuR, an ARE-binding protein that promotes mRNA stabilization, displayed almost negligible binding to cB1-3-UTR WT that was not affected by the mutations that inactivate the CPE (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, we knocked down CPEB4 in tumoral RWP-1 cells (RWP-1-sh4) and compared it with a control non-target shRNA (RWP-1-shNT) (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depletion of CPEB4 (RWP-1-sh4) caused a significant reduction of E1A protein levels expressed from AdCPE (Fig 3b), with the subsequent reduction of viral replication (Fig 3c) and increased IC50 values (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, Adwt was unaffected by a CPEB4 knockdown (Fig 3bd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were observed in HCT-116 colorectal and T98 glioblastoma cells (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A reverse approach, of overexpressing CPEB4 in non-tumour cells (HPDE), partially rescued the expression of E1A from AdCPE (Fig 3e) and viral replication (Fig 3f), as compared to Adwt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, high levels of CPEB4 seem to be required for the oncoselective behaviour of the engineered virus and to prevent the CPE-mediated translational repression observed in non-tumour cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: CPEB4 regulates AdCPE E1A expression and viral fitness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Representative western blot of CPEB4 protein downregulation in RWP-1 tumour cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  shNT, non-targeted;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Oncolytic viruses are advancing to clinical trials and are being envisioned as breakthrough agents in oncology in the near future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, optimized engineered viruses are under development to maximize their anticancer effects34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as their potency increases, so do potentially associated toxicities, pointing to the need to develop highly tumour-specific viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that engineering adenoviruses with CPE regulatory elements, to control E1A expression post-transcriptionally, resulted in attenuated viral activity in normal cells while maintaining, or even increasing, potency in cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specificity of the antitumour response is directly derived from the ectopic expression of CPEB4 in tumours14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, depletion of CPEB4 attenuates viral activity in tumour cells, while its overexpression in non-transformed cells increases viral replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In turn, the levels of CPE-mediated expression may be further increased by reduced levels of CPEB1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with a scenario in which CPEB1 in non-transformed cells (in which its levels are high) represses CPE-containing mRNAs22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In tumour cells, on the other hand, CPEB1 levels are reduced9,28, while CPEB4 levels are increased14, which promotes cytoplasmic polyadenylation and thereby increases mRNA stability and translation of CPE-regulated transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, viral genome replication is dependent on CPEB4 activity and can only occur in tumour cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This leads to the production of fully competent viruses in tumour cells but attenuated ones in healthy tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the CPE-regulated virus maintains its oncolytic capacity in tumour cells while significantly reducing its damage to non-tumour tissues, which is mainly in the liver as this is the target organ of adenovirus sequestration on intravascular delivery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increased selectivity allows for an enhanced therapeutic index, since increased antitumour capacity was obtained after AdCPE treatment at viral doses that, with Adwt injection, compromised mice survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We demonstrate here a novel approach to fine-tuning protein expression in a tumour-selective manner by exploiting the post-transcriptional reprogramming of gene expression in tumour cells to control selectivity of an oncolytic virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results have been validated in pancreatic cancer models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, since CPEB4 is overexpressed in several tumours, such as gliomas and colorectal cancers14,31, this oncoselective strategy may be valid for many solid tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach may overcome some of the limitations associated with other commonly used postentry viral targeting approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking advantage of a tumour-selective control by tumour-specific promoters is confronted with the fact that most of the genome is constantly transcribed at low levels, and is a strategy restricted to viruses that rely on the cellular transcription machinery but not for viruses that use virally encoded polymerases for replication in the cytoplasm, such as the measles virus and vaccinia virus34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The alternative postentry strategy to regulate viral replication is a negative targeting approach based on the miRNA expression in normal tissues to restrict viral replication of miRNA-target site-engineered viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, this is a very versatile approach for many different viruses and is highly efficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the evolution of escape mutants in miRNA-targeted viruses, or the potential off-target effects on the host miRNA machinery, have been proposed as potential caveats6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, no mutations were found in the CPE-regulated adenovirus under evolutionary pressure (Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To achieve a tight restriction of replication to tumour cells, it should be possible to combine different targeting strategies such as regulation by more than one viral gene3 or the introduction of transcriptional and post-transcriptional control in the same viral gene35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this line, a double E1A-engineered virus, with the uPAR promoter and the CPE post-transcriptional control, displayed additivity in a non-tumoral context (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This novel tropism-modified strategy presented here provides a framework for exploiting CPE-regulated transgenes to achieve cancer cell-specific expression in therapeutic gene-transfer-based strategies, or to attenuate viruses for vaccine purposes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This technology could also extend to other viruses of interest in virotherapy that require attenuation in particular tissues, such as reoviruses in heart36 or coxsackievirus A21 in the muscle5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Altogether, our data provide a novel paradigm for the development of tumour-specific viruses and provide the proof of principle that CPEB-dependent regulation can be exploited to attenuate viral toxicity, by preventing the spread of the virus in normal tissues, without perturbation of the antitumour efficacy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
