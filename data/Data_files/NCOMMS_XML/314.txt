Ancient human sialic acid variant restricts an emerging zoonotic malaria parasite  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Plasmodium knowlesi is a zoonotic parasite transmitted from macaques causing malaria in humans in Southeast Asia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasmodium parasites bind to red blood cell (RBC) surface receptors, many of which are sialylated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While macaques synthesize the sialic acid variant N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), humans cannot because of a mutation in the enzyme CMAH that converts N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) to Neu5Gc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we reconstitute CMAH in human RBCs for the reintroduction of Neu5Gc, which results in enhancement of P. knowlesi invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that two P. knowlesi invasion ligands, PkDBP and PkDBP, bind specifically to Neu5Gc-containing receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A human-adapted P. knowlesi line invades human RBCs independently of Neu5Gc, with duplication of the sialic acid-independent invasion ligand, PkDBP and loss of PkDBP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that absence of Neu5Gc on human RBCs limits P. knowlesi invasion, but that parasites may evolve to invade human RBCs through the use of sialic acid-independent pathways.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Diverse pathogens including bacteria1,2, parasites3,4 and many different viruses5,6 take advantage of the ubiquity of sialic acids on the surface of mammalian cells to attach to and infect host cells6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sialic acids are a family of acidic sugars usually found at the termini of glycan chains on proteins and lipids7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most common forms of sialic acid on mammalian cells are N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Humans express Neu5Ac, but lack Neu5Gc because of an Alu-mediated exon deletion in the gene encoding cytidine monophosphate Neu5Ac hydroxylase (CMAH), which converts Neu5Ac to Neu5Gc8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This CMAH gene inactivation occurred 3.2 Myr ago11, around a time of active hominin evolution12, and is shared by Neanderthals13, extinct hominins closely related to humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In contrast to the human lineage, CMAH is functional in great apes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variation between human (Neu5Ac) and great ape (Neu5Gc) sialic acid was posited to underlie the host specificity exhibited by the evolutionarily related Laverania parasites, P. falciparum and P. reichenowi, which infect humans and chimpanzees, respectively14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recent work has challenged the view that Neu5Gc is a key host determinant of the tropism exhibited by P. falciparum and other Laverania parasites15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  knowlesi is unique among the human malaria-causing parasites because it displays significant cross-species transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P. knowlesi chronically infects Neu5Gc-positive long-tailed and pig-tailed macaques, as well as Neu5Ac-positive humans17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most human blood-stage infections are mild and associated with low parasitaemias18, but increasing numbers of severe infections accompanied by high parasitaemias are being reported19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is growing concern that this simian parasite is adapting to infect humans more efficiently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown that P. knowlesi can expand its preferred host cell niche by invading older red blood cells (RBCs)21, and this is an important factor influencing adaptation of P. knowlesi to the human population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we sought to test the hypothesis that Neu5Gc is a key determinant of P. knowlesi tropism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We modified human RBCs by introducing Neu5Gc on the cell surface through expression of chimpanzee CMAH in ex vivo-cultured RBCs (cRBCs)22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that while Neu5Gc expression has no effect on P. falciparum invasion, it significantly increases P. knowlesi invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, both PkDBP and PkDBP, which belong to the Duffy binding protein (DBP) ligand family, bind to Neu5Gc-sialylated receptors, potentially facilitating invasion of Neu5Gc-expressing human cRBCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In demonstrating that a human-adapted P. knowlesi lab strain efficiently invades Neu5Gc-expressing human cRBCs in a sialic acid-independent manner, we identify a potential host factor that P. knowlesi must overcome for efficient adaptation to humans.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Students t-test (two-tailed)) compared with Neu5Ac-positive pLVX cRBCs (Fig 2a), bringing the level of P. knowlesi invasion close to that found for macaque RBCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provides direct functional evidence that the absence of Neu5Gc is a major restriction factor for P. knowlesi invasion of human RBCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our in vitro culture system produces cRBCs of similar age, as indicated by CD71 expression (Supplementary Fig 3), suggesting that Neu5Gc mediates invasion independently of RBC age21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Introduction of Neu5Gc on human RBCs increases P. knowlesi invasion but does not affect P. falciparum invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) P. knowlesi H invasion of PtCMAH cRBCs is significantly enhanced, compared with pLVX cRBCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b,c) Sialic acid-dependent and sialic acid-independent P. falciparum strains Dd2 (b) and 3D7 (c), respectively, invade PtCMAH cRBCs and pLVX cRBCs similarly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human and macaque RBCs are included as controls for each strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parasitized erythrocyte multiplication rate for P. knowlesi H is the average of four independent experiments and for P. falciparum Dd2 and 3D7, three independent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars indicate the s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Students t-test (two-tailed) was used to assess significant differences in invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  *P=0.012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NS, not significant.Full size image', 'P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  falciparum is not affected by Neu5Gc on human RBCs', 'To directly determine the impact of cell surface Neu5Gc on P. falciparum invasion, we assessed invasion of the P. falciparum sialic acid-dependent and sialic acid-independent laboratory-adapted strains, Dd2 and 3D7, respectively, into RBCs expressing different sialic acid variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, P. falciparum Dd2 and 3D7 invaded human RBCs, but not macaque RBCs29 (Fig 2b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in contrast to P. knowlesi, both P. falciparum strains invaded PtCMAH cRBCs and pLVX cRBCs at similar levels (Fig 2b,c), suggesting that P. falciparum can utilise both Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This supports the biochemical evidence that the major sialic acid-dependent invasion ligand P. falciparum erythrocyte-binding antigen-175 does not discriminate between Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PtCMAH cRBCs have 30% of the normal complement of Neu5Ac that might be sufficient for efficient invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this is not supported by the finding that an enzymatic reduction of Neu5Ac to 30% normal levels on human RBCs results in significantly decreased invasion by P. falciparum sialic acid-dependent lines (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'PkDBP and PkDBP bind to sialylated receptors', 'To identify the molecular determinants of sialic acid-dependent invasion in P. knowlesi, we recombinantly expressed the binding domains of the P. knowlesi DBP ligands, PkDBP, PkDBP and PkDBP30 (Supplementary Fig 5a,b), as fusions with the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) pentamerization domain31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PkDBP binds to the DARC receptor32, while PkDBP and PkDBP have been shown to bind rhesus macaque RBCs33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assessed binding of recombinant PkDBP domains to normal and enzyme-treated human and rhesus macaque RBC ghosts in protein overlay assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, PkDBP did not bind to chymotrypsin-treated macaque RBC ghosts (chymotrypsin cleaves DARC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, binding to untreated and trypsin-treated macaque ghosts, as well as macaque ghosts stripped of sialic acid by neuraminidase treatment was preserved (Fig 3a), as expected32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, PkDBP and PkDBP did not bind to neuraminidase-treated macaque RBC ghosts, demonstrating that PkDBP and PkDBP are both sialic acid-binding ligands (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sialic acid dependence of PkDBP has been reported previously34, but the same study concludes that PkDBP binds to macaque RBCs in a sialic acid-independent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our protein overlay and orthogonal flow cytometry-based-binding data (Fig 3c;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this study, we used an ex vivo RBC culture system coupled with lentiviral transgene expression of CMAH to specifically and functionally study Neu5Gc, as a determinant of the tropism displayed by the zoonotic macaque parasite P. knowlesi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide evidence that P. knowlesi is restricted in its invasion of human RBCs due to the absence of surface Neu5Gc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evolutionarily, this modified sialic acid was once present in ancestral humans Myr ago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is plausible that selective pressure due to a Plasmodium parasite utilizing this invasion pathway could have resulted in loss of a functional CMAH in ancestral humans, given the considerable evidence that malaria has shaped the human genome4,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, fossil records of ancestral macaques in Africa do not place them in East Africa at the site of CMAH inactivation, but rather in North Africa, from where they migrated to Eurasia 5.5 Myr ago41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, an ancestral zoonotic P. knowlesi species is less likely to have been the selective force for CMAH loss 3.2 Myr ago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that a Laverania parasite, such as P. reichenowi, that infects chimpanzees (which have Neu5Gc-positive RBCs) is a more likely candidate for the selective pressure leading to CMAH loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless of the origins, we suggest that CMAH gene inactivation in humans is currently a restriction factor limiting the emergence of P. knowlesi infections in the human population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'However, the human-adapted Pk YH1 strain used in this study suggests that P. knowlesi can adapt to overcome this restriction through duplication of the sialic acid-independent PkDBP invasion ligand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our hypothesis that Pk YH1 has greater and more efficient usage of the PkDBPDARC invasion pathway is supported by the increased IC50 for Pk YH1 in the MGSA invasion inhibition assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed deletion of the Neu5Gc-dependent PkDBP, although whether this was a necessary change concomitant with the duplication of PkDBP, remains to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The space-filling model for the display of invasion ligands at the apical end of the invading parasite42,43 can be one way to rationalize how increased expression of PkDBP and loss of PkDBP may enhance invasion of human RBCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With limited space at the apex of the parasite for the deployment of invasion ligands before invasion, increased expression of PkDBP and absence of PkDBP would result in greater release of PkDBP to the apex of the parasite, resulting in an increased number of productive PkDBPDARC interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PkDBP and PkDBP are expressed together with PkDBP in wild-type P. knowlesi44,45, making plausible the increased apical presentation of PkDBP in the absence of PkDBP in Pk YH1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The duplication of PkDBP in Pk YH1 is reminiscent of the duplication of the closely related P. vivax DBP invasion ligand observed in P. vivax isolates in Madagascar46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This P. vivax DBP duplication, likely a recent event, may have been selected for the efficient invasion of Malagasy individuals, where RBCs that are either homozygous for DARC-negative alleles or heterozygous for DARC-negative/DARC-positive alleles are common.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The rise in reported malaria cases due to P. knowlesi infection in Southeast Asia19,20 raises concern about the possible occurrence of human-to-human transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is already evidence suggesting the clustering of P. knowlesi infections in households, where individuals had not been in proximity to macaques47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the 1950s, the use of P. knowlesi as a treatment for tertiary neurosyphilis had to be stopped because of increased pathogenicity of the parasite, with continuous passaging in humans49,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that increased parasite adaptation to humans may be associated with severe disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that genetic changes in the DBP invasion ligands might be a sentinel indicator of increased adaptation to humans.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
