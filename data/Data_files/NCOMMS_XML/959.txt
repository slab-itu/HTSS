Adrenergic-mediated loss of splenic marginal zone B cells contributes to infection susceptibility after stroke  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Infection is a major complication of acute stroke and causes increased mortality and morbidity; however, current interventions do not prevent infection and improve clinical outcome in stroke patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanisms that underlie susceptibility to infection in these patients are unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Splenic marginal zone (MZ) B cells are innate-like lymphocytes that provide early defence against bacterial infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show experimental stroke in mice induces a marked loss of MZ B cells, deficiencies in capturing blood-borne antigen and suppression of circulating IgM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These deficits are accompanied by spontaneous bacterial lung infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IgM levels are similarly suppressed in stroke patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -adrenergic receptor antagonism after experimental stroke prevents loss of splenic MZ B cells, preserves IgM levels, and reduces bacterial burden.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that adrenergic-mediated loss of MZ B cells contributes to the infection-prone state after stroke and identify systemic B-cell disruption as a target for therapeutic manipulation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Clinical outcome in stroke patients is influenced not only by the primary brain injury but also neurological and medical complications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection is the most common complication of stroke, affecting up to one third of patients, and is independently associated with increased short-term and long-term mortality and morbidity1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infections of bacterial origin affecting the respiratory or urinary tracts are the most prevalent and pneumonia itself is associated with a threefold increase in mortality and poorer functional outcome in survivors1,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to dysphagia and immobility, stroke-induced impairments in some aspects of systemic immunity are thought to contribute to risk of infection after stroke2,5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A general reduction in cellularity of systemic lymphoid tissues and blood has been described in experimental models of stroke and in patients2,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Impaired function of various T-cell subsets has also been reported after experimental stroke in mice and is associated with spontaneous pneumonia2,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of autonomic neural pathways seems to be central to these systemic immune alterations2,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Infection occurs most frequently in the first few days after stroke; therefore, deficits in conventional mechanisms of adaptive immunity, which are slowly activated, are unlikely to account for the initial susceptibility to infection1,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is increasing awareness of the importance of lymphocytes with innate-like functions in tissue homeostasis, immune regulation and infection control13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Marginal zone (MZ) B cells are a subset of innate-like lymphocytes in the MZ of the spleen, an important interface between the circulation and the immune system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MZ B cells mediate rapid responses to bacterial infection within 13 days after pathogen encounter by rapidly producing polyreactive immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies that recognise highly conserved microbial molecular patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This response is a crucial early anti-bacterial defence mechanism thought to bridge the temporal gap until conventional follicular B cells can respond in a T-cell-dependent manner14,15,16,17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individuals who lack spleens due to congenital dysfunction or surgery, or have disruptions to their splenic MZ, are susceptible to similar strains of encapsulated bacteria that typically cause lung infections in stroke patients20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The susceptibility to these infections in asplenic individuals is generally attributed to a lack of MZ B-cell-derived, T-cell-independent, IgM and IgG antibody specific for bacterial capsular polysaccharides21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MZ B cells are one of the major cellular sources of IgM produced early after infection and individuals with IgM deficiency are also at particular risk of bacterial respiratory infection24,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus there is an important functional relationship among innate-like functions of splenic MZ B cells, IgM and the lung that is essential for anti-bacterial defence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore pertinent to identify if innate-like B-cell anti-bacterial defences are affected by stroke, a phenomenon that has not been investigated previously in the context of any central nervous system (CNS) injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general support that systemic B-cell populations may be sensitive to CNS injury, a loss of B-cell populations and reduced antibody production by follicular B cells in response to immunisation with T-cell-dependent antigen was shown in experimental models of spinal cord trauma, although assessment was several weeks after injury27,28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, given that most infections occur in the first few days after stroke, and the established role of innate-like B cells in rapid anti-bacterial defence against strains typically affecting patients, we sought to identify if systemic innate-like B-cell functions are affected by ischaemic stroke and contribute to infection susceptibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We show that experimental stroke in mice causes rapid loss of MZ B cells associated with impaired IgM production and spontaneous bacterial infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also demonstrate lower concentrations of circulating IgM in patients with acute ischaemic stroke and that IgM levels are most suppressed in patients who develop infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adrenergic signalling mediates these deficits, suggesting involvement of autonomic pathways in brain-immune communication affecting B-cell function after stroke.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blockade of adrenergic signalling after experimental stroke using propranolol prevents loss of MZ B cells, restores circulating IgM levels and reduces infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data reveal loss of innate-like B-cell populations and their associated functions as an important mechanism contributing to infection susceptibility after stroke and highlight this pathway as a potential target for intervention.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

adrenaline concentrations were unaltered (Fig 6b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2-adrenergic receptor (2-AR) surface protein expression was detected on both MZ and follicular B cells with a significantly higher proportion of MZ B cells expressing the receptor (Fig 6c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was despite a small but significantly lower expression of Adrb2 on MZ B cells (Supplementary Fig 5), consistent with Immgen expression data (https://www.immgen.org/) although differences between gene and surface protein abundance are not uncommon due to post-transcriptional and post-translational modification including regulation of protein trafficking and degradation39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stimulation of in vitro cultures of isolated splenocytes with noradrenaline resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in B-cell viability with a greater reduction in viability of MZ B cells (37%) than in follicular B cells (13%; Fig 6d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are consistent with our in vivo observations on lymphoid tissue changes after MCAO where both MZ and follicular B cells numbers are decreased but MZ B cells are affected to a greater extent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The more prevalent surface protein expression of 2-AR on MZ B cells may underlie this relatively greater sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Selective sensitivity of mature and MZ B cells to adrenergic

B-cell subpopulations after MCAO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mature recirculating subpopulations comprising naïve and plasma B cells were significantly reduced, whereas immature B cells newly differentiated from haematopoietic precursors and long-lived memory B cells remained relatively unaffected (Fig 6f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the sensitivity of bone marrow, as well as splenic B cells, to MCAO-induced loss corresponds with the pattern of 2-AR expression across different subsets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data also suggest that the sustained loss of splenic B cells up to 5 day after MCAO is unlikely due to deficits in cellular repopulation of lymphoid tissues as the numbers of immature progenitor B cells in the bone marrow were unaffected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In view of the similar effects of stroke on

blocking -AR signalling in vivo could prevent the loss of MZ B cells induced by MCAO using the pan--AR blocker, propranolol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Propranolol treatment resulted in preservation of splenic

area of MZ B-cell labelling using multiple MZ B-cell markers (CD21/35, CD1d and IgM (Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The area of total B220+ B-cell labelling in WP was also significantly greater in animals treated with propranolol in comparison to PBS-treated controls (Fig 7c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conjunction with preservation of MZ B cells, plasma IgM concentration after MCAO was significantly greater in propranolol-treated mice compared to PBS-treated controls (Fig 7d) and levels approximated those observed in sham-operated mice described above (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Propranolol treatment significantly reduced bacterial burden in comparison to PBS-treated controls (Fig 7e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protection of B-cell numbers in propranolol-treated mice was mediated by prevention of MZ and follicular B-cell death as determined by a reduction in MZ (Fig 7f,g) and follicular (Fig 7f,h) B-cell immunolabelling co-localisating with TUNEL in comparison to PBS-treated controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no significant effect of propranolol on infarct volume although we did note a trend towards smaller infarcts in propranolol-treated mice (Supplementary Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the extent of brain injury was comparable to that observed above (Supplementary Fig 1a) that induced severe splenic disruption which was absent in propranolol-treated mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, there was no correlation between infarct volume and plasma IgM concentration (Supplementary Fig 7a,b) yet lung bacterial burden inversely correlated with plasma IgM concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This supports that rescue from severely suppressed levels of IgM in propranolol-treated mice is associated with lower susceptibility to infection (Supplementary Fig 7c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data suggest that propranolol can affect plasma IgM concentration independently of the extent of primary brain injury and most likely through preservation of splenic B-cell populations after MCAO, notably MZ B cells, the major source of rapidly inducible IgM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively with in vitro findings above, these data show that -AR signalling mediates loss of MZ B cells and their innate-like functions early after MCAO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, reversal of these MCAO-induced impairments by -AR blockade is associated with reduced susceptibility to stroke-associated

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The data presented here provide compelling evidence of neuroimmune driven disruption to innate-like B cells after stroke and suggest these alterations as a novel mechanism contributing to the infection-prone state induced by ischaemic stroke in addition to previously described impairments in other immune cell populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that anti-microbial function of innate-like B cells is affected by stroke.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Key findings include that (1) stroke induces marked loss of splenic MZ B cells along with gross disruption to splenic microarchitecture, (2) MZ B-cell capture of antigen is deficient after stroke, (3) circulating IgM levels are suppressed after stroke in mice and humans and lower IgM levels are evident in stroke patients with infection and (4) 2-AR-mediated signalling drives stroke-induced MZ B-cell loss and susceptibility to infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'MZ B cells are one of several types of lymphocytes that display innate-like attributes as reflected by their innate activation via pattern recognition receptors, speed of responsiveness and antigen polyreactivity, making them vital immune sentinels that mediate rapid systemic anti-microbial immunity17,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The depletion of MZ B cells as early as 24 h after MCAO results in deficits in the ability to capture MZ B-cell-targeted antigen and a high bacterial burden accumulates in the lungs over a similar time-frame.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This rapid loss of a cell population which is critical for early anti-bacterial defence is highly relevant because of the timing of infections after stroke.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, almost all cases of pneumonia occur within the first week, and half of these within 2 days1,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such an immediate window of susceptibility suggests that deficiencies in innate or innate-like functions are important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have reported altered macrophage responses early after stroke, however these have largely focussed on markers of immunoregulatory phenotype or antigen presentation rather than direct effector and microbicidal functions5,40,41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to their speed of response, MZ B cells are specialised to respond to T-independent antigens that include polysaccharides of encapsulated bacteria17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bacterial strains causing early onset pneumonia in stroke patients most frequently include the encapsulated Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphyloccocus aureus43,44,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of splenic MZ B cells early after MCAO is therefore of particular relevance to both the types of bacterial infection and when they occur in stroke patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Splenic MZ B cells are a major source of IgM, particularly during the early stages of infection16,46,47,48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite a high bacterial burden in the lungs and blood after MCAO and hence strong stimulus for antibody secretion, we found significantly lower levels of circulating IgM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IgM is also produced constitutively as natural antibody by MZ B cells and B1 B cells50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lower IgM levels after MCAO may reflect a loss of constitutive natural antibody production as well as impaired infection-triggered production due to a lack of MZ B cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IgM has a short half-life (12 h) thus the early reduction in IgM we observed after MCAO is consistent with this rate of turnover51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with the mouse data, which showed rapid and sustained splenic MZ disruption, plasma IgM concentration was also significantly reduced in patients as early as 24 h after stroke and this was maintained up to the 57 days time point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it is possible that individuals who subsequently have stroke could have lower pre-existing IgM levels than those who do not, this is an unlikely explanation given that paired controls were well matched for age, sex and degree of atherosclerosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A significantly greater reduction in IgM concentration during the first week after stroke was associated with infection, which was observed in one third of patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As described in previous studies, infection was also associated with greater initial stroke severity4,12,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data are consistent with a recent study showing lower IgG levels in stroke patients which was associated with bacterial infection, however, these deficits were not associated with a B-cell-dependent mechanism53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conjunction with our mouse MCAO data, it is reasonable to speculate that deficits in innate-like B-cell function, including IgM production, could mediate the effects of greater stroke severity on infection risk in patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However the precise mechanisms of reduced circulating IgM concentrations leading to susceptibility to bacterial lung infection still remain to be fully elucidated in the context of stroke.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our exploratory analysis indicated a combination of greater stroke severity and lower IgM may identify those individuals at particularly high risk of infection although further studies are warranted to address these links more definitively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The loss of MZ B cells and suppression of circulating IgM levels after MCAO were reversed by blockade of -AR signalling and this was accompanied by a significantly lower bacterial lung burden.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spleen is directly innervated and our data showing elevated splenic noradrenaline levels after MCAO are consistent with previous studies reporting activation of sympathetic neural circuits after MCAO and increased circulating catecholamines (or metabolites of these) in stroke patients2,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression of the 2-AR across different B-cell subsets was previously unknown and our data provide a rational explanation for the relatively greater sensitivity of MZ B cells to depletion after MCAO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of the 2-AR on human B cells further supports their sensitivity to similar neural signals as observed in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of particular note is that few immature B cells expressed the 2-AR and this correlated with stable numbers in the bone marrow after MCAO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of specific splenic B-cell populationsis therefore unlikely to be the result of impaired B-cell differentiation in bone marrow and moreover highlights selective sensitivity of B cells at different stages of development to neural signalling activated after stroke.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However we do not exclude that noradrenaline could also act indirectly via an intermediate cell to affect B cells after experimental stroke and the precise mechanisms of how brain ischaemia results in increased splenic noradrenaline remain to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used propranolol simply as an experimental tool to antagonise 2-AR signalling and it is likely that therapeutic targeting of B cells themselves would provide a superior approach clinically to target infection susceptibility given the potential adverse effects of general 2-AR blockade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless it is relevant to note recent interest in re-evaluating the role of -blocker treatment in stroke patients55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As noted above, our data implicate B-cell death as the terminal mechanism responsible for their depletion after MCAO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2-AR activation on B cells has thus far only been studied in vitro and reported effects vary dependent on other exogenous stimuli included in culture56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atrophy of lymphoid organs including the spleen occurs after experimental stroke and is thought to reflect general apoptosis of lymphocytes although effects on MZ B cells specifically were unknown40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have suggested that surgical and/or anaesthetic stress could contribute to transient immune alterations after MCAO57,58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However effects on MZ B cells after MCAO were maintained out to 7 day and we observed no alterations in cell death or splenic microarchitecture and did not detect any bacterial growth in sham-operated mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the effects we describe are specific to the stroke-induced brain injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The disruption to systemic anti-microbial B-cell function after stroke we describe here raises the possibility that interventions directed at preventing these changes could be a novel strategy to reduce infection risk and associated mortality/morbidity after stroke.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, there are no treatments proven to reduce rates of infection after stroke that improve clinical outcome, including preventative antibiotic therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study suggests this may in part be due to ineffective prevention of pneumonia59,60,61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transiently augmenting systemic B-cell function, in particular innate-like responses in the first few days after stroke, may offer potential advantages to other approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Effects of B cells in the brain during the acute phase of experimental stroke are neuroprotective and limit tissue-damaging inflammation suggesting the risk of exacerbating brain damage may be relatively low for B-cell-targeted approaches62,63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recent discovery that auto-antibody production by B cells may promote dementia long-term after experimental stroke, and have pathological effects in models of CNS trauma must be considered, however, these effects are likely greatly separated in time and space from the role of anti-microbial innate-like B-cell function relevant to infection control during the acute phase of stroke64,65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although increased risk of autoimmunity must also be considered, a recent study showed that generally attenuating stroke-induced immunosuppression increased levels of CNS-specific autoantibodies but had no detrimental effect on long-term outcome in mice66.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we propose that studies examining the effects of B-cell-targeted approaches to preventing infection after stroke are warranted and suggest that markers of systemic B-cell function, as an adjunct to existing indicators, may have potential utility in identifying stroke patients at particularly high risk of infection.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
