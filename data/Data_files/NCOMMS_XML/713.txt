Nanomechanical motion transduction with a scalable localized gap plasmon architecture  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Plasmonic structures couple oscillating electromagnetic fields to conduction electrons in noble metals and thereby can confine optical-frequency excitations at nanometre scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This confinement both facilitates miniaturization of nanophotonic devices and makes their response highly sensitive to mechanical motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanically coupled plasmonic devices thus hold great promise as building blocks for next-generation reconfigurable optics and metasurfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a flexible approach for accurately batch-fabricating high-performance plasmomechanical devices is currently lacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we introduce an architecture integrating individual plasmonic structures with precise, nanometre features into tunable mechanical resonators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The localized gap plasmon resonators strongly couple light and mechanical motion within a three-dimensional, sub-diffraction volume, yielding large quality factors and record optomechanical coupling strength of 2 THz·nm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Utilizing these features, we demonstrate sensitive and spatially localized optical transduction of mechanical motion with a noise floor of 6 fm·Hz1/2, representing a 1.5 orders of magnitude improvement over existing localized plasmomechanical systems.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Chip-scale devices coupling light with mechanical degrees of freedom are ubiquitous, finding applications from spatial light modulators in movie theaters, through telecommunications and adaptive optics for astronomy1,2, to atomic-scale mass sensing and sensitive optical readout of micromechanical sensors such as atomic force microscopy cantilevers3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dielectric cavity optomechanical devices with narrow resonance linewidths achieve strong coupling of optical modes with motion that is significantly influenced by the optical forces6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This dynamic back-action has been used to remarkable effect, such as optical cooling and observation of macroscopic quantum mechanical behaviour7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, dielectric devices such as photonic crystal and whispering gallery resonators have micron-sized physical extents and minimum optical mode sizes approximately equal to the wavelength of light within the material8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inability of dielectric devices to concentrate light beyond this limit hinders their usage for detecting motion from nanometre-sized regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Plasmonic systems offer a complimentary application domain enabled by large optical bandwidth and extreme miniaturization of optical modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Localized plasmon resonances, supported by noble metal nanostructures, confine optical-frequency excitations into nanometre volumes by converting free-space electromagnetic energy into the electromechanical energy of charge-density oscillations9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resonant frequencies of these modes depend sensitively on the nanostructures geometric configuration such as the gap size between interacting elements10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, strong coupling of light to nanomechanical motion can be realized by introducing a mechanical degree of freedom into the plasmonic structure12,13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasmomechanical systems based on this principle have been suggested for applications in reconfigurable metamaterials12, compact optical switches13 and sensors, enabling optical motion readout in nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) as well as dynamic light manipulation by NEMS17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to realize the benefits of this approach compared with stationary plasmonic devices and metasurfaces18, individual plasmomechanical elements must efficiently transform minute mechanical motions into changes in far-field optical amplitude or phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This requirement necessitates reliable production of plasmonic elements having precise, movable nanoscale gaps over a region that is large compared with the individual element size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concurrently, the flexibility to tune the plasmonic and mechanical geometries is desirable for shaping the near-field plasmomechanical interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a scalable and flexible approach for making these devices near the physical limits of optical confinement and plasmomechanical coupling19 is currently lacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this article, we introduce a monolithic plasmonic-NEMS (pNEMS) device architecture, in which localized gap plasmon (LGP) resonators with precise, large-area nanoscale gaps are embedded into arrays of moving silicon nitride nanostructures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our fabrication approach yields thousands of devices per chip with individually tailorable plasmonic and mechanical designs, and is compatible with optical lithography batch-fabrication and integration with electronics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LGP resonators produce record optomechanical coupling strengths of 2 THz·nm1 and large plasmonic quality factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these features enable measurement of mechanical motion from a 165 × 350 nm2 device area with a 6 fm·Hz1/2 noise floor, representing a sensitivity that is 1.5 orders of magnitude lower than previously achieved with localized plasmonic resonators17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This architecture paves the way for advances in nanomechanical sensing, ultrasmall reconfigurable photonics and randomly addressable metamaterials.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Naturally, pursuing the largest value of gOM is of value for plasmomechanical systems, and we see that values in excess of 4 THz·nm1 are in principle achievable by shrinking the gap to 10 nm or smaller.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond this point, classical electrodynamic theory breaks down in single-nanometre scale gaps19, preventing further coupling and confinement improvements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Practically, due to the presence of attractive forces arising from Van der Waals interactions as well as possible residual embedded charges in the SiNx, producing devices with as-deposited Cr layers thinner than 12 nm would require increased mechanical stiffness, which is undesirable for applications in sensing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, creating stiffer, faster and actuated pNEMS with sub-10 nm gaps is an attractive future avenue for producing electrically-tunable small plasmonic elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4 shows that varying the input power of the measurement laser causes a linear reduction in the mechanical frequency for both devices (insets, Fig 4a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, we observe a change in the mechanical frequency of the third beam device as a function of detuning (Fig 4c inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, the behaviour likely does not result from the optical spring effect8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we suspect that bulk heating of the devices and a photothermal spring effect27 contributes to the observed mechanical frequency changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These intricate thermal effects will be the subject of a future study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An advantage of the pNEMS architecture is that tailored thermal bimorph or electrostatic actuation can be included with additional patterning steps, before release of the devices, to achieve device tunability by electrical, as well as optical means.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to photothermal effects, using optical forces for light-based control of pNEMS is somewhat more difficult to achieve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intrinsic losses in plasmonic metals limit the plasmonic quality factor, yielding  products about two orders of magnitude lower than those in high-quality dielectric optomechanical systems with very large optical Q.

Using the standard deviations derived from Lorentzian fits, we find that  and S are negligibly small.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the uncertainty is dominated by contributions from thermal mechanical fluctuation amplitude .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using  from nanoindentor measurements (one s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  from six independent measurements),  representing, conservatively, a maximum 20 K variability in the beam temperature above room 300 K, and  from mechanical modelling, we find that .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gOM values have an additional 10 % error resulting from the standard deviation for GDC, determined from the linear fit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'The authors declare that all data supporting this work are contained in graphics displayed in the main text or in the Supplementary Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data used to generate these graphics are available from the authors upon request.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
