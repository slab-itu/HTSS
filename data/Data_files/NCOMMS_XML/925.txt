Past penguin colony responses to explosive volcanism on the Antarctic Peninsula  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Changes in penguin populations on the Antarctic Peninsula have been linked to several environmental factors, but the potentially devastating impact of volcanic activity has not been considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use detailed biogeochemical analyses to track past penguin colony change over the last 8,500 years on Ardley Island, home to one of the Antarctic Peninsulas largest breeding populations of gentoo penguins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first sustained penguin colony was established on Ardley Island c. 6,700 years ago, pre-dating sub-fossil evidence of Peninsula-wide occupation by c. 1,000 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The colony experienced five population maxima during the Holocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, we find no consistent relationships with local-regional atmospheric and ocean temperatures or sea-ice conditions, although the colony population maximum, c. 4,0003,000 years ago, corresponds with regionally elevated temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, at least three of the five phases of penguin colony expansion were abruptly ended by large eruptions from the Deception Island volcano, resulting in near-complete local extinction of the colony, with, on average, 400800 years required for sustainable recovery.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Evidence of different penguin species responses to changes in climate and other environmental variables are based on short-term observational records (typically the last 3060 years1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8), studies of the age and provenance of sub-fossils found in abandoned penguin colonies9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16, and genetic and genomic studies of their evolutionary history17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of these studies have focussed on how climatic, oceanographic and anthropogenic factors affect penguin populations through access to food and nesting sites and predatorprey dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As far as we are aware, no studies have investigated the long-term impact of large explosive volcanic eruptions on penguin colony size and distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Deception Island off the north-western Antarctic Peninsula (AP) (Fig 1a) is a highly active volcano20,21,22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its Late Pleistocene-early Holocene, caldera-forming eruption(s) were exceptionally explosive (Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI)25 of 67), producing an estimated 3060 km3 of volcanic ash24,26, but the 20+ eruptions of the historical era (last c. 200 years) and the 30+ eruptions identified in Holocene (11.750 ka) records have been smaller and less explosive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most small eruptions from Deception Island present an immediate hazard to penguins nesting within its crater and in the immediate vicinity from ash-fall and pyroclastic flows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, fine volcanic ash is often widely dispersed across the AP by strong Southern Westerly winds20,22,27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, following the December 19671970 CE eruptions (c. 0.1 km3, VEI=3)20, a fine layer of tephra  less_than 2 mm thick was deposited on Ardley Island and the Fildes Peninsula, King George Island and South Shetland Islands (SSI), c. 120 km north-west of Deception Island (Fig 1a)21, and in the James Ross Island (JRI) ice core, c. 200 km away on the north-eastern AP29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even relatively minor volcanic eruptions can be potentially devastating to the ecology at locations far from the eruption source30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In terms of penguin mortality, the fine basaltic-andesitic tephra, most commonly produced by Deception Island eruptions, contains large volumes of fine and physically abrasive glass, poisonous aerosols (for example, SO2, F), as well as trace elements and toxic metals (for example, Cd, As, Pb)31 that can adversely affect their physiological functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Study sites and the location of different types of records examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Antarctica, the northern Antarctic Peninsula (AP), the Anvers Trough marine core GC047 sampling site and the South Shetland Islands (SSI), located between the mean modern-day (NSIDC 19812010 CE;

'Guano geochemistry', 'The geochemistry of Ardley Lake (ARD, study site) and Yanou Lake (YAN, control site) sediments showed significant fluctuations with sediment depth and modelled age (Figs 2, 3, 4, Supplementary Notes 47, Supplementary Figs 313, 16, Supplementary Tables 17, Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  R-mode cluster analysis performed on the inter-correlation coefficients of major and trace element concentrations in the ARD record clearly separated guano-derived elements (Sr, Cu, Zn, Se, Ca, Se, P, C, N, S) and guano-associated elements (Cd, As, Hg) from lithogenic elements (for example, Al, Mg, Si, Sc, Ti, Zr, Y and REE) derived from weathering of local volcanic bedrock (Fig 2, Supplementary Fig 8b, Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No similarly clear separation of elements was evident in the YAN control record (Supplementary Fig 8c; Supplementary Table 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The positive correlation between Ca and P (r=0.63, P less_than 0.001; Supplementary Table 4) suggests that hydroxylapatite is the main phosphate phase in the ARD record (Supplementary Notes 1,8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selected element-aluminium cross-plots (Fig 3a) show that Ardley Lake sediments clearly represent a mixture between two end members: eroded Ardley Island bedrock and ornithogenically derived (bird-formed) soil and sediment from the lakes catchment, whereas the geochemistry of Yanou Lake sediments is strongly associated with local bedrock and tephra deposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The influence of penguin guano on the sediment samples from Ardley Lake is further supported by their C/N and C/P ratios (C/N=av.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6.6, C/P=av.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3.3), which are close to those previously reported in ornithogenic soils (C/N=6.3, C/P=1.23.7) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  49) (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, they differ significantly from ratios found in phytoplankton and local plants, for example, carpet mosses, lichens (Usnea antarctica), liverworts and vascular plants, such as Deschampsia antarctica (Fig 3b, C/N=21114)50 present in the catchment area of both lakes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Whole core geochemistry of Ardley Lake sediments.Downcore profiles of selected aluminium normalized guano-elements (P, Zn, As, Cu, TN, TS, TC, Ca, Sr, Hg, Se), lithogenic elements (Si, Ti, Zr) and age-depth model (ARD-M5) of the ARD record (Supplementary Data 1,2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intact juvenile Pygoscelis Papua bones found at core depths are labelled B1B6 (scale bars are 1 cm): B1 is a cnemial crest bone of the tibiotarsus (left leg);

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Ardley Lake began accumulating sediments c. 8.8 cal ka BP 9.28.4 cal ka BP following retreat of the SSI Ice Cap from this part of the Fildes Peninsula between 10.1 and 8.2 cal ka BP (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  52), driven by early Holocene thermal maximum conditions recorded in regional marine and ice core temperature records (the early Holocene Optimum (EHO) in Fig 4g (refs 29, 47, 48)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highly explosive, T7 eruption, c. 7 cal ka BP 6.07.7 cal ka BP, had a bi-modal basaltic-andesitic and trachydacitic-rhyolitic composition, and dispersed tephra widely across the northern Peninsula and Scotia Sea (Supplementary Figs 20,21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This and other more widespread early Holocene eruptions occurred before the Ardley Lake colony was established, and could have disrupted early post-deglaciation penguin colonization across the north-western AP (Supplementary Discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Following the EHO, an extended period of generally warmer interglacial conditions, with minor variations in temperature existed on the AP between 9.2 and 2.5 cal ka BP (refs 48, 29) (Fig 4f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These conditions, together with the extended periods of open water in Maxwell Bay (Fig 4c) and on the Anvers Shelf (Fig 4d) enabled the establishment of a small penguin colony on Ardley Island from c. 6.7 cal ka BP 7.45.8 cal ka BP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the oldest in situ evidence of a Holocene penguin colony on the AP, and up to c. 1,000 years before the sub-fossil evidence of occupation for the mid-southern western AP from c. 5.8 cal ka BP 5.95.6 cal ka BP, and the northern AP from c. 5.5 cal ka BP 5.65.3 cal ka BP (refs 12, 53) (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The peak in penguin populations during guano phase GP-1 (6.76.3 cal ka BP) coincided with a continuation of the local open water conditions in Maxwell Bay (Fig 4c), but at the same time there were contrasting reductions in shelf-edge spring/summer open water conditions 6.76.0 cal ka BP in the Anvers Trough (inferred from higher Fragilariopsis curta/F.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  kerguelensis diatom ratios and lower percentage of pelagic open water diatoms), and other records of cooler and increased sea-ice conditions around the SSI 7.35.2 cal ka BP (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Local sea-ice conditions appear to be the most significant factor in driving GP-1, which ended when there was a gradual increase in sea-ice in Maxwell Bay more than 200 years before the T6 eruption event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The following two (of three) prominent Ardley Lake guano dry mass accumulation maxima occurred during GP-2 and GP-3 c. 5.85.3 and 4.54.3 cal ka BP (Fig 4b, Supplementary Table 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In marked contrast to GP-1, both GP-2 and GP3 occurred during a period of greater sea-ice extent or seasonality in Maxwell Bay (Fig 4c), despite the preference of gentoo penguins for ice-free conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These maxima also show no strong or consistent relationships with sea-ice conditions on the Anvers Shelf (Fig 4d), ocean temperatures at PD (Fig 4e) or atmospheric temperatures in the JRI ice core (Fig 4f), although the peak of GP-3 corresponds with the onset of a mid Holocene Hypsithermal (MHH in Fig 4g) at c. 4.5 ka in several terrestrial cross-Peninsula records55,56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the main driver of these penguin population changes is volcanism, with colony populations increasing during volcanically inactive periods and then experiencing abrupt catastrophic declines following major eruptions (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'After the T5a Deception Island eruption abruptly ended guano phase GP-2, the Ardley Lake colony struggled to fully re-establish itself for c. 800 years (Table 2) due to a series of closely spaced eruption events (Fig 4b) and a phase of continued sea-ice presence in Maxwell Bay (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis of longer-term (100-year interval) trends in the Maxwell Bay sea-ice reconstruction52 (Fig 4c) show that these cooler oceanographic conditions persisted well into the late Holocene (5.92.6 ka), corresponding to cooler conditions and increased sea-ice in the Bransfield Strait between c. 5 and 2 cal ka BP (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  57), and advancing glacier margins, increased local snow/ice and sea-ice and limited primary production in surface waters of King George Island54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these cooler conditions the penguin population was able to re-establish itself during GP-3, but was then abruptly terminated by the T4 Deception Island eruption at c. 4.54.2 cal ka BP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The most sustained guano phase, GP-4 (c. 4.03.0 cal ka BP) (Table 1), occurred during the warm conditions of the late MHH (Fig 4g), and is characterized by a marked increase in MSAT reconstructed in the Yanou Lake GDGT record (Fig 4a), positive temperature anomalies at JRI (Fig 4f) and a sustained period of significantly warmer cross-Peninsula terrestrial temperatures from c. 3.8 cal ka BP (refs 29, 48) (Fig 4a,f,g, Supplementary Tables 7,8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Warmer conditions have also been recorded at this time in lake and moss peat bank records from Livingston Island, Elephant Island, Beak Island56,58, some marine records from the AP48,56,59, Antarctic ice core composite records60 and stacked Southern Hemisphere temperature records61 (Fig 4eg, Supplementary Fig 17ei).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These more favourable climatic conditions for rearing juvenile penguins likely drove the Ardley Lake penguin colony to its Holocene population maxima, and led to the re-establishment of colonies in the mid-southern Peninsula region (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the gentoo penguins preference to feed near their colony, it appears that GP-4 was not adversely affected by the persistence of sea-ice in Maxwell Bay (Fig 4c) and around the Anvers Shelf (Fig 4d) and the cooler sea surface anomalies at PD (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as with guano phases GP-2 and GP-3, guano phase GP-4 was abruptly terminated by a Deception Island eruption event (T3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We link the failure to re-establish another large and sustained colony of similar size and duration as guano phase GP-4 to the start of a marked neoglacial decline in temperature at c. 2.5 cal ka BP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This neoglacial is apparent in Peninsula-wide lake58, marine57,59 and ice core29 records (Fig 4f), and marked by the episodic re-advance of local glaciers52,62 that slowed the rate of RSL decline on the SSI63,64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although reconstructed temperatures in the YAN-GDGT record remained above average until c. 1.5 cal ka BP, sea-ice conditions in Maxwell Bay and the Bransfield Strait52,57, and at some localities further south65, became progressively less favourable between c. 2.3 and 1.8 cal ka BP (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10), likely constraining the growth of the Ardley Lake and Lake Y2 colonies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relatively minor (VEI less_than 3) T2 eruption event had a measurable impact on the Ardley Lake colony in the middle of guano-phase GP-5, c. 2.1 cal ka BP (Fig 4b), but further deterioration in north-western AP climate into the neoglacial minimum probably drove more progressive reductions in the Ardley Lake GP-5 and Lake Y2 colonies from c. 1.5 to 1.3 cal ka BP (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "No significant changes in the Ardley Lake colony have occurred in the last c. 1,000 years (Fig 4), although we detected a minor increase in guano input into Ardley Lake from c. 500 years onwards (Fig 5), which coincides with the onset of warming detected in north-eastern AP lake58 and ice core records29 from c. 500 years, after the northern AP neoglacial minimum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elsewhere, increases in guano input into Lake Y2 on Ardley Island (Fig 6) and in Hope Bay records from the north-eastern AP10,16 have been linked to warming associated with a `Medieval Climate Anomaly'43, inferred in some AP records between c. 1,200 and 600 years ago48,56,66.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in sub-fossil evidence of nesting sites across the AP in the last 1,000 years for all Pygoscelis spp., regardless of whether they are ice-dependent or ice-avoiding species, could be a response to the more favourable `Medieval Climate Anomaly' and/or post-neoglacial conditions, or reflect migratory shifts to newly emerged, low-lying coastal areas created by declining Holocene RSLs across the Peninsula63,64,67,68,69 (for example, Fig 5a, c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of significant colonies at both the Ardley Lake and Lake Y2 sites during the last c. 1,000 years mirrors the increased rate of RSL fall from c. 10 to 0 m a.p.s.l.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (refs 45, 64, 70) (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This resulted in an increase in the available area for nesting sites near the coast and may have driven the relocation of penguins from the Ardley Lake catchment to the western side of Ardley Island, where much of the present day colony is located (Fig 6c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ", 'Figure 6: Changes in land availability and colony population on Ardley Island over the last

#@NEW_LINE#@#  The eastern half of the island, where the current penguin colony is located, was bordered by steep cliffs forcing early to mid Holocene colonies to nest in the centre of Ardley Island.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the mid to late Holocene, relative sea level (RSL) fell, increasing the land area available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of guano deposited in Ardley Lake declined after c. 1,300 cal a BP as some colonies relocated to the Lake Y2 and Lake G catchments43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The eastern side of the island became more easily accessible when RSL fell below 5 m above present sea level (m a.p.s.l.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  after c. 1,300 years ago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future colony population increases could be accommodated in the central area of Ardley Island.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See

'Although our new lake records suggest that warmer local atmospheric temperatures (Figs 4a, 5) and the regional expression of the MHH led to increased penguin populations during guano phase GP-3 c. 4.54.3 cal ka BP and GP-4, c. 4.03.0 cal ka BP, our main finding is that large mid-late Holocene eruptions of the Deception Island volcano had a sporadic, but devastating, impact on the Ardley Lake penguin colony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All five phases of colony expansion occurred in the absence of large volcanic eruptions and three of the phases (GP-2, 3, 4) were abruptly ended by eruptions from the Deception Island volcano at c. 5.55.4 cal ka BP (T5a), 4.54.2 cal ka BP (T4) and 3.23.0 cal ka BP (T3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only guano phase GP-5 declined gradually, which we attribute to adverse neoglacial conditions and migration away from nesting sites in the centre of the island towards newly emergent coastal areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This guano phase appears to have been negatively impacted by the relatively minor T2 eruption event at c. 2.1 cal ka BP, but, in general, from c. 2,500 years onwards the Ardley Lake colony was too small to determine whether volcanic activity had a significant impact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The remoteness of active volcanism in Antarctica means that modern-day analogues for volcanic impacts on penguin colonies are inevitably sparse and hard to quantify.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the relative size of Deception Island eruptions is thought to have diminished in the late Holocene, comparatively small recent eruptions were locally hazardous, causing catastrophic flooding and lahars20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Larger mid-late Holocene eruptions are thought to have generated pyroclastic density flows and surges20,21, which could have been particularly destructive at ground level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Circumstantial evidence from the volcanically active South Sandwich Islands shows that, close to an erupting volcano, penguins are largely absent from areas affected by recent ash fall (Supplementary Fig 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proximal fallout of coarse-grained tephra could lead to high localized mortality rates and significantly disrupt nesting activities, or drive migration to areas less affected by ash.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The northern AP is defined as having a moderate to extremely high likelihood of supraglacial airfall by active volcanoes, where a significant risk to life exists31, mainly because the deposition of far-travelled fine black basaltic ash can lead to rapid snow-melt and (supraglacial) lahar formation71.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other indirect processes, such as burial by tephra, the generation of tsunamis, landscape destabilization, and the deposition of fine ash layers and aerosols could pose a substantial risk to distal penguin colonies30, such as those on Ardley Island (Supplementary Fig 12, Supplementary Discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Physical disablement and poisoning are the most significant potential hazards to penguins, even though they are well-adapted to elevated levels of F, Cu, Cd, and Hg through high dietary intake16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prolonged exposure to the fine abrasive glass particles in tephra while rearing chicks on land, or during feeding at sea, could adversely affect one (or all) of the major physiological processes of penguins and their prey (for example, respiration, digestion, immune function, vision; Supplementary Discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colonies are more likely to be decimated if significant amounts of ash fell during the breeding season onto unhatched eggs or recently hatched chicks, or if one parent failed to return from foraging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mature individuals on long forages, outside the areas directly affected by ashfall, would have the best chance of survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our recovery interval calculations suggest that these individuals may have been displaced to alternative nesting sites such as those that were occupied in the mid-southern AP at c. 5.4 and 4.2 cal ka BP (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The physical landscape disturbance and presence of tephra over Ardley Island prevented sustainable post-eruption reoccupation of the site for, on average, 570±110 years (weighted mean±s.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), but as much as c. 8001,100 years following the largest mid-late Holocene (T5a) eruption c. 5,500 years ago (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, while we cannot assess some factors that determine breeding success such as pressure from predators1, the ability to change diet72, relative changes in species composition, or recent anthropogenic impacts73, our detailed case study, using innovative methodologies, has revealed the key environmental factors influencing the Ardley Lake penguin colony through the Holocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once deglaciated, c. 8,500 years ago, climatic conditions on Ardley Island were sufficiently amenable throughout the rest of the Holocene for sustained penguin habitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ardley Lake colony population maximum in first half of the late Holocene, c. 4,000 to 3,000 years ago, occurred during a period of particularly favourable regional climate (sustainably warmer than the 60 ka average, with fewer storms) and local-regional sea-ice conditions (near-average 60 ka sea-ice cover/seasonal extent), which enhanced nesting and foraging success.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, neoglacial conditions and falling sea levels during the second half of the late Holocene (c. 2,000 years ago to present) contributed to colony decline and/or migration away from the centre of Ardley Island.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Overall, though, we found no consistent relationships between guano inputs into Ardley Lake and local-regional atmospheric and ocean temperatures or sea-ice conditions across the Holocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the overriding driver of long-term penguin colony change on Ardley Island was volcanic activity from Deception Island.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three out of five mid-late Holocene guano-phases were interrupted by volcanic ash fallout from eruptions that were at least an order of magnitude greater than present-day eruptions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mid-late Holocene volcanic eruptions deposited layer of volcanic ash across the landscape, which severely disrupted nesting and foraging activities on Ardley Island.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the saw-toothed, asymmetric pattern of successive Ardley Lake penguin colony population maxima suggests that sustainable colony recovery following these mid-late Holocene volcanic eruptions was slow, taking, on average, between 400 and 800 years, but possibly as much as 1,100 years during the most disruptive phase of volcanism (T5) c. 5.54.6 cal ka BP.'
