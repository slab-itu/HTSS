Calcium imaging reveals glial involvement in transcranial direct current stimulation-induced plasticity in mouse brain  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Transcranical direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a treatment known to ameliorate various neurological conditions and enhance memory and cognition in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  tDCS has gained traction for its potential therapeutic value; however, little is known about its mechanism of action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a transgenic mouse expressing G-CaMP7 in astrocytes and a subpopulation of excitatory neurons, we find that tDCS induces large-amplitude astrocytic Ca2+ surges across the entire cortex with no obvious changes in the local field potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, sensory evoked cortical responses are enhanced after tDCS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These enhancements are dependent on the alpha-1 adrenergic receptor and are not observed in IP3R2 (inositol trisphosphate receptor type 2) knockout mice, in which astrocytic Ca2+ surges are absent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, we propose that tDCS changes the metaplasticity of the cortex through astrocytic Ca2+/IP3 signalling.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation procedure, in which weak d.c. current (typically 1 mA) is applied over cortical areas for 1030 min through the skull.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  tDCS has been shown effective for alleviating neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions such as major depression in humans1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  tDCS has also been demonstrated to enhance learning and memory formation2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work demonstrated that tDCS applied over the motor cortex of human subjects increases the excitability of the motor cortex in a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent manner4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Application of d.c. over mouse motor cortical slice has demonstrated that DCS enhances synaptic response that depends on the NMDAR and brain-derived neurotrophic factor5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, detailed cellular mechanisms for in vivo tDCS-induced plasticity remain largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Multiple studies show crucial roles of astrocytes in NMDAR-dependent plasticity6,7,8,9, using rodent in vitro and in vivo preparations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies imply that astrocytes make gliotransmission to secrete signalling molecules to synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several lines of evidence that gliotransmission occurs by intracellular Ca2+ elevation have been reported, although the exact mechanism of gliotransmission is still controversial10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As recent animal models of tDCS have successfully demonstrated enhancements in learning and synaptic plasticity2,12,13, we sought to address the dynamical activity of the brain during tDCS by Ca2+ imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'G-CaMP7 is a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based Ca2+ indicator protein that was improved from the original G-CaMP14 by directed site mutagenesis to yield higher signal-to-noise ratio and faster response time, making it suitable for monitoring neuronal activity15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we introduce a transgenic mouse line G7NG817 in which astrocytes and a subset of cortical neurons express G-CaMP7 permitting transcranial imaging, using a standard stereo fluorescence microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, we find that tDCS invokes large-amplitude and synchronized Ca2+ surges in astrocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenomenon lead to the hypothesis that tDCS-induced astrocytic activity affects the metaplasticity of the cortex in a similar manner to astrocytic modulation of synaptic plasticity by neuromodulators16.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Functional mapping of the cortex using the G7NG817 mouse', 'The G7NG817 line was generated by a random insertion of a transgenic construct to express G-CaMP7 under the control of the GLT-1 promoter (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  G-CaMP7 expression in the brain of the G7NG817 mouse was widespread and distinct from its background strain C57BL/6 (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particularly, high expression levels were observed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Double immunostaining for S100B (astrocyte marker) and GFP (G-CaMP7 marker) shows that virtually all cortical astrocytes express G-CaMP7 (Fig 1b; Supplementary Fig 1A; 95.2%; n=3 mice), whereas other glia cell types show minimal expression (Supplementary Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, neuronal expression of G-CaMP7 was observed (Supplementary Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The neuronal expression of G-CaMP7 in the cerebral cortex is not detectable in gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic (GABAergic) cells (Supplementary Fig 1E) and has a layer-dependent profile (Fig 1c; Supplementary Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  G-CaMP7 expression is also present in the processes of astrocytes and neurons, thus labelling the neurogliopil throughout the cortical depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high G-CaMP7 expression across the wide cortical area allowed transcranial imaging of neuronal and astrocytic Ca2+ activities of different cortical states (Supplementary Figs 2 and 3; Supplementary Video 1), as well as various sensory responses (Supplementary Figs 3 and 4; Supplementary Video 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: tDCS produces large and synchronized Ca2+ surges in the cortex as visualized with G7NG817 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Sagittal brain section of the G7NG817 (upper panel) and C57BL/6 wild-type mice (lower panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High expression of G-CaMP7 was seen in the cortex, hippocampus (particularly CA3), thalamus and striatum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 1 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Immunostaining for G-CaMP7 (green) and astrocytes (S100B, red) shows a high degree of co-localization (arrows, co-stained astrocytes; arrowheads, G-CaMP7-positive neurons).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 50 m.

P=0.0022).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, tDCS did not induce Ca2+ surges in awake G7NG817 mice that are deficient of inositol trisphosphate receptor type 2 (IP3R2)17 (Fig 1l; Supplementary Fig 7, Supplementary Video 4), the receptor responsible for large cytosolic Ca2+ elevations in astrocytes18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result indicates that astrocytic Ca2+ elevation is likely the key contributor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies reported that alpha-1 adrenergic receptor (A1AR) signalling underlies Ca2+ elevations in cortical astrocytes in awake states19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, tDCS-induced cortical Ca2+ surges during awake states were blocked by the A1AR blocker prazosin or diminishment of noradrenergic innervation by N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4) treatment21 (Fig 1l, see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stimulation parameters were found to be sufficient to alleviate a mouse model of depression by chronic restraint stress (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  tDCS did not alleviate the depression-like behavior in mice with prazosin administration, DSP-4 treatment or IP3R2 deficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we could not observe obvious astrocytic nor microglial reactivity after tDCS applied to awake mice (Supplementary Fig 9), after 3 h.', 'Astrocytes underlie tDCS-induced cortical Ca2+ surges', 'To investigate the cellular mechanism of the tDCS-induced Ca2+ surges, two-photon imaging in layer 2/3 of the primary visual cortex was performed through a cranial window in urethane-anaesthetized G7NG817 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As demonstrated with transcranial imaging, synchronized and large-amplitude Ca2+ surges were evoked in a population of cells with tDCS (0.1 mA, 10 min; Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, these cells were SR101-positive astrocytes (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further analysis revealed that the tDCS evoked astrocytic Ca2+ responses had significantly higher amplitudes than spontaneous events, whereas the neuronal Ca2+ events during tDCS had similar amplitudes as spontaneous events (Fig 2c, comparisons between spontaneous versus tDCS periods for the cells that had at least one Ca2+ event during the respective period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  F/F: astrocyte: 98.44±4.81% versus 274.70±15.61%, 289 versus 174 cells in five mice, P=8.94E34; neuron: 110.8±3.68% versus 118.67±4.03%, 283 versus 271 cells from five mice, P=0.15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the observations with transcranial imaging in urethane-anaesthetized mice, astrocytic Ca2+ surges were induced at variable delay from the onset of tDCS under urethane anaesthesia (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, astrocytic Ca2+ surges occurred nearly seven times more frequently during the course of tDCS (10 min) than during the baseline, while neuronal activity did not show obvious changes (Fig 2e, sponta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  versus tDCS, neuron: 2.07±0.10 min1·per cell versus 1.92±0.14 min1·per cell, P=0.42;

This plasticity was blocked by the NMDAR antagonist AP-5, suggesting that glutamatergic synapses are involved (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the contribution of A1ARs in the tDCS-induced plasticity, we repeated the experiment with topical application of prazosin (200 M, applied before 20 min stimulus presentation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, tDCS did not enhance the VEP in the prazosin condition (Fig 3a,b) or in DSP-4-treated mice, whereas the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (23 mM) did not block the effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, tDCS-induced VEP slope enhancements were not observed in IP3R2 KO mice (n=5 mice for AP-5, 12 mice for IP3R2 KO mice and 6 mice for all other groups).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest an essential role of astrocytic Ca2+ elevations in the tDCS-induced enhancement of VEP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the origin of LFP enhancement, neurogliopil imaging was performed with G7NG817 mice in layer 2/3 and 4 of the primary

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We demonstrate that the G7NG817 mouse yields high enough G-CaMP7 expression in astrocytes and neurons to permit transcranial functional imaging with a standard fluorescent stereo microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the BAC-GLT-1 promoter is known to be active predominantly in astrocytes22, the strong expression of the transgene in cortical neurons in G7NG817 is ectopic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the fortuitous combination of highly expressing neurons and astrocytes resulted in a transgenic mouse that allows transcranial fluorescence imaging for functional mapping of the cerebral cortex, even with heterozygous mice (Supplementary Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although tDCS has been shown to have positive effects on memory and remedial effects on neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions in humans1,23, its mechanism of action is largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using tDCS parameters commonly used for small rodent models23,24,25,26,27,28, we find that the activation of cortical neurons was undetectable by the analysis methods we used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is reasonable, as the stimulus parameters used in this study are estimated to be close to the neuronal activation threshold reported in previous studies, which used a voltage-based approach29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, tDCS-induced virtually synchronous astrocytic Ca2+ surges in wide-spread cortical areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We demonstrated enhancements of sensory evoked cortical responses after tDCS, consistent with an earlier study performed with the rabbit whisker system12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we show that the lack of the tDCS-induced plasticity in IP3R2 KO mice, suggesting the involvement of astrocytic Ca2+/IP3 signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, recent reports have shown that astrocytic Ca2+/IP3 signalling plays a significant role in in vivo synaptic plasticity in the cortex and hippocampus7,31,32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to a human study4, we showed that the tDCS-induced enhancement of sensory evoked LFP response is NMDAR dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As astrocyte Ca2+ levels are positively related to the extracellular level of the NMDAR co-agonist d-serine, tDCS-induced astrocytic Ca2+ elevations conceivably lead to NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity6,7,9,34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A large part of the tDCS-induced plasticity was blocked by prazosin or DSP-4 treatment, indicating the involvement of noradrenergic activation of A1ARs, which transduce the Gq signalling cascade for production of IP3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, a recent study by Panktratov and Lalo35 describes that noradrenaline application elevates extracellular d-serine and ATP levels, and lowers the threshold for the induction of LTP-like plasticity in mouse cortical slices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same study also demonstrated little neuronal Ca2+ elevation after noradrenaline application, supporting our result that the tDCS-associated Ca2+ elevations are of astrocytic origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, activation of A1ARs have recently been shown to be the prevalent mechanism of astrocytic Ca2+ elevation in awake mice19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enhanced LFP response following tDCS is most likely due to a reflection of synaptic current enhancement, as rodent astrocytic membrane potential fluctuation is modest36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our differentiation of neurogliopil signal into neuropil and astropil components confirmed that tDCS-induced plasticity occurs in neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, we have identified a major intermediate mechanism between the impact of the electrical field and neural plasticity mediated by astrocytic activity (Supplementary Fig 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Potential mechanisms for this tDCS-induced noradrenergic drive include activation of the locus coeruleus and/or direct induction of transmitter release from noradrenergic axon terminals in the cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A simulation study predicts that axon terminals are more susceptible to polarization than somata by d.c. stimulation37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is conceivable that the activation of neuromodulatory terminals are overlooked in our imaging experiments because the G-CaMP7 expression in non-glutamatergic neurons is low in G7NG817 and also single-axonal signals are not detected by LFP electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bias of noradrenergic activation over other neurotransmitters such as glutamate or acetylcholine is not clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that glutamate and acetylcholine, if released in small amounts, undergo immediate transporter uptake or enzymatic breakdown before they reach to receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies should identify the mechanism for the prevalent activation of A1ARs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, while our results suggest that the tDCS-induced parameters described in this study did not induce obvious glial inflammation, the safety standards of tDCS on humans38 should consider glial components in future.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The relative fluorescence change F/F was computed, where the F is the difference from the baseline mean and F is the baseline mean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Signal fluctuations in an ROI larger than the mean+3 s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  were considered to be Ca2+ events (Fig 2e,g,k; and Supplementary Fig 7D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The duration is computed as the full-width half-maximum of the Ca2+ event (Supplementary Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For tail pinch experiments, the during tail pinch period is defined as the 100-s period starting from the onset of tail pinch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For tDCS experiments, the tDCS period is defined as the entire period of tDCS (that is, 600 s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All data are expressed as mean±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Time to Ca2+ onset is defined as the time where F/F exceeded the mean+3 s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  since the start of tDCS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ca2+ events for individual cells were detected with a threshold of the mean+3 s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ca2+ events of astrocytes in G7NG817 mice were detected after applying a low-pass filter (cutoff frequency 0.5) to exclude possible neuronal signals from the contiguous neurogliopil (Fig 2e,g,k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ca2+ events of neurons in G7NG817 mice were detected after applying a band-pass filter (bandpass: 0.53 Hz) to exclude possible astrocytic signals from the contiguous neurogliopil (Fig 2eg,k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the analysis of astrocyte-Ca2+ on versus off period (Fig 2f), the on period is defined as the period where at least one astrocyte is detected for a Ca2+ event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Statistics', 'For comparisons of two sample means (Fig 2c,eg; Supplementary Figs 3C,E,F,7D), two-sample t-tests and paired t-tests (Fig 3d) were performed using ORIGIN (OriginLab).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparisons of multiple groups, statistical tests based on analysis of variance (ANOVA) are performed followed by Tukey s post-hoc tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two-way (Fig 1g,i, and Fig 4d-f) or one-way (Supplementary Fig 10B) repeated measures ANOVA was computed using R (http://www.r-project.org) with a software add-on for ANOVA (ANOVAKUN, http://riseki.php.xdomain.jp/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One-way ANOVA was computed using ORIGIN (Fig 1l and Fig 3b,f; and Supplementary Fig 8B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unless otherwise noted, mean values are presented with the s.e.m.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
