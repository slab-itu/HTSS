Structural diversity of supercoiled DNA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'By regulating access to the genetic code, DNA supercoiling strongly affects DNA metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite its importance, however, much about supercoiled DNA (positively supercoiled DNA, in particular) remains unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use electron cryo-tomography together with biochemical analyses to investigate structures of individual purified DNA minicircle topoisomers with defined degrees of supercoiling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results reveal that each topoisomer, negative or positive, adopts a unique and surprisingly wide distribution of three-dimensional conformations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we uncover striking differences in how the topoisomers handle torsional stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As negative supercoiling increases, bases are increasingly exposed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond a sharp supercoiling threshold, we also detect exposed bases in positively supercoiled DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular dynamics simulations independently confirm the conformational heterogeneity and provide atomistic insight into the flexibility of supercoiled DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our integrated approach reveals the three-dimensional structures of DNA that are essential for its function.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The structure of the B-form DNA double helix has been known for over 60 years1, yet DNA metabolism requires deviations, sometimes extreme, from this canonical form2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies of DNA are typically performed on short, linear DNA fragments that cannot be supercoiled; therefore our understanding of DNA is incomplete.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most organisms DNA is maintained in a negatively supercoiled (underwound) state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positively supercoiled (overwound) DNA is transiently generated during DNA replication and transcription, and, if not promptly relaxed, inhibits these processes5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electron microscopy6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 (including electron cryo-microscopy6,8,11,12,13) and atomic force microscopy10,14 have previously provided significant insight into the structure of negatively supercoiled DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we build on those earlier studies by covering a broader range of supercoiling, including positive supercoiling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using a combination of approaches we here show that supercoiling causes DNA to adopt large conformational variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unpaired bases and localized distortions contribute to this variability both by relieving torsional strain and by providing flexible hinges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positive and negative supercoiling are accommodated differently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biological implications of these findings are discussed.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'336 bp minicircles accommodate a wide range of supercoiling', 'Minicircles containing 336 bp were selected for this study because they are representative of the supercoiled DNA loops found in nature15,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, these minicircles are small enough to allow isolation of suitable amounts of individual topoisomers (Fig 1a), yet large enough to yield an ample spread of ten unique topoisomers (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In its relaxed state, the two strands of a 336 bp DNA circle wrap around each other 32 times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This number is known as the linking number (Lk).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other topoisomers deviate (Lk) from the Lk of the relaxed topoisomer (Lk=32, Lk=0) in steps of 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We generated and isolated six different negatively supercoiled minicircle topoisomers (Lk=31 through 26, Lk=1 through 6), three different positively supercoiled topoisomers (Lk=33 through 35, Lk=+1 through +3), relaxed (Lk=32, Lk=0), nicked and linearized minicircles (Fig 1a, Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Effect of supercoiling on the structure of minicircle DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Individual 336 bp minicircle

with compactness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Open circles were given a value of 1, open figure-8 s a value of 2, figure-8 s as a value of 3, and so on.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative fraction of each was subsequently used to determine the average degree of compactness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lk, Lk and superhelical density () for each topoisomer are shown (see Supplementary Note 1).Full size image', 'All nine of the supercoiled minicircles were subjected to and relaxed by human topoisomerase II (htopoII) (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This relaxation demonstrated the biological activity of the minicircles, confirmed their Lk designations, and verified that there was no cross-contamination among topoisomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because htopoII relaxes in characteristic steps of two Lk, all of the minicircles with even Lk relaxed to Lk=0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The odd-numbered Lk topoisomers relaxed to a mixture of Lk=1 and Lk=+1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Wide variety of minicircle DNA conformations', 'Electron cryo-tomography (cryo-ET) was used to obtain three-dimensional (3D) structures of the different minicircles embedded in vitreous ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before freezing, the purified topoisomers were either incubated on ice or at room temperature for at least 15 min in an attempt to allow the DNA to reach conformational equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specimen vitrification19 occurs at a rate of freezing (106 °C per second) that should be fast enough to preclude temperature-dependent structural alterations20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Projection images were obtained with an electron microscope by incrementally tilting the specimen stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These images were subsequently reconstructed into 3D volumes (tomograms) containing the minicircles (Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, these data represent snapshots of the DNA molecules at the instant of freezing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We computationally generated traces of 336-bp minicircle DNA backbones and fitted these to the observed densities in the tomograms, confirming that each subvolume represented a single 336 bp minicircle (Fig 2a,b, Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, as a control, we visualized double-length minicircles (672 bp) and computationally fitted a 672 bp backbone to the observed densities, confirming their length and thus providing additional validation of the approach (Fig 2c).

minicircle topoisomer (Fig 1b,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the rigidity of DNA at this short length21, it is remarkable that the DNA was able to contort into such a wide variety of conformations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heterogeneity observed indicates that the DNA structure is in dynamic equilibrium, driven by both the torsional stress of supercoiling and by Brownian motion13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results illustrate the power of cryo-ET to visualize individual molecules in solution and capture their conformational variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, cryo-ET data contained sufficient detail to visualize that, as expected, only right-handed crossovers were observed in negatively supercoiled DNA and only left-handed crossovers were observed in positively supercoiled DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Most of the observed minicircle conformations could be classified into the following empirical categories, in order of increasing compaction: open circle, open figure-8, figure-8, racquet, handcuffs, needle, and rod (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examples of the handcuffs and needle conformations are shown in Supplementary Movie 2 and 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is interesting to note that minicircles in topologically distinct topoisomers sometimes adopted the same general conformation (for example, rods found in the Lk=1 and Lk=6 topoisomers appear similar).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these cases, DNA supercoiling must be accommodated in different ways that result in the same general 3D shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some minicircles, especially those with larger Lk (either negative or positive) adopted alternative shapes (other in Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Deviations from relaxed DNA may be manifested as changes in twist, the coiling of the DNA about the helical axis, or writhe, the coiling of the double helices about each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in twist result in torsional strain whereas changes in writhe result in bending strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because we observed multiple DNA conformations in supercoiled DNAranging from open to highly writheddifferent degrees of twist and writhe must simultaneously exist within the same topoisomer population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA bending, and thus writhe, is thought to be more difficult to accommodate for short DNA lengths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Minicircles twice the length (672 bp) with equivalent supercoiling (Lk=4) to the Lk=2, 336 bp minicircle all appeared highly writhed (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison the Lk=2, 336 bp topoisomer displayed both open and writhed conformations (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, smaller minicircles of 94158 bp have no appreciable writhe11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Minicircles (336 bp) are, therefore, an ideal size for exploring the relationship between twist and writhe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As mentioned above, linear DNA is rigid in the aforementioned lengths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theory therefore predicts that very small circles should be perfectly round.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant deviations from a perfect circle will require non-uniform distribution of bending along the DNA length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Very small circles already have considerable bending strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Localized variations in bending should therefore be energetically unfavourable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ellipticity was measured previously in 94158 bp DNA minicircles and averaged between 1.1 and 1.5 (refs 11, 12, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased ellipticity was attributed to the appearance of hyperflexible kinks within the DNA13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus ellipticity is one measure of conformational variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare our data to those previous studies, we measured ellipticity in a subset of our observed open circles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant numbers of minicircles with an open circle shape were found in the following topoisomer populations: Lk=2, 0, +1, +2, +3, and nicked.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured ellipticity values ranged from 1.1 to 2.6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This larger deviation from circularity is attributable to the longer length of our 336 bp minicircles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed potential differences with supercoiling in the dimensions of the open circles (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The conformations adopted by each topoisomer are shown as frequency distribution plots (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A weighted average of the shape frequency distribution (denoted by arrowheads on each plot) approximates the average degree of compactness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, electrophoretic mobility provides a measure of relative compaction22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By both measures increased negative or positive supercoiling leads to a shift in the distribution towards more compact shapes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To provide a more quantitative measure of compactness, radius of gyration values were measured from the cryo-ET density maps (Fig 3a, middle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values were consistent with the electrophoretic mobilities (Fig 3a, left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Comparison of electrophoretic mobility and radius of gyration values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Left, distance each topoisomer migrated during

DNA backbone traces.Full size image', 'Molecular dynamics simulations provide atomistic insight', 'To further understand the conformational fluctuations of the topoisomers, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (Supplementary Movie 4 and 5; Supplementary Tables 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generalized Born continuum solvent simulations, which, in the absence of viscous damping enable rapid configurational sampling in a relatively short computational time, revealed a wide variety of conformations for each topoisomer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulation results suggest that each supercoiled topoisomer undergoes large fluctuations in writhe (Supplementary Movie 4 and Supplementary Fig 4) and, hence, in the level of compaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The radius of gyration values, averaged over the MD simulations, showed the same trends with changing superhelical density as the gel electrophoretic mobility and the radius of gyration values extracted from the cryo-ET data (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conformations that were observed in the cryo-ET data were also observed in the MD simulations (Fig 3b), providing insight into how conformations may interchange.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The consistency between structural and computational results established confidence for the observation of simultaneous co-existence of multiple conformations of each topoisomer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Across all levels of supercoiling, differences were observed for negative versus positive Lk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the Lk=1 and Lk=+1 topoisomers might be expected to migrate with similar electrophoretic mobility, Lk=1 migrated much faster on the gel (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, cryo-ET data revealed that the Lk=1 topoisomer adopted a spread of conformations that included predominantly compact forms (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Lk=+1 adopted mostly open conformations, similar to the nicked and relaxed minicircles (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of a small fraction (10%) of compact forms may explain why, on average, the Lk=+1 topoisomer migrated slightly farther on the gel than the nicked or relaxed minicircles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Extending the comparison to Lk=2 and Lk=+2, we observed broad distributions of conformations, such that every shape category described in Fig 1c was seen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the distribution trends for the Lk=2 and Lk=+2 were similar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One noteworthy difference, however, was in the relative proportions of the figure-8 and racquet conformations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Racquets were observed 3-fold more frequently than figure-8 s for the Lk=2 topoisomer; figure-8 s were 5-fold more frequent than racquets for Lk=+2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation implied structural differences between the two topoisomers, which we verified biochemically as described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Further underwinding (Lk=3, 4 and 6) resulted in an additional shift in the distribution toward more compact shapes observed in the cryo-ET data and a concomitant increase in electrophoretic mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in electrophoretic mobility between consecutive topoisomers was more pronounced for positive than for negative supercoiling (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar trend was observed for the shift in the conformational distribution between consecutive topoisomers (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Lk=+3, 39% of the minicircles adopted unusual shapes (other, Fig 1d), which were not observed in the Lk=+2 population (Fig 1e), indicating that a sharp structural transition occurs between these two topoisomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Probing for base-pair disruptions and localized denaturation', 'Many of the observed 3D conformations appear to contain sharply bent or kinked DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One way that sharp bending may be facilitated is through localized distortions and disruptions of the helix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To probe for and quantify such helix disruptions, we used nuclease Bal-31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bal-31 has endonuclease function on exposed, unpaired DNA bases (for example, kinks, nicks, gaps, single-stranded regions and BZ junctions)23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All underwound topoisomers and the most overwound Lk=+3 topoisomer had some exposed, unpaired bases, as measured by their Bal-31 sensitivity (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The negatively supercoiled Lk=2, 3, 4 and 6 topoisomers were linearized within the first minute of Bal-31 incubation and subsequently degraded (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Lk=1 topoisomer was cleaved at a much slower rate, requiring 20 min to degrade (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with their Bal-31 sensitivity, the electrophoretic mobility of the negatively supercoiled topoisomers shifted when incubated with glyoxal, a small molecule that traps exposed bases (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relaxed (Lk=0) and Lk=+1 topoisomers resisted Bal-31 digestion, and the Lk=+2 topoisomer was a very poor substrate (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that positive supercoiling should inhibit strand separation, it was surprising that the Lk=+3 topoisomer was efficiently cleaved by Bal-31 (Fig 4a) and this topoisomer was almost completely degraded within an hour (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single molecule manipulation studies previously uncovered a structural variation of DNA when it was extremely overwound25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The researchers proposed that overwinding may result in an inside-out DNA conformation with the backbones wrapped around each other on the inside and unpaired bases on the outside of the helix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemical probing confirmed the presence of unpaired bases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This DNA conformation, named Pauling DNA (P-DNA), was only detected when the DNA was under high tension and writhe was suppressed25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Bal-31 sensitivity of Lk=+3 coincides with the dramatic structural changes observed by cryo-ET for this topoisomer (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the presence of exposed bases may imply P-DNA, there are alternative explanations for Bal-31 sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A probable explanation for the exposed bases is denaturation resulting from sharp bending.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, sharp bending is a feature of the highly writhed conformations of this topoisomer (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Effect

were found at a sharp bend of a needle conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be a potential atomistic explanation for Bal-31 susceptibility of negatively supercoiled topoisomers.Full size image', 'To provide an atomistic interpretation of the cryo-ET density for each topoisomer and to explore how localized distortions may alter the structural properties of DNA, we performed explicitly solvated MD simulations (Supplementary Movie 69).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the inclusion of solvent molecules in the calculations slows down configurational sampling, these simulations were performed starting from conformers most commonly observed in the continuum solvent MD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The explicit solvent simulations allowed increased conformational diversity and could be directly fitted to the cryo-ET density maps (Fig 3b and Supplementary Movie 1013).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas restraints were imposed on the hydrogen bond interactions between complementary base pairs in the simulations in implicit solvent, these restrictions were removed for simulations in explicit solvent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This removal of restraints allowed single-stranded regions to form within the minicircles under sufficiently high levels of torsional or bending stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, in simulations of the Lk=3 topoisomer, a kink emerged at the apex of a highly writhed minicircle, where the hydrogen bonding between complementary base pairs was disrupted (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar base-pair disruptions observed by MD simulations have been reported for bent DNA26,27 and for underwound linear DNA28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These computational results are consistent with the experimental observation that the Lk=3 topoisomer is under a high degree of torsional strain, but additionally predicts that base-pair separation may occur at bent apices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vologodskii and co-workers found that very small DNA minicircles (6465 bp) were susceptible to Bal-31 cleavage, which was attributed to kinking resulting from the inherent bending strain29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Base-pair disruption has been observed in MD simulations of positively supercoiled DNA, either because of the formation of P-DNA28 or because of sharp bending in very small DNA circles27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The propensity for base-pair separation depends on DNA sequence30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the WebSIDD algorithm32 to predict base-pair separation in our 336 bp minicircle, which identified a short region within attR to have a higher probability of duplex destabilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because it was very susceptible to Bal-31, the Lk=6 topoisomer was probed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the prediction, Bal-31 predominantly cleaved 180° away from the anticipated destabilization sequence (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased flexibility brought about by localized denaturation at the Bal-31-susceptible site should enable the DNA to be sharply bent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of conformations observed for the Lk=6 topoisomer were sharply bent or kinked (for example, racquets and rods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kinking at this first site may induce kinking at the site diametrically opposite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar cooperative effects between distant sites were seen by Stasiak and co-workers, who observed sequential, cooperative kinking in torsionally strained minicircles at sites located 180° apart along the DNA circumference13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional influence of the location of Bal-31-susceptible sites may be sequence-dependent DNA flexibility and curvature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences with increased flexibility and/or curvature are preferentially localized to superhelical apices33 where the DNA is most sharply bent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A short region in attR is known to have modest intrinsic curvature34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This curvature may be preferentially located at a superhelical apex36, thereby positioning the sequence located 180° apart along the DNA circumference at the diametrically opposite superhelical apex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Localized denaturation may be necessary to accommodate the sharp bending at the apex, thereby generating a Bal-31-susceptible site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The kink defect observed by MD at a bent apex (Fig 4c) is relatively close to the Bal-31 cleavage site (Fig 5b), consistent with the hypothesis that Bal-31-susceptible sites are localized to the superhelical apices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Mapping Bal-31 cleavage.To determine whether Bal-31 cleavage occurs at multiple sites or at a

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our data collectively demonstrate that supercoiled DNA is able to adopt a wide variety of conformations, the proportions of which depend upon the level of supercoiling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each topoisomer appears to migrate as a single discrete electrophoretic band (Fig 1a), suggesting that each individual DNA molecule fluctuates among the different conformations seen by cryo-ET.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If there were no interchange among conformations, we would expect multiple discrete bands (representing the different meta-stable conformations), a smear, or a more diffuse band.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MD simulations provided further evidence of the dynamic nature of supercoiled DNA and insight into how the conformations may interconvert.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Each topoisomer displayed a wide variety of conformations but the relative proportion of these depended on Lk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of rapid vitrification, the structures observed should represent a snapshot of the highly dynamic DNA molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More highly writhed conformations were observed with increasing negative or positive supercoiling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These trends show how supercoiling drives the dynamic equilibrium and determines how frequently and for how long each minicircle adopts a particular conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Somewhat surprisingly, a small number of open circles were observed even in the Lk=6 topoisomer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these open circles the Lk must be partitioned almost entirely into twist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Sensitivity to Bal-31 cleavage revealed the presence of exposed bases when the DNA was negatively supercoiled, and also when highly positively supercoiled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On one hand, localized Bal-31-susceptible distortions create flexible hinges that allow DNA to assume conformations that would be energetically unfavourable if the bases remained paired.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, extreme writhe and concomitant bending at the apices lead to kinking and localized distortions, even in positively supercoiled DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More extensive denaturation relieves torsional strain, one potential explanation for why a small number of open circles are observed in the Lk=6 topoisomer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The release of torsional strain through denaturation may also explain why more open circles are observed in the Lk=2 topoisomer than the Lk=1 topoisomer (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interplay between localized denaturation and the sharp bending required to achieve the observed conformations is summarized in Fig 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mapping of the cleavage site of Bal-31 suggested that sharp bending at one location may in turn lead to localized distortions at a site located 180° away along the perimeter of the minicircle, similar to the cooperative kinking model13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Model for how DNA accommodates supercoiling.Comparison of smooth and sharp bending and the effect of localized denaturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images represent a more detailed view of the local structure at the bend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For smooth bending, writhe-mediated bending is regular with bending strain more evenly
