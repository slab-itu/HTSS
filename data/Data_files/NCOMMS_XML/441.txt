Oncogenic PIK3CA mutations reprogram glutamine metabolism in colorectal cancer  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cancer cells often require glutamine for growth, thereby distinguishing them from most normal cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that PIK3CA mutations reprogram glutamine metabolism by upregulating glutamate pyruvate transaminase 2 (GPT2) in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, making them more dependent on glutamine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with isogenic wild-type (WT) cells, PIK3CA mutant CRCs convert substantially more glutamine to -ketoglutarate to replenish the tricarboxylic acid cycle and generate ATP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutant p110 upregulates GPT2 gene expression through an AKT-independent, PDK1RSK2ATF4 signalling axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, aminooxyacetate, which inhibits the enzymatic activity of aminotransferases including GPT2, suppresses xenograft tumour growth of CRCs with PIK3CA mutations, but not with WT PIK3CA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data establish oncogenic PIK3CA mutations as a cause of glutamine dependency in CRCs and suggest that targeting glutamine metabolism may be an effective approach to treat CRC patients harbouring PIK3CA mutations.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cancer cells are distinguished from most normal cells by metabolic reprogramming, including phenomena termed the Warburg effect and glutamine dependency1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Normally, glucose is converted to acetyl-CoA, which enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cancer cells, however, convert glucose to lactate even in the presence of oxygen (Warburg effect) and utilize glutamine to replenish the TCA cycle3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To enter the TCA cycle, glutamine is first deaminated by glutaminases (GLSs) to glutamate4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glutamate is then converted to -ketoglutarate (-KG), which is a substrate in the TCA cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three groups of enzymes can convert glutamate to -KG: (1) glutamate pyruvate transaminases (GPTs); (2) glutamate oxaloacetate transaminases (GOTs); and (3) glutamate dehydrogenases (GLUDs)4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The metabolic products of glutamine are utilized both to produce ATP and to synthesize macromolecules in the promotion of tumour growth4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although glutamine is a non-essential amino acid, it has long been recognized that glutamine is a required supplement for culturing cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Many oncogenes and tumour suppressors impact glutamine metabolism4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Myc overexpression affects cellular glutamine levels by inducing the transcription of GLS1 and the glutamine transporter SLC1A5 (a.k.a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ASCT2)5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, SLC1A5 expression is repressed by the Rb tumour suppressor7, whereas GLS2 was identified as a transcriptional target of p53 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, it has been shown that p53 represses the expression of malic enzymes ME1 and ME2, thereby regulating glutamine-dependent NADPH production9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study showed that loss of tumour suppressor von hippel-lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) renders renal cell carcinomas sensitive to glutamine deprivation through hypoxia induced factor (HIF)-induced metabolic reprogramming10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, K-ras upregulates the aminotransferase GOT1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though all of these mechanisms impact the production or degradation of glutamine or its metabolites, the mechanisms by which many cancer cells become dependent on glutamine are still unknown or actively debated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'PIK3CA encodes the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase  (PI3K), which plays a key role in regulating cell proliferation, survival and motility12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PIK3 consists of a catalytic subunit p110, and one of several regulatory subunits (a major one being p85)13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On growth factor stimulation, p85 is recruited to phosphorylated receptor protein kinases and adaptor proteins, thereby activating PI3K.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activated PI3K converts phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biophosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second message PIP3 then activates PDK1 and AKT signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PIK3CA is mutated in a wide variety of human cancers including 30% of colorectal cancers (CRCs)14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent large-scale sequencing of human cancer genomes reveals that PIK3CA is the most frequently mutated oncogene in human cancer15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the fact that PIK3CA mutations can reprogram cancer metabolism, as demonstrated herein, was previously unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We report that PIK3CA mutations render CRCs more sensitive to glutamine deprivation by upregulation of GPT2, an enzyme involved in glutamine metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further demonstrate that mutant p110 increases GPT2 gene expression through an AKT-independent signalling pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we show that aminooxyacetate (AOA), a compound that inhibits enzymatic activity of aminotransferases, suppresses xenograft tumour growth of CRCs with PIK3CA mutations, but not with wild-type (WT) PIK3CA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that reprogramming glutamine metabolism is crucial for the oncogenic function of PIK3CA mutations and that targeting glutamine metabolism may be an effective approach to treating CRC patients harbouring tumour mutations of this gene.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'PIK3CA mutations render CRC cells dependent on glutamine', 'Most PIK3CA mutations are clustered in two hotspots, with H1047R in the kinase domain and E545K in the helical domain the most common mutations16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We set out to determine whether PIK3CA mutations reprogram cell metabolism in CRCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CRC cell line HCT116 harbours a heterozygous H1047R mutation, whereas DLD1 CRC cells have a heterozygous E545K mutation (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We exploited isogenic derivatives of these cell lines in which either the WT or mutant allele of PIK3CA is knocked out (Fig 1a)17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The clones in which the mutant allele had been disrupted (and the WT allele was intact) were called WT (Fig 1a), whereas the clones in which only the WT allele had been disrupted (and the mutant allele was intact) were called mutant (Mut, Fig 1a)17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As reported previously17, the parental cells and their derived knockout clones grew at similar rate under normal conditions in the presence of both glucose and glutamine (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in medium without glutamine, both parental cells and the two independently derived PIK3CA mutant clones died faster than did two independently derived PIK3CA WT clones (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This relative sensitivity to glutamine deprivation dependent on PIK3CA status was observed in both HCT116 and DLD1 (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, glutamine deprivation induced more apoptotic cells in the mutant clones than in the WT clones as assayed by percentages of sub-G1 cells and amounts of cleaved PARP (Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, differential sensitivity to deprivation of glucose was not found (Fig 1b and Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, these cell lines still grew equally well, although slowly, in the absence of glucose (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because recent studies showed that lung cancer cells can become independent of glucose by upregulation of mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK2), which generates phosphoenolpyruvate from glutamine to generate ribose for nucleic acid synthesis18,19, we set out to determine whether PCK2 was upregulated in the HCT116 and DLD1 cell lines when deprived of glucose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Supplementary Fig 1b, PCK2 was indeed upregulated in both cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: PIK3CA mutation renders CRC cells more sensitive to glutamine deprivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) PIK3CA parental, WT and mutant allele configurations of CRC lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) PIK3CA mutation makes cells sensitive to glutamine, but not to glucose, deprivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numbers of cells of the indicated genotypes were determined in medium with both glucose and glutamine (normal), medium without glutamine (Gln) and medium without glucose (Glc) at indicated time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parental cells (HCT116 and DLD1) and two independently derived mutant (Mut 1 and Mut 2) or WT (WT 1 and WT 2) clones for each parental line were analysed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c,d) Glutamine deprivation induces more apoptosis in cells mutant for PIK3CA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HCT116 (c) and DLD1 (d) cells of the indicated genotypes were grown with or without 2 mM glutamine for 72 h.

determine whether the upregulation of GPT2 makes PIK3CA mutant cells dependent on glutamine, we knocked down GPT2 in the HCT116 PIK3CA mutant clone using two independent shRNAs (Fig 2f).

analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with cells with a control shRNA, the GPT2 knockdown cells grew more slowly under normal growth conditions (Fig 2g), but they were less sensitive to glutamine deprivation as assayed by cell apoptosis (Fig 2h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results were further validated with GPT2 CRISPR/Cas9 knockouts in HCT116 cells (Supplementary Fig 2fi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although GPT2 knockout cells grew slower than the parental cells, they were less sensitive to glutamine deprivation (Supplementary Fig 2h,i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, reconstitution of the knockout cells by restoration of GPT2 expression made these cells grow faster and more sensitive to glutamine deprivation (Supplementary Fig 2jl).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, knockdown of GPT2 in the HCT116 PIK3CA WT clone (WT 1) had no effect on their sensitivity to glutamine deprivation or proliferation under normal culture conditions (Supplementary Fig 2mo).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, overexpression of GPT2 in the WT clone made it grow faster under normal culture conditions, and more sensitive to glutamine deprivation (Fig 2ik and Supplementary Fig 2p).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, overexpression of an enzymatic inactive mutant GPT2 in the WT clone had no impact on either cell proliferation or sensitivity to glutamine deprivation (Fig 2ik).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In aggregate, these data demonstrate

thereby protecting ATF4 from degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we first tested the binding of WT and S245A mutant ATF4 to -TrCP1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, both WT and the mutant ATF4 bound to

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our data demonstrate that oncogenic PIK3CA mutations reprogram glutamine metabolism through the upregulation of GPT2 in CRCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a previous study by Weinberg and colleagues suggests that GPT2 is involved in oncogenic KRAS mutation-mediated glutamine metabolism in HCT116 cells, they did not investigate how K-ras regulates GPT2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, using isogenic cell lines with either mutant allele or WT allele knockout, we clearly demonstrated that KRAS mutation does not make HCT116 and DLD1 CRC cells more dependent on glutamine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, both SW480 and LOVO CRC cell lines harbour oncogenic KRAS mutations, but the two cell lines were resistant to glutamine deprivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our data suggest that mutant KRAS is not a key determinant of glutamine dependency in CRCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, knock-in of mutant K-ras in mouse and a human cell line actually reduces or does not affect PI3K/AKT activities29,30, although WT K-ras interacts and activates PI3K (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, our data provide compelling evidence that oncogenic PIK3CA mutations in CRCs render them more sensitive to glutamine deprivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that several studies show that PI3K/AKT signalling regulates glucose metabolism32,33, it is surprising to observe that HCT116 and DLD1 PIK3CA mutant and WT knockout clones could grow without glucose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data could be interpreted that upregulation of PCK2 in HCT116 and DLD1 cells deprived of glucose attenuates glucose dependency of these cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our data also show that CRC cells harbouring PIK3CA mutations, but not those cells with WT PIK3CA, are sensitive to growth inhibition by AOA, a compound that blocks the conversion of glutamate to -KG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings constitute a proof of principle that targeting glutamine metabolism could be a useful approach to treating CRCs harbouring PIK3CA mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the first PIK3CA mutations in human cancers were discovered14, huge efforts have been made to develop small molecule inhibitors of p110 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because the catalytic domains of class I lipid kinases, p110, p110, p110 and p110, are highly conserved, it is difficult to design small molecules that specifically inhibit the p110 isoform35, and pan-PI3K inhibitors are highly toxic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the p110 inhibitors developed to date do not discriminate between mutant and WT p110 proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study showed that cancer cells quickly develop resistance to a p110-specific inhibitor BYL719 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study suggests that targeting glutamine metabolism may provide a specific form of therapy for cancer patients harbouring PIK3CA mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The findings reported here demonstrate that GPT2 is the key determinant of glutamine sensitivity in PIK3CA mutant CRC cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GPT2 is an aminotransaminase that converts glutamate to -KG, which is a TCA cycle intermediate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metabolic profiling shows that amounts of -KG are significantly higher in the PIK3CA mutant clones than in the WT clones and that the other TCA cycle intermediates are also higher in the mutant clones than in the WT clones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, -KG largely rescues PIK3CA mutant cells from cell death caused by glutamine deprivation, suggesting that -KG is a key metabolite required for PIK3CA mutant cell growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data suggest that upregulation of GPT2 by PIK3CA mutations produces more -KG from glutamine to replenish the TCA, thereby generating more ATP and intermediates for macromolecule synthesis to sustain rapid growth of PIK3CA mutant tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in agreement with our observation that both the ATP concentration and the ATP/ADP ratios were higher in the PIK3CA mutant cells than in the WT cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'AOA potently inhibits xenograft tumour growth of CRCs with PIK3CA mutations, despite its low potency to inhibit growth of CRC cells in culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar discrepancy was also observed with a breast cancer cell line23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We postulate that tumour cells are more dependent on glutamine in the in vivo microenvironment than the in vitro tissue culture conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although AOA is a pan-aminotransferase inhibitor, our data clearly demonstrate that the tumour inhibitory effect of AOA on PIK3CA mutant xenografts is indeed on-target to GPT2, because GPT2 knockdown cells grow much slower in nude nice and these tumours are insensitive to AOA treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, AOA treatment reduces amounts of -KG and alanine, but increases amount of pyruvate and glutamate, in PIK3CA mutant xenograft tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, only pan-aminotransferase inhibitors are available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is conceivable that a GPT2-specific inhibitor could be more potent and less toxic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that GPTs are also involved in gluconeogenesis in liver and kidney, GPT inhibitors may cause hypoglycaemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a study by Lindblom et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  shows that GPT1, but not GPT2, is predominantly expressed in liver and kidney37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, GPT2-specific inhibitors could still have a favourable therapeutic index.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is generally believed that AKTs are the key mediators of the oncogenic signalling of PI3Ks (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study, however, revealed a novel p110PDK1RSK2ATF4GPT2 pathway that regulates glutamine metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated that blocking this pathway inhibits PIK3CA mutant tumour growth in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that this novel signalling pathway also plays a critical role in tumorigenesis driven by PIK3CA mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While our previous studies showed that AKT signalling drives metastasis of PIK3CA mutant tumours39, here we propose the p110PDK1RSK2ATF4GPT2 signaling axis reprogrammes glutamine metabolism that is required to generate energy and metabolites to sustain rapid growth in PIK3CA mutant tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we have discovered a novel mechanism through which mutant p110 perturbs the regulation of glutamine and makes cancer cells more dependent on adequate glutamine levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated that mutant p110 activates RSK2 kinase through PDK1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activated RSK2 then phosphorylates ATF4 at the serine residue 245, which in turn recruits the deubiquitinase USP8 and protects ATF4 from ubiquitin-mediated degradation (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pathway can be targeted by various means, which may provide potential selective therapies for the treatment of the large number of patients whose tumours harbour PIK3CA mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future experiments may extend our study to a large panel of CRC cell lines, patient-derived xenografts and transgenic PIK3CA mutant mouse models.'
