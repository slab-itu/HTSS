Phototaxis of synthetic microswimmers in optical landscapes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Many microorganisms, with phytoplankton and zooplankton as prominent examples, display phototactic behaviour, that is, the ability to perform directed motion within a light gradient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we experimentally demonstrate that sensing of light gradients can also be achieved in a system of synthetic photo-activated microparticles being exposed to an inhomogeneous laser field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe a strong orientational response of the particles because of diffusiophoretic torques, which in combination with an intensity-dependent particle motility eventually leads to phototaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the aligning torques saturate at high gradients, a strongly rectified particle motion is found even in periodic asymmetric intensity landscapes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations of a minimal model and should similarly apply to other particle propulsion mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because light fields can be easily adjusted in space and time, this also allows to extend our approach to dynamical environments.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Despite their structural simplicity, active colloidal particles1,2,3,4,5 exhibit many properties of motile microorganisms6,7,8,9 including formation of clusters10,11,12,13,14 and their response to gravitational15,16 or flow17 fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, active colloids provide an intriguing chance to understand the formation of dynamical structures in living systems18,19,20,21 but may also find use as microrobots whichsimilar to their biological counterpartsautonomously navigate through complex environments22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to most previous experiments, where particles with spatially constant self-propulsion were considered3,4,11,23,24,25,26, only little is known about synthetic systems with a position-dependent propulsion strength27,28,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such conditions, however, apply to many microorganisms, including bacteria and algae, which exhibit photo- or chemotactic motion allowing them to respond to external optical or chemical gradients31,32,33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In case of phototactic bacteria such as Rhodobacter sphaeroides35, this is typically achieved by an intensity-dependent reorientation (tumbling) rate33; however, it should be mentioned that also other more sophisticated steering mechanisms are possible, for example, for the green alga Chlamydomonas36 or the flagellate Euglena gracilis37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, a phototactic response in living systems requires complex internal feedback mechanisms between sensors and actuators38, and it is therefore not obvious whether a similar behaviour can be realized with simple artificial microswimmers, which are not equipped with an elaborate internal network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike living systems, the reorientation rate of colloidal particles is entirely determined by the rotational diffusion time rot=8R3/kBT, which only depends on the particle radius R, the solvent viscosity  and the thermal energy kBT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if the reorientation rate does not respond to the local light intensity, no directed motion is possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is demonstrated in Fig 1, where we show numerical simulations of the probability distribution P(x) of self-propelled particles whose propulsion velocity varies linearly as a function of their position x.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although P(x) asymmetrically broadens as a function of time, no macroscopic tactic particle flux is observed28,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Particle motion with mere position-dependent propulsion velocity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Time evolution of the probability distribution P(x) of self-propelled particles with variable self-propulsion velocity  for xa as obtained from Brownian dynamics simulations (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although P(x) becomes asymmetric at long times, no systematic drift of the particles to regions of higher motility is observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Time evolution of (N+N)/(N++N), where N+ and N are the numbers of particles at x greater than 0 and x less_than 0, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Obviously, a mere position-dependent motility does not induce a macroscopic particle current.Full size image', 'Here we experimentally demonstrate the orientational response and phototactic motion of spherical active colloids in a non-uniform light field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to the coupling of both the particles motility and its orientation to a light gradient, we observe particle transport towards lower intensities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Orientational particle response is achieved by breaking the axial symmetry of the velocity field around the particle, leading to an aligning torque.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because these torques saturate at higher gradients, we observe phototactic motion not only for monotonically increasing light fields, but also for periodic and asymmetric intensity profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experimental observations are in agreement with a theoretical model based on appropriate Langevin equations taking the position-dependent particle motility and orientational response into account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter is derived from the advective coupling of the heat flux in the illuminated particles to the solvent slip velocity at the particle surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a particle orientation misaligned with the intensity gradient, the theory predicts an aligning torque that saturates with increasing light intensity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

sawtooth-shaped intensity profiles I(x) have been created by application of a ratchet-shaped voltage to the electro-optical modulator (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  I(x) is characterized by its period length L, the modulation amplitude I and the length ratio of the two segments a and b (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the first glance, a particle current seems to be unlikely under such conditions because the opposite signs of  I in the two segments lead to opposite realigning torques that shouldsimilar to the example trajectory shown in Fig 3asimply lead to an accumulation of the particles at the minima of I(x).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a matter of fact, however, we observe a directed particle motion in +x direction (see Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is demonstrated in Fig 4c where we show typical trajectories x(t) for different modulation amplitudes I and L=33.5 m, a/b=0.22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Obviously, directed particle motion increases with increasing I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the orientation  of a particle is parallel to its translational velocity, a net motion to the right implies that particles are able to pass segments a with the wrong orientation, that is, without being aligned opposite to  I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This seems surprising because the realigning torques increase with | I|, which is larger in segments a compared with b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand the occurrence of a rectified motion, one has to recall that the time required for the reorientation of a particle inside an intensity gradient, that is, , decreases but rapidly saturates at large | I| (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other relevant timescale is the particles mean residence time r,i, that is, the time it spends in each segment i (i=a,b) when travelling through the sawtooth-shaped light profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When r,i less_than ,i, the particle will (on average) travel through the corresponding segment without a significant orientational response to the local gradient, which then leads to rectified motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In Fig 4d, we exemplarily show the distribution of measured residence times in both segments for I=1.0 W m2 together with the corresponding reorientation times taken from Fig 3c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because ,i depends not only on | I| but also on the absolute intensity, we have plotted the values of ,i for the mean intensity as vertical dashed lines in Fig 4d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As can be seen, ,b is smaller than the typical residence times r,b, which allows the particle to align opposite to the local gradient and thus leads to a motion to the right.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in contrast to the situation in the segments a, where usually r,a less_than ,a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, particles that travel from b to a segments are likely to maintain their previous direction of motion, which generates a particle current in the +x direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be emphasized that this rectification mechanism crucially depends on the saturation behaviour of  versus | I| (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without such saturation, the time ,a would be much shorter, leading to r,a greater than ,a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, particles would always align opposite to  I, which results in a mere accumulation of the particles at the minima of the intensity profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding time distributions for I=0.7 W m2 are shown in Fig 4e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular in the a segments, we find an enhanced probability that r,a greater than ,a, which leads to events where the particle moves to the left (see inset Fig 4c) and thus explains why the particle transport is strongly reduced under such conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The average velocity of the particles within one period

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our experimental findings demonstrate a strong rectified motion due to the coupling of the particle orientation to the gradient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to understand the above results in more detail, we performed numerical simulations where, in addition to the intensity-dependent particle velocity , the aligning torque M due to the light gradient was taken into account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding Langevin equations for the centre-of-mass position r(t) and the orientation  of the particle are', '', '', 'where r and  are translational and rotational noise terms (see Methods for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rotational damping constant rot sets the scale of the torque M=|M|, such that rot/M determines the reorientation time .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To keep the theoretical model as simple as possible, we approximated the light profile and correspondingly vp(x) by two straight segments (dashed curve in Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimental findings show that the phoretic torque M aligning the particle antiparallel to the local intensity gradient depends both on the magnitude and the gradient of the illumination intensity (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Employing scaling arguments, we use the expression', '', 'with a saturating function g(( I)2), which can be understood from the coupling of the heat flux through the particle to the solvent slip velocity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further details are provided in Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The numerical results (solid curves in Fig 5a) are in good agreement with our data and correctly describe both the dependence of  on the amplitude and the asymmetry of the light profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to a corroboration of our experimental results, the simulations highlight the importance of the nonlinear dependence of the restoring torque M (and the corresponding reorientation time ) on the light gradient (cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In case of a linear relationship M I, our simulations do not lead to a significant rectified motion, and particles mainly accumulate at the minima of I(x) (see Methods for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The particle alignment and the mean particle velocity are also influenced by thermal noise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is shown by the velocity probability distribution functions, which are plotted in Fig 5b,c for large and small light amplitudes I, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The right peak of the bimodal distribution in Fig 5b corresponds to particles that travel rather straight through the light landscape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is only possible for particles whose orientation perfectly points in the +x direction .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under such conditions no torques arise and the particles travel continuously to the right.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When reducing I, the influence of thermal fluctuations increases, which leads to deviations from a perfect particle alignment and thus to torques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This results in a back and forth motion around the minima of I(x) due to opposite torques at those regions (inset Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the probability of small  is enhanced (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have also investigated the dependence of  on the particle diameter .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With decreasing , the phoretic torques become smaller41, while for larger  the spatial averaging of the particle over the light landscape effectively reduces the amplitude I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This leads to a pronounced size dependence of  (Fig 5d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our findings demonstrate that a phototactic response can be observed in artificial microswimmers, which fortifies the resemblance with biological systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with microorganisms, where the underlying active reorientation is typically achieved by complex internal feedback loops, a tactic response to external light gradients can be accomplished in active colloids by breaking the axial symmetry of the diffusiophoretic slip velocity around the particle, which leads to particle alignment and directed motion along a light gradient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because similar torques as discussed here are also expected for catalytically26,48,49,50 or thermophoretically4,51,52,53 self-propelled polar particles in concentration or temperature gradients27,41,54, a comparable tactic behaviour is likely to occur also in other systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with topographical structures or external ratchet potentials, where particle currents havebeen experimentally demonstrated44,45,47,55,56, the use of optical landscapes allows for dynamical adjustments because they can be easily varied in space and time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This offers promising opportunities for the navigation of active particles in dynamical environments.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

#@NEW_LINE#@#  The result in equation (32) provides a direct relation between the position-dependent velocity vp(x) and the particle orientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that a particle with certain initial conditions will always have the same orientation once it reaches a position with a certain velocity vp(x), independent of the specific shape of the velocity profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To illustrate that this always leads to a vanishing particle current, we now consider a particle starting in the minimum of a periodic velocity profile vp(x) (Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (For the example

slope of the velocity profile (see Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Independent of the specific shape of the profile (even if there is a substructure with additional local minima and maxima as in the example in Fig 7), the particle reaches the position of the same maximum velocity before it returns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This velocity vp,max is determined by the initial conditions via', 'Figure 7: Particle

that the net current is still zero after averaging over the initial orientations of the particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For symmetry reasons and with the result in equation (32) it is clear that a particle with initial orientation 0 moves continuously to the left, given that a particle with initial orientation 0 travels to the right through the periodic velocity profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it only has to be shown that the mean velocity is the same in the two cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For that purpose it is sufficient to calculate the time a particle with initial orientation 0 needs to cross region
