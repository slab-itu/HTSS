Tunable and low-loss correlated plasmons in Mott-like insulating oxides  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Plasmonics has attracted tremendous interests for its ability to confine light into subwavelength dimensions, creating novel devices with unprecedented functionalities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  New plasmonic materials are actively being searched, especially those with tunable plasmons and low loss in the visibleultraviolet range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such plasmons commonly occur in metals, but many metals have high plasmonic loss in the optical range, a main issue in current plasmonic research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we discover an anomalous form of tunable correlated plasmons in a Mott-like insulating oxide from the Sr1xNb1yO3+ family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These correlated plasmons have multiple plasmon frequencies and low loss in the visibleultraviolet range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supported by theoretical calculations, these plasmons arise from the nanometre-spaced confinement of extra oxygen planes that enhances the unscreened Coulomb interactions among charges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correlated plasmons are tunable: they diminish as extra oxygen plane density or film thickness decreases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results open a path for plasmonics research in previously untapped insulating and strongly-correlated materials.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Plasmonics offers a crossroad between photonics and nanoelectronics by combining the formers high-bandwidth capability with the latters nanoscale integrability1,2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasmonics utilizes plasmon, a collective excitation of charges that arises from interactions between electromagnetic fields (such as photons) and free charges3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conventionally, the plasmon frequency depends on the free-charge density3; thus, high-frequency plasmons are usually found in metals3,4,5 due to their abundance of free charges, but are rarely observed in conventional wide bandgap insulators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In strongly-correlated materials, conventional forms of plasmons have been observed in the metallic or superconducting phases of these materials, and there have been studies to explore their potential for plasmonics in vanadium oxides6,7,8 and cuprates9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, localized conventional surface plasmons have been observed in the metallic phase of VO2, and its temperature-dependent metalinsulator transition has been utilized for plasmonic switching and sensing6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in strongly-correlated, insulating phases of these materials (such as in Mott insulators11), correlated forms of plasmons under long-range Coulomb interactions have only been theoretically investigated12 but not experimentally observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Meanwhile, the Sr1xNb1yO3+ family of oxides are known to have rich structures and electronic properties that vary with oxygen content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, perovskite SrNbO3 is conducting with an Nb-4d1 electronic structure13,14,15,16, and Sr1xNbO3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14) has been found to potentially be a good photocatalyst in water splitting applications15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, oxygen-rich SrNbO3.4 and SrNbO3.5, derived by interspersing the perovskite lattice of SrNbO3 with extra oxygen planes along the 101 direction at certain periodic intervals16,17 (see Supplementary Note 1 for details), is a quasi-one-dimensional conductor16,17,18,19,20,21 and a ferroelectric insulator22,23, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously, there are no reported studies on plasmons in this family of oxides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, several Sr1xNbO3+ films with varying oxygen content, electrical conductivity (from metallic to insulator-like) and film thicknesses are studied using spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE), atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), transport measurements and supported by theoretical calculations based on coupled harmonic oscillators model and density functional theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results show a surprising observation of a new form of correlated plasmons in the insulator-like film, itself also revealed to be a strongly-correlated Mott-like insulator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correlated plasmons unusually have multiple plasmon frequencies (1.7, 3.0 and 4.0 eV) and low loss (several times lower than gold) in the visibleultraviolet range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supported by theoretical calculations, these correlated plasmons arise from collective excitations of correlated electrons in the film, where the nanometre-spaced confinement of extra oxygen planes causes increased Coulomb repulsions among the electrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correlated plasmons are reproducible and tunable: they diminish and ultimately vanish as extra oxygen plane density or film thickness decreases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the decrease of extra oxygen plane density increases the electrical conductivity, and, as correlated plasmons are vanishing in the metallic films, the increased free-charge density causes conventional plasmon to arise at 1.9 eV.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Transport measurements results', 'The main batch of pressure-dependent Sr1xNbO3+ films is deposited on (001)LaAlO3 substrates using pulsed-laser deposition under three oxygen pressure conditions: 5 × 106, 3 × 105 and 1 × 104 Torr, labelled as lp-SNO, mp-SNO and hp-SNO, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transport measurements reveal that lp-SNO and mp-SNO are metallic with room-temperature resistivity of 1 × 104 and 6 × 103 cm, respectively, while hp-SNO is insulator-like with room-temperature resistivity of 6 cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conducting lp-SNO have an unusually large room-temperature free-charge density of 1 × 1022 cm3, while for mp-SNO it is 4 × 1021 cm3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The room-temperature mobility of the conducting films is 2.5 cm2 V1 s1 for lp-SNO and 0.3 cm2 V1 s1 for mp-SNO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thickness of the three main films is 196, 218 and 168 nm for lp-SNO, mp-SNO and hp-SNO, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For thickness-dependent study, thinner hp-SNO films with varying thicknesses of 81, 52 and 20 nm are also deposited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For reproducibility, a second batch of pressure-dependent films is deposited as well under six oxygen pressure conditions: 5 × 106 Torr (lp-SNO-2), 1 × 105 Torr (mlp-SNO-2), 3 × 105 Torr (mp-SNO-2), 7 × 105 Torr (mhp-SNO-2), 1 × 104 Torr (hp-SNO-2) and 5 × 104 (hrp-SNO-2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lp-SNO-2, mlp-SNO-2, mp-SNO-2, and mhp-SNO-2 films are conducting, while the hp-SNO-2 and hrp-SNO-2 films are insulating, and their thicknesses are kept to be within a narrow range of 159182 nm (see Supplementary Table 1 for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystal structures of the representative main batch films are studied using X-ray diffractions (XRDs) shown in Supplementary Fig 1.

extracted from SE, where  is the photon angular frequency (see Supplementary Figs 25 for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each peak in the transverse () spectra indicates an optical excitation, while each peak in the longitudinal LF spectra indicates a plasmonic excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For sub-X-ray photons, the photon momentum transfer, q, is finite but approaches zero because it is much less than the crystal momentum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this limit, the distinction between longitudinal (l) and transverse (t) () vanishes, that is, , which allows sub-X-ray optical spectroscopy to probe both optical and plasmonic properties of materials in the low-q limit24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the optical and plasmonic peaks are listed in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that longitudinal LF spectrum is also the quantity probed by electron energy loss spectroscopy, which is another common technique used in the study of plasmonic properties of materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as hp-SNO is insulator-like, such photoemission-based spectroscopy measurements might be challenging for hp-SNO due to significant charging effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Complex dielectric

lp-SNO (Fig 1b) shows an intraband Drude peak (A1) and the first interband transition peak (A2 and A3,  greater than 4.6 eV), which has been attributed as O-2pNb-4d transition15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Note that in the cited studies, the theoretical bandgap between O-2p and Nb-4d calculated using density functional theory was underestimated25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the A2 peak from 4.6 eV should still be regarded as originated from O-2pNb-4d transition because it is the lowest-energy interband transition in lp-SNO.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LF of lp-SNO (Fig 1b) shows a large peak (A1, 1.9 eV), which coincides with the zero-crossing of 1() at 1.84 eV (Fig 1a) and is very close to the reflectivity minimum at 2.1 eV (Supplementary Fig 6), indicating that the peak comes from a conventional plasmon excitation3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a slight blueshift between the A1 peak and the 1() zero-crossing due to the free-electron scattering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, from this blueshift along with the full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of the A1 peak (see equations 5 and 6), we can estimate the free-electron scattering, 1/, in lp-SNO to be 0.47 eV and its conventional plasmon dephasing time3, T2, to be 2.8 fs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Meanwhile, in the less-conducting mp-SNO, the conventional plasmon peak (B1 in Fig 1c) redshifts to 1.7 eV due to the decrease in free-charge density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the FWHM of the B1 peak and its blueshift with respect to the 1() zero-crossing at 1.62 eV, the 1/ and T2 in mp-SNO can be estimated to be 0.52 eV and 2.5 fs, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reflectivity minimum also redshifts to 1.9 eV (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides the Drude (B1) and the first interband transition peaks (B4 and B5), the 2() of mp-SNO also shows two additional peaks at 3.5 (B2) and 4.5 eV (B3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particularly for B2, it shares the same shape and energy position with the B2 of the corresponding LF spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As discussed below, B2 is a new form of correlated plasmon, with a different origin from the B1 conventional plasmon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An important observation is shown in the 2() and LF spectra of hp-SNO (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2() shows that hp-SNO has no apparent Drude peak, consistent with transport measurement, with a wide bandgap of 4.6 eV (C5 and C6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, below this bandgap there exist several mid-gap peaks at 1.7 (C1), 3.0 (C2), 4.0 (C3) and 4.5 eV (C4) with low overall 2() ( less_than 1 for C1 and C2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particularly, C1, C2 and C3 peaks share very similar shapes and energy positions with another group of three peaks in the LF spectrum: C1, C2 and C3, respectively (just like the similarities between B2 and B2 peaks of mp-SNO).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The energy positions of both group of peaks are also very close to the reflectivity minima of hp-SNO (Supplementary Fig 6) at 1.9, 3.2 and 4.2 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These indicate that the two groups of peaks come from a similar origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The appearance of these mid-gap peaks in the LF spectrum indicates that they arise from plasmonic excitations3 and not from other effects such as spinorbit coupling, phononic, excitonic or anisotropic effects (see Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, their concurrent existence in 2() spectrum indicates that there is a coupling between optical and plasmonic excitations in hp-SNO (and to a lesser extent, in mp-SNO).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As discussed later, these mid-gap plasmonic excitations are born from collective excitations of correlated electrons, and are thus called correlated plasmons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As a first approximation, the dephasing time of these correlated plasmons may be estimated from FWHM of each peak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FWHM of C1, C2, and C3 peaks is 0.7, 0.68 and 0.38 eV, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This leads to the dephasing time of 1.9, 1.9 and 3.5 fs, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the scattering and dephasing mechanisms in correlated systems might be different from those in weakly correlated metals due to long-range correlation effects, as discussed later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Meanwhile, the C4 peak may be excitonic in origin due to its relative sharpness, asymmetric shape and energy position that is just below the bandgap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This peak diminishes as free-charge density increases in conducting mp-SNO (see the similar B3 peak in mp-SNO), and ultimately vanishes in lp-SNO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If this peak is indeed excitonic, its presence in hp-SNO indicates that electronhole interactions are unscreened in the insulating hp-SNO film, while its diminishing behaviour in mp-SNO and lp-SNO indicates that electronhole interactions are heavily screened in the conducting films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Differences between correlated and conventional plasmons', 'The correlated plasmons of hp-SNO are fundamentally different from conventional (bulk) plasmon in lp-SNO, conventional metals such as gold3,5,26 and the metallic phases of strongly correlated materials such as metallic VO2 (refs 6, 7, 8) for the following reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, since hp-SNO is insulator-like, the correlated plasmons do not originate from collective excitations of free charges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, as free-charge density increases in mp-SNO, the correlated plasmons instead become weaker and ultimately vanish in lp-SNO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, in lp-SNO and gold the 1() is negative below the conventional plasmon energy and conventional plasmons occur at the zero-crossing of 1() (albeit with slight blueshifts due to the free-electron scattering), while the 1() of hp-SNO stays positive below the correlated plasmon energies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, conventional plasmons as in lp-SNO and gold usually only have one (bulk) plasmon energy, while hp-SNO has at least three observable correlated plasmon energies with a seemingly ordered energy ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is somewhat similar to a previous theoretical result12 where the presence of long-range Coulomb interaction in correlated systems could induce multiple correlated plasmon energies to appear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These theoretical plasmon energies also had an ordered ratio of U* and U*/2, where U* was the effective local Coulomb interaction, although the energy ratio of the observed correlated plasmons of hp-SNO is not as straightforward to deduce (see Supplementary Note 3 for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourth, the correlated plasmons appear in both 2() and LF spectra of hp-SNO, which means that the correlated plasmons can readily be excited by, decay radiatively into and thus couple with free-space photons without any external mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is unlike conventional surface plasmon resonance in metals, which needs external phase-matching mechanisms such as grating, Otto and Kretschmann configurations3,27,28 to couple the plasmons with free-space photons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, the 2() of hp-SNO below its bandgap is several times (for example, 6 times at 3.0 eV) lower than that of gold3,5,26, which means the correlated plasmons have low loss in the optical visibleultraviolet range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explain these differences, we further study the optical conductivity (1()=02(), where 0 is the vacuum permittivity), spectral weight transfer and atomic structure of the films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Optical conductivity and spectral weight analysis', 'The 1() analysis (Fig 2a) is important because it obeys the f-sum (charge conservation) rule24,29,30,  where n, e and me is the total electron density, elementary charge and electron mass, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this rule, a partial spectral weight integral of an energy region (for example, from E1 to E2) can be defined as .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The W is proportional to the effective number of electrons participating in the optical excitations, which means by analysing the evolution of W we can study the various charge transfers that occur in the films and gauge their electronic correlations11,24,30,31,32,33,34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, the 1() spectra are divided into three energy regions: W1 for the Drude peak (0.62.0 eV), W2 for the mid-gap plasmonic peaks (2.04.3 eV) and W3 for the first interband transition of O-2pNb-4d (4.36.5 eV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evolution of each W across the three films is shown in Fig 2b (see also Supplementary Fig 7 for more details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Optical conductivity spectra and spectral weight of pressure-dependent Sr1xNbO3+ films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The optical conductivity, 1(), of lp-SNO (5 × 106

three films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Wtot is the total W from 0.6 to 6.5 eV.Full size image', 'As free-charge density decreases from lp-SNO to mp-SNO, the decrease of W1 (Drude region) is accompanied by an increase of W3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be understood because the decreased number of electrons in the conduction band (Nb-4d) increases the available unoccupied states necessary for the first interband transition of O-2pNb-4d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, as free-charge density further decreases and ultimately vanishes during a transition from metal to insulator, the diminishing of Drude peak is expected to be accompanied by a further increase of W3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, Fig 2 shows this is not the case for the metalinsulator transition (MIT) between mp-SNO and hp-SNO, because instead W1 and W3 both anomalously decrease as MIT occurs, leading to an overall decrease of W below 6.5 eV (Wtot).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the f-sum rule24,29,30 and because hp-SNO is insulator-like with no apparent Drude peak, this decrease has to be compensated by an equivalent increase of W above 6.5 eV, implying spectral weight transfers over wide energy ranges on the onset of the MIT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such wide-range anomalous spectral weight transfers are a direct evidence of strong electronic correlation11,24,30,31,32,33,34,35 and has also been observed in other strongly-correlated materials such as cuprates11,30,33, vanadium oxides34 and manganites11,30,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This anomalous spectral weight transfer behaviour signifies that hp-SNO is most likely a Mott-like insulator and the MIT occurs as the Coulomb repulsion between electrons becomes stronger (that is, unscreened) and electronic correlation increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This also means that the plasmons in hp-SNO are a new type of correlated plasmons born from collective excitations of correlated electrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Transmission electron microscopy', 'The three films are also studied using TEM to determine their microstructures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atomic resolution z-contrast scanning TEM images of lp-SNO, mp-SNO and hp-SNO are shown in Fig 3ac.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The global arrangement of the atomic structure of lp-SNO (Fig 3a) exhibits a long-range perovskite structure13, whereas those of mp-SNO and lp-SNO (Fig 3b,c) exhibit a short-range perovskite structure interspersed with high densities of ordered {101} and {101} extra oxygen planes that occur every few unit cells (shown in high magnification in Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their position-averaged atomic structure (Fig 3e) matches with the known extra oxygen plane structure of bulk SrNbO3.4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17) shown overlaid onto the image (see Supplementary Note 1 for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density of these planes qualitatively appears to increase with oxygen deposition pressure (Fig 3ac), and quantitatively (see Supplementary Figs 8 and 9 for details), there is a fourfold increase from mp-SNO to hp-SNO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with an increased incorporation of extra oxygen with higher oxygen deposition pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Atomic resolution

decreases further to 20 nm, the correlated plasmon disappears (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that besides using the oxygen deposition pressure, the correlated plasmons can also be tuned by

this further, we study the 1() and W of the thickness-dependent hp-SNO films shown in Fig 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be seen that as the film thickness decreases, the spectral weight of the first

Supplementary Fig 1, it can be seen that the in-plane lattice constant of the Sr1xNbO3+ films is 4.04 Å, while the lattice constant of the LaAlO3 substrate is 3.791 Å (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36), which means that there is a relatively large lattice mismatch of 6.6% between the films and the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In thinner films, this large lattice mismatch should play a more significant role in influencing the electronic band structure of the whole film due to their relative thinness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large lattice mismatch may reduce the unscreened Coulomb interactions between the electrons, resulting in less correlations and correlated plasmon excitations in thinner films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the role of lattice mismatch should be more minimized in thicker films, because their relative thickness should allow them to have more complete relaxations, leading to stronger correlations and more correlated plasmon excitations compared to thinner films.

thickness-dependent effects (see Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From Supplementary Fig 14, it can be seen that, in general, the behaviours of the correlated and conventional plasmons as well as excitonic peaks in this batch are very similar to what was observed in the main-batch films shown in Fig 1 (see Supplementary Note 4 for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Supplementary Fig 16 also shows that the pressure-dependent MIT is reproducible as well, and that the films deposited under higher oxygen pressures consistently have the signature of strong electronic correlations.

'The presence of extra oxygen planes in hp-SNO and their absence in lp-SNO accompanied by remarkable changes in () and 1() spectra indicate that the interplay between extra oxygen planes and electronic correlations plays important roles in the plasmonics excitations and MIT between the films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For lp-SNO, its negative 1() value below 1.9 eV, strong Drude response and no excitonic peak indicate that the Coulomb interactions between its Nb-4d electrons as well as between its electrons and holes are screened, making it a weakly-correlated metal similar to Sr1xNbO3 (refs 14, 15, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, non-negative 1() value, wide-range spectral weight transfer and presence of excitonic signature in thick (168 nm) hp-SNO indicate the Coulomb interactions among its Nb-4d electrons as well as between its electrons and holes are unscreened, which leads to strong electronic correlation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, the extra oxygen planes in the thick hp-SNO act as high-potential walls that prevent the Nb-4d electrons from hopping across the planes, confining them and making them feel stronger Coulomb repulsions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This changes their behaviour from itinerant to localized and transforms the system into a strongly-correlated Mott-like insulator11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Furthermore, since the extra oxygen planes are embedded throughout the volume of the hp-SNO film, the correlated plasmons disappear in the very thin hp-SNO film, and as hp-SNO itself is a Mott-like insulator with little to no free electrons at its surface, the observed correlated plasmons are most likely bulk plasmons instead of surface plasmons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The occurrence of the extra oxygen planes every few unit cells (every 5 unit cells for SrNbO3.4) also means that the correlated plasmons have nanometre-spaced (2 nm for SrNbO3.4) confinement in the film (see Supplementary Fig 1 for the films lattice constants).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The electronic confinement is further supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations shown in Fig 6a,b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculations show that the presence of oxygen planes in SrNbO3.4, which shares similar extra oxygen plane structure with hp-SNO, can indeed induce the electronic confinement on Nb-4d electrons (Fig 6b), consistent with previous report16 (see also Supplementary Fig 18 for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This confinement is not observed in SrNbO3 (Fig 8a), which has no extra oxygen planes similar to lp-SNO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the following discussion, we model and explain the

approximation (RPA) method is also able to resemble qualitatively the experimental LF of lp-SNO (see Supplementary Fig 19a and Supplementary Note 5 for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is not surprising because lp-SNO is a metal with little to no correlations and thus can be modelled using DFT-based calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On the other hand, the theoretical LF of SrNbO3.4 calculated using DFT and RPA is not able to resemble the experimental LF of thick hp-SNO, particularly the three correlated plasmons peak that we observe in thick hp-SNO (Supplementary Fig 19b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because hp-SNO is a correlated system, which cannot be properly treated using DFT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, to model the correlated plasmons of thick hp-SNO, we instead use a phenomenological model in which the effective Coulomb interactions between neighbouring correlated electrons is modelled as that of an elastic spring, at least in the low wave vector (or momentum transfer, |q|0) limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this model (Fig 6d and Supplementary Fig 20), we qualitatively treat plasmonic oscillations of the correlated electrons as those of a chain of coupled harmonic oscillators bounded by two oxygen walls (where the walls are the extra oxygen planes that confine the Nb-4d electrons).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the correlated electrons might have different effective masses and charges from bare electrons due to correlation effects12, in the calculations we vary these along with the number of oscillators in one chain to find the set of parameters that can best describe the experimental data (see Supplementary Fig 21 and Supplementary Note 3 for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'From the calculation results (Fig 6e,g), we find that the coupled oscillator model is able to resemble

magnitude of (), the effective masses of the quasi-electrons are set to 25me, suggesting that the masses are heavily renormalized due to electronic correlation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we also find that to match the intensity trend of the correlated plasmon peaks, the quasi-electrons need to have alternating charges, that is, the quasi-electrons nearest to the walls have e charge, their immediate neighbours +e charge, and so on, suggesting that the originally itinerant electrons have transformed into quasi-electrons and holes distributed alternatingly along the chain due to correlation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with previous report of possible formation of charge density wave in SrNbO3.4 (refs 18, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The estimated heavy effective mass and the alternating charge arrangement of the quasi-electrons should also affect the dephasing time of the correlated plasmons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heavy effective mass of the quasi-electrons can make the confined electrons (and thus the correlated plasmons) much more inertial against scattering, which can significantly enhance the correlated plasmon dephasing time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the redistributed charge arrangement would also alter their scattering profile to be different from that of nearly free bare electrons in metals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we have demonstrated that depending on the electronic correlation strength, different types of plasmons can be reproducibly excited in Sr1xNbO3+ films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In weakly correlated metallic films, conventional plasmons dominate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, in strongly correlated Mott-like insulating films, low-loss correlated plasmons, which have fundamentally different properties and origins from conventional plasmons, are excitable instead.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These correlated plasmons arise from the nanometre-spaced confinement of extra oxygen planes in the film and, in general, can be tuned by changing the electronic correlation strength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be accomplished by changing the extra oxygen plane density, for example, by varying the oxygen pressure during film deposition,

and the optimum Z value is found to be 25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Second, to tune the peak intensity trend which increases as energy increases (see Fig 1d), we fine-tune the effective charges of the correlated electrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the effective charges are set to be all the same as that of bare electron, the calculation results in a peak intensity trend that decreases as energy increases, which is the opposite trend compared to what was observed experimentally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This happens because the slower vibration mode corresponds to higher polarization, which gives higher peak intensity as energy increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To improve this, we find that the increasing intensity trend can only be achieved if the charges are assumed to be distributed with alternating signs, that is, q1=e, q2=+e, q3=e and so on.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Third, the number of plasmonic peaks appearing in the theoretical () and LF of hp-SNO is tuned by varying the number of oscillators in one chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In analogy with classical mechanics, an N-oscillator system has N natural oscillation modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the number of observed plasmonic peaks in Fig 1d is three, this gives an indication that N should be an odd number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We start with the case of N=3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A three-body oscillator have three intrinsic oscillation modes, but there is one mode that has zero polarization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This zero-polarization mode cannot show up in (), leaving only two non-zero peaks and inconsistent with the three peaks observed in Fig 1d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, for N=5 the five-body oscillator has five eigenmodes, but two of them have zero polarization, leaving three non-zero peaks surviving, which is what the experimental results require.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculation results (Supplementary Figure 21) show that for N=5 the peak positions and the increasing intensity trend are in a rough agreement with experimental results, but the calculated relative peak intensities are not very satisfactory because the first and the second peaks are too low compared to the third peak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The calculation for the case of N=7 is next performed with the same approach as discussed above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results show that not only does it give three appearing peaks (Fig 6e,g and Supplementary Fig 21), with only an additional negligibly small peak close to 0 eV, but also it provides a peak intensity profile that much better resembles the experimental results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this particular case, the parameter values are set as follows: 0=2.0 eV, Z=25, 1()=4.0, 1/=0.5 eV, m1=m2==mN=Zme, k1=0.4k0, k2=0.5k0, k3=1.0k0 and k4=1.1k0, and the rest of the spring constants follow a mirror symmetry, that is, k8=k1, k7=k2, k6=k3 and k5=k4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The calculations are also performed for N=9 and N=11, although Supplementary Fig 21 shows that these two cases result in too many peaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 1d it can be seen that, in addition to the three main peaks of C1, C2 and C3, there is a small peak at 2.4 eV that appears in both () and LF spectra of thick hp-SNO, which means this peak is also a correlated plasmon peak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the analysis of Supplementary Fig 21, this small peak could come from the excitation of these higher-order modes (that is, N=9 and/or N=11), although its low intensity compared the three main peaks of C1, C2 and C3 means that the seven-oscillator mode should still be the dominant mode of oscillation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For more details, the in-depth theoretical calculations of the conventional plasmon of lp-SNO and correlated plasmons of hp-SNO are discussed further in Supplementary Note 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding authors on reasonable request.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
