Universality and chaoticity in ultracold K+KRb chemical reactions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A fundamental question in the study of chemical reactions is how reactions proceed at a collision energy close to absolute zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This question is no longer hypothetical: quantum degenerate gases of atoms and molecules can now be created at temperatures lower than a few tens of nanokelvin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we consider the benchmark ultracold reaction between, the most-celebrated ultracold molecule, KRb and K. We map out an accurate ab initio ground-state potential energy surface of the K2Rb complex in full dimensionality and report numerically-exact quantum-mechanical reaction dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of rotationally resolved rates is shown to be Poissonian.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An analysis of the hyperspherical adiabatic potential curves explains this statistical character revealing a chaotic distribution for the short-range collision complex that plays a key role in governing the reaction outcome.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
"The ability to prepare reactants and control products on demand with quantum state precision is chemistry's holy grail1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultracold chemistry is a new and rapidly progressing field where reactants are prepared in a single quantum state which holds out this promise1,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a pioneering experiment, groups at JILA were able to produce an ultracold gas of 40K87Rb molecules at nano-Kelvin temperature where even the nuclear spins were oriented1,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exothermic reaction rate coefficients of KRb+KRb and KRb+K were also measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, by merely flipping a nuclear spin the KRb+KRb reaction could be turned on and off.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a perfect illustration of an on demand reaction demonstrating the control that is attainable in ultracold gases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such control also promises to answer open questions such as the role of geometric phases (GPs), non-adiabatic14 and Van der Waals entrance-channel effects15, and the effect of external fields on the product distribution in chemical reactivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detection of complex molecules with single-quantum state precision has been shown to be feasible in a hotter 1 K environment16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ", 'However, theoretical calculations of reaction dynamics for such systems pose a daunting computational challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultracold collisions are sensitive to details of the potential and require accurate electronic potential calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition many of the systems of current interest are heavy with deep potentials, meaning that scattering calculations need to include many channels with computational costs scaling with the cube of the number of channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is for these reasons that while the pioneering experiments1,13, on KRb reactions, were performed over 6 years ago no accompanying scattering calculations have been performed, until now.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such calculations are needed to provide key predictions for state-to-state rate coefficients, which await laboratory measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The reaction of KRb with K is relatively fast with a rate coefficient of the order of 1010 cm3 s1 which agrees fairly well with predictions of a universal model (UM), based on quantum defect theory18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that most molecules undergo atom exchange, and only a small percentage undergo an elastic collision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A statistical approach has been used to analyse the effect of an external electric field on the rotational product distribution in the K+Rb2 and KRb+KRb reactions20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to understand the chemistry of such reactions one needs to go beyond these approaches and examine reaction rates at a state-to-state level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The reactive scattering of complex atoms and molecules has always been intricately intertwined with classical and quantum chaos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, classical trajectory simulations of reactive scattering show self-similar behaviour of dwell times between entering and leaving the central part of the high-dimensional potential21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently there has been interest in the chaotic character of ultracold inelastic collisions24,25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atom+dimer collisions involving three identical alkali atoms at ultracold energies have been shown to be classically chaotic28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This chaotic character has been taken as the starting point for work examining statistical aspects of non-reactive ultracold alkali-metal dimer collisions29,30 and ultracold resonance reactions31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such works suggest an approach to tackling ultracold reactions involving heavy alkali species avoiding the prohibitive computational cost of numerically exact calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We report an explicit quantum mechanical study of the ultracold reaction between a K atom and a KRb molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we compute an accurate ab initio ground-state potential energy surface (PES) of the KRbK complex in full dimensionality, taking special care to accurately describe the long-range forces important in ultracold collisions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total rate is shown to be universal in charactervalidating the use of simple UMs for other similar reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the product rotational distribution is shown to be statistical in character, which we attribute to the chaotic nature of the reaction complex.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
