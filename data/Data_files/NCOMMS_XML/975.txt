Variations in brain defects result from cellular mosaicism in the activation of heat shock signalling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Repetitive prenatal exposure to identical or similar doses of harmful agents results in highly variable and unpredictable negative effects on fetal brain development ranging in severity from high to little or none.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the molecular and cellular basis of this variability is not well understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study reports that exposure of mouse and human embryonic brain tissues to equal doses of harmful chemicals, such as ethanol, activates the primary stress response transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1) in a highly variable and stochastic manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While Hsf1 is essential for protecting the embryonic brain from environmental stress, excessive activation impairs critical developmental events such as neuronal migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that mosaic activation of Hsf1 within the embryonic brain in response to prenatal environmental stress exposure may contribute to the resulting generation of phenotypic variations observed in complex congenital brain disorders.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Environmental stressors are critical factors impacting the proper development of the nervous system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cerebral cortex, the intricate outer layer of the cerebrum whose formation relies on a complex series of coordinated developmental events1,2, is particularly vulnerable to disturbances in the prenatal environment3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinical and epidemiological studies have identified a variety of such stressors including heavy metals and alcohol to enhance the risks of neuropsychiatric diseases6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Exposure to environmental stressors results in immediate alterations in the molecular landscape of afflicted cells7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduced expression of many genes affect brain development deleteriously8,9, while the upregulation of others are involved in pathological processes such as cell death10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To mitigate these outcomes, cells launch protective signalling events simultaneously that attempt to counter these effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One such mechanism is the Hsf1-Heat shock protein (Hsp) signalling pathway, a well-known stress-induced chaperone pathway that serves as a universally conserved cytoprotective mechanism against multiple forms of cellular stress across several organisms ranging from bacteria to humans12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hsf1 is activated by heat stress or other stimuli through sequential protein modification events including phosphorylation, sumoylation, trimerization, and nuclear translocation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation then triggers the transcription of Hsps and other downstream target genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our recent study has revealed that Hsf1Hsp signalling is commonly activated on prenatal exposure to various distinct types of environmental stressors including ethanol (EtOH), methyl mercury (MeHg), and maternal seizures, and is required for reducing the risk of cortical malformations such as leptomeningeal heterotopias, thereby reducing susceptibilities to epilepsy15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the intercellular variability in transcriptional stress responses due to environmental stressors, including that of Hsf1Hsp signalling, is augmented in pathological conditions such as aging and neuropsychiatric diseases in higher-order organisms15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, unicellular microbial populations rely on this non-genetic cell-to-cell gene expression variability for the survival of a clonal population in response to abrupt environmental changes17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the roles of mosaic cellular responses in brain pathogenesis in vertebrates are still unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This study identifies the probabilistic activation of Hsf1Hsp signalling on exposure to environmental stressors and the distinct phenotypic consequences resulting from differential activation levels in cortical development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that heterogeneous events of abnormal development may occur probabilistically, accounting for individually distinct patterns of focal cortical malformations in the cortex exposed to similar levels of environmental challenges.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Probabilistic HSF1 activation in human neural progenitors', 'To test whether the HSF1 activation levels of human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) in response to environmental stress are determined in a random manner or correlated with their geographical location in the dish, we have taken advantage of the single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) method for visually analysing mRNA expression levels of HSP70, a major downstream transcriptional target of HSF1 in each single cell (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that HSP70 mRNA is very stable (with a half-life of more than 8 h) under stress exposure20, smFISH analysis after a 3 h exposure provides an overall picture of the average transcriptional activity of HSF1 during the stress exposure in each hNPC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this analysis, we used three types of environmental stress: EtOH, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and MeHg, all of which induce oxidative stress at certain concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highest concentration for each agent was set to a subthreshold level, which is half of the concentration that induces massive (more than 20% of the total number of cells) cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Variable levels of activation of Hsf1Hsp signalling by environmental stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) Representative smFISH images of HSP70 mRNA (a) and GAPDH mRNA (b) in an hNPC line (AG09429).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c,d) Quantification of HSP70 and GAPDH mRNA puncta in hNPCs (AG09429 and GM03440) exposed to the indicated reagents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the box plot, the line within the box indicates the median; the upper and lower edges of the box represent the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars indicate the 10th and 90th percentiles and each dot indicates cells within the top/bottom 10th percentiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variability of HSP70 mRNA particles was significantly increased in response to all these reagents compared to that with PBS exposure (*P less_than 0.05, **P less_than 0.01, ***P less_than 0.001 by Levenes test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More than 35 cells in different positions within the dishes were measured in each group).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (eg) The correlation coefficients of cellular positions in the dishes and Hsp70 mRNA levels are compared between the experimental data (broken lines) and simulated data sets representing probabilistic events (red histograms).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presented P values of one-sample Z-test indicate that the levels of the Hsf1Hsp 70 signalling activation in each cell are randomly determined regardless of the positions in the culture dish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars, 0.02 mm.Full size image', 'After 3 h of stress exposure, we observed that the number of HSP70 mRNA particles in each cell varied among the hNPCs regardless of the type of environmental stressors (PBS control did not induce HSP70 expression; Fig 1a, Supplementary Fig1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect was dosage dependent, as the variability was higher when exposed to environmental stressors at increased concentrations (Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The levels of activation appeared to be random as they differed across hNPCs in close proximity regardless of their location within the culture dish (peripheral, central and so on), hence sharing the same microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell-to-cell variability was similarly observed for hNPC lines derived from differently induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines (Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variability was maintained during a long period of exposure (Supplementary Fig 2ac), supporting the notion that this effect may have significant consequences on brain development15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant effects were observed in the variability of the expression of the housekeeping gene GAPDH by environmental stressors (Fig 1b-d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We next confirmed that the probability of HSF1 activation was independent of the cells location in the dish through statistical simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each dish, the spatial patterning of HSP70 expression was shuffled to generate a set of randomized patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated for every pair within the data set after random permutation of the experimental data, and the average of the correlation coefficients derived from a thousand of the permutations was plotted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting data for each environmental stressor shows a normal distribution, and the average coefficient of the simulated data set shows no significant difference compared with that of the experimental data (Fig 1eg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous studies21, the correlation between the HSP70 mRNA expression level and the cell cycling status was not evident (Supplementary Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the Hsf1Hsp70 signalling is mainly activated at different magnitudes in a probabilistic fashion among hNPCs in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Heterogeneous Hsf1 activation in mouse embryonic cortex', 'We next examined the Hsf1 activation pattern in vivo by analysing the developing mouse cerebral cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this analysis, we made a reporter plasmid that includes a red fluorescent protein (RFP:DsRed2) encoding gene under the control of the Hsp70 promoter (pHSERFP HSE: Heat Shock Element, Supplementary Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This Hsp70 promoter contains two Hsf1 binding sites, driving RFP (DsRed2) expression upon Hsf1 activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially, we used in utero electroporation (IUE)-mediated transfer of the reporter constructs into cortical neural precursor cells (NPCs) generating excitatory neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pHSERFP was co-electroporated at embryonic day (E) 14 into the cortex with pCAGGFP, which labels all the electroporated cells with green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure was followed by daily intraperitoneal injections of EtOH as a representative stressor (or control PBS) which were started 6 h post-electroporation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HSERFP reporter expression was rarely detected in the embryos from PBS-injected dams 1 day after the last injection at E16 ( less_than 0.01% of total electroporated cells express RFP), whereas RFP was expressed in most of the embryos from EtOH-injected dams (Fig 2b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In embryos from EtOH-exposed dams, 23.6±1.6% (s.e.m.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of the total electroporated (GFP+) NPCs and descendent neurons expressed the HSERFP reporter in sporadic patterns, showing no indications for specificity in cortical regions (Fig 2ah, Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No induction of the HSERFP reporter in Hsf1 knockout (KO) mutant embryos exposed to EtOH was observed (n=3/3 embryos), confirming that reporter induction was caused solely by Hsf1 activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The morphology and positioning of the reporter-positive cells appeared to be normal (Fig 2il).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, flow cytometric analysis revealed that the HSERFP reporter-positive cell population contained significantly fewer dying cells compared with the reporter-negative cell population (Fig 2mq), consistent with the protective roles of activated Hsf1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Normal development of HSERFP reporter+ neurons and increased cell death of reporter cells in IUE-based reporter analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ac) pHSE- (b,c) or pmutHSE- (a) RFP was electroporated with pCAGGFP into the mouse (C57NL/6J) lateral cortex at E14, followed by daily EtOH (a,b) or PBS (control, c) administration to the dam until E16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reporter expression (red) was observed in NPCs and neurons by electroporation of p HSERFP followed by EtOH administration (b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electroporation of pmut HSERFP plasmid that contains point mutations in HSF1 binding sites in the promoter (Supplementary Fig 3) resulted in reporter expression in less than 0.1% of total electroporated (GFP+) cells in the cortex exposed to EtOH (n=22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, electroporation of p HSERFP in Hsf1 KO mice resulted in no reporter induction by EtOH exposure (n=3/3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (dh) The HSERFP reporter expression was observed in

litter of the transgenic reporter mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in the representative images, the reporter expression is also restricted in limited cortical regions, the pattern of which varies among embryos with no apparent regional preferences (Fig 3bd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reporter expression is not correlated to the position of the embryo in the uterus or in the location of the EtOH injection within the dam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gavage administration of EtOH induced similar heterogeneous reporter expression patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since RFP (DsRed2) protein is stable and detectable for more than 4 days following induction (for example, Fig 3g), the heterogeneous reporter expression is not due to capturing oscillatory activities of HSF1 transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FACS analysis revealed that the reporter-expressing cells consist of both Tuj1+ immature neurons and Nestin+ NPCs, but few NeuN+ mature neurons (Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As the genomic insertion site of the transgene may compromise optimal observation of heterogeneous gene expression, we defined the genomic loci of transgene integration by paired-end whole genome sequencing of HSERFP transgenic mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the two insertion sites identified, one is at the intergenic region on Chromosome 10, where a read pair is aligned to HSE and an intrinsic genomic region (Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second is on Chromosome 5, where two read pairs are aligned to either HSE or the DsRed2 sequence on one side, and to intrinsic sequences within a 3 kb genomic region on the other side (Supplementary Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequences of these read pairs revealed that the transgene is inserted within an intron of the Tctn2 gene, but in the opposite direction of its transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the observed heterogeneous transgene expression is independent of the influence of its transgene locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Heterogeneous activation of Hsf1Hsp signalling in cortical cells was also confirmed by sporadic distribution of cells labelled with another molecular indicator, nuclear translocation of the HSF1, in both mouse and human embryonic cortices exposed to EtOH (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar heterogeneous reporter expression patterns across embryos, as well as among cells within the brain and other tissues in each embryo, have been observed by prenatal exposure to other environmental factors including sodium arsenite, Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced maternal seizure, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced maternal inflammation22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Altogether, these results demonstrate cellular mosaicism after Hsf1Hsp signal activation in the embryonic cerebral cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the results obtained using Hsf1 knockout mice exposed to environmental stressors15, our results also suggest that cells with low levels of activation face a higher risk of cell death under exposure to EtOH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Excess Hsf1 activation impairs migration of cortical neurons', 'We observed the regions containing HSERFP reporter-expressing cells was often associated with delayed migration of immature neurons (inset in Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To formally test this possibility, Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) pulse labelling (a BrdU injection 30 min before the second injection of EtOH at E15 and observation at E18) was performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The disturbed cell migration was observed in the domains with a significant number of reporter+ cells (Fig 3gj).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar migration defects of cortical neurons associated with the HSERFP expression have been observed by prenatal exposure to the drug suramin22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the cells with high levels of Hsf1Hsp signalling activation induced by EtOH and other environmental stressors undergo delayed migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This appears independent of cell death, which does not differ between HSERFP reporter+ and reporter- cells from the reporter transgenic embryos (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To examine whether the high-level activation of Hsf1Hsp signalling causally affects the migration of cortical neurons, an expression construct of the constitutively active form of HSF1 (caHSF1) or pCAGIG control plasmid24 was introduced into the cortex of wild-type mice by IUE at E14, and GFP+ cells were dissociated 24 h post-electroporation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of Hsp70 mRNA particles in individual cells using smFISH revealed that the activation level of Hsf1Hsp signalling by caHSF1 was comparable to the top 5% levels induced by EtOH exposure (Fig 4a,b, compared with Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the expression of caHSF1 recapitulated the physiologically relevant level of HSF1 activation that occurred in a small population of cells in the events of challenged exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the control electroporation, GFP+ electroporated cells were located around layers II-IV at postnatal day (P) 14 (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cases of caHSF1 introduction, however, GFP+ cells formed clusters beneath the gray matter (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full-length wild-type and the loss-of-function type R71A mutant, both of which lack the potency to sufficiently activate Hsf1Hsp signalling, did not exhibit significant effects (Fig 5c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EtOH exposure following caHSF1 electroporation did not have any obvious additional effects on heterotopia formation (Fig 5c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BrdU pulse labelling at E15, 1 day after IUE, and immunostaining for molecular markers such as NeuN (for mature neurons) and Cutl1 (upper layer neurons) at P14 indicated that caHSF1 expression did not affect neuronal differentiation/maturation and subtype specification (Fig 6al).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heterotopia began to develop as early as embryonic stages (Figs 5g, 6m,n).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tuj1 labelling at E18 and Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) at E16 showed that neither neuronal differentiation nor cell death appeared to be affected in the electroporated cells (Fig 5f,g, and Supplementary Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disruptions of the ventricular surface, similar to those observed by in utero exposure to EtOH (Figs 3b,g, 2a, Supplementary Fig 5h), were frequently found at the caHSF1-electroporated region (Fig 5e,h, Supplementary Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, electron microscopy analysis one day after electroporation of caHSF1 revealed that an impairment of adherens junctions in the GFP+ NPCs aligned on the ventricular surface was involved in these disruptions25,26 (Fig 5i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunohistochemistry for Nestin also showed abnormalities in the radial morphology of caHSF1-expressing NPCs (Fig 5h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the disrupted radial glial scaffold and the ventricular lining due to excess activation of HSF1 in NPCs might contribute to the impaired neuronal migration non-cell autonomously, as implied by the migration defects of non-electroporated cells (Fig 6bh) or reporter-negative cells in the EtOH-exposed cortex (Fig 3i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: IUE-mediated expression of caHSF1 recapitulates the physiologically relevant levels of HSF1 activation

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'This present study demonstrates that the level of activation of Hsf1Hsp signalling on prenatal exposure to environmental stress is highly variable among cortical NPCs and immature neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recently demonstrated that insufficient Hsf1Hsp signalling activation on exposure to environmental challenges causes a higher incidence of leptomeningeal heterotopia, as well as defects in neuronal production and survival in the cerebral cortex, all of which are associated with increased risk of seizures15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This present study shows that excessive activation of Hsf1Hsp signalling also leads to different abnormalities in cortical development such as neuronal migration defects and periventricular heterotopia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that the heterogeneous focal cortical malformations caused by discordant activation of the Hsf1Hsp signalling in response to prenatal environmental stress may be an underlying mechanism in human clinical cases associated with phenotypic variations in which various types of focal cortical malformations exist in different cortical regions in each brain30,31 (Fig 8g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to de novo somatic mutations during the early stage of brain development32,33, small epigenetic mosaicism during the early developmental stage is likely to significantly impact later brain development, resulting in mosaic disorganization reported in the brains with psychiatric disorders34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Consistent with previous studies demonstrated in microbes35,36, the present study suggests probabilistic activation of Hsf1Hsp signalling in the NPCs of the mammalian brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of the whole genome sequencing of the reporter transgenic mice (Supplementary Fig 4) suggest reporter expression to occur ubiquitously throughout the body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we observed broad expression in many tissues/organs including the eye, heart, liver and skin22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the expression patterns across various tissues and organs vary between animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Potential factors for these differences include differential circulation/accumulation of EtOH between tissues/organs, differential activation of Hsf1Hsp signalling between tissue/organ-specific cell types, and stochastic response of cells across tissue/organs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of our in vitro experiments demonstrate the stochastic response of Hsf1Hsp signalling to EtOH or other exposure among homogeneous cell populations (Fig 1, Supplementary Figs 1-2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we believe that these various patterns of Hsf1Hsp activation in tissue/organs strongly depend on, though may not be entirely due to, the stochastic response within the same cell populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reporter expression turnover, for example, may be an additional potential factor for the cell-to-cell difference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the unmet need for proper targeted therapies following acute exposure to environmental stressors during pregnancy, understanding the mechanisms of the stochastic activation and potential buffering mechanisms of such stochasticity is a critical next step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanisms similar to TATA-box-involved transcriptional controls for evolutionary adaptation in microbes17,37 may be involved in the generation of stochasticity among cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differential cell fates of NPCs (neuronal versus glial, inhibitory versus excitatory neurons and so on) are additional factors that may affect cell-to-cell variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A buffering mechanism of unequal transcriptions at the post-transcription level has recently been reported38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have shown that stochastic activation of Hsf1Hsp signalling is induced in vitro by EtOH, H2O2 and MeHg (Fig 1), as well as in vivo by prenatal exposure to EtOH using our reporter mice (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hsf1Hsp activation also occurs in the brain in a stochastic manner after prenatal exposure to several other stressors including MeHg, suramin, maternal seizures and sodium arsenite22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, prenatal exposure to suramin, similar to EtOH (Fig 3), is known to cause neuronal migration defects22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, these stressors are likely to share specific mechanisms presented in this study to ultimately affect cortical development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One potential mediator may be oxidative stress; many environmental factors including EtOH causes oxidative stress39,40, and oxidation of HSF1 has been suggested to enhance HSF1 DNA binding activity to induce Hsf1Hsp signalling41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Several questions remain to be answered, including is whether Hsf1Hsp signalling and other stress responsive signalling pathways are functionally integrated; whether their activations are concomitantly regulated, or if they take part in overlapping or compensatory roles; and how excessive Hsf1Hsp activation delays the migration of cortical cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not observe the delay of neuronal migration in either the Hsf1 KO cortices even when under EtOH exposure15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overexpression of Hsp70 did not affect the migration of cortical cells (Supplementary Fig 7b), suggesting that the impaired neuronal migration may be mediated by non-canonical downstream targets of Hsf1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility mechanism may be through controlling the transcription of microtubule-associated molecules such as Dcx, Dclk, p35 and Ndel1 via interaction with Hsf2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, the cortical neurons that have stalled due to the lack of Dcx re-migrate by replenishment of the gene after birth43 while the reduction of Hsf1 activity after birth is not sufficient to reboot this migration (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that genes other than microtubule-associated genes may critically mediate the migrational disruptions resulting from high-level Hsf1 activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other potential downstream target genes may be the genes controlling adherens junction formation which are disturbed by excess activation of Hsf1 (Fig 5).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
