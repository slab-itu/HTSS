Blood coagulation protein fibrinogen promotes autoimmunity and demyelination via chemokine release and antigen presentation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Autoimmunity and macrophage recruitment into the central nervous system (CNS) are critical determinants of neuroinflammatory diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mechanisms that drive immunological responses targeted to the CNS remain largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that fibrinogen, a central blood coagulation protein deposited in the CNS after bloodbrain barrier disruption, induces encephalitogenic adaptive immune responses and peripheral macrophage recruitment into the CNS leading to demyelination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fibrinogen stimulates a unique transcriptional signature in CD11b+ antigen-presenting cells inducing the recruitment and local CNS activation of myelin antigen-specific Th1 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fibrinogen depletion reduces Th1 cells in the multiple sclerosis model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II-dependent antigen presentation, CXCL10- and CCL2-mediated recruitment of T cells and macrophages, respectively, are required for fibrinogen-induced encephalomyelitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibition of the fibrinogen receptor CD11b/CD18 protects from all immune and neuropathologic effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that the final product of the coagulation cascade is a key determinant of CNS autoimmunity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Disruption of the homeostatic balance between the vasculature and the brain is a sustained and often early feature of neurologic diseases and traumatic insults to the central nervous system (CNS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding how bloodbrain barrier (BBB) disruption instigates and amplifies immune and degenerative responses leading to brain pathology and loss of function would be instrumental in the design of novel treatments for neurologic diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fibrinogen (coagulation factor I) is a major component in the blood that upon BBB disruption enters the CNS and is deposited as insoluble fibrin1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although soluble fibrinogen in the bloodstream is not proinflammatory, activation of the coagulation cascade results in the formation of fibrin associated with exposure of cryptic epitopes that transform fibrinogen from a blood factor to a potent activator of innate immunity1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In multiple sclerosis (MS) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), BBB disruption and fibrin deposition are detected in the white matter along with microglial activation before T-cell infiltration and the onset of demyelination2,3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, increased coagulation activity leading to fibrin formation occurs early in neuroinflammation before demyelination4, and is highly upregulated in active MS plaques7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, injection of soluble fibrinogen in the healthy brain results in fibrin formation5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fibrin deposition is abundant not only in early but also active and chronic MS lesions, and correlates with demyelination and T-cell infiltration3,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic or pharmacologic depletion of fibrinogen decreases microglial activation and axonal damage and attenuates neurologic signs in EAE5,7,11,12,13 and other MS models14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While studies in EAE mice support a role for fibrin in the activation of microglia in myelinated areas, its role in the initiation and propagation of myelin-targeted adaptive immune responses is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, despite the vast literature on BBB disruption and activation of the coagulation cascade in brain diseases, there is currently no model of neuroinflammation induced by a coagulation factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we developed a model of coagulation-driven demyelination to directly assess the role of BBB disruption and fibrin in the induction of CNS autoimmunity and demyelination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, introduction of fibrinogen into the healthy CNS was sufficient to induce activation of adaptive immunity targeted to CNS myelin antigens leading to demyelination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of fibrinogen as an initiator of CNS autoimmunity was first substantiated in vivo, where a single stereotactic injection of fibrinogen in the corpus callosum induced recruitment and local differentiation of myelin antigen-specific Th1 cells leading to demyelination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance, endogenous fibrinogen was required for T-helper 1 (Th1) cell activation in EAE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microarray analysis in cell autonomous systems of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) uncovered a unique transcriptional signature for fibrin that links the coagulation cascade with M1-type activation of APCs associated with induction of antigen presentation and release of leukocyte recruiting chemokines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rescue experiments to genetically deplete the fibrin-specific immune responses in APCs demonstrated that secretion of the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) and the C-X-C motif ligand-10 (CXCL10), together with MHC II-dependent antigen presentation, are essential molecular mediators for fibrin-induced autoimmune responses in the CNS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we showed that fibrin induces CNS autoimmune responses not via its prohaemostatic functions, but due to CD11b/CD18 receptor activation in APCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show for the first time that a component of the coagulation cascade induces autoimmunity, attributes the CNS effects of coagulation to the proinflammatory effects of fibrin and introduces fibrinogen-induced encephalomyelitis (FIE) as a novel coagulation-driven, autoimmune-mediated model for the study of novel mechanisms and therapies for brain inflammation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Fibrinogen in the CNS induces inflammatory demyelination', 'To determine whether fibrinogen extravasation is sufficient to induce CNS pathology in vivo, we stereotactically injected fibrinogen at its physiological plasma concentration into the corpus callosum, the largest CNS white matter tract associated with disability in MS16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, this single injection of fibrinogen spontaneously induced local demyelination within 7 days (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microglial activation was rapidly induced 1 day after fibrinogen injection and preceded demyelination (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of innate immunity regulates autoimmune responses including T-cell recruitment and differentiation17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fibrinogen injection induced infiltration of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell populations in the CNS, but not in the spleen (Fig 1a,b;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'This study establishes the fundamental role of the coagulation cascade as a driver of adaptive immune responses and the mechanisms by which extravasation of a blood clotting factor into the brain white matter can induce autoimmunity, demyelination and peripheral macrophage recruitment into the CNS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that fibrin, the final product of the coagulation cascade, constitutes a sustained, non-diffusible and geographically constrained immunological molecular switch that triggers the inopportune local activation of resident APCs to induce the proliferation, recruitment and local activation of myelin antigen-specific Th1 cells in the CNS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The introduction of fibrinogen in myelinated areas in the healthy CNS led to the four major findings (Fig 8d): (i) fibrinogen leakage in the CNS is a major plasma protein that induces CNS autoimmune responses and demyelination; (ii) fibrinogen is a key inducer of recruitment of both encephalitogenic T cells and peripheral macrophages into the CNS via CXCL10 and CCL2 chemokine secretion, respectively; (iii) activation of the coagulation cascade in the CNS favours Th1-cell differentiation via fibrin-induced upregulation of IL-12; and (iv) the effects of coagulation to CNS autoimmunity are primarily due to the proinflammatory, CD11b-mediated effects of fibrin, thus dissecting the beneficial prohaemostatic roles of coagulation from its damaging effects in CNS disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fibrinogen is not only sufficient to induce T-cell activation and demyelination in the healthy CNS, but is also required for T-cell activation after peripheral autoimmune activation as shown on depletion of endogenous fibrinogen in EAE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These new findings, together with our prior studies in EAE showing (i) early activation of coagulation4 and (ii) reduction of neurological signs, microglial activation, demyelination and axonal damage on fibrinogen depletion5,11,14, bolster the significance of coagulation activity in the development of neuroinflammatory lesions and establish fibrinogen as a key component of the coagulation cascade with pleiotropic functions in CNS innate and adaptive immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In EAE, T cells enter the CNS after local activation by perivascular macrophages at the leptomeninges and their initial local CNS activation determines the clinical outcome of the autoimmune response18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fibrin is localized in the leptomeninges at EAE pre-onset and induces early perivascular clustering of microglia and meningeal macrophages5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in marmoset EAE early BBB leakage is associated with perivascular inflammatory cuffing and parenchymal microglial activation, but precedes demyelination6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is possible that within the CNS fibrin functions as an instructive signal enabling antigen-presenting properties in resident perivascular macrophages and thus facilitating T-cell entry, proliferation and activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MOG3555 tetramer binding in the cervical lymph nodes (Fig 4b) and MOG3555-induced BrdU incorporation (Fig 4c) demonstrate the presence of functional autoreactive myelin antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in C57BL/6 mice injected with fibrinogen in the corpus callosum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies will characterize the responses of T cells to other myelin antigens of not only C57BL/6 mice, but also in the CNS and draining lymph nodes of other mouse strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since interactions of T cells with APCs also continue during the peak of EAE18, fibrin-induced activation of autoimmune responses might play a role not only at the onset but also for the amplification and perpetuation of the autoimmune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Strikingly, our study shows that extravascular fibrinogen induces a transcriptional program of immune effectorcell activation and recruitment that links innate with adaptive immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upregulation of CXCL10 and IL-12p40, two immune modulators involved in T-cell recruitment and Th1-cell differentiation, occurs before the infiltration of peripheral leukocytes, suggesting that fibrinogen-induced activation of CNS innate immunity appears to be a primary pathogenic event that precedes T-cell entry into the CNS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since CCL2-dependent recruitment of peripheral monocytes is required for antigen-specific Th1 immune responses26, fibrin-induced recruitment of peripheral monocytes might contribute to Th1-cell differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the fibrin-induced IL-20p40 expression in both microglia and BMDMs observed here suggests that both resident and peripheral CD11b+ innate immune cells can be activated by fibrin to enable autoimmune responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, an attractive scenario based on the present findings is that weakening of the BBB either by peripheral brain autoimmune response or by exposure to high-risk environmental factor(s) that weaken the BBB, such as systemic inflammation and infection, extravascular fibrin deposition and activation of coagulation in the CNS might be key upstream signals for the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The time-course study in Ccr2RFP/+Cx3cr1GFP/+ mice showed that the primary effect of fibrinogen is on the resident GFP+ microglia and secondarily on the peripheral RFP+ macrophages (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, morphologic changes in GFP-expressing microglia occur as early as 1 day after fibrinogen injection, while RFP-expressing macrophages are not detected in the CNS until 3 days after fibrinogen injection (Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, increased chemokine gene expression in the corpus callosum is detected as early as 12 h after fibrinogen injection (Fig 2a), before the infiltration of peripheral macrophages (Fig 6a) and T cells (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, pharmacologic inhibition of CD11b in the CNS by intracerebroventricular delivery of M1/70 reduced chemokine expression and decreased peripheral macrophage infiltration (Fig 8b,c), further suggesting that microglia are the primary cell target of fibrinogen in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD11b/CD18 is expressed in microglia and macrophages and regulates myelin phagocytosis11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that CD11b/CD18 engagement of extravascular fibrinogen induces activation of APC properties in innate immune cells in a hierarchical manner, first by activating microglia and then peripheral macrophages after they enter the CNS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since peripheral macrophages enter into the CNS in neurodegenerative diseases associated with BBB and fibrin deposition, such as stroke and Alzheimers disease47, fibrinogen might stimulate the recruitment of peripheral macrophages into the CNS in a wide spectrum of neurological diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We established FIE as a novel experimental setting for exploring the cascade of pathogenic events that directly follow from the leakage of plasma proteins in the white matter in the absence of pre-existing peripheral immune activation or myelin pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We selected stereotactic delivery of fibrinogen as it is a common experimental method in viral- and toxin-induced demyelination48, as well as in established neurodegeneration models, such as kainic acid injection in the hippocampus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, stereotactic delivery evades any complexities associated with the imposed genetic expression, assembly and processing of all three chains of fibrinogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FIE could be used to dissect the contribution of BBB disruption and the coagulation cascade in the CNS without the confounding factors of pre-existing viral, cytokine, toxin or autoimmune events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given its rapid 7-day disease course, FIE could also be used as a pharmacodynamic model to rapidly test the efficacy of novel treatments for inhibiting CNS-targeted innate and adaptive immune responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using albumin, kininogen and plasma derived from Fib/ and Fib377-395 mice, we show that fibrinogen is a major protein in the blood that drives sustained neuroinflammatory responses in the CNS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that in addition to fibrinogen, other plasma proteins might play a role in brain pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, other components of the coagulation cascade involved in fibrin formation and clot stabilization, such as thrombin, factors X, XII and XIII could be involved in inflammatory responses49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies will elucidate the relative contribution of blood proteins to brain inflammation and neurodegeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study demonstrates that fibrinogen induces demyelination using myelin-specific antibodies and histological stains that clearly show myelin loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Demyelination can be associated with axonal damage in MS and Alzheimers disease50,51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies will show whether fibrinogen-induced demyelination is primary associated with preservation of axons, or whether it is accompanied by axonal damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results may have broad implications for the potential development of new therapeutic strategies for neuroinflammatory diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of CD11b+ resident CNS cells appear to be one of the earliest events leading to local CNS antigen presentation, amplification of myelin-reactive T-cell responses, infiltration of peripheral macrophages and axonal damage5,17,53,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since CD11b/CD18 is a pleiotropic receptor55, specific inhibition of its pathogenic ligand fibrinogen would be a preferred upstream therapeutic strategy for suppressing the pathogenic cascade in neuroinflammation over any global inhibition of CD11b/CD18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selective disruption of CD11b/CD18fibrinogen interface would also be expected to protect the brain from axonal damage and neurodegeneration5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, targeting the interaction of fibrinogen with CD11b would not affect the beneficial functions of fibrinogen in haemostasis1,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since activation of innate immunity is a hallmark of neuroimmune and neurodegenerative diseases, inhibiting the interaction of fibrinogen with CD11b/CD18 could be beneficial not only for suppressing autoimmunity, but also halting neurodegeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identification of extravascular fibrinogen as a key regulator of CNS innate and adaptive immunity might allow us to develop novel therapies targeting early and late events in neuroinflammatory diseases and potentially provide new treatment options.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
