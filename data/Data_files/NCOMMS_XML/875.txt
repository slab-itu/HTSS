Proteogenomic integration reveals therapeutic targets in breast cancer xenografts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Recent advances in mass spectrometry (MS) have enabled extensive analysis of cancer proteomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we employed quantitative proteomics to profile protein expression across 24 breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Integrated proteogenomic analysis shows positive correlation between expression measurements from transcriptomic and proteomic analyses; further, gene expression-based intrinsic subtypes are largely re-capitulated using non-stromal protein markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteogenomic analysis also validates a number of predicted genomic targets in multiple receptor tyrosine kinases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, several protein/phosphoprotein events such as overexpression of AKT proteins and ARAF, BRAF, HSP90AB1 phosphosites are not readily explainable by genomic analysis, suggesting that druggable translational and/or post-translational regulatory events may be uniquely diagnosed by MS. Drug treatment experiments targeting HER2 and components of the PI3K pathway supported proteogenomic response predictions in seven xenograft models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study demonstrates that MS-based proteomics can identify therapeutic targets and highlights the potential of PDX drug response evaluation to annotate MS-based pathway activities.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Profiling of somatic alteration by next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) has entered clinical practice with the promise of rapid diagnosis of druggable somatic genomic alterations for personalized cancer treatment1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, recent analysis of 4,068 samples from 16 cancer types suggested that repurposing approved drugs based on genomic alterations could provide individualized treatment options for around 40% of tumours3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, clinical evidence for this proposition is limited and has been slow to develop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, the signalling and biological effects of somatic mutations are not routinely determined in human tumour samples even though this is a consideration for rational drug design, response prediction and target prioritization4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, druggable genomic alterations are not detected in the majority of cases tested by NGS3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comprehensive proteomic analyses provide a potentially valuable approach to validate genomic findings as likely biological drivers and to discover discover opportunities for targeted treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) in immunodeficient mice maintain the histological and molecular heterogeneity of the progenitor human tumour6 and cytotoxic drug responsiveness is often a transplantable phenotype7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our previous studies have shown that breast tumour PDXs recapitulate major genomic signatures and transcriptome profiles of their original breast tumours8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, drug responses to endocrine therapy in breast cancer PDXs resembled that observed in the corresponding patient and endocrine therapy resistance patterns were associated with aberrations in the ESR1 gene6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While comprehensive proteomic characterization of PDX is still lacking, recent studies using reverse phase protein array have identified similar protein profiles between PDX and primary tumours10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies collectively suggest that the PDX approach is a potentially valuable preclinical model for identification and testing of therapeutic targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recent advances in mass-spectrometry provide an unprecedented opportunity for antibody-independent proteome profiling with approximately 80% of all proteins in major human tissues quantifiable by this technique12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses of the global proteome in tandem with genomic profiles generated through TCGA have yielded key insights on the molecular etiology of colorectal cancer13, breast cancer14 and ovarian cancer15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our recent proteogenomic characterization of 105 human breast cancers linked 5q-loss to elevated EGFR expression and identified overexpression of phosphorylated kinases including CDK12, PAK1 and ARAF as potential biological drivers14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, current proteogenomic analyses of human tissues are limited by the fact that therapeutic hypotheses were not being addressed in these initial analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As patient treatments were heterogeneous, links between treatment and proteogenomic findings are difficult to establish in banked tumour specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PDX system therefore provides an early opportunity to determine whether a proteogenomic approach can produce more robust therapeutic hypotheses and predictive biomarkers for individual patients than that achieved by genomic analysis alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we generated high-coverage proteome and phosphoproteome data for 24 PDX models representing different breast cancer subtypes using both isobaric mass-tag labelling and label-free proteomic methods for cross-validated identification of 12,794 proteins and 56,874 phosphorylation sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After filtering for observation in at least 10 out of 24 samples 10,069 proteins and 36,609 phosphorylation sites with their relative abundances quantified across tumours, were used in subsequent analyses in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A substantial number of druggable protein/phosphoprotein events were uniquely identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, similar proteomic/phosphoproteomic signatures were observed in patient breast cancer samples indicating potential clinical relevance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In selected PDX models exhibiting proteomic and/or phosphoproteomic up-regulation events of HER2 or the PI3K pathway, we validated the efficacy of targeted inhibitors in suppressing PDX growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these observations show that comprehensive proteogenomic profiling has potential to identify new targets for individualized treatment approaches in cancer.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Proteogenomic coverage of breast cancer xenografts', 'We selected 24 PDX models established from primary or metastatic breast tumours for comprehensive proteogenomic characterization (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The human patient cohort was composed of 10 basal, 1 claudin-low (CLDN-low), 9 luminal B and 4 HER2-enriched (HER2-E) breast tumours based on PAM50 expression subtyping (Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conducted DNA and RNA sequencing respectively for 23 PDX models and in one case Sanger DNA sequencing of hotspot mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isotope Tagging for Relative and Absolute Quantitation (iTRAQ 4-plex)16 was completed for all 24 PDXs for discovery and label-free quantification (LFQ) for 18 PDXs for validation and confirmation (Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comprehensive proteogenomic coverage allowed us to systematically assess the somatic mutation profile, copy-number variation (CNV), mRNA expression, protein expression, and phosphosite levels and localizations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Modelling human breast cancer with patient-derived xenografts (n=24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Illustration of generation and proteogenomic characterization of breast cancer xenograft models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Somatic mutations of significantly mutated genes of human breast tumour were recapitulated in xenograft models.

represents one xenograft sample.Full size image', 'We examined somatic mutations in significantly mutated genes of breast cancer in 12 human tumours and their matching PDXs (Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most key somatic mutations in these genes were preserved (Fig 1b), validating the genomic fidelity of these PDX models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recurrent breast cancer mutations were not detected in two PDX models (WHIM17 and WHIM46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While sequencing data were not available for the matched progenitor human tumours, the germline SNPs of human blood normal samples matched with the PDX tumours, validating their patients of origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Follow-up histological and RNA-seq analyses suggested WHIM17 and WHIM46 are EBV-positive human lymphoproliferative cells arising in the NOD/SCID/ mouse strain17 (Methods, Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We then compared the variant allele fractions (VAFs) of exonic somatic mutations in human tumours and derived xenografts when both are available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found comparable or higher VAFs in xenografts, potentially due to higher tumour purity and selection of some mutant alleles by loss of heterozygosity in PDX models (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relatively high, positive VAF correlation (R=0.66) implied similarity between human samples and their respective xenografts, consistent with our previous report9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, all PIK3CA and TP53 somatic mutations in the 12 originating human tumours were detected in respective xenografts with comparable or increased VAFs (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the 22 breast cancer PDX models, 14, including 7 of the 8 basal tumours, harboured TP53 mutations, 5 luminal B PDXs had ESR1 mutations, and 5 luminal B and 1 CLDN-low xenografts carried PIK3CA mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We quantified mRNA expression of 16,209 unique human genes from RNA-seq data for these 24 models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also applied two distinct MS data acquisition approaches (Supplementary Fig 2a, Methods), iTRAQ (Supplementary Data 3) and LFQ (Supplementary Data 4), to quantify the expression ratios of 12,794 human proteins (11,879 genes) and 8,648 proteins (8,035 genes), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 56,874 phosphosites were also confidently identified using iTRAQ (Supplementary Data 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After filtering for observation in at least 10 out of 24 samples (4 out of 9 of the iTRAQ experiments, Supplementary Fig 3), the relative abundances of 10,069 proteins and 36,609 phosphorylation sites were quantified across tumours by iTRAQ and used in subsequent analyses in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The technical replicates in the LFQ (WHIM2 and WHIM16) and the iTRAQ (WHIM13) sets showed high correlation in protein expression levels (R greater than 0.85, Supplementary Fig 2b,c,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, phosphosite expressions also showed high correlations in technical replicates (WHIM13) of the iTRAQ experiment (R=0.82, Supplementary Fig 2d), validating the technical reproducibility of our proteomic and phosphoproteomic datasets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, while iTRAQ and LFQ quantification were conducted separately and based on different features of the LCMS data collected from the Q Exactive mass spectrometer (that is, reporter ion intensity and MS1 peak area, respectively), our analysis showed reasonable correlation between the two measurements after normalization (R=0.61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two datasets utilizing the same PDX models but different workflows enabled cross-method validation of global proteomic results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Proteogenomic integration and comparison', 'We first evaluated the correlation between mRNA expression and protein abundance measurements from the iTRAQ experiment (Fig 2a) for these 24 PDX models: 83.6% of the genes with sufficient data showed positive correlations with a median Pearson R=0.536 (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigated whether the trend of mRNA-protein correlations were associated with specific KEGG pathways18, finding that metabolic pathways involved in house-keeping functions are enriched for genes showing high, positive correlation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, genes in the glutathione metabolism pathway showed the highest enrichment for positive correlations (KolmogorovSmirnov test, false discovery rate (FDR)=5.6e-07).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we observed that genes in the ribosome (FDR less_than 2.2e-16), spliceosome (FDR=2.0e-13), RNA transport (FDR=1.7e-5), RNA polymerase (FDR=1.8e-4), and oxidative phosphorylation (FDR less_than 2.2e-16) pathways showed relatively lower correlation between mRNA and protein level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These pathways were enriched for genes that do not require translated proteins for their biological functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar pathway-specific pattern of positive and negative enrichment of correlations were observed by LFQ (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high degree of mRNAprotein correlation observed in the PDX samples is consistent with recent results obtained for human breast tumours14 and colorectal cancer13, suggesting that PDXs closely mimic the respective human breast tumours in their relationship between mRNA and protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Proteogenomic correlation analysis in PDX samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Correlation between mRNA and iTRAQ protein expression levels identified pathways with significantly concordant or discordant mRNA-protein expressions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

associated pathway, and each bar represents one gene in the pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Proteogenomic summary of xenograft shows relationships among mutation, CNV (normalized log-R ratio), mRNA

visualization.Full size image', 'We then examined the correlation of CNV, mRNA, and protein expression levels for several key genes for breast cancer biology: EGFR, ERBB2 (HER2), ESR1, GATA3, PGR, PIK3CA, AKT1/2/3, MTOR and TP53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most cases, we observed consistent relationships between CNV, mRNA, and protein expression levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with PDXs of non-luminal subtypes, luminal B breast cancer xenografts, as expected, showed higher mRNA and protein expression of ESR1 and PGR, consistent with their positive ER and PR status (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five out of the six PIK3CA mutations were observed in luminal B PDXs, which tended to also show higher mRNA and protein expression levels of GATA3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, a larger proportion of basal PDXs expressed higher protein levels of EGFR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strong HER2 expression at the mRNA, protein and phosphoprotein levels were detected in WHIM8 and WHIM35, both derived from HER2-positive breast cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall expression patterns for key genes were consistent with the clinical subtype diagnosis across CNV, mRNA, protein and phosphosite analyses (Supplementary Fig 6).

has treatment implications19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, transcriptome clustering based on PAM50 genes from RNA-seq data largely reproduced intrinsic subtypes of the breast tumours (Fig 3a; Supplementary Data 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore proteomic and phosphoproteomic subtype classifications in xenograft models, we conducted unsupervised clustering of proteomes and phosphoproteomes of the 24 xenograft samples based upon the top 436 variably expressed proteins showing a s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  greater than 2 from the iTRAQ proteome (Supplementary Data 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two distinct clusters emerged: one contained all basal tumours and the only CLDN-low tumour (WHIM12), while the other included all luminal B and HER2-E breast tumours; HER2-E tumours did not show a proteomic expression profile distinct from luminal B samples (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clustering analysis using the same gene markers from the transcriptome (Supplementary Fig 7a) and the LFQ proteome (Supplementary Fig 7b; Supplementary Data 8) further supported the separation into these two proteomic subtypes, although the minor differences between the transcriptome and the proteome clustering suggested distinctions between mRNA and protein levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proteomic subtypes defined by the top 968 most variably expressed mouse host proteins did not segregate based on luminal and basal subtypes (Supplementary Fig 8; Supplementary Data 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides differing in mRNA expression, luminal and basal breast cancer PDXs also showed consistently distinct proteomic expression profiles, supporting their distinct biological origins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Transcriptomic and proteomic clustering of breast cancer PDX and human samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a)

human breast tumour samples (n=77) cluster based on their subtypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The non-differentially expressed proteins were identified through a t-test with FDR greater than 0.3 between the PDX and the TCGA human tumour samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PDX tumours are labelled by their WHIM IDs whereas the human tumours are not labelled.Full size image', 'We then utilized the iTRAQ phosphopeptide expression data to infer phosphoproteomic subtypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1,737 unique phosphosites with s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  greater than 2.5 were included to conduct hierarchical clustering (Fig 3c; Supplementary Data 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These analyses of the phosphoproteomic data produced two major clusters segregating the luminal B and basal subtypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, the WHIM37/WHIM47/WHIM26 group and the WHIM17/WHIM46 group, as observed in the proteome clustering, grouped closely together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene and protein expression of lymphoid lineage markers showed high expression of CD20 and JAK3 in WHIM17 and WHIM46 (Methods, Supplementary Fig 9), consistent with their positive EBV status and histological diagnosis (Supplementary Fig 1) as human lymphoproliferative cells arising in an immunocompromised mouse background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, while the basal and luminal clusters remain consistent, the hierarchical distances between PDX samples within the two major clusters differ between data types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The departure of proteomic and phosphoproteome subtypes from mRNA expression-defined subtypes suggests independent layers of molecular heterogeneity provided by distinct proteomic analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We then investigated whether human proteomic subtypes could be recapitulated in PDX models by including an additional 77 proteomes from TCGA human tumours that were processed concurrently in the iTRAQ experiment14 (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To reduce clustering bias imbued by the mouse contribution to the proteome in the PDX samples, we excluded proteins showing differential expression between human tumour and xenograft (t-test, FDR0.3) (Supplementary Data 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional requirements, including the presence of detectable protein in more than 10 samples and minimum difference of 2 s.d.s in the merged proteome, resulted in 133 proteins qualifying for un-supervised clustering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the subtyping analysis of the 24 PDXs alone, we identified two major clusters: one that included all but one basal breast tumour and the other comprised mostly of luminal tumours (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the proteomic subtypes of the PDX cohorts, luminal tumours and HER-2 tumours did not show clear separation, although several sub-clusters were identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, xenograft proteomes clustered adjacently to the human proteomes of their respective subtypes, validating the fidelity of basal and luminal proteomic signatures discovered in PDXs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To search for defining markers between the basal and luminal B subtypes, we conducted differential expression analysis between the PDXs of the respective subtypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found several proteomic markers that were differentially expressed in both the LFQ and iTRAQ datasets (t-test, FDR0.05), including SPR, GSTP1 and SERPINB5

expression (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The basal subtype breast tumours were up-regulated in most of the significantly differentially-expressed pathways (FDR0.01) identified by both LFQ and iTRAQ datasets, including extracellular matrix organization, cell cycle, and collagen formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison, the luminal B breast tumours showed higher expression in genes related to organelle biogenesis and membrane trafficking (Supplementary Data 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Activated pathways revealed by phosphorylation profiles', 'Cancer driving somatic events trigger major changes in downstream signalling to launch the tumorigenic cascade22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To search for tumour-specific activated pathways in PDX tumours, we systematically evaluated and compared phosphoproteome profiles of gene sets from KEGG signalling pathways (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphorylation enrichment analysis identified 12 significantly activated pathways, including Ras, MAPK and NFB signalling, in 4 xenografts (FDR0.01, Supplementary Data 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WHIM9 exhibited elevated phosphorylation of the MAPK signalling pathway (FDR=9.69e-6; Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, WHIM9 carried a recurrent somatic mutation, KRAS p.A146V (refs 23, 24), which may have driven canonical MAPK pathway activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, WHIM12 exhibited activation of the Ras signalling pathway (FDR=4.28e-5), along with an outlier protein expression of MET, a receptor tyrosine kinase upstream of the Ras signalling pathway (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly,

#@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphosite outlier expression events showed a moderate rate of validation in the same human cohort (48.8%, Fig 6c), suggesting its transient nature and potential micro-environmental effects on protein phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, HER2-E and a few HER2-positive luminal B tumours carried outliers in HER2 phosphosites including p.T701, p.T1240 and p.Y1248.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ARAF phosphosite outliers, such as p.S299, were found in both human and PDX samples, validating our previous finding in the human cohort12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we identified outlier phosphosites in genes not previously implicated in breast cancer through genomic profiles, such as BRAF p.S447, p.S750 and HSP90AB1 p.Y56 and p.S169 (Fig 6c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrated that proteomic outlier events, like genomic driver mutations, are consistently observed in PDXs and human tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some protein outlier events might represent proteomic drivers of tumorigenesis and therefore potential drug targets in breast tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Targeted treatments using breast cancer xenograft models', 'To validate the identified druggable events, we conducted treatment experiments targeting HER2 and PI3K pathways on selected PDX models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four PDX models were chosen to address HER2 targeting using lapatinib, an oral HER2 kinase inhibitor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include 2 HER2-E PDX models WHIM8 and WHIM35, both with high HER2 protein and phosphoprotein expression, and 2 low HER2 expressing, basal-like PDX models WHIM6 and WHIM14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blotting suggested high HER2 expression and phosphorylation of HER2 p.Y1248 in both HER2 positive tumours, WHIM8 and WHIM35 (Fig 7a; Supplementary Fig 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, high levels of HER2 p.Y1248 phosphorylation was also detected in WHIM14 by western blotting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast MS-based phosphoproteomics also detected high levels of HER2p.Y1248 in WHIM8 and WHIM35, but not in WHIM14, which was more consistent with the known biology of the models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibody-based diagnosis of HER2 activation in WHIM14 was possibly due to cross-reaction of the Y1248 antibody with the pY1172 site of EGFR that bears high sequence similarity around the pY residue (..GTPTAENPEy1248LGLDVPV-CO2H vs...GSTAENAEy1172LRVAPQ..,

#@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, WHIM14 also showed significant reduction in tumour growth by lapatinib (P=4.3e-3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon further exploration with a lower, clinically achievable dose of lapatinib for chronic treatment (30 mg kg1 compared with 220 mg kg1 in the previous experiment) over 48 days, significant but weak tumour growth inhibition was again achieved (P=0.0311, Supplementary

of WHIM14 to lapatinib was likely due to inhibition of EGFR not HER2 (refs 28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While WHIM6 also showed elevated EGFR protein level, WHIM14 showed notably higher EGFR phosphorylation based on both mass spectrometry (Fig 2b) and western blotting (Fig 7a), which could account for their different response to lapatinib.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two basal and one HER2-E human

of triple-negative breast cancer34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the combinatorial treatment achieved the greatest effect in WHIM18 and WHIM20 (P less_than 2.2e-16 for both comparisons).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While neither PI3K nor mTOR inhibitor drug treatment alone suppressed tumour growth in WHIM20 completely, the combination of both PI3K and mTOR inhibitors significantly reduced tumour growth to a nearly static state (Fig 7d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our proteomic characterization, WHIM20 exhibited the strongest AKT1 and AKT2 protein expression, as well as AKT1 p.S122 and p.S475

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Breast cancer has been traditionally characterized in the clinic through hormone receptor status and selected genes expressions20,36, and more recently by genomic sequencing3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, druggable genomic driver events are detectable in only a limited percentage of patients3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the majority of drugs target proteins, a systematic evaluation of breast cancer proteomes would seem ultimately to be necessary for selecting targeted treatment and predicting drug response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent advances in MS-based proteomics allow extensive and quantitative surveys of the global proteome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we have systematically analyzed proteogenomic profiles of 22 patient-derived breast cancer xenografts and 2 EBV-positive lymphoproliferations that are likely artifacts of engraftment of human lymphocytes into NSG mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This study shows that proteogenomic signatures of PDXs resemble most findings from breast cancer patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While some discrepancies exist, we established a normalization strategy at both the genomic and proteomic levels that enabled direct comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PDX tumours recapitulated the proteomic diversity of human breast cancers (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also identified multiple druggable targets for each tumour model (Fig 6; Supplementary Data 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteomic events validated a significant number of CNV or mRNA up-regulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, HER2 protein and phosphosite outlier expression was observed in HER2-E WHIM8 and WHIM35 (Fig 5), which were effectively treated using lapatinib (Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we also identified overexpressed proteomic events not evident in the genomic level in both PDX and human samples, including outlier protein expression of EGFR, and outlier phosphosite expressions of ARAF, BRAF, HSP90AB1, PTPN11 and TOP2A (Fig 6), highlighting potential new treatment opportunities in breast cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the two PDX models subsequently diagnosed as EBV-positive lymphoproliferations, we observed outlier BTK expression (Fig 6) and activation of the NFB pathway (Fig 4), validating BTK as a druggable target in EBV+ lymphomas37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While more than 80% of the proteomic outlier events in PDX were also found in human tumours, a lessor 48.8% of phosphosite outlier events were validated, potentially due to different tumour micro-environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, transient phosphoproteomic events identified in PDX tumours would likely require further verification in their corresponding primary tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Outlier protein expression events can likely lead to downstream pathway activation, such as MET outlier protein expression (Fig 6) and activated Ras pathway observed in WHIM12 (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While genomic analysis has utilized mutual occurrence or exclusivity in patient cohorts to deduce pathway relationships, phosphorylation profile analyses allowed us to directly interrogate signalling in these established pathways in a single sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our pathway activation results suggest these events may be crucial to tumorigenesis and that some are likely the proteomic smoking guns that originally triggered the oncogeneic cascade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Roughly 77% of breast tumours showed alterations in the PI3K-AKT signalling pathway, representing a potentially important path forward for drug-based treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, genomic alterations of PI3K pathway components have not shown themselves to predict treatment responsiveness to PI3K pathway inhibitors32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we defined complementary druggable targets of the pathway using proteogenomic analysis, including several events of a co-occurring PIK3CA mutation or copy-number amplification, and AKT protein outlier expression coupled by elevated AKT phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In two such breast tumours, we successfully inhibited tumour growth using a combination of PI3K and MTOR inhibitors (Fig 7c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While these results show potential functional implications, additional, systematic treatment experiments are required to validate the identified proteomic druggable targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, this initial work using proteogenomic integration coupled with patient-derived xenograft validation, has demonstrated a strategy that, in principle, may enable more accurate prediction of the efficacy of mechanism-based cancer therapeutics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

target-decoy based FDR estimates to apply score threshold criteria via two-step strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the whole proteome datasets thresholding was done at the spectral and protein levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the phosphoproteome datasets thresholding was done at the spectral level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In step 1, peptide autovalidation was done first and separately for each iTRAQ 4-plex experiment consisting of either 25 LCMS/MS runs (whole proteome) or 13 LCMS/MS runs (phosphoproteome) using an auto thresholds strategy with a minimum sequence length of 7(whole proteome) or 8 (phosphoproteome), automatic variable range precursor mass filtering, and score and delta Rank1Rank2 score thresholds optimized to yield a spectral level FDR estimate for precursor charges 2 through 4 of  less_than 0.6% for each precursor charge state in each LCMS/MS run.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For precursor charges 56, thresholds were optimized to yield a spectral level FDR estimate of  less_than 0.3% across all runs per iTRAQ 4-plex experiment (instead of each run), to achieve reasonable statistics, since many fewer spectra are generated for the higher charge states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In step 2 for the whole proteome datasets, protein polishing autovalidation was applied separately to each iTRAQ 4-plex experiment to further filter the PSMs using a target protein-level FDR threshold of zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primary goal of this step was to eliminate peptides identified with low scoring peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) that represent proteins identified by a single peptide, so-called one-hit wonders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After assembling protein groups from the autovalidated PSMs, protein polishing determined the maximum protein level score of a protein group that consisted entirely of distinct peptides estimated to be false-positive identifications (PSMs with negative delta forward-reverse scores).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PSMs were removed from the set obtained in the initial peptide-level autovalidation step if they contributed to protein groups that have protein scores below the max false-positive protein score.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the filtered results each identified protein detected in an iTRAQ 4-plex experiment was comprised of multiple peptides unless a single excellent scoring peptide was the sole match.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the whole proteome datasets the above criteria yielded FDR of  less_than 0.5% at the peptide-spectrum match level and  less_than 0.8% at the distinct peptide level for each iTRAQ 4-plex experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After assembling proteins with all the PSMs from all the iTRAQ 4-plex experiments together the aggregate FDR estimates were 0.42% at the at the peptide-spectrum match level, 1.5% at the distinct peptide level, and  less_than 0.01% (1/11,372) at the protein group level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the protein level FDR estimate neither explicitly required a minimum number of distinct peptides per protein nor adjusted for the number of possible tryptic peptides per protein, it may underestimate false positive protein identifications for large proteins observed only on the basis of multiple low scoring PSMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In calculating scores at the protein level and reporting the identified proteins, redundancy was addressed in the following manner: the protein score was the sum of the scores of distinct peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A distinct peptide was the single highest scoring instance of a peptide detected through an MS/MS spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MS/MS spectra for a particular peptide may have been recorded multiple times, (that is, as different precursor charge states, in adjacent bRP fractions, modified by deamidation at Asn or oxidation of Met, or different phosphosite localization) but were still counted as a single distinct peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a peptide sequence  greater than 8 residues long was contained in multiple protein entries in the sequence database, the proteins were grouped together and the highest scoring one and its accession number were reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some cases when the protein sequences were grouped in this manner there were distinct peptides that uniquely represented a lower scoring member of the group (isoforms, family members, and different species).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of these instances spawned a subgroup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple subgroups were reported and counted towards the total number of proteins, and were given related protein subgroup numbers (for example, 3.1 and 3.2: group 3, subgroups 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To better dissect the tumour/stroma (human/mouse) origin of orthologous proteins in this xenograft experiment, the inclusion of peptides contributing to each subgroup was restricted by enabling the subgroup-specific (SGS) option in Spectrum Mill.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only subgroup-specific peptide sequences were counted toward each subgroups count of distinct peptides and protein level TMT quantitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SGS option omits peptides that are shared between subgroups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If evidence for BOTH human and mouse peptides from an orthologous protein were observed, then peptides that cannot distinguish the two (shared) were ignored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the peptides shared between species were retained if there was specific evidence for only one of the species, thus yielding a single subgroup attributed to only the single species consistent with the specific peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, if all peptides observed for a protein group were shared between species, thus yielding a single subgroup composed of indistinguishable species, then all peptides were retained (the column in Supplementary Data 3 numSpeciesPresentR1 will have a value of 2 in such cases).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assembly of confidently identified PSMs yielded 20,480 total protein subgroups from 11,372 protein groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human and mouse ortholog proteins were typically arranged into individual subgroups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In step 2 for the phosphoproteome datasets a phosphosite table were assembled with columns for individual iTRAQ 4-plex experiments and rows for individual phosphosites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PSMs were combined into a single row for all non-conflicting observations of a particular phosphosite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (that is, different missed cleavage forms, different precursor charges, confident and ambiguous localizations, different sample handling modifications).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For related peptides neither observations with a different number of phosphosites nor different confident localizations were allowed to be combined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selecting the representative peptide from the combined observations was done such that once confident phosphosite localization was established, higher identification scores and longer peptide lengths are preferable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After assembling the phosphosite table a polishing step was applied to further filter the phosphosites with the primary goal of eliminating phosphosites with representative peptides identified through low scoring peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) that were observed in only a few experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial table of representative peptides for 82,030 phosphosites had an aggregate FDR of 3.3% at phosphosite-level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The table was sorted by identification score and then by number of iTRAQ 4-plex experiments in which the phosphosite was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cumulative FDR trend showed inflection points at an identification score of 8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphosites with an identification score less_than 8.0 observed in  less_than 3/9 experiments were therefore removed, yielding 68,385 phosphosites with an aggregate FDR of 0.34% at the phosphosite level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the Spectrum Mill identification score is based on the number of matching peaks, their ion type assignment, and the relative height of unmatched peaks, the phosphosite localization score is the difference in identification score between the top two localizations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The score threshold for confident localization ( greater than 1.1) essentially corresponds to at least 1 b or y ion located between two candidate sites that has a peak height 10% of the tallest fragment ion (neutral losses of phosphate from the precursor and related ions as well as immonium and iTRAQ reporter ions are excluded from the relative height calculation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ion type scores for b-H3PO4, y-H3PO4, b-H2O, and y-H2O ion types are all set to 0.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This prevents inappropriate confident localization assignment when a spectrum lacks primary b or y ions between two possible sites but contains ions that can be assigned as either phosphate loss ions for one localization or water loss ions for another localization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In aggregate, 66.3% of the reported phosphosites were fully localized to a particular serine, threonine, or tyrosine residue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Relative abundances of proteins and phosphosites were determined in Spectrum Mill using iTRAQ reporter ion intensity ratios from each PSM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A protein-level or phosphosite-level iTRAQ ratio was calculated as the median of all PSM level ratios contributing to a protein subgroup or phosphosite remaining after excluding those PSMs lacking an iTRAQ label, having a negative delta forward-reverse score (half of all false-positive identifications), or having a precursor ion purity less_than 50% (MS/MS has significant precursor isolation contamination from co-eluting peptides).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unless stated otherwise for a particular analysis, the following considerations apply to the tumour/stroma (human/mouse) origin of a protein in this xenograft experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the proteome dataset, only PSMs from subgroup-specific peptide sequences contributed to the protein level quantitation (see protein subgrouping description above).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A protein detected with all contributing PSMs shared between human and mouse was considered to be human.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the phosphoproteome dataset, a phosphosite was considered to be mouse if the contributing PSMs were distinctly mouse and human if they were either distinctly human or shared between human and mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 2-component Gaussian mixture model-based normalization approach was used to centre the distribution of iTRAQ log-ratios around zero to nullify the effect of differential
