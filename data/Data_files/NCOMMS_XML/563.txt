N-type organic electrochemical transistors with stability in water  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are receiving significant attention due to their ability to efficiently transduce biological signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A major limitation of this technology is that only p-type materials have been reported, which precludes the development of complementary circuits, and limits sensor technologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report the first ever n-type OECT, with relatively balanced ambipolar charge transport characteristics based on a polymer that supports both hole and electron transport along its backbone when doped through an aqueous electrolyte and in the presence of oxygen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This new semiconducting polymer is designed specifically to facilitate ion transport and promote electrochemical doping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stability measurements in water show no degradation when tested for 2 h under continuous cycling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This demonstration opens the possibility to develop complementary circuits based on OECTs and to improve the sophistication of bioelectronic devices.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Interest in mixed conduction, as in recent bioelectronic and energy applications, has led to a surge in novel organic electronic materials and devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One characteristic example is an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT), in which ions from an electrolyte penetrate a polymer film and modulate its conductivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, OECTs can efficiently transduce ionic signals into electronic ones, making them ideal biological sensing elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OECTs can be fabricated from biocompatible materials1,2 and operate in aqueous environments, which enables recordings in vivo and in vitro1,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The advantage of OECT-based sensors compared to organic field-effect transistor (OFET)-based sensors is that ions in the former interact with the whole volume of the active material, giving rise to lower impedance and higher transconductance6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the performance of an OECT, defined by the efficiency with which it transduces a voltage modulation at the gate (VG) into a current modulation in the channel (ID), depends on the thickness of the active layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is contrary to OFETs, which rely on the interfacial accumulation of charges and are thus limited by the double layer capacitance5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the transconductance (gm=ID/VG) of OECTs operated in an aqueous environment can reach more than 3.0 mS (refs 3, 7, 8) at low biases, enabling their use in clinical neuroscience applications, including electrocardiography3,9, electroencephalography6,9 or neural stimulation4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The current state-of-the-art active material for OECTs is the conducting polymer blend poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) PEDOT:PSS, where the material is doped in its native state, requiring the OECT to be operated in depletion mode3,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The operation of an OECT in accumulation mode allows for low power consumption devices with high ON/OFF ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of a polythiophene-based polyelectrolyte to operate as an accumulation mode OECT has previously been demonstrated with transconductances of up to 2.0 mS (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intermediate materials, where conducting and semiconducting polymers were blended together, have also been reported11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, however, all reported OECTs have relied on hole transport (p-type), while development of electron transporting (n-type) or ambipolar OECTs has been ignored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such OECTs would allow the development of complementary circuits and will dramatically improve the sophistication of bioelectronics devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the development of appropriate semiconductor materials is a major challenge: It requires that a material be both stable in an aqueous electrolyte, and that it be reversibly reduced and oxidized within the electrochemical window imparted by that electrolyte.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This requires the design of materials that concurrently have a high electron affinity (EA), a low ionization potential and the capacity for facile ion penetration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to their ability to be oxidized and reduced efficiently, these materials should also show high electron and hole mobilities in order to sustain large electronic currents and yield efficient current modulation in an OECT format.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, the electron mobility of n-type polymers has increased rapidly, reaching values of more than 1.0 cm2 V1 s1 in OFETs,12,13,14,15,16,17 thus enabling n-type OECTs operating in accumulation mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While air stable n-type materials for OFETs have been reported18,19, these materials usually degrade when operated in water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this work, we report the first n-type and ambipolar OECT which operates in water and shows a high stability during pulse measurements over 2 h. This work paves the way for the fabrication of OECT complementary circuits.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Materials synthesis', 'The synthetic design for developing n-type OECT materials required a narrow band gap donor acceptor copolymer with polar side chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we focus on the highly electron-deficient 2,6-dibromonaphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic diimide (NDI) monomer which can easily be copolymerized with electron-rich thiophene based co-monomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The synthesis of linear glycol chains with several ethylene glycol repeating units and an amine end-group which is needed for the imide formation is usually time consuming and involves several reaction steps20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present a simple reaction where the NDI monomer gNDI-Br2 (2, Fig 1) with long linear ethylene glycol-based side chains is synthesized in a one-pot reaction from commercial reagents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amino alcohol forms an ester with 2-2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxyacetic acid while the dianhydride 1 is converted to the diimide monomer 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stille polymerization of 2 in chlorobenzene with 5,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2-bithiophene 3b and the (2-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy) analogue 3a with 2 mol% Pd2(dba)3 and P(o-tol)3 was carried out to synthesize polymers p(gNDI-T2) and p(gNDI-gT2), respectively, following a procedure for semiconducting polymers with polar side chains21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solubility of the polymer in polar solvents increases with the amount of glycol side chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polymer p(gNDI-gT2) is soluble in chloroform, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane and dimethylformamide while p(gNDI-T2), with lower glycol side chain density, can only be dissolved in hot 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  End-capping of p(gNDI-gT2) with mono-functionalized thiophenes was performed to remove bromo or organo-tin polymer endgroups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to a low solubility of p(gNDI-T2) in chlorobenzene it was not possible to carry out the end-capping procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecular weight distribution of p(gNDI-gT2) was measured by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) where sequences of (gNDI-gT2)n up to seven repeating units (n=7) were detected (Supplementary Fig 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, 1H NMR end-group analysis yielded an average repeating unit of seven repeating units and is in agreement with the MALDI-TOF measurements (Supplementary Fig 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Monomer and polymer synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) One-pot synthesis of monomer 2 and (b) Stille polymerizations affording p(gNDI-T2) and

oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates in acetonitrile solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of the CV measurements are summarized in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polymer p(gNDI-T2) has an electrochemical bandgap of 1.68 eV and polymer p(gNDI-gT2) of 0.71 eV where the substitution in the 3,3-positions of the bithiophene from a hydrogen atom to a methyl end-capped triethylene glycol chain decreases the ionization potential (IP) from 5.53 to 4.83 eV and increases the EA from 3.85 to 4.12 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thin film UV-Vis-NIR absorption of p(gNDI-T2) and p(gNDI-gT2) is presented in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the solid state, the absorption onset for polymer p(gNDI-gT2) is at 1,550 nm (Supplementary Fig 1) and for p(gNDI-T2) at 817 nm which is consistent with an increased donor strength of the glycol-bithiophene unit compared to bithiophene unit and in agreement with literature22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial UV-Vis spectrum of p(gNDI-gT2) has two absorption peaks, a -* transition located between 350 and 550 nm and a broad absorption band from an intramolecular charge transfer complex (ICT) between 600 and 1,550 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Time-dependent density functional theory calculations at WB97XD/6-31G(d,p) level of theory were carried out to simulate the UV-Vis spectra of both polymers and compare them to the experimental absorption spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar trend for the band gap was found where polymer p(gNDI-gT2) shows an ICT transition at lower energies compared to p(gNDI-gT2) in the gas phase (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2b, the attachment of polar glycol chains at the polymer backbone enables reversible electrochemical switching between the reduced and neutral states in 0.1 M NaCl aqueous solution for both polymers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the reduction (n-type doping process), sodium ions drift into the thin film to stabilize the negative charge on the polymer backbone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of the narrower bandgap polymer p(gNDI-gT2), which has a lower ionization potential, oxidation (p-type doping) takes place at relatively low positive voltages where chloride ions are driven into the film to stabilize the positive charge on the backbone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With these synthetic modifications, we are able to achieve stable redox reactions for the conjugated polymers p(gNDI-T2) and p(gNDI-gT2) in 0.1 M NaCl aqueous solution and also in phosphate-buffered saline solution (Supplementary Fig 11) where the measurements show reversible doping and de-doping over 40 cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, all

9001,100 nm, while the intensity of the initial ICT transition decreases correspondingly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon applying a negative potential during the spectroelectrochemical measurements, electrons are injected into the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the polymers to form a single occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) that enable new optical transitions similar to previously reported doping studies of P(NDI2OD-T2) (Polyera N2200)28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the intensity of the charge transfer complex decreases while new absorption peaks arise from transitions between the HOMO and SOMO or SOMO and higher states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Polymer p(gNDI-T2) shows a similar trend where the changes in absorption occur at slightly higher voltages, resulting from a lower EA of p(gNDI-T2) (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that the n-type doping in aqueous solution only occurs to a certain degree before the polymers decompose, similar to PEDOT:PSS where over-oxidation degrades the material resulting in a lower conductivity30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both polymers presented here, the resulting UV-Vis spectra are convolutions of un-doped and n-type doped polymer absorption bands, and a reversible n-type doping can be observed up to voltages of 0.5 V for p(gNDI-gT2) and 0.8 V for p(gNDI-T2) versus Ag/AgCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Transistor

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A stable operation of an n-type electrolyte gated organic field effect transistor (EGOFET) was already reported where the operational voltage was reduced by changing from a solid state dielectric gated to an electrolyte gated device33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OECT performance, in comparison to EGOFET, relies on a large capacitance in the channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the measurements of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of the polymers in 0.1 M NaCl aqueous solution (Fig 9), it is possible to extract the effective capacitance per unit area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a quantitative means to determine whether doping of the polymer is largely electrostatic (and limited to the polymer/electrolyte interfacetypical of EGOFET34) or whether the doping permeates the thickness of the channel, a defining characteristic of OECTs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A potential was applied to the polymer-coated gold electrode (working electrode (WE)) with respect to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode in 0.1 M NaCl aqueous solution, and the change in impedance was monitored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effective capacitance per unit area of p(gNDI-gT2) is 9.9 × 103 F cm2 at an offset potential of 0.4 V and is more than three orders of magnitude higher than for a P3HT-based EGOFET where a capacitance per area of 36 × 105 F cm2 is measured on gold electrodes (and is relatively insensitive to the applied

presented herein can therefore be categorized as a working OECT, due to the fact that (a) the turn on voltages of the OECT during n- and p-type operation are in agreement with the reduction and oxidation values obtained from CV measurements, (b) bulk electrical doping was verified by spectroelectrochemical measurements, and (c) the ability to store charge extends into the bulk of the film, yielding high capacitance values (with areal capacitances far greater than those of an EGOFET).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In comparing OECTs prepared with p(gNDI-gT2) to those with p(gNDI-T2), it is interesting to note that the material with the higher FET mobility (and tighter -stacking) happens to be the material that did not work as an electrochemical transistor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work has discussed the performance of PEDOT-based OECTs on the grounds of both electronic mobility, and capacity for charge due to electrochemical (de)doping upon ion injection6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The improved energy levels when comparing p(gNDI-gT2) to p(gNDI-T2), mainly a higher EA, allow for a decrease in the turn on voltage for polymer p(gNDI-gT2) and must lead to more facile cation injection/n-type doping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enhanced ion injection is likely facilitated by higher glycol side chain density, and the resulting less densely packed conjugated backbones.

OECT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison to PEDOT:PSS, the volumetric capacitance of p(gNDI-gT2) is one order of magnitude higher6, demonstrating the potential for ethylene glycol chains to become the side chain of choice for OECT materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We demonstrate the successful development of an ambipolar OECT, opening a new direction for n-type conjugated polymers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This

chains, which facilitated electrochemical switching between the reduced, neutral and oxidized states in aqueous solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spectroelectrochemical measurements were carried out to demonstrate high stability for p- and n-type doping in aqueous solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A remarkably stable OECT operation was achieved, where the device was operated for 2 h without degradation.'

'Materials characterization', 'Column chromatography was carried out with silica gel for flash chromatography from VWR Scientific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microwave experiments were performed in a Biotage Initiator V 2.3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV-400 spectrometer at 298 K and are reported in ppm relative to TMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deuterated solvents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on UV-1601 (1,100 nm) and UV-2600 (1,400 nm) UV-VIS Shimadzu UV-Vis spectrometers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electrospray (ESI-TOF) mass spectrometry was performed with a Micromass LCT Premier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MALDI-TOF spectrometry was conducted in negative linear mode on a Micromass MALDImxTOF with trans-2-3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenylidene-malononitrile (DCTB) as the matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Electrochemical characterization', 'Cyclic voltammograms were recorded using an Autolab PGSTAT101 with a standard three-electrode setup with ITO-coated glass slides as the working electrode, a platinum mesh counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode calibrated against ferrocene (Fc/Fc+).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measurements were carried in an anhydrous, degassed 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate TBAPF6 acetonitrile solution or a 0.1 M NaCl aqueous solution as the supporting electrolyte at a scan rate of 100 mV s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the CV measurements in acetonitrile, the glassware was dried at 100 °C and the cell was purged with argon during the measurement to prevent oxygen contamination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ionization potentials were obtained using the equation: IP=(Eox  EFc + 4.8 V).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed with a three-electrode configuration using a potentiostat (Metrohm Autolab) with platinum and Ag/AgCl counter and reference electrodes, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The polymer-coated gold electrode was the working electrode and the electrolyte was a 0.1 M NaCl aqueous solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Effective capacitance was determined from C1/(2fIm(Z)) where f is the frequency, and Z is the complex impedance; this capacitance was confirmed for doped spectra from a fit to a R(R||C) equivalent circuit in order to extract both capacitance per unit area, and C*.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis was performed with Metrohm NOVA software and custom MATLAB tools.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spectroelectrochemical measurements were performed using a PGSTAT101 potentiostat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ITO-coated glass slides with spun cast polymer was used as the working electrode immersed in a cuvette.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A UV-1601 UV-VIS Shimadzu UV-Vis spectrometer was employed with the beam path passing through the cuvette filled with a 0.1 M NaCl aqueous solution and the polymer/ITO/glass sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A background spectrum with the cuvette/electrolyte/ITO/glass was recorded for baseline correction before the experiment was started.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Potential were applied for 5 s before the UV-Vis spectra were recorded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Transistor fabrication and characterization', 'OECTs were fabricated as previously reported8, except that the polymers p(gNDI-T2) and p(gNDI-gT2) were spun cast from chloroform before sacrificial peel off of Parylene C for the dry patterning processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The completed samples were not annealed or treated after deposition, the samples were briefly rinsed in deionized water before testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OECT IV curves (transfer and output), as well as repetitive pulsing were performed with a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit, and custom LabView scripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis was performed with MATLAB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'The authors declare that the data supporting the findings of this study are available within the paper and its supplementary information files.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
