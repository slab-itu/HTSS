Immune modulation enables a specialist insect to benefit from antibacterial withanolides in its host plant  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The development of novel plant chemical defenses and counter adaptations by herbivorous insect could continually drive speciation, producing more insect specialists than generalists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One approach to test this hypothesis is to compare closely related generalist and specialist species to reveal the associated costs and benefits of these different adaptive strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use the specialized moth Heliothis subflexa, which feeds exclusively on plants in the genus Physalis, and its close generalist relative H. virescens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specialization on Physalis plants necessitates the ability to tolerate withanolides, the secondary metabolites of Physalis species that are known to have feeding deterrent and immune inhibiting properties for other insects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we find that only H. subflexa benefits from the antibacterial properties of withanolides, and thereby gains a higher tolerance of the pathogen Bacillus thuringiensis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We argue that the specialization in H. subflexa has been guided to a large extent by a unique role of plant chemistry on ecological immunology.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A major theme in evolutionary biology is the co-adaptation of interacting organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One well-known example of reciprocal adaptation is the co-evolutionary arms race between plants and their insect herbivores, as proposed in the seminal 1964 paper of Ehrlich and Raven1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This arms race has resulted in more specialized herbivore species consuming a few closely related species of host plants than generalized herbivore species consuming plants from several genera or families2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specialized herbivores have typically evolved the ability to efficiently detoxify defensive compounds made by their hosts to deter herbivory, and to even sequester and use them to their own advantage4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examples of these defensive compounds include phenolic glucosides, cardenolides and iridoid glucosides that the specialist co-opts for defence against predators, parasites and pathogens, or for interspecific communication or attracting mates6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a vast literature illustrating the great variety of methods by which specialists may benefit from host plant specialization, by utilizing plant secondary compounds to their own advantage that deter most other species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we study the specialized adaptation of the noctuid moth Heliothis subflexa to the plant genus Physalis, members of this nightshade family include popular fruit and vegetables (known as cape gooseberry or simply Physalis fruit and tomatillo).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to its close relative Heliothis virescens, a generalist that feeds on at least 14 different plant families but not on Physalis9,10, H. subflexa larvae feed exclusively on Physalis fruits11, and is the only Heliothis species to do so12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H. tergemina, the closest living relative of H. subflexa13, is a pest of tobacco in South America and has never been recorded from Physalis14, thus adaptation to Physalis appears uniquely in H. subflexa among the heliothines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Physalis fruits are surrounded by an inflated calyx or lantern (Supplementary Fig 1), which shields the feeding larva from parasites and predators15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To utilize this enemy-free space, H. subflexa larvae must deal with withanolides, the major secondary plant compounds of Physalis17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Withanolides are triterpenoids with ergostan-type steroids as core structures19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They have been shown to be potent feeding deterrent in other insect species20,21, immunosuppressants22,23, ecdysteroid antagonists24 and cytotoxic agents25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also have antibacterial activity26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to toxic secondary metabolites, herbivorous insects encounter pathogens, such as the ubiquitous entomopathogenic Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This endospore-forming bacterium produces insecticidal crystal proteins during sporulation28 and other toxins during vegetative growth29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calyx partially shields H. subflexa larvae from exposure to environmental bacteria such as Bt; the generalist H. virescens by contrast is more exposed to the environment, feeding on the exterior of fruits of its many host plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The different architecture of the food plants led us to hypothesize that H. virescens experiences stronger selection for resistance to pathogens compared with H. subflexa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an earlier study, we found that when feeding on artificial diet, H. virescens indeed showed a stronger immune response overall than did H. subflexa30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Haemolymph phenoloxidase and lysozyme increased more in H. virescens after injection of pathogenic or nonpathogenic bacteria, and the haemocytes of H. virescens had a higher phagocytic activity and suppressed bacterial growth (including Bt) in the haemolymph more efficiently than in H.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  subflexa30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'With the known immunosuppressive properties of withanolides in mind, we aimed to examine specialization on Physalis in the context of ecological immunology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach combines classical studies of the immune system with an ecological perspective to evaluate the costs and benefits of defence against parasites and pathogens in the natural environment, and the manner in which natural selection shapes the immune system31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In tritrophic interactions between herbivorous insects, microorganisms and host plants, secondary plant compounds could either reduce intake of pathogens by reducing consumption rates of insects, or increase toxicity of pathogens by imposing additional stress on the insects metabolism33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expected that withanolides would further suppress the already relatively weak immune system of H. subflexa, such that the reduced pathogen defence and increased stress would have to be compensated for by the increased protection from pathogen exposure provided by the calyx.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, to examine the role of host plant chemistry in H. subflexa specialization, we tested the effects of withanolides on larval relative weight gains, survival rates and immune status of H. subflexa in comparison with H. virescens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that in accordance with the immunosuppressive effect seen in other insects, withanolides suppress the immune system of H. virescens, but unexpectedly stimulate the immune system of H. subflexa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Withanolides also directly inhibit the growth of some bacteria, as well as inhibiting germination of Bt spores in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, withanolides protect H. subflexa, but not H. virescens, from the growth-suppressive effects of Bt infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, adaptation by the specialist H. subflexa to compounds in its host plant Physalis includes a novel retuning of the immune system, in which the direct antibacterial properties of withanolides are reinforced by their indirect strengthening of the immune response.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Withanolides, the major secondary plant compounds in the genus Physalis, have harmful effects on every biological system tested to date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study demonstrates the first beneficial effects of withanolides in any insect species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Withanolides have a positive impact on the specialist H. subflexa larvae that feed exclusively on Physalis plants by increasing larval growth and immune system activity, in contrast to its close relative H. virescens, which does not experience advantageous properties from a withanolide diet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, feeding on withanolide-supplemented diet improved the survival rate of H. subflexa larvae infected with Bt, suggesting that withanolides have played an important role in the evolution of H. subflexas adaptation to its host plant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Withanolides have numerous well-documented harmful effects on diverse biological systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They have feeding deterrent and immunosuppressive effects on several insect species22, including at least one heliothine, Helicoverpa zea34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also trigger apoptosis, a programmed cell death pathway shared by all animals35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Withanolides are phytoecdysteroids, which are plant-produced compounds that have been shown to antagonize ecdysteroid activity in insects37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ecdysteroid metabolism is known to control insect development, and disruption of this metabolism compromises insect development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, ecdysteroids were shown to modulate cellular and humoral immunity in Drosophila melanogaster by increasing phagocytic activity, pathogen encapsulation and AMP gene expression38,39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Withanolides have been shown to have antagonistic ecdysteroid activity in D. melanogaster cell lines24,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The feeding deterrent and growth-inhibiting effect of withanolides on most insects might therefore arise from the disruptive impact of these compounds on insect development and immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found feeding deterrent and growth inhibitory effects of withanolides in the generalist moth species H. virescens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, withanolides positively affected the relative weight gain of the closely related specialist moth species H. subflexa when the caterpillars were fed diet containing biologically relevant concentrations of withanolides42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, H. subflexa might have evolved mechanisms to prevent the effect of withanolides on their ecdysteroid receptors and thus avoid the negative effects of the phytochemical on insect development and immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The gut microbiota in herbivorous insects can play an important role in nutrition and digestion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, food-derived phytochemicals are assumed to change the composition of the bacterial gut microbiota43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since withanolides possess antibacterial properties19,26, they potentially affect the composition of larval gut microbiota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in Rhodnius prolixus, a blood-sucking bug and an important vector of the Chagas disease, withanolide treatment resulted in higher numbers of bacterial microbiota but also in a lower antibacterial activity45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that we found an increase in the relative weight gain in H. subflexa larvae feeding on diet containing withanolides suggests that withanolides have a nutritional or digestive microbial-driven effect, which reached its full potential at a concentration of 100 g of withanolides in our experiments (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, withanolides may favour specific bacterial strains that promote nutrition and digestion in the specialist H. subflexa, or H. subflexa might be able to overcome limitations in the composition of its gut microbiota with the help of withanolides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous studies have shown that withanolides have a potent immunosuppressive effect on other insects, inhibiting antibacterial activity, phagocytosis and hemocytic proliferation, and on human cells, suppressing T- and B-cell activation and proliferation22,23,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These effects may result from the ecdysteroid-modulating properties of withanolides discussed earlier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such an immune inhibitory effect of withanolides was not evident in the specialized H. subflexa larvae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, their immune system appeared to be stimulated, with a significant increase of the phenoloxidase activity, while in H. virescens the PO activity was unaffected by withanolide supplementation (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phenoloxidase catalyses early steps in melanin formation and is a key factor of the immune response in invertebrates, as it is involved in cellular defence, haemolytic clotting and wound repair47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed a non-significant increase in general antibacterial activity in the H. subflexa haemolymph after larvae ingested diet-containing withanolides (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stimulatory effect of withanolides on the H. subflexa immune system is further supported by our transcript data (Fig

species21,48,49,50, we found the relative weight gain of H. virescens to be significantly affected by withanolides supplementation and the immune-related genes of H. virescens to be downregulated by withanolides (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phenoloxidase activity and general immune activity in the haemolymph on the other hand were unaffected by withanolide ingestion rather than downregulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These divergent results might be a consequence of the RNAseq data reflecting changes in the whole larval gut, while the haemolymph measurements only give a report of the haemolymph immune status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, H. virescens did not show the same immune-stimulating effects by withanolides as H. subflexa, suggesting that the immune stimulation is a direct effect of host plant adaptation by H.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  subflexa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The evolution of plant defence is driven not only by herbivorous insects, but to a large extent also by microorganisms51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many antibacterial agents in nature are secondary metabolites of plants52,53 and some have been shown to prevent insect infection by bacteria or viruses54,55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Withanolides are known to be active on a broad range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria relevant in human pathology19,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the antibacterial activity of withanolides has not yet been investigated in an ecologically relevant context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that vegetative cells and spores of the microorganism B. thuringiensis, which are toxic to many insects28,29, were susceptible to extracts from P. peruviana containing withanolides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antibacterial activity of Physalis plants may have evolved as a defence mechanism against bacterial plant pathogens, with the antibacterial activity of withanolides against the insect pathogen B. thuringiensis occurring as a side effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The antibacterial mode of action of withanolides is not yet clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the susceptibility to withanolides and plant extracts of P. peruvivana may be restricted to the class of Gram-positive bacteria, as it only showed inhibitory activity against Gram-positive bacteria in our experiments (Supplementary Fig 5; Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A triterpenoid from the plant Maytenus blepharodes, structurally related to withanolides, was found to inhibit cell wall synthesis and macromolecule synthesis of B. subtilis, and withanolides might act in a similar manner56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The Bt toxins that are produced by Bt spores are toxic to certain insects28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In H. subflexa we found that withanolides reduced the larval mortality when exposed to Bt and increased the larval growth of Bt infected H. subflexa larvae (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The close relative H. virescens did not experience such benefits from withanolide consumption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mortality of H. virescens larvae was slightly reduced when withanolides were consumed in addition to Bt spores and the relative weight gain drastically reduced on withanolide supplemented diet compared with a Bt-only diet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results thus suggest that H. subflexa, which is able to tolerate withanolides in high amounts, gain protection from entomopathogenic bacteria such as Bt by feeding on Physalis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As the toxin produced by the Bt spores, rather than the Bt bacteria or spores themselves, is the main acute cause of insect death28, the antibacterial activity of withanolides against Bt may only partly explain the observed increased survival rates among H. subflexa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Withanolides might inhibit Bt bacteria from multiplying further, but the toxin in ingested spores would still be effective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the larvae might profit from the immune-stimulating effect of withanolides when challenged by Bt, as it is the case in Ephestia kuehniella, the flour moth, which has an increased survival rate on low Bt concentrations, when immune-stimulated57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, withanolides might enhance the regenerative capacity of the gut cells after Bt toxins are released in the larval gut lumen where the toxins induce cell lysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some insects, septicaemia caused by other midgut bacteria invading the haemolymph after the ingestion of Bt toxins has been suggested to be the major cause of mortality58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antibacterial effect of withanolides might keep bacteria from invading the haemocoel and thereby suppress septicaemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, while the precise mechanisms by which withanolides increase the survival of H. subflexa feeding on Bt spores remain unknown, it has to be a specific interaction between H. subflexa and withanolides as the close relative H. virescens does not experience such advantages from feeding on withanolide supplemented Bt diet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results confirm previous work showing that the host plant cannot be ignored in assessing Bt toxicity in insects59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Withanolides are found in many genera of Solanaceae, but also in other plant families19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their toxic effects on animal systems suggest an adaptive benefit in reducing herbivory, but the coevolutionary aspects of plantinsect interactions have hardly been investigated for this class of compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other insect species such as the false potato beetle have adapted to Physalis and presumably overcome the toxic effects of withanolides60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It would be interesting to see whether there are reciprocal adaptations and counter-adaptations by withanolide-producing plants; such has been documented for crucifers and certain crucifer-feeding specialists61,62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Is H. subflexa now dependent on Physalis for optimal immune system function?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a previous study we found that H. subflexa, which had been reared on artificial diet without withanolides were less tolerant to Bt bacteria and had a less efficient cell-mediated immune response compared to H. virescens.30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current study, we found the opposite effect when both species are exposed to withanolides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the evolutionary divergence of these closely related species about two and a half million years ago10, immune competence has evidently also diverged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the host range of the common ancestor is unknown, it is likely that H. virescens or its ancestor evolved a more efficient immune response as its host range increased, exposing it to a greater variety of pathogens, in accordance with the predictions of ecological immunology30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is also likely that the immune system in the H. subflexa lineage evolved as it developed its unique specialization on Physalis: it not only overcame the inhibitory effect of withanolides on its immune system, but also evolved the ability to be stimulated by withanolides, possibly by circumventing ecdysteroid antagonistic activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In adapting to withanolides, H. subflexa has likely become partially dependent on them for its immune system to function optimally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This dependence may be an unexpected corollary of the dictum that evolutionary specialization is a dead end.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, withanolides derived from the host plant directly and indirectly protect H. subflexa from bacterial pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Withanolides actively inhibit Bt spore germination and vegetative cell growth and thereby reduce pathogen loads for H. subflexa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Withanolides also stimulate the immune response of H. subflexa, opposite to the effect these compounds have on all other insects studied to date, including its close relative H. virescens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indirect effect of withanolides further enables H. subflexa larvae to defend themselves against bacterial pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, a consequence of H. subflexa specialization on Physalis plants is the adaptation of its immune system to the impact of withanolides, enabling H. subflexa to exploit their positive antibacterial properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond simply countering the plant-produced anti-herbivore compounds or using them for its own defenses (for example, by sequestration), the insect has succeeded in converting the inhibitory effects of withanolides into activation effects for its own advantage, demonstrating a unique benefit to hostplant specialization.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
