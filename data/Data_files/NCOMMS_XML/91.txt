Capture Hi-C reveals novel candidate genes and complex long-range interactions with related autoimmune risk loci  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Genome-wide association studies have been tremendously successful in identifying genetic variants associated with complex diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of association signals are intergenic and evidence is accumulating that a high proportion of signals lie in enhancer regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use Capture Hi-C to investigate, for the first time, the interactions between associated variants for four autoimmune diseases and their functional targets in B- and T-cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report numerous looping interactions and provide evidence that only a minority of interactions are common to both B- and T-cell lines, suggesting interactions may be highly cell-type specific; some disease-associated SNPs do not interact with the nearest gene but with more compelling candidate genes (for example, FOXO1, AZI2) often situated several megabases away; and finally, regions associated with different autoimmune diseases interact with each other and the same promoter suggesting common autoimmune gene targets (for example, PTPRC, DEXI and ZFP36L1).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The idenfication of the precise gene targets of variants associated with complex traits detected through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has proved challenging1 but is essential if the full potential of genetic studies is to be realised.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accumulating evidence suggests the majority of these variants lie outside traditional protein-coding genes and are enriched in enhancer regions, which are both cell-type and stimulus specific2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The task now is to identify which genes are implicated and understand which cell types are involved, to ascertain the biological pathways that are perturbed in individuals who are genetically susceptible to disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is well-established that enhancers regulate gene transcription by physical interactions5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These can operate over large genetic distances, so the tradition of annotating GWAS hits with the closest, or most biologically plausible gene candidate, may prove misleading and result in expensive, time consuming efforts to define the function of non-causal genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The utility of chromosome conformation capture technology (Capture Hi-C) to detect the patterns of interactions between chromosomal regions has been demonstrated6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, for the first time, we used this approach to characterize the interactions of confirmed susceptibility loci for four autoimmune diseases: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes (T1D), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) with the aim of linking disease-associated SNPs with disease-causing genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Uniquely, we have tested the interactions in two complementary experiments: first, Region Capture targets regions associated with disease10,11,12,13,14; second, Promoter Capture provides independent validation through capturing all known promoters within 500 kb of lead disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study expands on recent applications of the Capture Hi-C method firstly, by increasing the depth of sequencing and therefore the resolution, (average 10,000 interactions per restriction fragment), second, by comprehensively targeting the full known genetic component of four related autoimmune diseases and finally by performing complimentary experiments, such that we target the disease-associated regions and, in separate experiments, all gene promoters within 500 kb, so providing direct, independent, reciprocal validation for each interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All experiments were performed in human B (GM12878) and T (Jurkat) cell lines, selected because they are most relevant to these diseases3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hi-C libraries were generated for both cell lines15, then hybridized to custom biotinylated RNA baits and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested for significant interactions using a negative binomial distribution as described previously6, performing all experiments in duplicate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our findings provide compelling evidence that disease-associated SNPs, currently nominally assigned to the closest plausible gene candidate, may well-regulate genes some distance away.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show that in a subset of risk loci, SNPs associated to different autoimmune diseases physically interact with and may well-regulate the same genes but with differing enhancer mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of the interactions also show evidence of cell-type specificity, occurring in either the B- or T-cell lines only.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

62% capture efficiency).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, in the Promoter Capture experiment, 121.1 million (GM12878) and 115 million (Jurkat) unique di-tags were on-target (average 21,448 reads per HindIII restriction fragment;

previously, using the nearest candidate gene annotation method, different genes would have been assigned to the diseases but our work shows that they may all act on the same gene promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide three examples below to illustrate the findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the 16p13 region contains SNPs associated with both T1D and multiple sclerosis that locate within intron 19 of the CLEC16A gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A physical interaction between a 20-kb region of CLEC16A and the promoter of DEXI has previously been reported20, although was not detected in the current study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that a separate, independent region, associated with both T1D and JIA, near the RMI2 gene and 530 kb from the DEXI gene, also interacts with the DEXI promoter (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a region proximal to the ZC3H7A gene, associated with RA susceptibility, some 1.2 Mb from DEXI, interacts with both the T1D/JIA-associated region and the DEXI promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Examples of chromatin interactions linking several disease associations to a common promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) DEXIboth GM12878 and Jurkat cell lines show that SNPs associated independently with RA, PsA and T1D interact with the DEXI promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, evidence suggests that the RA and JIA SNP regions interact in GM12878 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) RAD51BRA associations located within a strong enhancer are shown to interact with the promoter of ZFP36L1, a gene involved in B-cell transition, which also contains SNPs associated with JIA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c), PTPRCVariants associated with PsA, within the DENND1B are shown to interact with PTPRC, a region independently associated with RA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genomic co-ordinates are shown along the top of each panel and tracks are labelled AY as in Fig 4.Full size image', 'The second example is provided by RA-associated variants mapping within a strong enhancer region intronic of RAD51B, where a significant interaction is observed with the promoter of the ZFP36L1 gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SNPs in the promoter region of ZFP36L1 are independently associated with JIA but not RA; however, the interaction of the ZFP36L1 promoter with the RA-associated SNPs suggests that the causal gene in both diseases may be ZFP36L1 and not RAD51B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZFP36L1 is a zinc finger transcription factor involved in the transition of B cells to plasma cells and it is noteworthy that the interaction with the RA-associated region was only seen in the B-cell line (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally we show evidence that SNPs associated with PsA within the DENND1B gene make strong contact with a region associated with RA within the PTPRC gene, which is responsible for T- and B-cell receptor signalling and maps over 1 Mb away (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We, like others8,9, have demonstrated a complex relationship between promoters and enhancers, where promoters interact with many enhancers and enhancers interact with many promoters, rarely in a one-to-one relationship (Fig 1 and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enhancers containing risk variants for autoimmune diseases can, therefore, meet at the same promoters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This challenges the assumption that disease-associated SNPs have to be in close linkage disequilibrium (LD) to have a disease related effect on the same gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, these findings may well-suggest an evolutionary phylogeny, where polymorphic variants regulating expression of the same gene result in either different autoimmune diseases or different molecular mechanisms resulting in risk of the same disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interactions with previously implicated loci', 'Among the other 141 confirmed interactions, we observed examples of disease-associated SNPs within the 3 untranslated region, or within introns of a gene, interacting with the promoter of the same gene (STAT4, CDK6, Supplementary Fig 2a,b); disease-associated SNPs within lncRNA interacting with the promoter of genes (RBPJ, Supplementary Fig 3) and several examples of restriction fragments, proximal to those containing disease-associated SNPs, interacting with promoters some distance away (ARID5B, IL2RA, TLE3, Supplementary Fig 4ac), supporting recent findings that disease-associated SNPs are enriched outside transcription factor-binding sites3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Long-range interactions', 'Perhaps unexpectedly, 80% of significant interactions occurred at distances exceeding 500 kb (Supplementary Fig 5) and interacted with non-promoters, reducing the number of interactions available for co-validation in the Promoter and Region Capture experiments (targeted genes in the Promoter Capture not extending that far) and reinforcing the idea that GWAS regions may be involved with complex long-range gene regulation possibly involving multiple enhancer elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate whether these are likely to be true interactions, we compared results from the largest Hi-C data set on GM12878 cells reported, to date21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 4,607 longer distance interactions ( greater than 500 kb) we called at FDR  less_than 5% in our data, 377 were found at 50 times observed over expected in the independent Hi-C data set (Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provided both strong confirmation of our long-range capture Hi-C results we already co-validated with Promoter and Region Capture (for example, FOXO1, ZFP36L1, Supplementary Fig 6) and supports many potentially novel interactions (for example, MMEL1, Supplementary Fig 7), but detailed examination to confirm these long-range interactions is now required.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our targeted Capture Hi-C analyses have identified, for the first time, many long-range interactions between autoimmune risk loci and their putative target genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this methodology we have intriguing data illustrating that regions associated with more than one disease, often some distance apart, interact with the same gene and that associated regions can skip genes to interact with more distant novel candidates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results provide new insights into complex disease genetics and changes the way we view the causal genes in disease, with obvious implications for pathway analysis and identification of therapeutic targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since we uncovered evidence of cell-specific interactions, the current study is likely to be only the beginning of similar explorations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further work to characterize functionally the observed interactions, including eQTL studies using a range of cell types and stimulatory conditions, are required to determine how disease-associated SNPs influence the risk of disease, with the aim of better understanding disease aetiology.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
