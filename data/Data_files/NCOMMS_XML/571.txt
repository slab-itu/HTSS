Insulin and TOR signal in parallel through FOXO and S6K to promote epithelial wound healing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The TOR and Insulin/IGF signalling (IIS) network controls growth, metabolism and ageing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although reducing TOR or insulin signalling can be beneficial for ageing, it can be detrimental for wound healing, but the reasons for this difference are unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that IIS is activated in the cells surrounding an epidermal wound in Drosophila melanogaster larvae, resulting in PI3K activation and redistribution of the transcription factor FOXO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insulin and TOR signalling are independently necessary for normal wound healing, with FOXO and S6K as their respective effectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IIS is specifically required in cells surrounding the wound, and the effect is independent of glycogen metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insulin signalling is needed for the efficient assembly of an actomyosin cable around the wound, and constitutively active myosin II regulatory light chain suppresses the effects of reduced IIS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings may have implications for the role of insulin signalling and FOXO activation in diabetic wound healing.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The conserved IIS and TOR signalling network has a central role in metabolic homoeostasis, growth control, stress responses and ageing1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decreased activity of the network can extend lifespan, improve many aspects of health and delay or prevent ageing-related diseases in laboratory animals2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, reduced network activity can also impair specific aspects of health, notably wound healing3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be one reason why impaired wound healing is a common complication of diabetes5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identification of the mechanisms mediating both the health benefits and impairments from reduced IIS and TOR activity is important in order to understand if they can be triaged apart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying impaired wound healing in diabetes are incompletely understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vascular defects have a major role6, but insulin resistance in other cell types may also contribute and could be a potential therapeutic target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fruit fly Drosophila is an excellent model organism in which to study the cell biology and physiology of epidermal wound healing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fly has also been used to develop multiple genetic models of extended lifespan from reduced IIS/TOR activity, and of insulin resistance1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In several of these experimental situations, gene expression can be controlled both temporally and in a cell-type-specific manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The Drosophila epidermis is a monolayered epithelium with a basal lamina, resembling simple squamous epithelia in mammals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether with the apically secreted cuticle it provides a robust external barrier (Supplementary Fig 1A)7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two major conserved mechanisms contribute to epithelial wound repair in the Drosophila embryo and pupa are formation of an actomyosin cable that constricts the wound, and protrusion of lamellipodia by cells surrounding the wound, associated with cell crawling towards it, eventually leading to wound closure8,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In larvae, wound closure is driven primarily by actin protrusion rather than by actomyosin cable contraction, but a polarized actin assembly is observed at the wound edge12,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The movement of cells surrounding the wound is coupled to phagocytosis of debris and formation of syncytia centred at the wound12,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Haemocytes are also recruited to the wounded area, and these stop the escape of haemolymph and the entry of microorganisms12,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The larval epidermis is post-mitotic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Epidermal morphogenesis occurs only during embryonic stages, and the larval epidermis hence provides a powerful in vivo model to study the cell biology of wound healing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Larvae have not been widely used in this context, partly because they cannot easily be immobilized for long periods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have overcome this problem and established a laser ablation method for inducing epithelial wounds in third instar larvae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We employed live imaging to analyse the role of the IIS/TOR network, and found that inhibition of TORC1 impairs wound healing in an S6 kinase-dependent manner, and that there is an epidermal-specific and cell-autonomous requirement for insulin signalling through FOXO for efficient actomyosin cable formation and wound healing.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Epidermal wound healing in Drosophila larvae', 'A laser beam was used to ablate one or a few cells in the epidermis of anaesthetized, early third instar (L3) Drosophila larvae, which were imaged for up to 7 h after wounding (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We initially investigated wounds encompassing 36 epidermal cells (3,0008,500 m2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immediately after injury, the wound area expanded for 6±1 min (Supplementary Fig 1 and Supplementary Fig 2A,B, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Movie 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sides of the cells facing the wound showed a strong enrichment of Src-GFP at the plasma membrane and formed a ring around the wound, which shrank over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accumulation of Src-GFP occurred near the apical side of the cell edges at the border of the wound while, at the basal side, lamellipodia emanated and filled in the wound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wound closure was completed within 250±20 min, irrespective of Gal4 drivers and markers used (Supplementary Fig 1CF and Supplementary Fig 2AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To investigate a possible role of a contractile actomyosin ring in the initial shrinking of the wound, we expressed DE-Cadherin-GFP to mark adherens junctions, and mCherry fused to spaghetti squash (Sqh), the Drosophila non-muscle myosin II regulatory light chain (MyoII), both under their endogenous promoters19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We saw that MyoII was rapidly reorganized in the cells surrounding the wound (Supplementary Fig 1G and Supplementary Movie 1B,C), and relocated from the cytoplasm to the side of the cells facing the wound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There it co-localised with DE-Cadherin, which itself was then gradually lost from this location but remained unaltered at the cell sides facing non-wounded neighbours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accumulation of MyoII occurred at the end of the expansion phase; a complete actomyosin cable had formed by 1012 min and was maintained until wound healing was completed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We next examined single-cell wounds, to explore the potential for investigating cell-autonomous effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in multicellular wounds, we observed an initial expansion of the wound, formation of an actomyosin cable and growth of basal lamellipodia into the wound (Fig 1ae, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Movie 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rate of actomyosin cable formation was independent of wound size and number of ablated cells, but single-cell wounds healed faster (Supplementary Fig 2EH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both in single- and multi-cell wounds, the actin cable was established by the cells surrounding the wound, with simultaneous depletion of cytoplasmic MyoII and LifeAct-Ruby in these cells (Fig 1e, Supplementary Fig 1G and Supplementary Fig 3AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extrusion of cells by a contractile actin cable also occurs after apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we did not see apoptotic markers21 (Supplementary Fig 3E), the ablated cells were immediately destroyed, and their debris was engulfed by neighbouring cells (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in other systems8,22, wounding was immediately followed by a pulse of Calcium signalling (Fig 1f and Supplementary Movie 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Healing of single-cell epidermal wounds in 3rd instar larvae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ad) Heterozygous e22c greater than Src-GFP,DsRed2-Nuc (e22c-Gal4, UAS-Src-GFP, UAS-DsRed2-Nuc/+), (e) recombinant DE-Cad-GFP, Sqh-mCherry and (f) e22c greater than GCaMP3 (e22c-Gal4, UAS-GCaMP3) early third instar larvae were immobilized and wounded by laser.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Projections (xy) and cross-sections (xz;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The capacity of the body to regenerate and repair tissues is compromised in some pathophysiological conditions, especially Type 2 diabetes37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wound healing is also impaired by the TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin, which is licensed as a drug to prevent rejection of tissue transplants38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these clinical findings, wound healing in mice depends on insulin and TOR signalling40,41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the roles of systemic and cell autonomous signalling mechanisms are unclear, as are the exact processes of wound healing that are affected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Drosophila is the organism that is best understood for mechanisms and pathways that direct tissue assembly, morphogenesis and cell polarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wounding larvae using laser ablation followed by long-term live imaging allowed us to characterize the activity of IIS with a high spatiotemporal resolution at the subcellular level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large, transparent epidermal cells of Drosophila larvae, and the absence of interfering maternal components that may hamper genetic analysis of ubiquitously needed proteins in the embryo, make them an attractive model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Drosophila larvae can be treated with inhibitors and drugs (for example, rapamycin) with similar effects as observed in mammals43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because many signalling pathways are conserved between Drosophila and mammals and many labs use Drosophila larvae to accelerate drug discovery for treatment in cancer or diabetes and other chronic diseases, this model may be useful for such purposes in the future44,45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, Drosophila larvae may be used to test the effects of dominant mutations of human genes to understand their mechanism and function, as recently described, for example, for the human keratin networks and their role in epidermolysis bullosa simplex47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Immediately after wounding we observed a local enhancement of IIS in the cells surrounding the wound and clonal analysis showed that IIS signalling during wound healing was autonomous to the epidermal cells themselves, and specifically to the small group of cells immediately around the wound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is important, because it implies that very local insulin resistance, not only vascular complications peculiar to mammals, may contribute to impaired wound healing in type 2 diabetes, and that therefore local enhancement of IIS signalling at the wound itself could be beneficial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A delay in epidermal wound healing after rapamycin treatment has also been observed in mammals3,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mice, the level of S6 phosphorylation (pS6) was increased in the epidermal compartment of wound edges, and rapamycin treatment reduced pS6 level and delayed the healing process3,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Epidermal deletion of the TOR inhibitor TCS1 accelerated wound closure, with increased pS6 in the epidermis, in particular in the migrating epithelial tongue of the wound3,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Drosophila larvae, activation of S6K is sufficient to suppress the wound healing delay caused by rapamycin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the function of S6K in wound healing is conserved from insects to mammals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conserved function makes S6K an interesting target for regenerative and drug studies in Drosophila to identify its cellular targets in wound healing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Activation of S6K did not suppress the wound healing delay caused by reducing insulin receptor signalling, suggesting that other branches of insulin signalling in parallel to TOR are needed for efficient wound healing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fits with the finding that reduction of FOXO levels, whether ubiquitously or only in the epidermis, completely rescues the wound healing delay caused by lowered insulin receptor signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, at least two pathways within the nutrient-sensing network are involved in wound healing, one acting downstream of TORC1 through S6K and independent of FOXO levels, the other downstream of the insulin receptor through FOXO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effects of modulating FOXO levels in mice are less clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of epidermal FOXO1 has been reported to lead either to impaired wound closure48 or to improve wound healing4,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our own results clearly show the need for low nuclear FOXO levels for efficient wound healing in the Drosophila epidermis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microarray experiments on wounded versus non-wounded human epidermis revealed an over-representation of FOXO binding sites in differentially expressed genes50,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genes repressed by FOXO included those encoding the matrix metalloproteases MMP-1 and MMP-9, which is interesting in light of the fact that Drosophila MMP-1 and MMP-2 are required for proper wound healing in larvae52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cutaneous wound healing is difficult to study at the subcellular level in humans due to the interplay of several cell types and growth factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The potential common FOXO targets between Drosophila and humans again highlight the usefulness of Drosophila as a model for further studies on the mechanism of IIS/FOXO regulation during wound healing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'High levels of glycogen are present in the epidermis of larvae, and in the mammalian epidermis53,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduced glycogen level under lowered insulin receptor signalling was not normalized after FOXO deletion, while the rate of wound healing returned to normal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in Drosophila larvae under rich nutrient conditions, wound healing does not depend on high levels of glycogen, and the effects of reducing IIS can therefore not be explained by loss of glycogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glycogen increases during wound healing in the mammalian epidermis55 but its function for wound healing and epidermal homoeostasis is not clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will be interesting to find out how glycogen synthesis is regulated in the epidermis and in response to wound healing and if there is a feedback loop or cross talk between glucose metabolism, glycogen synthesis and autophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our genetic manipulations affected IIS over an extended period of  greater than 24 h before we assayed their effects on wound healing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effects could therefore be due to a requirement for IIS at the time of wounding, shortly afterwards, or in the period before wounding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can distinguish distinct phases in wound healing, and these may be affected differently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The immediate increase in PIP3 at the wound edges and the appearance of an actomyosin cable coincided with the cessation of wound opening during the early response; this was then followed by constriction of the wound concomitant with the production of lamellipodia; finally, in the late phase of wound healing, autophagosomes appeared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IIS appeared to have a role immediately after wounding, as shown by the initial release of FOXO from epidermal nuclei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While IIS is needed for the accumulation of PIP3, we cannot distinguish whether this is due to acute InR signalling at the time of wounding, or an earlier requirement, with the direct signal for PIP3 accumulation being provided by a different mechanismfor instance via Ca++ signalling, activation of Src kinase, or other pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The appearance of autophagosomes in the late phase of wound closure may be a consequence of FOXO re-entering nuclei after the initial response to wounding, but it could also be stimulated by other mechanisms, such as inflammatory signalling or production of ROS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'However, overexpressing FOXO-TM also affects some of the immediate responses to wounding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FOXO-TM must act via transcriptional regulation, as it is constitutively confined to the nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the time between wounding and actomyosin cable formation is too short to be regulated through a transcriptional mechanism, this means that increased levels of FOXO act at an earlier phase to compromise the ability of the epidermal cells to generate a strong and properly assembled actomyosin cable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous studies on wound healing after mechanical injury of the larval epidermis did not describe the immediate formation of an actomyosin cable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, a discontinuous assembly of actin was seen in the leading edges of cells surrounding the wound, and only several hours after injury13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of this delayed appearance of the cable, Brock et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  suggested that actin-based contraction is not a major contributor to larval wound closure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a clear contrast to wound healing in the embryo where actomyosin cables are formed8,10, and now also to the data we report here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike the visualization of the actomyosin cable by live imaging used here, the other studies analysed fixed material stained with phalloidin or other probes for actin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that the early actomyosin cable is sensitive to fixation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Elevated nuclear FOXO reduced the rate of actomyosin assembly, contraction and maintenance and decelerated wound closure, suggesting that this may be due to transcriptional regulation of actin modulators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A transcriptome analysis in adult flies identified FOXO target genes that encode components of cell adhesion and cell polarity complexes and the Rho-GTPase signalling system (for example, p120, -Cat, Baz/Par3, Shg/E-cadherin, Numb, Crb, Tub, Rho-GAP-1A, Rho-GAP-54D, Rho-GAP-93B, RhoL, Rac2)56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of these genes are involved in wound healing in Drosophila or mammals9,24,57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The finding that insulin and TOR signalling have independent roles in wound healing is important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the finding implies that the mechanisms of impaired wound healing seen with rapamycin treatment and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes may be different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, it will be important to identify the effector molecular processes at work downstream of both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, lowered insulin signalling in wounded tissues themselves, as opposed to impaired vascular supply, may have an important role in the impaired wound healing in type 2 diabetes, and may imply that local up-regulation of insulin signalling or inhibition of FOXO is sufficient to effect an improvement.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
