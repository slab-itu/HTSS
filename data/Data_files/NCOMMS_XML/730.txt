Molecular and electronic structure of terminal and alkali metal-capped uranium(V) nitride complexes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Determining the electronic structure of actinide complexes is intrinsically challenging because inter-electronic repulsion, crystal field, and spinorbit coupling effects can be of similar magnitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, such efforts have been hampered by the lack of structurally analogous families of complexes to study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report an improved method to UN triple bonds, and assemble a family of uranium(V) nitrides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along with an isoelectronic oxo, we quantify the electronic structure of this 5f1 family by magnetometry, optical and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies and modelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we define the relative importance of the spinorbit and crystal field interactions, and explain the experimentally observed different ground states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find optical absorption linewidths give a potential tool to identify spinorbit coupled states, and show measurement of UV···UV super-exchange coupling in dimers by EPR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that observed slow magnetic relaxation occurs via two-phonon processes, with no obvious correlation to the crystal field.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this nuclear age, there is a need for improved extraction agents for separations and recycling technologies1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To achieve this, we need a better understanding of the electronic structure of actinide complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is challenging because relativistic effects are important2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in contrast to lanthanide and transition metal ions, after inter-electronic repulsion, crystal field (CF) effects induced by coordinated ligands and the spinorbit coupling (SOC) of such heavy elements can be large and of the same order of magnitude3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, neither traditional LSRussellSaunders nor jj-coupling are entirely appropriate schemes to describe the electronic structures of 5fn elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this is precisely the area where accurate models are needed because our understanding of core chemical concepts such as oxidation state, valence and the spin (S), orbital (L), and total angular momentum (J) quantum numbers become increasingly nebulous at the foot of the periodic table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In recent years, many novel uranium molecules have become available, some accompanied by detailed spectroscopic and magnetic data4,5,6,7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a comprehensive electronic structure picture has thus far been limited to a few isolated studies of highly symmetric species5,6,7,8,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, 5f1 complexes are appealing11,12 because inter-electronic repulsion is absent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, it would be ideal to study systematic families of uranium(V) complexes, but this chemistry has lagged behind that of uranium(IV/VI) because of the propensity of the former to disproportionate into the latter pair under aqueous conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Non-aqueous approaches allow isolation of stable uranium(V)12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the mono(oxo) complex U(TrenTIPS)(O) 1, TrenTIPS=N(CH2CH2NSiPri3)3 exploits the bulky TrenTIPS ligand to block disproportionation and stabilizes a wide range of novel uraniumligand linkages14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In 2012, we reported a molecular terminal uranium(V) nitride20,21,22,23, via oxidation of UIII(TrenTIPS) (2) by sodium azide to give the dinuclear contact ion pair (DCIP) complex {UV(TrenTIPS)(-N)(-Na)}2 (3Na).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of 3Na with 12-crown-4 ether (12C4) afforded the terminal nitride separated ion pair (SIP) complex UV(TrenTIPS)(N)Na(12C4)2 (4Na)20; when the crown was mismatched to the sodium, the contact ion pair (CIP) complex UV(TrenTIPS)(-N){Na(15C5)} 5Na, 15C5=15-crown-5 ether was formed21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complex 4Na could also be oxidized to UVI(TrenTIPS)(N) (6)21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Terminal uranium nitrides were without precedent outside of matrix isolation experiments22,24,25,26,27,28,29; molecular species always exhibited bridging nitrides30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41 or decomposed via CH activation to give amides21,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These difficulties stand in contrast to the common terminal uranium oxides9,14,43,44,45 and transition metal nitrides46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These U(TrenTIPS)(X)n complexes, in addition to their synthetic utility13,48, are appealing because of their axial (C3) symmetry and the availability of a series in which only X and/or counter-ions vary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, we can study the influence of varying CF at uranium(V) by replacing O2 with N3 in isostructural and isoelectronic molecules: there are no other available uranium compound families where this is possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, extending the nitride family requires more reliable synthetic routes because, although the synthesis of 3Na is conceptually simple, it is not straightforward and sometimes fails for no obvious reason.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Herein, we report a reliable route, enabling us to prepare analogues with all the alkali metals (M) from LiCs; the nitride is capped by two bridging M in DCIP derivatives (3M), capped by one M in CIP derivatives (5M) or is terminal in a SIP (4M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present experimental magnetic/electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) data that are sensitive to the nature and ordering of the lowest lying electronic states, and ultraviolet/visible/near-infrared (UV/Vis/NIR) data that define the energies of excited states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have performed ab initio calculations on model and real complexes, and parameterize the results in a CF+SOC model, or, in other words, into a relatively simple conceptual basis familiar to chemists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we refine the model parameters by global fitting to the experimental data to provide a quantitative electronic structure picture for these uranium(V) nitrides and the isoelectronic oxo analogue 1, and justify the experimentally observed differences between these species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we explore the dynamic magnetic properties of the entire series, demonstrating that they are behaving as single molecule magnets (SMMs), and we explore the mechanism for this effect.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

two -bonds between the filled nitride 2p-orbitals and the uranium lz=±1 (5f) orbitals; a pair of non-bonding lz=±3 (5f) uranium orbitals containing one electron; two non-bonding empty lz=±2 (5f) orbitals;

(iii) the lz=±2 pair (which remains degenerate) falls below the barycentre of the |lz|=3 pair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first effect is due to the additional axial ligand trans to the nitride, the second effect is due to the threefold equatorial field mixing the lz=±3 orbitals, and the last effect is due to the equatorial field destabilizing the in-plane lz=±3 orbitals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, when SOC is introduced (Supplementary Table 5): (i) the first excited doublet (still jz±3/2) is at much lower energy than for UN2+ (300 cm1;

'The few methods of preparing isolable uranium nitrides30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41 contrast to the plethora of methods in the transition metal series46,47, and for uranium most involve redox activity of azide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, we have found new and reliable methods to a wide family of terminal uranium nitrides based on the U(TrenTIPS) framework (Supplementary Note 2), and it is our hope that this could be applicable to other ligand systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the reactivity described here is analogous to that reported recently for a titanium nitride59, since uranium is behaving like an early d-block ion in this context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given the simplicity of our ab initio approach, there is remarkable agreement between calculated and the experimental energies from UV/Vis/NIR (deviations of up to 103 cm1, or only 2.9 kcal mol1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transition to the first excited doublet is outside our spectral range, but all other states are observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the ff transition linewidths follow a consistent pattern (from low to high energy) of broad, sharp, sharp, broad and very broad.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These transitions are to excited states derived primarily from |lz|=1, |lz|=2 or 3, |lz|=2 or 3, |lz|=1 and |lz|=0, respectively (Fig 5f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The broad transitions are to states with |lz|=1 and 0, deriving from orbitals that are formally anti-bonding with respect to the nitride, while the sharp transitions involve non-bonding |lz|=2 or 3 states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The former are expected to be much more susceptible to UN vibrational broadening (and more so for |lz|=0 than 1) than the latter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the assignments are consistent with the orbital parentage of the SO-coupled states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If this is characteristic for uranium(V) more widely, it could serve as a tool to directly evidence the nature of SO-coupled states, although it may only apply in cases with dominant axial CFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Importantly, the gross electronic structure is clearthere are two low-lying doublets (jz±5/2 and ±3/2), within a few hundred cm1 of each other, well separated from all others by thousands of cm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the calculated separation of the two lowest doublets is of the same order as the errors in the calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, it is feasible that their actual ordering could be reversed and dependent on small structural differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Note there is no significant difference in the ab initio results upon enlargement of the active space and basis set, or correcting for dynamic correlation; Supplementary Table 13.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these two doublets will dominate the magnetic properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EPR gives gz3.74 (9) with an upper limit for gx,y less_than 0.5, in agreement with ab initio values for the jz±5/2 doublet of 3.84 (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The jz±3/2 doublet is calculated to have gz2.4 (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the EPR spectra must arise from the jz±5/2 doublet in each case, and we initially assumed that this was the ground state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this is not compatible with the magnetic data in all cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The calculated magnetization for an isolated jz±5/2 doublet with gz=3.74, gx,y=0 is 0.90 B mol1 (for 1.8 K and 7 T;

extrapolated 0 K MT=0.120.22 cm3 K mol1), particularly allowing for uncertainty in gz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, it appears for 4M and 5K that jz±3/2 is the ground state with ±5/2 as a low-lying excited state, consistent with the significant temperature dependence in MT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The jz±5/2 state must be low enough that it is still sufficiently populated at less_than 10 K to give the observed EPR spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimental data for 3K, 3Rb, 3Cs and 5M (excluding 5K) are significantly higher (M=0.60.75 B mol1; extrapolated 0 K MT=0.260.37 cm3 K mol1 per uranium).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that jz±5/2 is significantly lower in energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, for 3K and 5Na, the data approach the calculated values for jz±5/2 and, along with the lack of temperature dependence in MT, suggests that this is the ground state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To estimate the separation of the two doublets for each complex, we attempted to fit MT(T) while simultaneously fitting all other experimental data (EPR, optical and magnetization) to the CF+SOC Hamiltonian (Equation 1;

(ii) the equatorial CF due to the TrenTIPS ligand is unchanged; and (iii) the weaker axial CF of the oxo stabilizes the lz=±2 relative to ±3 orbitals, therefore stabilizing the jz±3/2 doublet relative to ±5/2 after SOC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ab initio calculations on 1 (Fig 5g,h;
