Sea ice and millennial-scale climate variability in the Nordic seas 90kyr ago to present  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In the light of rapidly diminishing sea ice cover in the Arctic during the present atmospheric warming, it is imperative to study the distribution of sea ice in the past in relation to rapid climate change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we focus on glacial millennial-scale climatic events (Dansgaard/Oeschger events) using the sea ice proxy IP25 in combination with phytoplankton proxy data and quantification of diatom species in a record from the southeast Norwegian Sea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that expansion and retreat of sea ice varies consistently in pace with the rapid climate changes 90 kyr ago to present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sea ice retreats abruptly at the start of warm interstadials, but spreads rapidly during cooling phases of the interstadials and becomes near perennial and perennial during cold stadials and Heinrich events, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low-salinity surface water and the sea ice edge spreads to the GreenlandScotland Ridge, and during the largest Heinrich events, probably far into the Atlantic Ocean.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Dansgaard/Oeschger (D/O) events in Greenland ice cores consist of warm interstadial (IS) and cold stadial events1 and are strongly imprinted in sediments from the northern North Atlantic region and Nordic seas2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general the warming to insterstadial conditions was abrupt as seen in Greenland ice cores and marine records.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The warm conditions were followed by gradual cooling called the insterstadial transitional cooling phase, and a rapid transition to cold stadial conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Larger and/or longer-lasting stadials correlate with North Atlantic Heinrich events (H-events)2, where numerous icebergs were released from the Laurentide ice sheet and melting over the North Atlantic region in the so-called Ruddiman belt4,5 (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though D/O events have been extensively studied, changes in sea ice cover have only been inferred by indirect evidence for presence or absence of sea ice (for example, deposition patterns of ice-rafted debris, oxygen isotope records and palaeo-temperature reconstructions) (Supplementary Fig 1 and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Map of the Nordic seas.Location of studied sediment core JM11-FI-19PC (yellow star) along with nearby core ENAM93-21/MD95-2009 (refs 3, 66, 67, 68) (magenta coloured circle) and core MSM5/5-712-217 (black star) from the Svalbard margin, discussed in the text, are marked.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bathymetry from GEBCO 2014 grid (http://www.gebco.net/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Major surface (solid and dashed black lines) and bottom currents (dotted black lines), locations of Arctic Front (AF) including the Iceland-Faroe front (IFF)) and Polar Front (PF) (dashed white lines) are indicated together with the modern location of summer sea ice limit (shaded white area with drift ice), and the location of the Arctic surface water (shaded area with diagonal lines), as well as the Ruddiman belt (shaded area with wave-shaped lines).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EGC, East Greenland Current;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In late MIS 3 to early MIS 2 (c. 3522 kyr ago), the interstadials of D/O events 62 are short-lasting, and because of the relatively low sampling resolution in JM-FI-19PC in this time interval (300 years per sample) not all the interstadials are equally well resolved (Fig 5; see also ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the following discussion we therefore focus on the time interval 9035 kyr ago comprising the longer-lasting D/O events 217 with the highest resolution, including H-events H8H4 (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of three different phases within each D/O event could be determined; insterstadial conditions, insterstadial transitional cooling conditions and stadial conditions (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A fourth phase describes the particular conditions during some larger H-events (H6, part of H4 and H1; Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interstadials are characterized by absence or near absence of IP25, maximum content of brassicasterol and dinosterol, and low PBIP25 and PDIP25 values (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The (near) absence of IP25 indicates absence of sea ice-related diatoms, while high brassicasterol and dinosterol values indicate favourable conditions for phytoplankton growth in general and higher primary productivity at the surface ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thalassiosira oestrupii (Ostenfeld) Hasle, an indicator of relatively warm temperatures32,33 is present in higher amounts in IS21 (MIS 5a) and in the Holocene, coinciding with high values of brassicasterol and dinosterol (Fig 5, see Methods for details on diatoms).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The species occurs sporadic or is absent in interstadials of MIS 3 and 2 (IS17IS3) indicating colder than modern conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, the biomarker signals indicate open-ocean conditions and relatively high surface water temperatures over the northern Faroe Islands margin, with the Arctic Front located north of the core position (Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Planktic foraminiferal species from nearby core ENAM93-21/MD95-2009 indicated inflow of Atlantic Water during interstadials of MIS 3 and MIS 23 in support of the interpretation based on diatom floras and organic biomarkers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the 13Corg values are higher in interstadials, which point to a (relative) decrease of terrigeneous organic matter supply and/or an increase in marine organic matter input28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter option, that is, an increased influence of marine organic matter at times of higher water temperatures due to higher marine productivity at the core location, is supported by higher flux of diatoms and higher concentrations of brassicasterol and dinosterol (Figs 5 and 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Schematic reconstruction of sea ice conditions at the northern Faroe slope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Interstadial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Interstadial transitional cooling phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Stadial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) H-events H6, H4 and H1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Black horizontal arrows indicate location of the Arctic Front (AF) and Polar Front (PF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Green colour (including arrows) indicates degree of phytoplankton productivity inferred from concentrations of brassicasterol, dinosterol and flux of diatoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Productivity levels are indicated in the lowermost part of each figure: Magenta coloured line, no or very little phytoplankton productivity;

marked by arrows in Fig 5) indicate increasing seasonal sea ice cover and elevated surface productivity, respectively, typical of the marginal ice zone11,12 (Fig 6b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that the IFF had moved to a probably variable position south-east of the core location and that the area was in the zone of Arctic surface water, likely resulting in decrease of both atmospheric and surface-water temperatures (Fig 6b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phase correlates with an increase in ice rafting and an increase in cold-water planktic foraminiferal species as seen in nearby core ENAM93-21/MD95-2009 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The cooling phase terminated in a phase of extended sea ice cover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is associated with a maximum in IP25 values (higher than the calculated mean value), an abrupt decrease in the concentration of brassicasterol, dinosterol and high PBIP25 and PDIP25 values (Fig 5, light-blue colour bars).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generally supporting this, the sea ice-associated Fragilariopsis oceanica (Cleve) Hasle33,34,35 is present in higher relative abundance in H-event 8, S16 and S1 (Fig 5, see Methods for details on diatoms).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of diatoms in most of the identified phases of extended sea ice cover (Fig 5) is in accordance with the low abundances of diatoms found in areas with near-perennial sea ice cover today16,20 (for diatom preservation, see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With cold surface conditions and extended sea ice cover as far south as the core location, the Polar Front migrated to a position close to or probably south of the core site (Fig 6c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conditions were probably similar to conditions currently observed in areas governed by the East Greenland Current with (very) low primary productivity36,37 and a dense pack-ice cover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather low 13Corg values might indicate decreased marine organic carbon flux due to the low productivity and/or an increased influence of terrigenous organic matter, probably being ice-rafted to the core site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of near-perennial sea ice prevented heat exchange and the atmosphere was probably very cold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These last phases of the D/O events represent the stadial conditions of the Greenland ice cores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The sea ice proxy data for the H-events 6, 4 and 1 (Figs 4 and 5) show a very prominent period of perennial or near-perennial sea ice cover (absent or medium IP25, respectively, absent or minimal brassicasterol and dinosterol, and maximum PBIP25 and PDIP25 values).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these intervals, the IP25 values of zero cannot be interpreted as absence of sea ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the combined signals likely represent a thick permanent sea ice cover and very cold temperatures15,26 (see also discussion in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As long as the sea ice cover is thin enough for sunlight to penetrate, sea ice diatoms synthesizing IP25 can grow attached beneath the ice14,16,20, which was probably the case at the beginning and end of some of the stadial intervals, where high peaks in PBIP25 and PDIP25 can occur (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the sea ice becomes permanent and too thick for sunlight to penetrate, the signal of IP25 will drop to zero (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To allow for the perennial sea ice and extreme cold temperatures, Polar surface water most likely spread over the area north of the Faroe Islands and the Polar Front was located far more southerly than today and during the smaller stadials (Fig 6d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The transition from stadial and H-events to interstadials is rapid and interpreted as a sudden transition from extended sea ice cover to open-ocean conditions, seen as a decrease in values of IP25, PBIP25 and PDIP25 (with the exception of H6, H4 and H1; Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The abrupt decrease in sea ice cover is in line with the abrupt increase in atmospheric temperatures at the beginning of D/O events1 and increase in sea surface temperatures as also seen in nearby record ENAM93-21/MD95-2009 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our data generally show a good correlation between climate and sea ice cover for MIS 3, as well as for the last 30,000 years (Figs 4 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that the presence/absence of sea ice varies closely in pace with the different climatic phases of the D/O millennial-scale climate events (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peak warm interstadials with no sea ice (Fig 7a) (Supplementary Fig 1 and Supplementary Table 1) resembled the modern conditions, which have been shown by numerous marine core studies from the northern North Atlantic and Nordic seas, and have generally been interpreted as a sign of strong flow of Atlantic surface water (Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transitional cooling phase of the insterstadial with gradually expanding sea ice cover from northwest (Figs 6b and 7b) correlate with increase in ice rafting from icebergs, decreasing atmospheric temperatures1 and an increasing amount of meltwater over a larger area of the northern North Atlantic region and Nordic seas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the following stadial events iceberg rafting reached a maximum (Figs 6c and 7c) as also seen in nearby core ENAM93-21/MD95-2009 and other records from the Nordic seas and North Atlantic (Supplementary Fig 1 and Supplementary Table 1), and 18O values reached very low values indicating presence of meltwater (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sea ice advanced and the sea ice cover became near-perennial in the case of smaller stadial events (Figs 6c and 7c) or perennial as during the colder H-events H6, H4 and H1 (Figs 6d and 7d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter events are the three strongest events during the last 90 kyr, probably due to orbital forcing2,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All stadial and H-events in the North Atlantic and Nordic seas show dominance by the polar planktic foraminifera Neogloboquadrina pachyderma sinistral (s) and cold polar conditions (see references in Supplementary Information;
