Multitrophic diversity in a biodiverse forest is highly nonlinear across spatial scales  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Subtropical and tropical forests are biodiversity hotspots, and untangling the spatial scaling of their diversity is fundamental for understanding global species richness and conserving biodiversity essential to human well-being.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, scale-dependent diversity distributions among coexisting taxa remain poorly understood for heterogeneous environments in biodiverse regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that diversity relations among 43 taxaincluding plants, arthropods and microorganismsin a mountainous subtropical forest are highly nonlinear across spatial scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taxon-specific differences in -diversity cause under- or overestimation of overall diversity by up to 50% when using surrogate taxa such as plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar relationships may apply to half of all (sub)tropical forestsincluding major biodiversity hotspotswhere high environmental heterogeneity causes high biodiversity and species turnover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study highlights that our general understanding of biodiversity patterns has to be improvedand that much larger areas will be required than in better-studied lowland foreststo reliably estimate biodiversity distributions and devise conservation strategies for the worlds biodiverse regions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Untangling the scale-dependency of - and -diversity among coexisting taxa is essential to understand the structuring of ecological systems, to estimate regional and global species richness, and to inform policy options on conservation1,2,3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, how exactly megadiverse groups such as arthropods and microorganisms scale in relation to more frequently assessed taxa, such as plants, is a matter of ongoing debate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This particularly applies when extrapolating assessments to landscape and regional scales in the most species-rich terrestrial regions of the world, subtropical and tropical forests2,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Most studies on scale-dependent biodiversity patterns in species-rich forests have focused on single taxa8,9,10,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those studies that have considered multiple taxa have analysed variousincluding non-foresthabitat types or restricted the spatial analyses to pairwise plot comparisons14,15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite their functional importance, microorganisms have so far been ignored in such studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study in a lowland neotropical rainforest, however, showed similarities in species turnover (-diversity) for a wide range of arthropod taxa7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By extrapolating local plot species inventories, that study showed that areas as small as 1 ha can harbour almost two-thirds of the landscape-scale species richness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the species richness of arthropods across all trophic levels was surprisingly well predicted by that of woody plants, and this strong relationship was independent of the geographic scale considered7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, whether these patterns can be extrapolated to species-rich forest types in more heterogeneous environments, and to other species-rich taxa such as microorganisms, is questionable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many highly diverse forests, and many of the worlds biodiversity hotspots18, are located in mountainous landscapes with heterogeneous topography, which results in a higher -diversity of many taxa than in more homogeneous lowland forests9,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may have consequences for the design and costs of biodiversity research and conservation, and for species richness estimates at larger spatial scales19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the species richness, turnover, and cross-taxon diversity congruence of plants, arthropods and, for the first time, soil microorganisms from the local plot to landscape scales in a highly diverse, and topographically and environmentally heterogeneous, subtropical forest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used multi-method species censuses of above- and below-ground organisms (woody and herbaceous plants; 10 arthropod taxa comprising herbivores, detritivores, predators and parasitoids; 12 groups of soil fungi and 19 groups of bacteria) and modelled species richness and area relationships (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data were obtained from 27 study plots that reflect the environmental heterogeneity typically found in the 8,000-ha mountainous study site, a national forest reserve in South-East China.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis shows that cross-taxon diversity relationships are highly nonlinear across spatial scales, with far-reaching consequences for our understanding of regional and global biodiversity patterns and their conservation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Sampling completeness', 'Altogether, we identified 1,008 (morpho)species of arthropods and plants with a total of 77,718 individuals, and 6,223 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of microorganisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Speciesarea relationships for all taxa were best modelled by asymptotic functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample coverage, a measure of sample completeness, approached values  greater than 90% relatively fast with increasing plot number, and was on average 97% across all taxa in 27 plots (with the exception of lepidopterans;

Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at any given spatial scale, the fractions of overall estimated species richness, and thus the degree of species turnover, differed strongly among taxa (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most arthropod taxa showed highest turnover rates between scales of 1 and 10 ha (Fig 1 barplots).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, turnover in weevils and lepidopterans was highest at scales  greater than 10 ha, and in bark beetles and all microorganisms at scales 1 ha (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences in turnover patterns among fungi and among bacteria were much less pronounced and much more similar than among arthropods (Fig 2 and Supplementary Figs 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, two different turnover patterns emerged for both fungi and bacteria: taxa with very little turnover at scales  greater than 1 ha (Fungi 1: for example, Archaeorhizomycetes, Leotiomycetes, Agaricomycetes) and taxa where large-scale turnover was slightly more noticeable (Fungi 2: for example, Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Tremellomycetes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, for some bacterial taxa, turnover was particularly high at the plot scale (Bacteria 1: for example, Acidobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Cyanobacteria), whereas for others it was highest at the scale of 0.5 ha (Bacteria 2: for example, Bacteroidetes, Deltaproteobacteria, Planctomycetes;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our study indicates that environmentally heterogeneous forests are characterized by a substantial turnover in the species richness of many taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Capturing a percentage of overall biodiversity similar to that obtained in 1 ha of lowland tropical forests7 would require much larger areas of up to 10 ha at our study site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar relationships may apply to a broad range of forest ecosystems in the subtropics and tropics, where high environmental heterogeneity promotes high overall biodiversity and causes higher rates of spatial species turnover than in lowland forests9,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This also includes major biodiversity hotspots21, emphasizing that we still lack a general understanding of diversity relationships in those regions of the world that are assumed to be the most diverse22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings underline that a better ecological understanding of scale-dependent biodiversity relationships in heterogeneous landscapes is needed if we aim to predict larger-scale biodiversity distributions in the most biodiverse regions on the Earth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This also applies to estimates of regional and global species numbers, which, so far, have been based largely on relatively homogeneous landscapes, such as lowland tropical forests2,7,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Focusing on homogeneous lowland forests ignores the fact that 47% of tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests are located in mountainous regions that are environmentally more heterogeneous (with a mean elevation of 997 m±689 s.d.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  than typical lowland forests (making up 53% of the forest area, at a mean elevation of 220 m±189 s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ; see Methods for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, our study suggests that the logistic efforts and costs required for the implementation of reliable biodiversity assessments will inevitably increase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same applies to conservation planning and the estimation of minimum areas required for the protection of the overall biodiversity of a larger region20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this respect, it might also be important to consider that the observed differences in turnover among taxa might affect the way the diversity and functions mediated by a given taxon are influenced by local disturbances, such as logging23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The nonlinear diversity relationships and scale-dependent changes in cross-taxon congruence indicate that it is not advisable to use single taxa as potential surrogates of overall biodiversity14,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, our results indicate that there might be distinct groups of taxa that show remarkable similarities in the scale-dependent increase of relative species richness (that is, herbs, diplopods and longhorn beetles; woody plants and ants; weevils and lepidopterans; spiders, centipedes and parasitic wasps; Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might allow for the identification of a complementary set of indicator taxa that can be used to infer diversity patterns for a wider range of organisms25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such an approach would help to better estimate and monitor overall biodiversity patterns and thus guide management decisions in poorly studied, species-rich regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, its effectiveness and transferability to other systems requires further investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrasting cross-taxon relationships have been reported from lowland tropical forests7,27, with even non-herbivorous arthropods showing a strong linear and apparently scale-independent increase with plant species richness7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might indicate that in lowland forests with a more homogenous abiotic environment, plant species richness is the most important driver of arthropod species richness7,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In contrast, environmental heterogeneity can affect interactions among trophic levels28 and decrease the impact of plant species richness relative to other environmental drivers19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that differences in the environmental conditions throughout our study site (and/or dispersal-based processes13) affect arthropods more strongly than woody plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even for herbivorous insects, patterns of species richness do not necessarily match those of their host plants in environmentally heterogeneous forests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other factors, such as plant biomass and topographically mediated environmental conditions, can be crucial in determining herbivore species richness19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A direct analysis of the ultimate drivers for the wide range of taxa (43) is beyond the scope of our study, as we address key aspects of diversity scaling with regard to biodiversity estimation and conservation, which presently lack a proper integration of highly diverse and environmentally heterogeneous ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, environmental conditions in our study system vary across scales in predictable ways and might be indicative of the drivers underlying the observed differences in spatial diversity scaling (Supplementary Fig 4; with for example, elevation and temperature related to large-scale turnover patterns such as in lepidopterans and weevils, soil N and C concentrations to medium-scale turnover such as in woody plants, and slope and pH with small-scale turnover such as in bark beetles or microorganisms).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding the scale dependence of the environmental drivers of the different taxa will be crucial for advanced insights into community assembly processes and the consequences of increasing anthropogenic impact on diversity distributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taxon-specific dispersal abilities13 and the niche breadth and degree of resource specialization of species20,29 are likely to play an important role in this respect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, saproxylic bark beetles show very low host specificity30, and the diversity of saproxylic beetles can be largely determined by the availability of deadwood29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a protected forest reserve such as the Gutianshan National Nature Reserve (GNNR), these resources are readily available throughout the forest and thus could lead to high levels of local-scale diversity and low spatial turnover of bark beetles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, many herbivore arthropods show a higher niche specialization31 and even generalist predators such as spiders, while often less specific in their food requirements, have been shown to exhibit pronounced and fine-scaled adaptations to structural and microclimatic conditions32 that can result in high spatial species turnover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For soil microorganisms, the lower spatial turnover of bacteria and, to a lesser extent, soil fungi as compared with that of plants is concordant with global distribution patterns and can be partly attributed to their high dispersal capacity33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, soil microorganisms might respond to environmental heterogeneity on much smaller scales than aboveground macroorganisms34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This likely leads to a high turnover at scales much smaller than those considered in our study, particularly for bacteria, but does not affect our findings for the spatial scales considered in our analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although more fine-scaled sampling within plots would thus probably reveal additional insights at the sub-plot level, our sampling approach for microorganisms, with four replicate composite samples per plot, aggregates microsite variation at the plot level and enables adequate comparison with arthropods and plants at the plot level and beyond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the indication of two different spatial turnover patterns for fungal and bacterial groups that comprise taxa with differing functional or ecological characteristics (for example, Agaricomycetes and Alphaproteobacteria) suggests the need for further detailed analysis of small-scale distribution patterns at the level of more finely resolved functional groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although our study covers all strata from the soil to the canopy, most taxa were sampled in the lower forest strata.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A complete species census for the estimation of the total species richness at our study site is therefore not available and was not our aim.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that the species richness of lower forest strata can equal that of the canopy in species-rich forests35,36, the relationships we report may nevertheless be relevant for total biodiversity patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, results did not differ qualitatively between taxa with an expected high species richness in the canopy (for example, spiders, weevils, longhorn beetles) and taxa largely restricted to lower strata, for which a large proportion of the total diversity has likely already been sampled (for example, diplopods, herbs; Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that our study has a strong focus on functional groups (for example, taxa with specific feeding ecologies in arthropods), which may differ in their Linnean rank.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These taxonomic ranks can suffer from inconsistencies when it comes to comparisons among different taxa37, and our study thus adopts an ecological rather than strictly taxonomic perspective (but note that our data on microorganisms, while analysed at the OTU level, represent a comparatively coarse distinction of taxonomic and ecological groups).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we analysed the relative scaling of species richness patterns (rather than comparing absolute richness values or analysing community composition patterns), our results are unlikely to be strongly affected by the potential variation in abundance patterns of individual species in a community between different sampling years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The nonlinear relationships we observed complicate attempts for regions of high environmental heterogeneity to reliably predict diversity across multiple trophic levels based on plant inventories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that upscaling species richness relationships from smaller (for example, data from 1 ha) to larger scales, and vice versa, downscaling from regional and landscape scale assessments to local-scale relationships, can be problematic24,38 and emphasizes the need for more intensive studies of biodiversity patterns in the worlds most biodiverse regions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

corrected for small sample sizes) for each taxon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Models that indicated non-normality or heteroscedasticity of the residuals with the model validation procedure implemented in mmSAR were excluded in the model selection procedure59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the best-fitting model, species richness data were then extrapolated to the 8,000 ha of the GNNR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our analyses, we paid special attention to the 1 and 10 ha scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 1 ha scale was suggested in a previous analysis in tropical forests to capture almost two-thirds of the overall arthropod species richness7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We considered the 10 ha scale to be particularly relevant for our analyses as our study site is environmentally much more heterogeneous than many lowland tropical forest sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although model uncertainty may arise if two or more models have similar AICc values, this was not the case in our study and a single best-fitting function (with a AICc greater than 2) was identified in all of our analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As the distance among plots might affect the extrapolation results60, we re-ran the analyses with a reduced set of 17 of the 27 plots located in the core area of the reserve (approximately halving the average distance between plots from 3.4 to 1.8 km).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This enabled us to check to what extent the relative increase in species richness with area of our 43 focal taxa was potentially influenced by the spatial arrangement of the plots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As a component of -diversity, we calculated the effective species turnover across five scales (0.1 ha as the mean plot scale, 0.5, 1, 10 and 8,000 ha of the whole reserve) using the additive partitioning method of overall species richness (in our case the estimated species richness for the whole reserve) after ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, overall species richness =Plot+Plot+0.5 ha+1 ha+10 ha+Reserve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We used two different approaches to analyse the cross-taxon congruence of species richness patterns of the focal taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, plant species richness is commonly assumed to strongly influence the species richness of other organism groups, and woody plants characterize forest ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore assessed the extent to which the species richness of herbaceous plants, arthropods and microorganisms deviates from an expected linear relationship with woody plant species richness across scales from the local plot scale (0.1 ha) to the landscape scale (the 8,000 ha of the whole reserve).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the linear relationship, we extrapolated the relationship predicted by a linear regression between the species richness of woody plants and that of a given taxon at the 1-ha scale to the area of the whole reserve (see insets in Fig 1 for details), as other studies have suggested a close fit of arthropod species richness with that of woody plants at this scale7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, allowing for nonlinear relationships among the species richness of the focal taxa, we compared the percent deviation of the relative species richness of each taxon to the mean relative species richness across all taxa (and thus the relative differences among all taxa) from the plot scale to the spatial scales at which 100% of the focal taxas species richness was attained (see Fig 2 for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To estimate sample completeness of the species richness of the focal taxa, we calculated sample coverage according to ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample coverage (equation 4a in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  62) indicates the degree of sample completeness by estimating the proportion of the total number of individuals in a sample that belong to the species recorded in this sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher the sample coverage, the less likely it is that an additionally sampled individual will belong to a previously unrecorded species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated sample coverage for all possible combinations (or, as the number of combinations was excessively large for combinations of 6 to 21 plots, for a random draw of 100,000 combinations) of 1, 2, 3,... 27 plots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Moist broadleaf forest cover was calculated from the percentage cover of planar ( less_than 500 m a.s.l.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and montane moist broadleaf forest ( greater than 500 m a.s.l.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in the tropics and subtropics, and the mean elevation (±s.d.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of these regions, by overlaying the outline of the Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests region provided by ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  63 with elevation data provided by ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated the overall area covered by grid cells in planar and montane forest and averaged the elevation data per grid cell for both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'All analyses were conducted in R 3.1.0 (http://www.r-project.org).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
