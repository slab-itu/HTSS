Pre-plaque conformational changes in Alzheimers disease-linked A and APP  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Reducing levels of the aggregation-prone A peptide that accumulates in the brain with Alzheimers disease (AD) has been a major target of experimental therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternative approach may be to stabilize the physiological conformation of A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, the physiological state of A in brain remains unclear, since the available methods used to process brain tissue for determination of A aggregate conformation can in themselves alter the structure and/or composition of the aggregates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, using synchrotron-based Fourier transform infrared micro-spectroscopy, non-denaturing gel electrophoresis and conformational specific antibodies we show that the physiological conformations of A and amyloid precursor protein (APP) in brain of transgenic mouse models of AD are altered before formation of amyloid plaques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, focal A aggregates in brain that precede amyloid plaque formation localize to synaptic terminals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes in the states of A and APP that occur prior to plaque formation may provide novel targets for AD therapy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Studies on the aggregation state of -amyloid peptide (A) in brain typically have relied on brain tissue being processed by techniques including homogenization, high-speed centrifugation and/or enrichment, all of which may themselves trigger alterations in protein structure and state of assembly of aggregation-prone proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, assaying whole-brain homogenate can make it difficult to detect localized pathology, which may occur in the early stages of the disease, before gradually progressing through the brain over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A central question in AD concerns the mechanism by which A structure contributes to neuropathology1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The up to 42/43 amino acid long A peptides, cleaved from within the larger amyloid precursor protein (APP), are generally thought to normally exist in brain as monomers that then with age abnormally aggregate to insoluble fibrils in AD brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasingly, soluble oligomers have been viewed as the neurotoxic form of A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Various structures of A oligomers are seen as important in AD, including particularly dimers, trimers, dodecamers and larger amyloid beta-derived diffusible ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, studies on A in brain tissue have generally relied on standard SDS gel electrophoresis or other methods, which can alter native protein conformations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, at present, no consensus exists regarding the structures of A species in brain associated with disease pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, to analyse the early changes in A structure in brains of AD transgenic mouse models of -amyloidosis, we used the non-destructive techniques of synchrotron-based two-dimensional Fourier transform infrared micro-spectroscopy imaging (FTIR) and blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) complemented with 3D confocal immunofluorescence microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'BN-PAGE is a separation method that is sensitive to alterations in the conformation of a protein and is therefore useful for the study of protein aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined with western blot it provides higher sensitivity to detect A than gel filtration or sucrose density ultra-centrifugation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FTIR detects vibrations of main-chain carbonyl groups that occur in the wavenumber range of 1,600 to 1,700 cm1 (Amide I region)2, allowing for the detection of specifically -sheet structures3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, no tissue processing is required, and non-volatile tissue components that could be affected or lost during chemical processing remain in situ and contribute to the infrared spectrum2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FTIR permits for the acquisition of spectra from samples as low as 100 pg (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5); however, FTIR is a non-destructive technique, since mid-IR photons are too low in energy (0.050.5 eV) to either break chemical bonds or to cause ionization6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using FTIR it was shown that amyloid fibrils and native -sheet proteins produce different Amide I bands8, as they differ by the structural variability of the residues constructing their sheets, the average number of strands per sheet, and twist angles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different morphologies of purified amyloid fibrils and native -sheet proteins were confirmed in vitro by cryo-electron microscopy9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although in vitro and in vivo environments are of course different and ideal controls for the FTIR experiments of brain tissue are challenging, FTIR has been used to specifically detect amyloid fibrils in tissue sections10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we provide evidence of localized -sheet elevations in brain tissue of AD transgenic mice using FTIR that precede amyloid plaque formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, using BN-PAGE we show the loss of a low molecular weight A complex and emergence of higher weight A and APP complexes in AD transgenic mouse brains that occur concomitant with this pre-plaque rise in -sheet content by FTIR.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Pre-plaque -sheet transition in transgenic AD models', 'To focus on the development of amyloid pathology, we used young AD transgenic Tg19959 mice harbouring two familial AD mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which show initial amyloid plaques at or just before 3 months of age12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FTIR spectral maps were recorded in chemically unprocessed brain sections of Tg19959 and wild-type mice at 1, 2 and 3 months of age (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We verified that the sample preparation used for our FTIR imaging of cryo-dried brain tissue did not introduce artificial -sheet formation, since change of -sheet did not occur with cryo-drying of synthetic A42 preparations (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in intensity of a band around 1,627 cm1 in the amide I region of the infrared spectra (red on the FTIR maps; Fig 1a) correlated with the age of Tg19959 mice and is indicative of increased -sheet structures already developing between 1 and 2 months, which is before amyloid plaque formation as determined by thioflavin S (ThS) staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To better resolve the peak positions for -sheet structures at around 1,627 cm1 and the band centred at 1,656 cm1 (a frequency characteristic of -helical structures), we performed a second derivative analysis10,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second derivative spectra of wild type and 1 month-old Tg animals displayed a peak at around 1,640 cm1, which together with the less intense bands above 1,675 cm1, can be assigned to the intra-molecular -sheet structures of native proteins10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second derivative spectra of AD transgenic animals are characterized by a peak at about 1,627 cm1, due to inter-molecular -sheet structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inter-molecular -sheet content increased only in AD transgenic and not in wild-type mouse brains at these ages (Fig 1bg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This type of intermolecular -sheet structure has been described as amyloid aggregates in brain tissue samples analysed by FTIR (refs 11, 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, -sheet content in brain sections of 1-month-old Tg19959 mice was similar to those of wild-type mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunolabelling of post-fixed brain sections adjacent to the FTIR brain sections with a C-terminal specific A42 antibody indicated age-related increases of A42 in transgenic but not wild-type mouse brain tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, A42 labelling in 2 month-old Tg19959 mice was punctate, and therefore not consistent with pre-fibrillar diffuse plaques, whereas -sheet structures detected by FTIR appear over significantly wider areas of cortex (Supplementary Fig 2a), which likely is to some extent due to the lower spatial resolution of FTIR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To complement the FTIR data, we used the conformation-specific antibody OC (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15) and ThS, which are both considered indicators of fibrillar amyloid structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the adjacent Tg19959 brain sections to those showing early -sheet structures by FTIR did not show evidence of amyloid fibrils with antibody OC or ThS (Supplementary Figs 3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of ThS and OC antibody labelling may be due to the low concentration of fibrils and/or dye specificity, that ThS and OC labelling do not detect all types of fibrils16,17, or due to a non-fibrillar nature of the -sheet structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "Figure 1: Early -structural transition in transgenic AD mouse brains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) FTIR maps were integrated for the -sheet spectral region at 1,6351,620 cm1 to visualize absorption intensities for the -sheet content in brain sections of Tg19959 (upper panels) and wild type (lower panels) mice at 1, 2 and 3 months, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -sheet content is shown in red (arrows).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maps are representative; N=3; N represents the number of animals per genotype/age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 50 m.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Here we provide evidence that the physiological conformation of A in brain on BN-PAGE is consistent with synthetic A1-42 tetramers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, tetramers were also the preferred state of freshly prepared A1-42 run on the native gels (Fig 4a; Supplementary Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Native gels are less accurate when it comes to molecular weight, and running the same synthetic A1-42 preparations on semi-denaturing and SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) gels showed progressive loss of the tetramer band, and indicated that this tetramer band runs closer to a 14 kD molecular weight marker (not shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also noticed that the A42 specific antibodies detected the band consistent with A42 tetramers in brain but not the synthetic A1-42 tetramers (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously reported that A42 specific antibodies react predominantly to A1-42 monomers20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the observations in Fig 4b suggest that the structure of the A band that appears consistent with a tetramer in brain differs from synthetic A1-42 tetramers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that, for example, associated lipid components and/or N- and/or C-terminally modified A peptides contribute to this difference between this low molecular weight A complex in brain compared to synthetic A42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Importantly, we demonstrate that the loss of this physiological state of A in AD transgenic mouse brain before plaque formation is concomitant with the appearance of increased -sheet content by FTIR; however this is not ThS or OC antibody positive, pointing to a non-fibrillar character of early -sheet formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although, the differences between transgenic and wild type animals in the FTIR spectra related to -structures and age-related increases in A42 are evident, development of new antibodies which are both specific to -structures and to A will be helpful to determine whether the -sheet structures detected by FTIR in brain tissue of transgenic animals originate from A42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, we present evidence consistent with aggregation of APP concomitant with A pathogenesis, which may be contributing to the pre-plaque increase in -structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the increase of A is concomitant with an apparent change in APP structure, and since in vitro experiments support that A may bind APP, it is possible that binding of A may cause changes in APP structure that interfere with physiological processing of APP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dystrophic neurites, associated with amyloid plaques, are known to accumulate APP, as well as A42 and the -site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1, supporting the concept that such dystrophies are the nidus of amyloid plaque formation20,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is of considerable interest that the destabilization and loss of the native state of normally tetrameric transthyretin has been found to promote subsequent aggregation of transthyretin into the -sheet rich pathologic amyloid found in patients with transthyretin amyloidosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, pharmacological stabilization of the physiological transthyretin tetramers led to the approval of the first drug that slows down the progression of an amyloidosis in the clinic26,27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Growing evidence also suggests that the native oligomeric structure of -synuclein associated with Parkinsons disease is a tetramer29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the current study supports the concept that the native and physiological conformations of proteins linked pathologically and genetically to AD might also be altered in the disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stabilization of the physiological structure might therefore be considered among novel therapeutic approaches.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
