Glucose represses dendritic cell-induced T cell responses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Glucose and glycolysis are important for the proinflammatory functions of many immune cells, and depletion of glucose in pathological microenvironments is associated with defective immune responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show a contrasting function for glucose in dendritic cells (DCs), as glucose represses the proinflammatory output of LPS-stimulated DCs and inhibits DC-induced T-cell responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A glucose-sensitive signal transduction circuit involving the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), HIF1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) coordinates DC metabolism and function to limit DC-stimulated T-cell responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When multiple T cells interact with a DC, they compete for nutrients, which can limit glucose availability to the DCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In such DCs, glucose-dependent signalling is inhibited, altering DC outputs and enhancing T-cell responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data reveal a mechanism by which T cells regulate the DC microenvironment to control DC-induced T-cell responses and indicate that glucose is an important signal for shaping immune responses.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cellular metabolism has emerged as an important regulator of immune cell function not only through facilitating the energy and biosynthetic demands of the cell but also through directly controlling important immune cell functions1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glycolysis is important for the proinflammatory functions of multiple immune cell subsets; glycolytic enzymes and metabolites can regulate immune signalling and effector functions2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is described in many immune cells as a central regulator of immune cell metabolism that promotes elevated levels of glycolysis through promoting the activity of the transcription factors cMyc and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1), which induce the expression of glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes4,5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mTORC1 is important in controlling the differentiation and function of immune cells, and it is becoming clear that this is achieved in part through the regulation of cellular metabolic pathways4,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the mTORC1-specific inhibitor rapamycin was originally characterized as a potent immunosuppressant required for the generation of effector T-cell responses, inhibition of mTORC1 in myeloid cells actually results in increased inflammatory outputs10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, mTORC1 signalling can be either proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory depending on the immune cell subset, although it is not clear whether mTORC1-controlled metabolic alterations are important for these differential effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Dendritic cells (DCs) undergo substantial changes in function following immune activation to adopt an important role in stimulating immune responses, and these functional changes are associated with altered metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In DCs differentiated from bone marrow in the presence of the growth factor granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (GM-DCs), rates of cellular glycolysis are rapidly increased, within minutes, once activated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then over the course of 18 h, GM-DCs switch to a highly glycolytic metabolism; GM-DCs display increased glycolytic rates and an inactivation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this point postactivation (18 h), DCs would normally have reached the draining lymph node where they would be interacting with T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The balance between glycolysis and OXPHOS is an important effector of immune cell differentiation and the modulation of inflammatory responses14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there is some evidence that OXPHOS levels affect DC function, the relationship between DC metabolism and DC-induced T-cell responses is not well defined17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As the flux through cellular metabolic pathways is controlled by the supply of nutrients, there is renewed interest in nutrient levels in immune microenvironments and how they affect immune responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, reduced glucose levels in the tumour microenvironment can directly impact upon T-cell receptor signalling and inhibit antitumour T-cell responses3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that nutrient levels will also be important for immune cell function at sites of bacterial and viral infections where there is considerably increased demand for nutrients, such as glucose18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DCs experience diverse microenvironments within tissue, at inflammatory sites and as they migrate to the draining lymph nodes where they activate T cells, often interacting with numerous T cells at a time20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not clear how the availability of nutrients within these microenvironments affects DC metabolic pathways to control DC function and the induction of T cells responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we establish that glucose represses DC inflammatory outputs and thus DC-induced T-cell proliferation and interferon- (IFN) production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A complex glucose-sensing mTORC1/HIF1/inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) signalling circuit integrates information about glucose levels in the local microenvironment to coordinate DC metabolism and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Competitive uptake of glucose by activated T cells can starve DCs of glucose, inactivate this glucose-sensing signalling circuit and promote proinflammatory DC outputs to enhance T-cell responses.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Glucose deprivation enhances DC-induced T-cell responses', 'Increased glycolysis is required immediately following LPS activation of DCs to facilitate an expansion of the biosynthetic machinery, that is, the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum apparatus22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, elevated glycolysis is also a feature of DC metabolism for prolonged periods after activation at points when DCs interact with T cells and promote T-cell responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To establish the role that glucose and increased rates of glycolysis play for DC-induced T-cell responses, GM-DCs were switched from glucose into galactose 8 h after LPS stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Galactose is an alternative cellular fuel to glucose that can be metabolized by glycolysis and OXPHOS to provide energy for the cell but galactose can only maintain low rates of glycolysis in GM-DCs (Fig 1a)2,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Removing glucose and limiting the rate of glycolysis in this way affected the expression of the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 on activated GM-DCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LPS-induced expression of CD80 and CD86 peaked at 24 h and then declined 48 and 72 h after stimulation when GM-DCs are cultured with glucose (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, glucose deprived GM-DCs, that is, cells cultured in galactose, maintained high levels of CD80 and CD86 for the duration of the 72 h post LPS stimulation (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During this time course, there were no differences in GM-DC viability (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Levels of another costimulatory molecule CD40 were unchanged in the absence of glucose (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cytokines produced by DCs are another important signal for shaping the T-cell immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glucose-deprived GM-DCs expressed elevated levels of Il12a mRNA but normal levels of Il10 mRNA (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar increases in Il12a mRNA were observed when GM-DC were cultured in decreasing concentrations of glucose (Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, the impact of these functional changes on DC-stimulated T-cell responses was investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GM-DCs were LPS-stimulated, pulsed with the peptide SIINFEKL and cultured in the presence of glucose or galactose for up to 72 h. At the indicated time points after LPS activation, GM-DCs from each condition were washed, placed into glucose-containing media and then co-cultured with purified CD8+ OTI T cells for a further 48 h. CD8+ OTI transgenic T cells express a single T-cell receptor that recognizes major histocompatibility complex I-bound SIINFEKL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GM-DCs cultured in glucose or galactose activated T cells equivalently as determined by T-cell blastogenesis and increased CD69 expression (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, distinct differences in the nature of the T-cell response were observed in the absence of glucose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The capacity of glucose-cultured GM-DCs to induce OTI T-cell clonal expansion declined at 48 h and was lost at 72 h post LPS stimulation (Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, GM-DCs cultured in galactose retained the ability to induce T-cell clonal expansion for the duration of the 72 h stimulation (Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glucose-deprived GM-DCs also induced increased IFN production in T cells 72 h post LPS stimulation (Fig 2eg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A direct effect of galactose on the phenotype of LPS-stimulated GM-DC was excluded as GM-DCs cultured in glucose or glucose plus galactose were phenotypically identical and stimulated equivalent T-cell responses (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the data show that glucose negatively impacts upon GM-DC-induced T-cell responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Glucose represses GM-DCs expression of costimulatory molecules and IL-12.GM-DCs were left unstimulated (Unstim) or

signal transduction pathways', 'The data showed that between 8 and 24 h post LPS-stimulation GM-DCs undergo glycolytic reprogramming, the increased expression of glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A key observation was that in addition to directly limiting the rate of glycolysis, switching GM-DCs from glucose to galactose also prevented glycolytic reprogramming of LPS-stimulated GM-DCs (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data argue that glucose affects metabolic signal transduction pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transcription factors cMyc and HIF1 are both described to promote the expression of glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes in immune cells5,6,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As cMyc is not expressed in DCs25, we investigated whether glucose is required for the activity of HIF1 in LPS-stimulated GM-DCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LPS stimulation of GM-DCs resulted in the increased expression of HIF1 protein but not that of Hif1a mRNA (Fig 3c, Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased HIF1 protein corresponded to elevated HIF1 transcriptional activity, based on the expression of prolyl hydroxylase 3 (Phd3) mRNA, an established HIF1 target gene (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specificity of these assays was confirmed using HIF1-null GM-DC (Hif1a/) from Hif1aflox/floxVav-Cre mice; these GM-DCs do not express HIF1 protein or Phd3 mRNA (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LPS-induced HIF1 activity was observed 16 h after stimulation and so correlated with LPS-induced glycolytic reprogramming (Fig 3a, Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether HIF1 expression or activity was sensitive to glucose availability, LPS-stimulated GM-DCs were cultured in decreasing concentrations of glucose and HIF1 protein levels and Phd3 mRNA levels ascertained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reducing the concentration of glucose from 10 to 2 mM was sufficient to prevent LPS-induced HIF1 protein expression and activity (Fig 3d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second complementary approach that involved replacing glucose with galactose also prevented LPS-stimulated HIF1 expression and activity (Fig 3e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, interestingly, these two approaches regulate HIF1 protein expression through distinct mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decreased glucose concentrations activated the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), as measured by increased phosphorylation of the AMPK substrate acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC; Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AMPK is a kinase that is activated when cells are experiencing energy stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In CD8 T cells, glucose deprivation activates AMPK to result in the inhibition of mTORC1 signalling26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, mTORC1 is also inactive in GM-DCs cultured in low glucose, as measured by the phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrate p70 S6-kinase (pS6K) and the S6K substrate S6 ribosomal protein (pS6) (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As our previous work in CD8 T cells showed that mTORC1 activity is essential for HIF1 expression, it was reasoned that mTORC1 inactivation in these GM-DCs leads to loss of HIF1 activity5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, as predicted the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin abolishes HIF1 protein expression and activity in LPS-stimulated GM-DCs (Fig 3g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, decreasing glucose levels inhibits HIF1 activity via the inactivation of mTORC1 signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, replacing glucose with galactose does not activate AMPK nor does it inactivate mTORC1 signalling (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because, while culturing GM-DCs in galactose only maintains low levels of glycolysis, it results in increased rather than decreased rates of OXPHOS coupled to ATP synthesis, which is sufficient to avoid energy crisis and AMPK activation (Fig 3h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, an alternative mTORC1-independent mechanism must underpin the lack of HIF1 protein expression under these conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3:

downregulate OXPHOS (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous reports have shown that nitric oxide (NO) produced by iNOS is responsible for the inactivation of OXPHOS in LPS-stimulated GM-DCs13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we considered whether glucose is required for iNOS expression and NO production in LPS-activated GM-DCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data showed that LPS-induced NO production was completely blocked in galactose-cultured GM-DCs, as determined by measuring nitrite levels in the culture medium (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that galactose-cultured GM-DCs have lost HIF1 expression, we investigated whether the loss of iNOS expression may be related to defective HIF1 activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  iNOS expression and activity was measured under multiple experimental conditions that inhibit HIF1 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rapamycin-treated GM-DCs that do not express HIF1 (Fig 3g) are also deficient for iNOS expression, NO production and they do not inactivate

activity is required for iNOS expression in LPS-stimulated GM-DCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next considered whether HIF1 expression is sufficient to promote iNOS expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A family of prolyl hydroxylases target HIF1 for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation, thus repressing HIF1 protein levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HIF1 protein levels increase when these prolyl hydroxylases are inhibited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While GM-DCs lacking mTORC1 activity do not express HIF1 or iNOS (Fig 5c), promoting the stabilization of HIF1 protein with the prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG) is sufficient to induce Nos2 mRNA and protein expression and to increase NO production (Fig 5g,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, experiments that disrupted iNOS activity in LPS-stimulated GM-DCs revealed that HIF1 protein expression is also dependent on iNOS activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct inhibition of iNOS, using the specific inhibitor S-ethylisothiourea (SEITU), prevented HIF1 protein expression and activity in LPS-stimulated GM-DCs (Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NO production by iNOS requires the substrate arginine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depriving GM-DCs of arginine prevented NO production in LPS-stimulated GM-DC and inhibited HIF1 activity (Fig 6b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arginine deprivation did not inhibit mTORC1 signalling arguing that reduced HIF1 activity was due to decreased NO production (Fig 6c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with decreased HIF1 activity, arginine deprivation prevented LPS-induced glycolysis and glycolytic reprogramming (Fig 6d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, GM-DCs were generated from iNOS knockout mice; these cells did not express HIF1 protein or Phd3 mRNA in response to LPS stimulation (Fig 6f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species are known inhibitors of the prolyl hydroxylases that target HIF1 for degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the data suggest that NO is required for HIF1 stabilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data show that HIF1 and iNOS have a reciprocal relationship, and each molecule is required for the expression of the other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A time course analysis of Nos2 mRNA expression and HIF1 activity (Phd3 mRNA expression) revealed that Nos2 mRNA expression but not HIF1 activity is increased 4 h after LPS activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is an additional increase in Nos2 mRNA expression observed after 16 h that coincides with the induction of Phd3 expression, that is, HIF1 activity (Supplementary Fig 2b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data support a model

'This study has characterized a complex signalling circuit in GM-DCs that is sensitive to the available levels of glucose but also to the availability of other nutrients (Fig 8a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amino acid availability can also impact upon this signalling circuit through inhibiting NO production or mTORC1 activity (Fig 6b, Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Systemic levels of glucose are tightly controlled and glucose levels do not drop to low levels even in the starved state; this is not surprising given the importance of glucose as a cellular fuel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there is a growing appreciation that glucose levels can become limiting in discrete microenvironments, such as the tumour or inflammatory microenvironments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Close interactions with T cells are central to the function of DCs to stimulate T-cell responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that during immune activation T cells have a substantially increased demand for glucose and the fact that multiple activating T cells can form clusters around a single DC20,21, we reasoned that these circumstances could result in glucose becoming limiting within the immediate DC microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate whether activating T cells could limit the nutrient levels available to DCs, we measured the uptake of the fluorescent glucose analogue 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-2-deoxyglucose (NBDG) into T cells and GM-DCs in co-culture experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SIINFEKL-pulsed GM-DCs were co-cultured with increasing numbers of purified CD8 OTI T cells for 20 h and NBDG uptake analysed by flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing the ratio of T cells to DCs resulted in decreased levels of NBDG uptake into GM-DCs (Fig 8b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the level of NBDG uptake into the T cells was equivalent for all DC:T-cell ratios, indicating that there was not a global deficit in NBDG in these cultures (Fig 8b, Supplementary Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data argue that T cells can limit glucose uptake into GM-DCs due to competitive uptake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that glucose deprivation can result in the inhibition of mTORC1 signalling (Fig 3e)26, we considered whether mTORC1 signalling was altered in GM-DCs in these co-culture experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing numbers of T cells resulted in decreased levels of pS6 within the GM-DCs but not in T cells (Fig 8c, Supplementary Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pS6 levels were also investigated in GM-DCs by confocal microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LPS-stimulated GM-DCs cultured at a 1:2 DC:T-cell ratio were observed to have high levels of pS6 (white arrows), as compared to the rapamycin-negative control (Fig 8d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, when cultured at a 1:10 DC:T-cell ratio, T cells were observed to cluster around GM-DCs and pS6 levels within the GM-DCs were comparable to the rapamycin control (yellow arrows; Fig 8d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The T cells within these DC:T-cell clusters maintained high levels of pS6, indicating that the T cells were nutrient replete (Fig 8d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the 1:10 DC:T-cell ratio cultures, there were a minority of GM-DCs that were only interacting with a small number of T cells and these GM-DCs had high levels of pS6 (white arrow compared to yellow arrow; Fig 8f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the data suggest that local nutrient depletion in the GM-DC microenvironment results in the loss of mTORC1 signalling as opposed to a global deficit of nutrients in the cultures (Fig 8df).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the signalling circuit identified in this study (Fig 8a), reduced mTORC1 signalling would be predicted to result in decreased HIF1 and iNOS activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As CD8 T cells do not produce NO, we determined the level of NO production in these cultures as a measure of HIF1/iNOS signalling in the GM-DCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a clear decrease in NO production in the co-cultures with increased CD8 T cells (Fig 8g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with a role for glucose and mTORC1/HIF1/iNOS signalling in repressing DC-induced T-cell responses, there was increased IFN production in OTI T cells activated under conditions where nutrient availability to GM-DCs was limited (Fig 8h, Supplementary Fig 4d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerous studies have demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1, using the inhibitor rapamycin, increased the proinflammatory outputs of human and murine DC subsets that do not express iNOS27,28,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggested to us that the inhibition of mTORC1 due to nutrient deprivation in iNOS-negative DC would also lead to enhanced T-cell responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, Nos2/ GM-DCs were co-cultured with different ratios of OTI T cells, as above, and IFN expression in the T cells was assessed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As predicted, increasing the numbers of T cells interacting with the Nos2/ GM-DCs resulted in elevated levels of IFN production in CD8 T cells (Fig 8i,j), though the magnitude of the differences were less than those observed in GM-DCs

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The present study explores the signalling pathways that link glucose in the local microenvironment to changes in DC metabolism and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A key finding was that glucose represses the proinflammatory functions of GM-DCs, inhibiting the induction of T-cell proliferation and IFN production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glucose does not prevent DC-induced T-cell activation but it changes the course of the T-cell response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glucose-deprived GM-DCs show increased costimulatory molecule and IL12 expression, signals known to be important for the induction of T-cell proliferation and the acquisition of T-cell effector functions31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the observed changes in the T-cell response correlate to the functional changes in glucose-starved GM-DCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data argue that glucose represents an important signal that can impact upon the outcome of the T-cell response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study shows that a complex signalling circuit involving mTORC1, HIF1 and iNOS relays signals from the local DCs microenvironment regarding glucose availability to coordinate the metabolic and functional changes in LPS-stimulated DCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This circuit is also sensitive to the levels of amino acids such as leucine and arginine that are required for mTORC1 and iNOS activity, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NO that originates from exogenous sources such as local macrophages will also regulate this signalling circuit33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerous studies have demonstrated that the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin increases the proinflammatory outputs of DCs: increased IL12 and costimulatory molecule expression27,28,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, inhibition of mTORC1 in human or mouse DCs during TLR stimulation augments the proliferation of effector CD4+ T cells in vitro29,34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All these studies inhibited mTORC1 pharmacologically, but we now present a model where this can occur physiologically due to nutrient deprivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the data show that nutrient deprivation of Nos2/ GM-DCs also enhances CD8 T-cell priming, indicating that this model is likely to be applicable to multiple DC subsets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, this represents a new regulatory axis for the control of DC proinflammatory functions and T-cell responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'iNOS and mTORC1 have previously been shown to be important for the metabolic shift from OXPHOS to glycolysis in DCs13,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study now reveals the transcription factor HIF1 as the key molecular link required for the sustained induction of glycolysis in LPS-stimuated DCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data show that HIF1 and iNOS activities are closely connected in LPS-activated GM-DCs with the expression of each reliant on the activity of the other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In non-immune cells, hypoxia-induced HIF1 has been shown to bind to DNA elements in the Nos2 promoter and increase gene expression, while NO has been reported to induce HIF1 protein expression, though the exact mechanisms involved are not clear36,37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this signalling circuit will certainly be different in DC subsets that do not express iNOS, it is likely that HIF1 will still be central to the control of cellular glycolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, splenic DCs stimulated in vivo in mice following poly(I:C) injection increase glycolysis and inactivate OXPHOS in a HIF1-dependant manner even though they do not express iNOS39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The question arises as to how these cells inhibit OXPHOS in the absence of iNOS expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein we demonstrate that HIF1 protein expression is induced in GM-DCs that lack the expression of iNOS in response to exogenously derived NO from sources such as proinflammatory macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, another study demonstrated that iNOS knockout GM-DCs can inhibit OXPHOS normally in response to LPS but only when co-cultured with wild-type GM-DCs, thus demonstrating that NO-dependent inhibition of OXPHOS can be a cell-extrinsic effect17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it seems likely that exogenously derived NO has an important regulatory role for DC metabolism and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Certainly, NO produced by phagocytes has been shown to diffuse across membranes to act upon multiple cells in the local microenvironment33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, DC expression of HIF1 appears to be essential for the metabolic changes that occur in activated DCs, while NO can originate from iNOS expressed within the DCs or may originate from other cells in the local microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This study reveals that in GM-DCs, there are two glucose-sensing mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AMPK/mTORC1 signalling axis can sense decreasing glucose concentrations to result in the loss of HIF1 protein expression and activity and leading to decreased iNOS expression and NO production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is consistent with our previous work in CD8 T cells that showed glucose withdrawal inhibits mTORC1 signalling following the activation of AMPK26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the data show that HIF1 protein expression is directly sensitive to glucose deprivation in GM-DCs independently of mTORC1 activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, it was demonstrated that glucose is required for the protein expression of cMyc in CD8 T cells because glucose feeds the glucosamine pathway that is required for GlcNAcylation of proteins, the reversible addition of UDP-GlcNAc to serine or threonine residues40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, one potential mTORC1-independent mechanism for promoting HIF1 stabilization is through protein GlcNAcylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, GlcNAcylation has been linked to HIF1 protein expression by one study in tumour cells41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further work is required to identify mTORC1-independent mechanisms linking glucose availability to HIF1 expression in DCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Multiple lines of evidence have described cellular glycolysis as having proinflammatory functions in immune cells24,42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a number of studies have described examples where glycolysis can have immunosuppressive functions; glycolysis is important for certain regulatory T cells subsets both in mice and humans44,45; glycolysis is required for the maintenance of DC tolerance in a vitamin D-induced DC tolerance model46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, it is becoming clear that HIF1 can also promote anti-inflammatory effects under certain conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, under conditions of hypoxia HIF1 has been directly linked to the expression of the immunosuppressive molecules PD-L1 and miR-210 in myeloid cells47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While most studies to date in T cells and macrophages suggest that HIF1 plays a predominantly proinflammatory role, the data in DCs are less clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several papers have shown that HIF1 is required for DC migration, particularly in a hypoxic environment and for IFN production49,50,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, an understanding of the role HIF1 plays in DC-induced T-cell responses is still developing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early reports suggested that HIF1 was required for costimulatory molecule and proinflammatory molecule expression in DCs, as knock down of HIF1 reduced their expression in a hypoxic environment52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, a report suggests that hypoxia affects costimulatory molecules and cytokine production in DCs independently of HIF149.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the available data support multiple roles for HIF1 in DCs that may differ dependent on the presence or absence of oxygen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, an elegant study of DCs function during Leishmania infection found that HIF1 in DCs promoted a regulatory T-cell response and deleting HIF1 resulted in enhanced DC-dependent IL12 production and increased CD8 T-cell proliferation53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study is consistent with the data presented herein showing an anti-inflammatory role for normoxic HIF1 in DCs to limit the induction of CD8 T-cell responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While competitive glucose uptake in pathological situations such as within tumours is now becoming established as a mechanism utilized by tumour cells to alter the course of immune response, the data presented in this study argue that competitive glucose uptake is also a feature of normal immune responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, in addition to glucose, several amino acids will impact upon mTORC1/HIF1/iNOS signalling including leucine and glutamine, which are important for mTORC1 activity, and arginine, the fuel for iNOS dependent NO production7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data generated using both in vitro and in vivo approaches demonstrates that activating T cells interacting with the antigen-presenting DC can deplete nutrients from the immediate DC microenvironment resulting in the inhibition of this nutrient-sensitive mTORC1/HIF1/iNOS signalling circuit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During a robust immune response, DC present multiple T-cell antigens and can encourage multiple simultaneous interactions with T cells resulting in the formation of DCT-cell clusters of up to 12 T cells21,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that activated T cells dramatically upregulate rates of glucose and amino acid uptake5,7, it is perhaps unsurprising that the immediate microenvironment surrounding a DC in such a T-cell cluster becomes nutrient deprived.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, competition for glucose or amino acids will allow these closely interacting cells to adopt contrasting signalling and metabolic states, glycolytic T cells compared to non-glycolytic DCs engaging in oxidative metabolism; both metabolic states that maximize the proinflammatory functions of the respective immune subset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This innovative mechanism allows
