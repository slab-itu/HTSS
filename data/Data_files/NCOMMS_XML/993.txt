Synergistic IL-6 and IL-8 paracrine signalling pathway infers a strategy to inhibit tumour cell migration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Following uncontrolled proliferation, a subset of primary tumour cells acquires additional traits/mutations to trigger phenotypic changes that enhance migration and are hypothesized to be the initiators of metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study reveals an adaptive mechanism that harnesses synergistic paracrine signalling via IL-6/8, which is amplified by cell proliferation and cell density, to directly promote cell migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect occurs in metastatic human sarcoma and carcinoma cells but not in normal or non-metastatic cancer cells-, and likely involves the downstream signalling of WASF3 and Arp2/3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transcriptional phenotype of high-density cells that emerges due to proliferation resembles that of low-density cells treated with a combination of IL-6/8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simultaneous inhibition of IL-6/8 receptors decreases the expression of WASF3 and Arp2/3 in a mouse xenograft model and reduces metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study reveals a potential mechanism that promotes tumour cell migration and infers a strategy to decrease metastatic capacity of tumour cells.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Uncontrolled cell proliferation is a hallmark of cancer that leads to the development of primary tumours1, which may be followed by further progression to metastasis, the spread of cancer cells from a primary organ to distal sites2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell proliferation and migration are two key drivers of metastasis that are regulated by complex interactions of multiple pathways that can either concurrently or divergently stimulate the two processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some studies have shown that the two processes occur simultaneously; proliferation and migration are both stimulated by secreted factors such as fibroblast growth factors3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other studies suggest that the two processes are mutually exclusive; primary tumour cells proliferate uncontrollably with tight cell-cell junction and low mobility, while metastatic invasive tumour cells seem to delay proliferation during migration5,6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cancer cells in the tumour microenvironment (TME) can secrete proteins, such as cytokines, that can interact with stromal and immune cells in a collagen-rich three-dimensional (3D) extracellular matrix10,11, to mediate intercellular communications and collectively modulate pathophysiological processes, including cancer-induced angiogenesis and metastasis12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the highly invasive nature of human brain tumours, such as glioblastoma multiform, has been attributed to its unique secretomic profile14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, secretomic profiles evolve as cancer cells proliferate and eventually progress to a higher grade (that is, as cells become more invasive)15,16, suggesting a possible role for secreted paracrine factors to couple proliferation and migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the local concentration of secreted proteins increases with cell number, we speculate that the contribution of proliferation-induced local crowding, accompanied by increased local cell density in the collagen-rich 3D TME, may be a significant, yet largely unidentified factor that directly alters tumour cell migration17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we find that metastatic human sarcoma and carcinoma cells exhibit enhanced migration as a consequence of cell proliferation, which causes increased cell density in 3D collagen matrices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase in cell density causes significant enhancement in cell migration due to an increase in the secretion of specific soluble proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a high-throughput multiplexing cell secretomic profiling assay, we demonstrate that only interleukin 6 (IL-6) and Interleukin 8 (IL-8) are specifically increased with cell density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that IL-6 and IL-8 are necessary and sufficient to increase tumour cell migration in a cell density dependent manner with negligible feedback on cell proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect is specific to metastatic cancer cells; IL-6 and IL-8 have no effect on the migration of normal and non-metastatic cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enhanced cell migration likely occurs through increased expression of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family member 3 (WASF3), which in turn regulates actin cytoskeleton dynamics through the recruitment of the Arp2/3 complex, increasing the formation of dendritic protrusions and thus driving cell migration18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therapeutic targeting of the receptors of IL-6 and IL-8 using Tocilizumab and Reparixin significantly decreases the expression of the Arp2/3 complex in a mouse xenograft model and decreases metastasis of breast cancer cells to the lungs, liver, and lymph nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study reveals a synergistic paracrine signalling pathway that when inhibited has the potential to decrease the metastatic capacity of cancer cells and thereby improve patient outcomes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Increase in tumour cell density enhances cell motility', 'To assess the potential effect of cell proliferationand associated increase in local cell densityon cancer cell migration in vitro, human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells, a cell line commonly used in studies of cell migration19,20,21,22, were embedded in 3D type I collagen matrices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collagen I is not only the main extracellular matrix component of connective tissues, but is also enriched in the vicinity of carcinoma and sarcoma tumours23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell migratory patterns within the matrix were monitored for 16.5 h using live-cell phase-contrast microscopy at a rate of 30 frames/h every other day for 5 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis revealed that fibrosarcoma cells became progressively more motile as cells proliferated and increased local cell density (Fig 1ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the role of increased cell density on cancer cell migration, we seeded increasing cell densities in 3D matrices and observed cell migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial cell densities used in the experiments, ranging from 10 cells mm3 to 120 cells mm3, corresponded to average cell-to-cell distances from 470 to 130 m in the 3D matrix, distances that were significantly larger than the average cell size (1020 m in diameter)24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This data revealed that cells became progressively more motile as cell density increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This enhanced motility cannot be attributed to repulsive cellcell interactions as the tracked cells did not come in contact with other cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell speed eventually plateaued for cell densities higher than 100 cells mm3 (Fig 1d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar trends were observed for migration parameters such persistence of migration and invasive distance (Fig 1f and Supplementary Fig 1A and B)25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Effect of cell density on cancer cell motility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Phase contrast micrographs demonstrate confluence of human fibrosarcoma cells (HT1080WT) days after initial seeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 100 m.

molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that the cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 were both secreted in relatively high concentrations and increased linearly with cell density for both cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, all other secreted proteins that were assayed including hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which has been implicated in promoting tumour progression and tumour metastasis in several cancers29, were not elevated at higher cell densities during our experimental time window (Fig 2g,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using ELISA, we confirmed our results and determined the precise concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 at specific cell densities of matrix-embedded HT1080 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig 2il).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, this result suggests that IL-6 and IL-8 drive

cell and consequently paracrine signalling can occur as the inter-cellular distance is decreased with an increase in cell density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the paracrine signalling could trigger a response in cellular behaviour (for example, enhanced migration).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrated that the expression of IL-6R and CXCR2 indeed increased as cell density increased, indicating that signalling pathway is paracrine (Supplementary Fig 3J and K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We next explored possible therapeutic targets to decrease metastatic capacity by inhibiting the

cell densities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, cells depleted of IL-8R displayed a reduction in cell velocity at both low and high cell densities (Fig 3h and Supplementary Figs 3L and 6AD).

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'This study suggests that as cancer cells proliferate and local cell density increases accordingly, the secretion profile of cancer cells in the TME may be dynamically altered and this may play an important role in metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased local cell density directly enhances cell migration in metastatic cells embedded in 3D matrices by increasing IL-6 and IL-8 levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, cell-density-dependent migration is unique to tumorigenic, metastatic cells exposed to 3D microenvironments, not 2D flat surfaces, which reconstitute features of tissues that enable in vitro recapitulation of in vivo function including spatiotemporal gradients of biochemical cues such as cytokines and growth factors39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Further, this study identified a novel synergistic mechanism between IL-6 and IL-8 required to promote cell-density-dependent migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that has been associated with tumour progression and metastasis in different types of cancers40,41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-8 has also been implicated in promoting angiogenesis and tumorigenicity, promoting a cancer stem cell phenotype, and enhancing metastasis in multiple cancer types43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, clinical data indicates that both IL-6 and IL-8 are found at high concentrations in the serum of patients with lung and liver metastases45, which suggests that they may play a critical role in metastasis46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous clinical studies have also shown that the serum concentrations of these two cytokines strongly correlate with the stage of cancer47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of this study explain the underlying mechanisms that account for these observations in 3D collagen-rich TMEs where tumour cells rapidly proliferate and increase local cell density16,48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, our data also suggests that this synergistic IL-6/8 paracrine pathway-mediated enhancement of cell migration is an adaptive process dictated by cell signalling and differs from the mechanism associated with cancer-stem-cell (CSC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells used in this investigation did not display CSC characteristics as revealed by bulk RNA-seq50,51', 'Our findings further emphasize the necessity of 3D cultures in pharmaceutical studies as monolayer cell culture methods remain the de facto prevalent testing platform51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells cultured on dishes adopt physiologically irrelevant morphology and signalling patterns52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the cell-density-dependent migration seen in 3D is not observed on 2D substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, there are currently no commercial therapeutics that specifically target metastasis which is responsible for 90% of cancer related deaths53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study suggests that by concurrently inhibiting the identified pathway with Tocilizumab (a humanized monoclonal antibody currently used to treat rheumatoid arthritis54) and Reparixin metastasis can be directly targeted and decreased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these agents are individually studied in clinical trials for their efficacy against different types of cancers55,56,57,58,59, they have not been evaluated as anti-metastasis therapeutics in highly invasive cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study suggests that simultaneous use of Tocilizumab and Reparixin could greatly decrease the metastatic capacity of tumours, thereby potentially improve cancer patient outcomes similar to Denosumab which is a human monoclonal antibody that was initially developed to treat osteoporosis60, but later found to be effective in the treatment of multiple myeloma and giant cell tumour of the bone61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our observations also demonstrate that IL-6 and IL-8 work uniquely in a cell-autonomous manner through paracrine signalling amongst the same population of cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously, inflammatory signals released from infiltrating immune cells have been implicated in tumour progression, invasion, and metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our work revealed a new mechanism for tumour-secreted IL-6 and IL-8, but not common inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1 secreted by immune cells, to promote tumour cell migration and metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through this study, we have shown that the inhibition of the synergistic IL-6/8 signalling pathway reduces metastatic burden in mice, suggesting a potential strategy to prevent or treat cancer metastasis through the inhibition of tumour cell-density-dependent migration.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
