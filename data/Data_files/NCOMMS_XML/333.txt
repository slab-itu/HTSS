Exosomal microRNA miR-92a concentration in serum reflects human brown fat activity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates energy and its activity correlates with leanness in human adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography coupled with computer tomography (PET/CT) is still the standard for measuring BAT activity, but exposes subjects to ionizing radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To study BAT function in large human cohorts, novel diagnostic tools are needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that brown adipocytes release exosomes and that BAT activation increases exosome release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Profiling miRNAs in exosomes released from brown adipocytes, and in exosomes isolated from mouse serum, we show that levels of miRNAs change after BAT activation in vitro and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of these exosomal miRNAs, miR-92a, is also present in human serum exosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, serum concentrations of exosomal miR-92a inversely correlate with human BAT activity measured by 18F-FDG PET/CT in two unique and independent cohorts comprising 41 healthy individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, exosomal miR-92a represents a potential serum biomarker for BAT activity in mice and humans.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a specialized fat depot that dissipates energy to generate heat1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BAT was thought to be active only in rodents and human infants5, but recently metabolically active BAT was also found in adult humans5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activity and amount of BAT is usually analysed by 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this technique requires cold activation of BAT and exposes patients to ionizing radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Activation of BAT is mainly controlled by the sympathetic nervous system1,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sympathetic nerves release norepinephrine (NE) and co-transmitters10 that activate G protein-coupled receptors and induce production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) which in turn activates protein kinase A and lipolysis1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Apart from classical brown adipocytes, inducible brown adipocytes with thermogenic potentialalso known as beige or brite (brown-like-in-white) adipocyteshave been identified in white adipose tissue (WAT)3,4,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Browning of WAT, that is, increasing the number of beige/brite adipocytes, can be induced by a large spectrum of substances and stimuli including cold-exposure and NE treatment, as well as adenosine10 and cyclic GMP2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The metabolically active fat depots in the neck and supraclavicular region of human adults contain both constitutive brown and inducible beige adipocytes13,14,15 with deeper neck depots possessing classical brown characteristics and more superficial depots expressing beige markers16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thermogenesis mediated by both brown and beige/brite adipocytes is dependent on the action of the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1)17, which uncouples mitochondrial ATP production and is stimulated by fatty acids that are liberated by lipolysis1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the major focus of BAT research has been on pathways that regulate UCP-1-mediated energy expenditure to identify potential BAT-centred therapies, diagnostic tools that allow for safe and easy assessment of BAT in humans are lacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs, which regulate protein expression in a broad range of tissues18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  miRNAs play an important role in BAT21 and several miRNAs have been identified that control brown adipocyte differentiation including miR-106b and miR-93 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22), miR-133 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23), miR-378 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24) and miR155 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  miRNAs also regulate browning of white adipocyte and thus the number of mature beige adipocytes25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, BAT activation itself, for example, by cold-exposure is able to change miRNA expression patterns of brown adipocytes23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Exosomes are small lipid vesicles 40100 nm in size27 that contain RNAs (mRNA and miRNAs), as well as proteins and surface molecules28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exosome secretion from releasing cell and subsequent uptake of exosomes by a recipient cell provides a mechanism for cell-to-cell communication and exchange of material between cells29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The composition of exosomes changes during cellular differentiation and pathological processes28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, exosomes can be involved in pathophysiological processes and can also be used as biomarkers to assess tissue function and disease progression30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To date, there is no biomarker for BAT that can easily be accessed by blood analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that brown adipocytes secrete exosomes and that exosomal miRNAs can be used as a potential serum biomarker for BAT activity in humans and mice.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Brown adipocytes release exosomes', 'To detect exosomes in brown adipocytes, we initially expressed a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein of the exosome marker CD63 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31) in murine brown adipocytes (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electron microscopy (Fig 1a) and western blotting revealed the release of exosomes from brown adipocytes and BAT (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of brown adipocytes with cAMP, the second messenger that is induced by cold and -adrenergic stimulation, resulted in a 4.7-fold increase of exosomes in the culture medium (Fig 1c), indicating that cAMP signalling enhances exosome release from brown adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To study exosome release also in beige cells, we treated primary murine white adipocytes with NE, which induced a significant increase in UCP-1 expression (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As pure white adipocytes, we used 3T3-L1 cells that did not significantly increase UCP-1 expression after -adrenergic stimulation with NE (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cAMP induced a significant increase of exosome release in beige (10.7-fold) adipocytes, but not in 3T3-L1 white adipocytes or in brown pre-adipocytes (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The treatment with cAMP also did not significantly affect the release of exosomes from muscle cells (C2C12) or hepatocytes (HepG2) (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next we studied the release of exosomes from tissues after cold-exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exosomal markers CD63 and Hsp70 were detectable in all isolations (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the in vitro data, both BAT and inguinal WAT (WATi) of mice showed a significant (9.05-fold and 7.62-fold, respectively) increase in exosome release after cold-exposure (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WATi was used for the analysis of beige fat, given its high capacity for browning after cold-exposure32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, gonadal WAT (WATg)the purest WAT depot33and other tissues (that is, muscle, liver and brain) exhibited no significant changes of exosome release after cold-exposure (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the weight of the three adipose tissues (Supplementary Fig 1c), 87% of the total amount of exosomes is secreted from BAT under cold conditions, whereas exosomes from WATi and WATg make up only 11% and 2%, respectively (Supplementary Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Brown adipocytes secrete exosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Upper lane: Expression of CD63GFP fusion protein in murine brown adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Representative bright field (left) and fluorescence image (right) are shown, (scale bar, 10 m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lower lane: electron microscopy images of exosomes in supernatant of brown adipocytes, (left scale bar, 120 nm, right scale bar, 40 nm, arrow heads indicate exosomes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Qualitative western blot of exosome marker protein CD63 and Hsp70 expression in exosomes released from BAT (left panel) and in BAT of mice (right panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tissue was treated ex vivo with 10 M norepinephrine (NE) or without NE (wt), protein isolation buffer served as vehicle control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blotting of tubulin and cytochrome c (cytC) are shown as loading control and cellular marker (n=1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c,d) ELISA quantification of CD63-positive particles released from cells per mg protein before and after cAMP (200 M) treatment (c) and released per mg tissue before and after cold exposure (4 °C for 7 days) (d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3T3-L1, 3T3-L1 differentiated white adipocytes;

Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, serum exosomal miR-92a abundance was significantly lower in the high BAT group compared with the low BAT group (unpaired, two-tailed t-test, P=0.017, Fig 3b), whereas miR-133a abundance was similar between groups (unpaired, two-tailed t-test, P=0.757, Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, when considering the group as a whole, we observed a significant negative correlation between Log10 miR-92a and the BAT SUVmean value (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such correlation was absent for miR-133a (Supplementary Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a stepwise multivariable linear regression analysis with Log10 miR-92a as a dependent variable, and age, sex, BMI, fat mass and BAT SUVmean, SUVmax and glucose uptake rate as independent variables, all three BAT parameters were significant predictors of Log10 miR-92a (Supplementary Table 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, individual univariate analyses showed no relations between other parameters and Log10 miR-92a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As alternative to BAT SUVmean, we also assessed BAT SUVmax and glucose uptake rate (Fig 3d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, we observed a significant correlation between these values and the Log10 miR-92a value (SUVmax: Pearsons correlation, R2=0.28, P=0.011, glucose uptake rate: Pearsons correlation, R2=0.26, P=0.016, n=22), (Fig 3d,e, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, to rule out that single axis logarithmic transformation resulted in such linear correlations, we performed similar analysis for the Log10 BAT SUVmeanLog10 miR92a (Pearsons correlation, R2=0.18, P less_than 0.05, n=22), as well as the Log10 BAT SUVmaxLog10 miR92a (Pearsons correlation, R2=0.25, P less_than 0.05, n=22), which resulted in similar correlations (Supplementary Fig 3c,d, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Correlation of thermoneutral exosomal miR-92a in serum with BAT activity measured in humans after acute cold exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) 18F-FDG PET/CT image of a subject with high (brown) and low (blue) BAT activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) miR-92a expression as quantified by qPCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subjects were separated into two groups with high and low BAT activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data is normalized to U6, and expressed as mean±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (unpaired, two-tailed t-test, *P less_than 0.05, n=11 per group).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Log10 miR-92a value is negatively related to BAT SUVmean value when considering the whole group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The obtained correlation equation is: BAT SUVmean (predicted)=0.8749 × Log10 miR-92a+3.5227, (Pearsons correlation, R2=0.26, P=0.015, n=22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Log10 miR-92a value is negatively related to BAT SUVmax (Pearsons correlation, R2=0.28, P=0.011, n=22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Log10 miR-92a value is negatively related to BAT glucose uptake rates (Pearsons correlation, R2=0.26, P=0.016, n=22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) Changes in miR-92a expression levels (Log10 miR-92a value) tended to correlate with changes in BAT activity (Delta BAT SUVmean value) on a 10-day cold acclimation period (Pearsons correlation, R2=0.29, P=0.11;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'BAT has received a lot of interest after the discovery of metabolically active adipose depots in the neck and supraclavicular region of adults that take up glucose after cold stimulation6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to its metabolic function, BAT is also a source of signalling molecules that can modulate BAT function or even other tissues like the liver36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These BAT-derived signals include nitric oxide38,39 and adenosine10 that activate brown adipocytes in a paracrine/autocrine manner, as well as endocrine factors and hormones like FGF21 (refs 40, 41) and NRG4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we demonstrate that brown adipocytes release exosomes that contain miRNAs and that exosome release, as well as the exosomal miRNA pattern change after brown adipocyte activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Exosomes are found in various body fluids including blood and play a role in exchanging information between cells and tissues29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several studies have shown that exosomes can regulate the function of the recipient/target cell and miRNAs are considered as major exosomal signals and effectors29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, exosome-mediated transfer of cancer-secreted miR-105 has been shown to reduce endothelial barrier function; thereby promoting metastasis43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, tumour-secreted exosomal miRNAs can trigger a pro-metastatic inflammatory response via binding to Toll-like receptors44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The pattern of exosomal miRNAs differ between healthy individuals and patients, as well as in different stages of diseases, therefore, exosomal miRNAs can be used as biomarkers of disease states and tissue function29,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The power of exosomal miRNAs as diagnostic tools has been clearly demonstrated for cancer46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, recent studies identified circulating miRNAs as potential biomarkers/indicators of metabolic disorders including obesity (miR-152 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  47), miR-17 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  47), miR-138 (refs 47, 48), miR-15b (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  48) and miR-376a (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  48)) and type 2 diabetes (miR-593 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  48) and miR-15a (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  49), miR-503 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  48), miR-326 and let-7a/f (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  50)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, we are the first to relate exosomal miR-92a serum levels with BAT activity in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The miR-17-92 (miR-17, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-20a, miR-19b-1 and miR-92a) cluster was previously described to be regulated by cell cycle via E2F3 binding and by a negative feedback loop through miR-17 that targets E2F2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The miR-17-92 cluster is essential for development52 and genetic deletion of this cluster results in defects in heart and lung development leading to postnatal death53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dysregulation of several cluster members has been observed in most cancer types52 leading to its classification as oncomiR-1-cluster54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  miR-92a has been associated with leukaemia, breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma55,56,57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although miR-92 has been shown to impair angiogenesis58 and to promote atherosclerosis59,60, ablation of this miRNA in mice resulted only in bone defects61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While six (miR-17, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-20a and miR-19b-1) of the seven members of this cluster were investigated in the context of adipocyte differentiation62, little is known about the role of miR-92a in adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First in vivo investigations associate genetic knockout and pharmacological inhibition of miR-92a with a HFD-resistant, more healthy phenotype in mice63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The detection of BAT currently relies mainly on PET/CT imaging of 18F-FDG uptake into metabolically active BAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This imaging technique was originally developedand is still mainly usedfor detection of metastasis in oncology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coincidentally, 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging revealed the increased uptake of tracer in a region extending from the anterior neck to the thorax64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several seminal publications6,7,8,9,16 showed that these areas of cold-induced glucose uptake correspond to BAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the major drawback of this technique is the exposure of patients to ionizing radiation by both the FDG tracer and CT and thus cannot be used for screening purposes or large number of subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, this method only visualizes active BAT and consequently has an imminent need to expose subjects to cold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Thus, diagnostic markers of BAT are of great importance to study the physiological role of human BAT, as well as for clinical trials to stratify subjects and to quantify the effects of drug candidates on BAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, the relation between exosomal miR-92a abundance in human blood samples and cold-induced BAT activity is highly promising.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the correlation is very modest and future studies with larger cohorts are needed, since biomarkers typically need to classify with greater accuracy than an R2 of 0.40 would allow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Taken together, miR-92a represents a potential thermoneutral brown/beige fat biomarker for basic science and clinical applications, which can be measured with relative ease in large cohorts of patients.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
