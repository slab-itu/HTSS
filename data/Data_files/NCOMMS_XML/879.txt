Defined chromosome structure in the genome-reduced bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'DNA-binding proteins are central regulators of chromosome organization; however, in genome-reduced bacteria their diversity is largely diminished.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether the chromosomes of such bacteria adopt defined three-dimensional structures remains unexplored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we combine Hi-C and super-resolution microscopy to determine the structure of the Mycoplasma pneumoniae chromosome at a 10 kb resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find a defined structure, with a global symmetry between two arms that connect opposite poles, one bearing the chromosomal Ori and the other the midpoint.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of local structures at a 3 kb resolution indicates that the chromosome is organized into domains ranging from 15 to 33 kb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide evidence that genes within the same domain tend to be co-regulated, suggesting that chromosome organization influences transcriptional regulation, and that supercoiling regulates local organization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study extends the current understanding of bacterial genome organization and demonstrates that a defined chromosomal structure is a universal feature of living systems.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Several studies have revealed novel insights into chromatin dynamics and its effect on gene expression regulation and replication1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such interplay suggests that chromatin organization might have a role in regulating gene expression at both the global and gene-specific levels3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all kingdoms of life, genome organization occurs in a functional and dynamic manner, packing the genome into the nucleus in the case of eukaryotes, while packing it into the cell in the case of bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacteria have evolved mechanisms such as DNA supercoiling4 and nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) mediated folding5 to condense their chromosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Negative supercoiling forms plectonemic loops of 10100 kilobases (kb)6,7, which are maintained by both gyrases and topoisomerases6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simultaneously, DNA-based processes such as transcription, replication and repair are all efficiently accommodated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the past, diffraction-limited resolution has impaired the detailed characterization of chromosome structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, more recent developments in super-resolution localization microscopy8,9,10,11,12 and chromosome conformation capture (3C)-based techniques13 have enabled the determination of the global chromosome organization of some bacteria14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-throughput derivations of genome-wide 3C-based assays such as Hi-C technologies15 have been used to generate high-resolution contact maps of genomes, which when combined with modelling, can provide three-dimensional (3D) representations of genome structures16,17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies of bacterial chromosome organization and regulation using these afore mentioned combinatorial techniques have been carried out in Caulobacter crescentus, resulting in a Hi-C map with a 13 kb resolution17, in Escherichia coli with a 20 kb resolution20, and in Bacillus subtilis with 30, 10 and 4 kb resolutions21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies show that for C. crescentus the genome structure is globally related to the chromosome segregation process, while for E. coli it is more related to DNA replication and transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, a higher 10 kb resolution Hi-C map of C. crescentus18 revealed that its genome is divided into 23 chromosome interacting domains (CIDs) or highly self-interacting regions, similar to the topologically associating domains (TADs) found in eukaryotes24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The size of these CIDs range from 30 to 400 kb in C. crescentus18, and from 50 to 300 kb (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22) or 60 to 340 kb (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23) in B. subtilis, depending on the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Nonetheless, in C. crescentus, the strongest determinant of these domain boundaries was the presence of highly expressed genes, whereas surprisingly the absence of the NAP heat unstable (HU) histone-like proteins and structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) proteins did not significantly affect the domain boundaries18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No such domains were described in the lower resolution Hi-C map of E. coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, it was found that histone-like proteins such as factor for inversion simulation (Fis), integration host factor (IHF) and histone-like nucleoid structuring (H-NS) do not contribute to the global organization of the E. coli genome20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, on a larger scale, it has been shown that the E. coli genome consists of four macrodomain-like regions of about 1 megabase (Mb) each, and two less constrained regions, all of which influence the segregation and mobility of the chromosome26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The above mentioned bacteria all have large, complex genomes over 4 Mb in size, coding for hundreds of transcription factors (TFs)27, multiple DNA structural proteins and several sigma factors, each of which play key roles in the response to physiological and environmental signals28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How such structural organization is achieved and the impact that it has on transcriptional regulation is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, whether smaller bacteria with reduced genomes and reduced total copy numbers of structural proteins maintain a defined chromosome structure is also undetermined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this question, we studied the chromosome organization of the genome-reduced bacterium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, which has minimal genetic components and lacks several structural DNA-binding proteins29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown that changes in DNA supercoiling can control transcription in bacteria30, and in fact, this could be more important in small-genome bacteria such as Mycoplasmas31 where, despite the absence of many structural DNA-binding proteins29, both gyrases and topoisomerases are present to control gene expression through changing the local DNA structure31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M. pneumoniae is one of the smallest self-replicating organisms32, has no cell wall, and causes atypical pneumonia in humans33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It possesses an attachment organelle (AO) located at one of the cell poles that is involved in adherence, motility and cell division34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M. pneumoniae has only a few known NAPs, and the total copy number for the remaining proteins is smaller compared with other bacteria (Table 1 and Supplementary Data 1): MPN529, IHF-HU that possibly affects DNA topology35; MPN426, an SMC family protein; MPN229 and MPN554, proteins that bind single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)36,37; and MPN002 a possible homologue of CbpA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also has very few TFs and only two sigma factors are found within its genome (Table 1)38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, M. pneumoniae has been systematically characterized in a quantitative manner by transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics studies39,40,41,42,43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

table', 'Here, we used Hi-C to determine the 3D structure of the stationary M. pneumoniae chromosome at a 10 kb resolution, with local structures further resolved at 3 kb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model is validated by electron microscopy, 3D light microscopy reconstruction of the nucleoid, and super-resolution microscopy of exponential and stationary cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a general symmetry along the axis of the origin (Ori) and the midpoint of the chromosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ori and the midpoint are located at the two opposite poles of the chromosome structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover we detected that the chromosome is organized into 44 CIDs, ranging from 15 to 33 kb, which are smaller than the CIDs previously described for C. crescentus18 and B. subtilis22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibiting supercoiling induced a decrease in the domain border strengths, suggesting that supercoiling might play a role in the regulation of these domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we provide the first evidence that genes inside CIDs tend to be co-regulated, suggesting that chromosome organization could influence transcriptional regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results, together with previous 3D structures of other bacterial chromosomes and data on eukaryotes, indicate that chromosome organization in cells is a widespread phenomenon of life.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'From M. pneumoniae Hi-C maps to 3D chromatin structure', 'Here, we studied the M. pneumoniae genome organization during stationary phase, performing Hi-C using four-cutter, HpaII, and six-cutter, HindIII, enzymes with average cutting frequencies of 450 and 1,810 base pairs (bp), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hi-C experiments generate genome-wide libraries of ligation products, in which genomic loci that are positioned close in space contact frequently, and loci located far away rarely interact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spatial distances can then be inferred from genomic loci frequencies to reflect the 3D structure of the genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the Hi-C interaction maps obtained at exponential and stationary phase display similar features (Supplementary Fig 6), the analysis of the exponential phase data alluded to possible chromosome heterogeneity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, as it is not possible to synchronize M. pneumoniae, we concentrated on the stationary phase samples for 3D modelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To analyse the Hi-C data sets, the paired-end library reads were first uniquely mapped to the MPN129 reference genome (NC_000912, NCBI) covering 816,394 bp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was done using Bowtie2, and further filtered and normalized as previously described following the ICE iterative mapping strategy from the hiclib Python45 (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, read pairs were classified as valid Hi-C products, non-ligation products, or self-ligation products, and only the valid Hi-C products were considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then constructed a genome wide matrix, M, of different resolutions (3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 kb) by dividing the genome into 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 kb bins respectively, and pooling interactions into their corresponding bins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final interaction frequencies were represented as two-dimensional matrices, where M(i,j) indicates the relative frequency of interaction between fragments in bins i and j.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "The decision to use the resolution of 10 kb was determined based on the correlation between 7 replicates at 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 kb resolutions (Supplementary Figs 1 and 2), as well as on the matrix modelling potential (MMP) score of the resulting matrices (Supplementary Fig 3 and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MMP score assesses the potential of an interaction matrix to determine accurate 3D models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a 10 kb resolution, both the HindIII and HpaII data sets resulted in MMP scores ranging from 0.71 to 0.74, with a maximum predicted model accuracy of 0.70 (0.580.81 at 95% confidence interval).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the matrices were highly reproducible between the five HpaII biological replicates (r greater than 0.91, P value less_than 0.0001 Pearson's correlation coefficient; Supplementary Fig 1) as well as between HindIII and HpaII data sets (r greater than 0.81, P value less_than 0.0001 Pearson's correlation coefficient; Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though no significant differences were found between the two enzymes, we decided to use the HpaII interaction matrix (computed as the sum of the five HpaII replicates at a 10 kb resolution, normalized by their respective number of reads) for modelling and subsequent analysis since the HpaII enzyme has a higher cutting frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ", 'The resulting Hi-C interaction map has two diagonals intersecting near the centre of the genome, hereafter referred to as the midpoint of the chromosome (at 400 kb; Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The location of the Ori was predicted based on the position of the DnaA boxes46, and validated by ChIP-seq experiments (Yus et al., manuscript in preparation); however, the exact localization of the terminus of replication (Ter) has not yet been experimentally determined in this bacterium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since in bacteria the Ter is generally located opposite to the Ori, we predicted it to be at this intersection point, and in fact, two putative structural elements having no transcripts (380,176380,637 bp; 410,901411,097 bp) were found flanking this region44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main prominent diagonal, characteristic of Hi-C maps, results from the local contact of proximal genomic regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second less prominent diagonal (from the upper left to the lower right corner) reflects both the circularity of the genome and the interactions between fragments located on the opposite arm of the chromosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All together this indicates that the chromosome has a global symmetry extending from the Ori-midpoint axis within the cell, a feature which is further reflected by the distances of genomic bins to the centre of mass (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, such symmetry is also observed in the linear organization of the genome, where genes are distributed on opposite strands in both the left and the right arms of the chromosome (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Hi-C matrix and 3D models of the M. pneumoniae chromosome reveal a global symmetry with Ori and midpoint located at the two opposite poles.

particle 82 in red, and uses the same colour code as the bar in a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ori and midpoint particles are highlighted with red and purple circles, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lighter colour represents the space occupied by all the models in the cluster, that is, the variability across the cluster.Full size image', 'Ori and midpoint are located at the two poles', 'To assess whether the overall symmetry is also reflected in the spatial organization of the genome, we built 3D models of the M. pneumoniae genome based on the filtered and normalized 10 kb resolution Hi-C matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, based on the hypothesis that chromatin interaction frequencies are a proxy for spatial proximities between loci15, we used TADbit16,47,48 to convert the contact frequencies of genomic loci into spatial distances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then we searched for the 3D conformations that best satisfied the spatial distances between genomic loci inferred from the frequencies of our Hi-C matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 5,000 models were built by an optimization protocol, where the loci were initially placed randomly in 3D space and their positions were modified iteratively using simulated annealing and Monte-Carlo sampling to satisfy as many restraints as possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we selected the 1,000 models having the least penalty for not satisfying the imposed restraints and clustered them based on their structural similarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found two main clusters corresponding to mirror images of each other, one containing 516 models and the other 484 models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To represent the M. pneumoniae chromosome structure model, we created 3D density maps in which the volume occupied by each fragment indicates the variability in the fragments positioning across the models within the cluster (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This variability is homogeneous along the entire chromosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to what was observed for the 3D organization of the C. crescentus genome17,18, our circular chromosome has a global symmetry between the two chromosomal arms that connect the Ori and the midpoint.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ori and midpoint are located at the two opposite poles of the structure (Fig 1c and Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Validation of chromosome dimensions by DAPI and EM imaging', 'To ensure that the predicted dimensions and volumes of the chromosome models fit within the M. pneumoniae cell, we examined cells by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using the quick-freeze deep-etch replica

reconstruction of the whole cell, we were still able to detect a rotational symmetry along the long cell axis, thereby allowing us to estimate the cell volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In stationary phase, the median cell volume estimated from the TEM images is 0.075 m3 (standard deviation, s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of 0.03 m3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Validation of chromosome dimensions and occupancy by

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Chromosome conformation capture based experiments coupled with deep sequencing have been used to explore bacterial genome organization and its role in transcriptional regulation17,18,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we have analysed the 3D genome organization of the M. pneumoniae bacterium, a model organism with a small genome size and a simplified gene regulatory network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with other bacteria, M. pneumoniae not only has considerably less TFs and NAPs, but also the total copy number of these proteins is proportionally lower.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, in M. pneumoniae there are only the SMC and histone-like IHF NAP proteins and two sigma factors responsible for coordinating gene transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By combining Hi-C and super-resolution fluorescence imaging, we were able to identify fundamental principles of genome organization, such as the partitioning of a reduced genome into domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we provide evidences that genes inside CIDs tend to be co-regulated, indicating that the chromosome structure has a role in transcription regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The M. pneumoniae genome contact map revealed a double diagonal intersecting near the centre of the genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This corresponds to the midpoint and reflects a global symmetry of the genome along the Ori-midpoint axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 3D models generated of the genome conformation resulted in the Ori and midpoint loci being located at the two opposite poles of the structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, our DAPI staining and TEM images indicated that the 3D chromosome models fit within the dimensions of the M. pneumoniae cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to take into consideration that the limited resolution of DAPI imaging impeded an accurate estimation of the nucleoid occupancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using super-resolution fluorescence imaging, we corroborated our 3D models of chromosome conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distances estimated from the 3D models obtained using Hi-C data were overall larger than the ones obtained from super-resolution imaging of cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be explained by the limited resolution of our models (10 kb), as the actual occupancy of a bin within the cell has not been determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the fixation and permeabilization treatments of cells for FISH can induce shrinkage artefacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imaging indicates that the midpoint locus is the closest of all tested loci to the AO in both stationary and exponential phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In M. pneumoniae, the duplication of the AO was reported to be coordinated with cell division, which is known to occur by binary fission55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, during cell replication but before nucleoid separation, the migration of the AO to the opposite pole of the cell has been observed in fixed cells, suggesting a coordination between the AO duplication and DNA replication34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once a new organelle has formed, it remains attached to the surface while the old AO pulls the dividing cell away from the nascent organelle, positioning itself at the opposite pole56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, as described for the closely related species Mycoplasma gallisepticum57, our findings suggest a possible anchoring of the DNA to the AO near the midpoint.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, the observed cell-to-cell variability in the Ori-AO and midpoint-AO distances did not allow us to demonstrate that the AO is attached to a specific chromosome region as division occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Technical restraints of the FISH protocol only allowed the study of fixed cells, thereby limiting a deeper understanding of cell division in M.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pneumoniae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previously, a double diagonal was also observed in the contact map of the phylogenetically, closely related gram-positive bacterium B. subtilis21,22,23, as well as in two gram-negative bacteria C. crescentus17,18 and Vibrio cholera21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, this symmetry observed along the two replichores was not observed in E. coli, which has an open chromosome structure (Fig 6a)20,21, likely due to the orientation of the chromosome within the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, in B. subtilis and C. crescentus, the Ori and Ter are preferentially located at opposite poles early on in the cell cycle17,52, and both have an origin proximal region parS (partition system) that assists in the orientation of the chromosome during replication58,59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of C. crescentus17 the Ter is situated at the new pole and the left and right extend along the cell17 (Fig 6b), whereas in E. coli the left and right are situated towards the two poles and the Ori and Ter are closer to the middle of the cell60 (Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chromosome organization of C. crescentus is similar to that of M. pneumoniae in the fact that the Ori and midpoint (or Ter in C. crescentus) are localized at the two opposite poles (Fig 6c), but differ in the fact that the chromosome of C. crescentus has an ellipsoidal form with periodically arranged arms twisting around each other17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Models of bacterial chromosome organization.Models of nucleoid organization with Ori and

'Several published studies have previously shown that mammalian genomes are partitioned into TADs24,25, which range from 200 kb to 1 Mb and are conserved across different species and cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis allowed the detection of bacterial TAD-like domains (CIDs) for the first time in M. pneumoniae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, M. pneumoniae is partitioned into a total of 44 CIDs, which range from 15 to 33 kb in size and are smaller than those reported for C. crescentus18 and B. subtilis22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These M. pneumoniae CIDs could be related to the 10 kb loops that are bounded by stochastic barriers as suggested for E. coli6,7 and Salmonella enterica61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the nested domains reported for C. crescentus18 and B. subtilis22,23 may be more related to the macrodomain-like regions identified in E. coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that domains are an elemental component of genome organization throughout the evolution of all organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work using super-resolution imaging of CIDs could estimate how variable the CIDs in prokaryotic cells are compared with the previous results of TADs in eukaryotes62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it has not been shown that a specific chromosome structure is essential for genomic functions as large genome reduction done in Mycoplasma mycoides63 or genome reorientation17 does not seem to compromise cell viability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus having a defined chromosome structure seems to be important, but it can be altered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, large genome DNA rearrangements can have important effects on the presence, order and expression of genes64, suggesting that chromosome domains are a fundamental principle of genome folding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We also observed, as previously reported for C. crescentus18, that inhibition of supercoiling by novobiocin significantly reduced the sharpness of CIDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding suggests that supercoiling could be regulating domain formation in bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, our analysis also indicates that genes inside CIDs tend to be co-regulated, with lower co-expression levels being detected between genes at the domain boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In C. crescentus, it was previously reported that domain borders correlated with the presence of highly expressed genes, being as the DNA is kept free of plectonemic loops during active transcription18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we did not observe such a correlation in M. pneumoniae, we established that not only domain borders are correlated with the presence of convergent and divergent gene pairs but also that borders are characterized by low GC content levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Promoter orientation has been related to gene expression regulation and more particularly divergent transcription could create negatively supercoiled or underwound DNA, while AT content has been previously related to the physical properties of DNA such as DNA curvature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, it has also been reported in E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium that the localization of domain loop boundaries is found in AT-rich regions65, and more recently in B. subtilis that a considerable number of domains barriers overlap with AT-rich sequences acquired through horizontal gene transfer22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though the contribution of NAP and SMC proteins in the global genome organization was recently refuted in E. coli20, as well as their role in the formation of CIDs in C. crescentus18, the formation of these domains was consistent with the distribution of histone-like proteins binding sites, such as H-NS, HU, Fis and IHF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As M. pneumoniae however has a limited number of copies of the histone-like IHF protein41, thereby making it difficult to maintain the CID boundaries, it is likely that additional factors contribute to the formation of such domain loops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, since M. pneumoniae only has a handful of DNA-binding proteins and very few TFs (Table 1), it is intriguing that it is capable of establishing a well-defined chromosome structure as well as maintaining CID boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that very few factors (such as the SMC protein) are necessary to define a 3D chromosome structure and provide evidence that other elements like supercoiling could regulate these domain boundaries, which are characterized by low GC-content and might be related to the physicochemical properties of DNA.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#
