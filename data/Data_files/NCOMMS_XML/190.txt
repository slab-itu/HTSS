Reconciling diverse mammalian pigmentation patterns with a fundamental mathematical model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Bands of colour extending laterally from the dorsal to ventral trunk are a common feature of mouse chimeras.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These stripes were originally taken as evidence of the directed dorsoventral migration of melanoblasts (the embryonic precursors of melanocytes) as they colonize the developing skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depigmented belly spots in mice with mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase Kit are thought to represent a failure of this colonization, either due to impaired migration or proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tracing of single melanoblast clones, however, has revealed a diffuse distribution with high levels of axial mixinghard to reconcile with directed migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we construct an agent-based stochastic model calibrated by experimental measurements to investigate the formation of diffuse clones, chimeric stripes and belly spots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observations indicate that melanoblast colonization likely proceeds through a process of undirected migration, proliferation and tissue expansion, and that reduced proliferation is the cause of the belly spots in Kit mutants.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Melanoblasts, the embryonic precursors of the pigment producing melanocytes of skin and hair, colonize the developing epidermis during development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice heterozygous for mutations of the receptor tyrosine kinase Kit present with a depigmented ventral belly spot long thought to represent a failure of either melanoblast proliferation or migration1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Melanoblasts are specified at embryonic day 9 (E9) in the pre-migratory neural crest2 by downregulation of the transcription factors Foxd3 and Sox2 and upregulation of the master transcription factor Mitf3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At E10.5 melanoblasts delaminate from the neural crest, upregulate the melanoblast-specific genes Pmel and Dct5,6, and accumulate in a region known as the migration staging area (MSA)1,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Melanoblast survival in the skin is dependent on signalling between Kit (expressed in melanoblasts) and its ligand Kitl (expressed by dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes), however initial delamination does not require Kit signalling1,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At E10.5 melanoblasts begin to leave the MSA in a Kitl- and endothelin 3 (Edn3)-dependent manner and embark on a dorsolateral migratory pathway in the dermis between the developing somites and the ectoderm1,7,8,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At E12.5 melanoblasts move from the dermis to the epidermis, upregulate E-cadherin, lose their dependence on Edn3 and continue to migrate and proliferate11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A dermal population also persists whose size remains constant (and so proportionally decreases in relation to the epidermal population)14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Epidermal colonization is complete by around E15.5, after which melanoblasts downregulate E-cadherin and begin to localize to the developing hair follicles11,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Luciani et al.14 measured melanoblast doubling times in the dermis and epidermis, and used a mathematical model to estimate the number of melanoblast progenitors specified in the pre-migratory neural crest14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Dorsolateral migration was first demonstrated by the capacity of grafted mouse skin to produce melanin in chick coelom17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Later, this early work was confirmed in chimeric mice generated by the aggregation of albino and pigmented cleavage-stage embryos19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, Mintz described a standard pattern of 17 successive bands/stripes extending dorsoventrally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the interpretation of the number of stripes was later criticized20,21, the acceptance of the stripes as representing directed dorsolateral migration remained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, using a Dct::laacZ transgene to label individual lacZ revertant melanoblast clones, Wilkie et al.22 observed a surprising degree of mixing at the axial level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The patterns observed were hard to reconcile with directed migration and suggested that different cell dispersal mechanisms may act in the head and trunk22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Experimental measurements and mathematical modelling have formed the basis of a number of studies on neural crest colonization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The failure to colonize the embryonic intestine by neural crest precursors in Hirschsprungs disease has been extensively studied23,24,25,26,27, as has the behaviour of chick cranial neural crest populations28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both continuous partial differential equation population-level models23 and discrete lattice-based individual-level models29 have been employed to model Hirschsprungs disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zhang et al.29 demonstrated, using a lattice-based model, that colonization of the intestine is more sensitive to changes in proliferation rate than in cell migration23,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stochastic effects, proposed to underlie incomplete penetrance in some neurocristopathies30, have also been investigated using individual-level modelling approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study we use experimental observations to parameterize an agent-based stochastic model that allows us to explore colonization of the trunk epidermis by migrating melanoblasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that a simple mechanism of undirected migration, proliferation and tissue expansion can reconcile the patterns described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Kit mutant melanoblasts migrate normally but have a proliferation defect that results in a depigmented ventral belly spot.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Dermal and epidermal melanoblast migration is undirected', 'To better understand the behaviour of melanoblasts during their colonization of the developing embryo, and to understand how this behaviour may result in the patterns described above (Supplementary Fig 1a,b), we performed ex vivo live imaging of whole mouse embryos at E11.5 and E12.5 and of mouse embryonic skin at E14.5 (refs 31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At E14.5 we used a Tyr::Cre transgene expressing Cre-recombinase under the control of the tyrosinase promoter with R26R-EYFP to label melanoblasts with EYFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At earlier stages, where Tyr::Cre activity in other neural crest lineages made imaging of melanoblasts difficult, we used a Pmel::CreERT2 knock-in line combined with R26R-EYFP (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all time-lapse sequences between E11.5 (Supplementary Movies 1 and 2) and E15.5 melanoblasts migrated constantly, only pausing when they briefly pass through M-phase (Supplementary Movie 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are polarized and move along their longest axis (or Ferets diametersee Fig 1a and Supplementary Movie 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ferets angle is therefore a good proxy for the direction of instantaneous migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of these angles in our time-lapse sequences is uniform, consistent with completely random melanoblast orientation and undirected migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that this was not an artefact of the ex vivo system we stained Dct::lacZ embryos expressing -galactosidase in the melanoblast lineage6 and observed the same random distribution of melanoblast angles at time points between E11.5 and E15.5 (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is thus no directionality associated with melanoblast migration in developing dermis at E11.5E12.5 or epidermis at E13.5E15.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore assume this is also the case at E10.5 when cell numbers are too low to perform a rigorous analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Melanoblast migration is undirected and not driven by repulsion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) A time-lapse sequence of melanoblasts migrating in ex vivo culture of E14.5 skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ferets diameter of each cell body is indicated in cyan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The path of a single migrating cell is indicated in red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Melanoblasts migrate along their Ferets diameterthe longest distance between any two points along a given boundary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of the Ferets angles in the time-lapse sequences invariably conformed to a uniform distribution (KolmogorovSmirnov Test P greater than 0.05 in all cases, n=414 independent tests) implying that melanoblast migration is undirected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) An analysis of the spacing of melanoblasts in the time-lapse sequences at E14.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A range of cell densities was observed at the start of each time-lapse (t=0) between 242 and 780 cells per mm2 (mean±95% CI=448.52±57.46 cells per mm2, n=20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Independent spatial patterns were generated by sampling each time-lapse at 40-min intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each spatial pattern (n=414 patterns) representing the x, y position of the centre of mass of each cell was tested for complete spatial randomness (CSR) using a Bermans test for a point process model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the majority of examples the pattern conforms to CSR (n=412 out of 414 independent tests).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 0.05 significance line is indicated in red, the Bermans P value is plotted against the cell density at t=0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Average PCF for melanoblast spatial organization at E14.5 for data in b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The red line indicates complete spatial randomness at all distances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Melanoblast spacing conforms to CSR at distances over 28 m.

that undirected melanoblast movement and proliferation, in tandem with tissue growth (Fig 2a and Supplementary Table 2) are sufficient for melanoblast colonization and that this simple mechanism can explain the patterns observed in chimeras, individually labelled clones and Kit mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used our observations to parameterize a stochastic model of melanoblast colonization of the trunk (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our modelling framework only considers the growth of the trunk region and its colonization by the migrating melanoblast population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The domain is limited axially to the region between and not including the limb buds and encompasses the complete dorsoventral length (Fig 2a and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assume that no new melanoblasts are specified after E10.5 and therefore that the growing melanoblast population is produced solely by the proliferation of this founder population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Melanoblasts migrate first within the developing dermis between E10.5 and E12.5, and subsequently within the epidermis and dermis between E12.5 and E15.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We collectively refer to the dermal and epidermal layers that can support melanoblast survival as the dorsoventral integument (DVI; Methods, Supplementary Fig 2) and assume that melanoblast behaviour in these compartments is equivalent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We describe above through analysis of cell orientations in Dct::lacZ embryos and time-lapse experiments that there is no directed migration in either compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our simulations we employed an agent-based, discrete-space random-walk model on a growing two-dimensional lattice employing volume exclusion, whereby at most one agent (melanoblast) occupies each square lattice site, and melanoblasts cannot migrate or proliferate into occupied sites40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stochastic events are simulated using the Gillespie algorithm (Methods)41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using the

growth and proliferation we simulated rare melanoblast clones (by mimicking in silico the experiments of Wilkie et al.22; Methods, Fig 3ef), and chimeric patterns (two coloured and multi coloured; Fig 3bc and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis of simulation data suggests that the prominence of stripe-like patterns (an emergent property of the modelFigs 3b,c and 5; column ag) is influenced by the number of clonal subtypes at the start of a simulation and the degree to which they are mixed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that stripes are most apparent when we initialize with only two clonal subtypes where a single, low frequency corresponding to the two-striped pattern is clearly identifiable in the discrete fast Fourier transform (DFFT) of the clonal signal (Fig 4c and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This corresponds to most experimental patterns in mice consisting of only two colours (Fig 3d, Methods and Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis suggests these stripes are composed of multiple subclones of like genotype, formed by the stochastic coalescence of like clones and that, contrary to received wisdom, stripe formation does not proceed through the directed migration of coherent or descendent clones42 but rather stripes form from a favourable arrangement of like clones in the initial conditions that are elongated dorsoventrally by the bias in growth in that direction (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing the number of differently labelled clonal populations removes the stripe-like pattern in the chimeras (Figs 4d and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, compare the panels in Figs 3c and 5ah, showing two-colour and multicolour depictions of single simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dominant patches of colour in the first panel (Fig 3c, top; and Fig 5ag) are composed of multiple subclones in the second (Fig 3c, bottom; and Fig 5bh).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clones originating from what was previously the same labelled subpopulation (but not progeny of the same initial cell) now appear distinct from each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If subpopulations are not well segregated initially then the formation of dorsoventral stripes is also less likely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examples of well-segregated and poorly segregated initial subpopulations and the resulting patterns are shown in Fig 4e,f, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When rare melanoblast clones (Fig 3e,f) are simulated (Methods) and plotted individually, they appear qualitatively similar to the patterns previously described in Dct::laacZ embryos22, and are therefore reconciled with stripe formation in our

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In summary we show experimentally that migrating melanoblasts do not have preferred directionality, but rather diffuse and proliferate throughout the developing skin in a density-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, repulsive events between adjacent melanoblasts do not seem to contribute to their dispersal, and the well-characterized follow my leader behaviour observed in cranial neural crest populations28 was not observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spatial distribution of melanoblasts appears random above a distance of 28 m. Consistent with this, occasional polygonal regions of exclusion are observed (Supplementary Movie 4), reflecting the underlying packing of the epidermal keratinocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate experimentally that melanoblasts carrying the KitW-v mutation do not migrate more slowly, but instead diffuse in a density-dependent manner similar to wild-type melanoblasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutant cells, however, proliferate more slowly than expected, and our modelling suggests that this is the likely cause of the white belly spot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many mutations result in white belly spots48, often in genes that would not be expected to affect cell motility such as the translation initiation factor Eif3c (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  49), the ribosomal protein S7 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  50) and the chromatin-modifying enzyme Mysm1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that in many cases the white spotting is due to defects in melanoblast proliferation rather than motility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using stochastic individual-level modelling we have examined the importance of density-dependent diffusion and proliferation for colonization of the DVI and conclude that colonization is most sensitive to changes in proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in agreement with Zhang et al.29 who explored the interaction between neural crest migration and proliferation using an on-lattice model for the colonization of the gut by enteric ganglia progenitors29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One weakness of our model is that it assumes that melanoblast behaviour is equivalent in the relatively sparsely packed three-dimensional dermal environment between E10.5 and E12.5, and in the more tightly packed two-dimensional epidermal environment between E12.5 and E15.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimentally, we demonstrate that this is qualitatively the case but there will certainly be minor differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The on-lattice approach we use is more appropriate for the latter of these scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to represent these two environments separately would require a computationally intensive hybrid model and a number of new and potentially inaccessible parameters, which would complicate the model and hamper the investigation of the patterning questions we chose to address.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model assumes that all melanoblasts arise by proliferation of the differentiated melanoblasts present at E10.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may not be the case as further cells fated to be melanoblasts may differentiate after E10.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another source of melanoblasts may be from Schwann cell precursors (SCPs) emanating from the dorsal ramus from E12.5 onwards as has been proposed by Adameyko et al.52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as the lineage tracing approach that identified these cells has been questioned53,54 and we have no access to the key parameters of their possible behaviour, incorporating Schwann cell precursor-derived melanoblasts into the present model is not feasible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cheeseman et al.26,27 investigated the dominance of sub-lineages in a lattice-based discrete model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They found that in many cases the progeny of two cells (of the 500 they initialized) could contribute in the order of 25% of the cells in the final population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect was mediated by a process of sequential isolation of individual lineages deprived of space to proliferate into26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This stochastic drift in clone size has been demonstrated experimentally and explored mathematically in the mouse intestine55,56,57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selection of dominant lineages is relatively weak in our simulations of melanoblast domain colonization owing to the more diffuse initial conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More cells are able to establish a significant lineage because they have the required space to proliferate initially and consequently fewer lineages become spatially isolated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that the stripes seen in our model are predominantly formed by the coalescence of multiple like-coloured subclones, and not by the presence of dominant lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in our model, the domain grows in both the dorsoventral and axial directions, whereas in Cheeseman et al.26,27 domain growth is only in the dorsoventral direction or is absent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two-dimensional growth in our model further reduces the role of dominant lineages since cells, which may previously have been isolated, can gain space into which they may proliferate through domain growth events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our modelling shows that the generation of rare clones22 and chimeric patterns19 can proceed through a common mechanism employing tissue expansion and density-dependent movement and proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further experimental clonal analyses, using stochastic labelling methods such as brainbow/confetti57,58, are required to explore whether our predictions of the behaviour of melanoblast subclones are accurate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, belly-spot formation, chimeric patterns and diffuse clonal patterns are all explained by a simple model incorporating random melanoblast migration with proliferation, in conjunction with domain growth, during the course of colonization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, colonization and the observed phenotypes are produced without the need for more complex cellcell interactions or extracellular signals and this has broader implications for cell behaviour in other NCSC lineages and their associated neurocristopathies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
