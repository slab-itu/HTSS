C. elegans maximum velocity correlates with healthspan and is maintained in worms with an insulin receptor mutation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Ageing is marked by physical decline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Caenorhabditis elegans is a valuable model for identifying genetic regulatory mechanisms of ageing and longevity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report a simple method to assess C. elegans maximum physical ability based on the worms maximum movement velocity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show maximum velocity declines with age, correlates well with longevity, accurately reports movement ability and, if measured in mid-adulthood, is predictive of maximal lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to recent findings, we observe that maximum velocity of worm with mutations in daf-2(e1370) insulin/IGF-1 signalling scales with lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of increased odorant receptor expression, daf-2(e1370) mutants prefer food over exploration, causing previous on-food motility assays to underestimate movement ability and, thus, worm health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, a disease-burden analysis of published data reveals that the daf-2(e1370) mutation improves quality of life, and therefore combines lifespan extension with various signs of an increased healthspan.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Ageing is an important risk factor for disease and is accompanied by the decline of many physiological characteristics, including physical performance, negatively affecting quality of life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, quality of life with age, not just longevity, is important for our ageing society.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Caenorhabditis elegans has been a valuable model organism in revealing the genetic regulatory mechanisms of ageing and longevity1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the best-studied longevity pathways is the insulin/IGF-1 signalling (IIS) pathway, which regulates longevity in response to nutrient levels through its control of the activity of the FOXO transcription factor and its downstream targets3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations of the DAF-2 insulin receptor, particularly the canonical allele daf-2(e1370), double lifespan3 and extend the abilities to learn and remember, resist stress and infection, repair axons7, and suppress neuronal morphological defects8,9,10 with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The components of the IIS pathway are well-conserved, and are linked to extreme longevity in humans11 as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, despite the fact that the daf-2 mutation extends many physiological functions with age7,8,9,10, Bansal et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  concluded that daf-2(e1370) IIS mutants are less healthy than wild-type animals, disproportionately extending their unhealthy lifetime2,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One of the most powerful tests of physical ability in elderly humans is the short physical performance battery (SPPB)13, an assessment of the maximum exercise capacity of lower extremities over a short period of time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SPPB accurately predicts risk of disability14, length of hospital stay, and mortality over the year after hospital discharge15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SPPB includes a short (4 m) walk to measure maximum gait speed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like humans, C. elegans shows age-related decline in physical ability, which is manifested by reduced body movement16,17,18,19,20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We wondered whether a similar metric of maximum velocity (MV) in a short period (30 s) would be equally informative in C. elegans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that worms MV declines with age, correlates well with longevity, accurately reports movement ability, and importantly, is predictive of future longevity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  daf-2(e1370) mutations extend MV and healthspan, scaling with lifespan19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Motility assays performed on bacteria underestimate daf-2(e1370) mutants movement ability due to their high odr-10 levels and subsequent preference for food over exploration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used human disease-burden models to assess C. elegans mutants quality of life; quality-adjusted reanalysis of data from previously published healthspan studies2,19 demonstrates that daf-2(e1370) mutants healthspan correlates with longevity extension, and in terms of disease-burden analysis, improves quality of life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IIS pathway mutation daf-2(e1370) coordinates the extension of lifespan with many aspects of healthspan, providing valuable insight into mechanisms that extend functional health with age.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'MV correlates with lifespan', 'To mimic the SPPB test used to assess health in elderly humans, we measured worms MV over 30 s on an unseeded nematode growth medium (NGM) plate each day of adulthood (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our assay differs from previous motility assays in its brevity (30 s versus 5 min (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21) or longer23), longitudinal testing of individual worms rather than populations, and measurement on plates without bacteria2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MV appears to not simply be a response to harsh touch, as harsh-touch mutants behave like wild-type worms in the assay, and the MV is distributed over the entire 30 s window for all animals (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To assess age-associated decline of physical performance, we measured MV of 52 individual wild-type worms each day of their lifespan (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that motility decreased with age (Supplementary Fig 3), with MV declining earlier and more drastically than mean velocity (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the early phase of adulthood (day 15), MV of individual worms was maintained in the range of 0.220.52 mm s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, from day 6 onwards, all worms showed a decline in MV with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: MV is correlated with longevity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Age-dependent changes in the MV of 52 individual wild-type worms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Black dots represent the average value at each age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b,c) Correlation between MV and lifespan (b) and correlation between mean velocity and lifespan (c) of individual worms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MVs and mean velocities of individual worms were measured at day 9 of adulthood and their lifespans were measured thereafter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  r2, coefficient of determination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n=173.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Survival curves of the low-MV (n=89) and high-MV (n=84) group worms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The groups were divided at day 9 of adulthood (grey dotted line) and the survivorship of worms in each group was measured thereafter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Correlation of MV with mitochondrial morphology at day 9 of adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scores of mitochondrial morphology of low-MV and high-MV groups were 1.3±0.5 and 2.5±0.5, respectively (n=27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bottom and top of the box and whiskers are the first and third quartiles, and the band inside the box is the average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significance was determined using a two-tailed, unpaired t-test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ****P less_than 0.0001.Full size image', 'We grouped worms into high (0.22 mm s1) and low (0.21 mm s1) MVs; the criterion was based on the minimum MV at day 1 of adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The population of the low-MV group increased almost exponentially, reaching 54.6% by day 9 of adulthood (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then examined the correlation between MV of worms at day 9 of adulthood (midlife) and their lifespan thereafter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Day 9 MV correlated well with lifespan (coefficient of determination (r2)=0.71), better than the correlation between lifespan and mean velocity (r2=0.44; Fig 1b,c), thrashing rate (r2=0.18; Supplementary Fig 5), or pharyngeal pumping (r2=0.65; Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the median lifespan of worms in the day 9 high-MV group (23±3.2 days) was 35.3% longer than that of the worms in the day 9 low-MV group (17±3.6 days; Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, MV of wild-type worms at day 9 of adulthood is a reliable predictor of longevity thereafter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In humans, mitochondrial defects are associated with ageing of skeletal muscle and are correlated with reduced physical strength in the elderly24,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Young C. elegans mitochondria are tubular27; however, gradual fragmentation with age results in sparse, globular mitochondria (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At day 9 of adulthood, worms in the low-MV range had very fragmented mitochondria, while the high-MV range groups mitochondria were significantly less damaged at the same age (Fig 1e and Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, expression of the protective lifespan biomarker sod-3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28) was 1.7-fold higher in the high-MV group than in the low-MV group (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data show that MV correlates with two age-associated physiological parameters, and suggest that mechanisms determining MV might also regulate mitochondrial integrity maintenance and stress protection gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'daf-2(e1370) mutation extends healthspan', 'We next assessed the MV of long-lived daf-2(e1370) insulin/IGF-1 receptor mutants and short-lived mutants of the DAF-16 FOXO transcription factor (daf-16(mu86)), which is required for daf-2 mutants longevity3,4,29 (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  daf-2 animals exhibited a higher MV with age, particularly from day 10 onwards (Fig 2bd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At day 26 of adulthood, when all the wild-type worms had died, daf-2 mutants still maintained on average 36% of MV (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined the correlation of MV on each day with the lifespan for the worms in the longitudinally tracked cohort (Figs 1a and 2b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correlation between MV and lifespan is best on day 9 for N2 worms, day 23 for daf-2 and day 10 for daf-16 (Supplementary Fig 9); in all cases, the best correlation between MV and lifespan occurs within 1 day of the first death in the cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We integrated the area under the MV curve to serve as an indicator of overall physical performance; daf-2 mutants showed a 2.4-fold increase over wild type, and daf-16 mutants showed slightly lower physical performance (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, daf-2(e1370) mutation extends physical ability with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Correlation of MV with lifespan in daf-2 mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Age-associated change of survivorship in N2 (wild type) (n=52), daf-2(e1370) (n=32) and daf-16(mu86) (n=42) worms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b,c) Age-associated change of MVs in daf-2 (b) and daf-16 mutant worms (c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Age-associated change of average MVs in N2 (n=52), daf-2 (n=32) and daf-16 (n=42) mutant worms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars represent s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) A cumulative difference in physical performance in N2 and daf-16 and daf-2 mutant worms as indicated by area under curves in d.

high levels of odr-10 suppress food-exploration behaviour30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ryan et al.30 showed that odr-10, despite the fact that it is only expressed in the AWA neurons and primarily detects diacetyl, plays a major role in food detection and is the primary factor in determining the decision of males to explore (mate search) rather than feed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we found that the expression of odr-10, which contains a DAF-16-binding element 809 bp upstream of its start site, is elevated 1520-fold in daf-2(e1370) mutants (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we observed that reduction of odr-10 levels dramatically increases daf-2s motility on bacteria: unlike control-treated animals, which stop moving after 1.53 min when placed onto bacteria, daf-2(e1370);odr-10(RNAi) worms continue to move constantly over a 10 min assay period (Fig 3b), and reduction of wild-type worms odr-10 levels has no significant effect (Fig 3c and Supplementary Movies 1, 2, 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Interestingly, knockdown of other genes involved in odour detection, including odr-3, odr-7 and osm-9, did not have the same effect on daf-2(e1370) motility (Supplementary Fig 10).)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, motility can only be measured accurately off food, because movement on bacteria measures food-seeking rather than ability to move.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Motility on bacteria measures food preference rather than ability to move.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Two sets of primers (#1 and #2) were used to measure the expression of odr-10 by qRT-PCR in N2 and daf-2 mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each primer set, odr-10 expression in wild type was normalized to 1. odr-10 expression in daf-2 mutants increased by 15.2±0.2-fold and 19.4±3.1-fold, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Reduction of odr-10 levels by RNAi increased daf-2 motility on bacteria significantly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  daf-2 on OP50: 0.04±0.03 mm s1;

Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reanalysis of the Bansal et al.2 data using this approach suggests that while not all longevity mutants have a commensurate increase in life quality (in fact, some longevity mutants, such as clk-1, exhibit lower total quality, as Bansal et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  reported), increased health and extended lifespan result in a higher total quality for daf-2(e1370) mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (We note that the cumulative quality-adjusted score for thrashing is equivalent for daf-2(e1370) and wild type, but that thrashing has little correlation overall with longevity (Supplementary Fig 5).)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reached a similar conclusion upon reanalysis of the data from Huang et al.19, which also measured several healthspan parameters (Fig 4d and Supplementary Fig 11a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, applying this analysis to our own MV data shows the same dramatic increase in daf-2(e1370) lifespan quality (Supplementary Fig 11ce).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus it appears from multiple analyses of healthspan that daf-2(e1370) mutants have a higher quality of life than wild-type worms.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Here we have modelled the SPPB assessment of physical ability in elderly humans in worms, using a simple assay of C. elegans maximum ability to move over a short period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MV correlates well with age; in fact, MV performance at midlife (day 9) can predict the remaining lifespan of the individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis also reveals that other widely used healthspan metrics are less correlated with lifespan; thrashing is a particularly poor correlate (r2=0.18), while pumping has a good correlation (r2=0.65) but shows highly irregular patterns (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, MV is a powerful healthspan proxy and may be the most informative metric of C. elegans health with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An unexpected benefit of this experimental design is that it is not confounded by the worms ongoing assessment of its bacterial food source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discovered that daf-2 has an inherently higher preference for food than exploration, likely due to its increased expression level of the daf-2/daf-16 target odr-10; high levels of the ODR-10 odour receptor cause daf-2 worms to prefer food over exploration, slowing its movement on bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Further, our data on other chemosensory genes suggest that odr-10 is a particularly good indicator of food preference.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As this type of movement is not limited by ability, but rather by preference, it may be difficult to draw conclusions regarding healthspan from on-food motility assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Measurements that take into account both lifespan and healthiness are important in assessing quality of life with age, and the clinical implications of coordinated extension of lifespan and healthspan are immense.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not all lifespan interventions will improve health or total quality, as clk-1 mutants demonstrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, several longevity mutants are less healthy overall than wild-type worms by different measurements, and it is important to note which mutants may have a long life with no health benefit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we find no evidence to support the claim by Bansal et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  that daf-2(e1370) mutants spend a greater fraction of life in a frail state; in fact, daf-2 mutants demonstrate that healthspan and lifespan can be coordinately extended.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the analysis of our own data and that of published experiments, it seems clear that daf-2 extends not only lifespan, but also many abilities with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the standard C. elegans-specific healthspan assays (heat stress, oxidative stress and movement), daf-2 extends behaviours that are relevant for human decline with age, as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This includes the abilities to learn and remember34, repair axons7, resist pathogenic infections35, suppress age-related neuronal morphological defects8,9,10 and neurodegenerative protein aggregation36, maintain neuromuscular junction activity23,37, and maintain high-quality oocytes with age38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of the downstream targets of the daf-2 insulin signalling pathway6 that enable these functions have been identified, and many of these genes and the underlying mechanisms are conserved in mammals; therefore, the extended abilities that daf-2 exhibits offers therapeutic target possibilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Defining healthspan and gerospan based on population maximum lifespans ignores the fact that quality is a continuum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, our analysis takes into account the length of time an individual can expect to live, and how healthy that individual can expect to be with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of daf-2(e1370) mutants, quality of life is clearly superior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanistic study of coordinated health and life extension might allow the development of therapeutics to remedy end-of-life problems or to compress morbidity, decreasing health costs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C. elegans IIS longevity mutants remain valuable tools in understanding the mechanisms by which we might achieve these goals.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
