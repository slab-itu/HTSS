BCAS2 is involved in alternative mRNA splicing in spermatogonia and the transition to meiosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Breast cancer amplified sequence 2 (BCAS2) is involved in multiple biological processes, including pre-mRNA splicing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the physiological roles of BCAS2 are still largely unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that BCAS2 is specifically enriched in spermatogonia of mouse testes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conditional disruption of Bcas2 in male germ cells impairs spermatogenesis and leads to male mouse infertility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the spermatogonia appear grossly normal, spermatocytes in meiosis prophase I and meiosis events (recombination and synapsis) are rarely observed in the BCAS2-depleted testis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In BCAS2 null testis, 245 genes are altered in alternative splicing forms; at least three spermatogenesis-related genes (Dazl, Ehmt2 and Hmga1) can be verified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, disruption of Bcas2 results in a significant decrease of the full-length form and an increase of the short form (lacking exon 8) of DAZL protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, our results suggest that BCAS2 regulates alternative splicing in spermatogonia and the transition to meiosis initiation, and male fertility.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is critical for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, during which particular exons from the same pre-mRNA might be excluded, included or modified to produce multiple mature mRNAs, often in an organ-, tissue- or cell-type-specific manner1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, alternative splicing significantly expands the form and function of the genome of organisms with limited gene number and is especially important for highly complex organisms and tissues4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Highly complex tissues, such as the testis and brain, have more gene splicing variants than any other tissues4,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mouse testis, spermatogenesis is a complex process involving mitotic cell division, meiosis and spermiogenesis to give rise to haploid spermatozoa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternative splicing variants, especially exon-skipping forms, are enriched in several stages of mouse spermatogenesis7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a number of trans-acting regulators of pre-mRNA splicing are primarily or exclusively expressed in the testis9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Substantial evidence suggests that pre-mRNA splicing is an important regulator of mouse spermatogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the roles of most spliced forms of specific genes during this process are unclear, several genes important for spermatogenesis have specific splice variants in different developmental stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, c-kit is specifically expressed in differentiating spermatogonia and is essential for the survival and proliferation of pre-meiotic germ cells11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the truncated form of c-kit (tr-kit) is expressed in the post-meiotic stages of spermatogenesis and enriched in spermatozoa, and could trigger parthenogenesis activation when injected into the cytoplasm of MII oocytes14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, numerous trans-acting regulators of pre-mRNA splicing are important for spermatogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Ptbp2, a key alternative-splicing regulator in the nervous system, is critical for male germ cell survival and male fertility through regulating the proper alternative splicing of germ cell messenger RNAs (mRNA) in the testis16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rbm5, a male germ cell splicing factor, is essential for the appropriate alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs involved in spermatid differentiation17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ranbp9 (Ran-binding protein 9) is also involved in regulating the proper splicing pattern of some spermatogenic mRNAs by interacting with several essential splicing factors (e.g., SF3B3 and HNRNPM) and poly (A) binding proteins (PABPs)18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite protracted effort, deciphering how alternative pre-mRNA splicing functions during spermatogenesis remains a great challenge for the field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Breast carcinoma amplified sequence 2 (BCAS2) is preferentially known as pre-mRNA splicing factor SPF27 and was originally characterized as an up-regulated gene by amplification in human breast cancer cells19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent studies reveal that BCAS2 is a core component of the CDC5L/Prp19 complex21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Prp19 complex is highly conserved and is involved in the assembly and conformation of the spliceosome, especially important for the catalytic activation of the spliceosome21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutation of the yeast BCAS2 ortholog Cwf7 or Snt309 results in the accumulation of pre-mRNA24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Drosophila melanogaster, BCAS2 is essential for viability and may function in pre-mRNA splicing26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BCAS2 has also been shown to be involved in DNA damage repair through the replication protein A (RPA) complex in various cell lines28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, we found that maternal BCAS2 responds to endogenous and exogenous DNA damage in mouse zygotes and maintains the genomic integrity of mouse early embryos through RPA (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the roles of BCAS2 are context-specific depending on the model system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, the physiological function of BCAS2 is still largely unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we found that BCAS2 was comparatively enriched in spermatogonia of the mouse testis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disruption of BCAS2 in germ cells with Vasa-Cre led to male infertility, but has little effect on spermatogonia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the spermatogonia were grossly normal, spermatocytes in meiosis prophase I were scarce and meiosis events did not occur in the BCAS2-depleted testis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further showed that BCAS2 was involved in pre-mRNA splicing in spermatogonia in the mouse testis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data reveal a critical role of BCAS2 involving in pre-mRNA splicing of spermatogonia and the transition to meiosis, and male fertility.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The alternative pre-mRNA splicing process is implemented by a synergism of the spliceosome, cis-acting RNA elements and specific trans-acting factors47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spliceosome is a large and dynamic RNAprotein complex that consists of five small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) (U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6) and several hundred proteins that are critical for the recognition of splice sites, assembly of specific stages of the spliceosome and catalytic activity of the splicing reaction49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the mitotic-to-meiotic transition in mouse spermatogenesis, the expression of many key alternative splicing regulators is stage-specific9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, proteomic analyses have shown that 58 RNA splicing proteins, including spliceosome components U1U6 snRNPs-related proteins and many splicing factors, were more highly expressed in type A spermatogonia and pachytene spermatocyte cell clusters50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, the patterns of alternative splicing are substantially changed in a stage-specific manner during this process9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stage-enriched expression of splicing proteins and the substantial changes in alternative splicing patterns around meiosis suggest that alternative splicing might be critical for the mitotic-to-meiotic transition during mouse spermatogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As a core component of the splicing-related Prp19 complex, direct interaction of BCAS2 with PRP19 and the spliceosome is important for spliceosome assembly in yeast22,51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BCAS2 is universally expressed in organisms, and conventional disruption of BCAS2 results in early embryonic lethality26,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The early embryonic lethality and the complexity of cell types at this stage impede the investigation of BCAS2 in detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, BCAS2 was comparatively enriched in mouse spermatogonia, prompting us to investigate the role of BCAS2 in mouse spermatogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a conditional knockout mouse model, we demonstrated that specific deletion of Bcas2 in male germ cells leads to a failure of spermatogenesis and male infertility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Bcas2-depleted testes, meiosis failed to initiate and very few meiotic prophase spermatocytes were observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, spermatogonia appeared to be grossly normal in Bcas2F/;Vasa-Cre male mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the major defect is most likely in the mitosis-to-meiosis transition during spermatogenesis in Bcas2F/;Vasa-Cre male testes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, Bcas2F/;Vasa-Cre male mice are a good model for investigating the role of BCAS2 involved in splicing in the mitosis-to-meiosis transition of mouse spermatogonia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The switch from mitosis to meiosis is a critical step of germ cell development that requires Dazl, the meiosis promoting factor46,53,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA-binding protein DAZL can target many crucial mRNAs (such as Mvh, Sycp3, Tpx-1 and Tex19.1) and regulate the translation of these target genes during germ cell development55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the role of its variants is still unclear, Dazl-FL and Dazl-8 variants have been identified in ES cells58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we found that the level of DAZL-FL protein is much higher than DAZL-8 in normal mouse testes, suggesting that DAZL-FL might be the main functional form during spermatogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of Bcas2 leads to dramatic skipping of exon 8 and significant retention of intron 7 in Dazl, suggesting a critical role for the precise control of Dazl splicing during normal spermatogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the roles of Dazl-8 with skipped exon 8 and retention of intron 7 are unknown, in fact, we observed a dramatic decrease in DAZL-FL protein and a significant reduction in total DAZL protein, suggesting that deletion of Bcas2 leads to a significant degree of loss-of-function of DAZL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although spermatogonia remain in the seminiferous tubules of Bcas2F/;Vasa-Cre testes, only a few spermatocytes are observed that do not move into pachytene, which is consistent with observations in Dazl null testes59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the protein levels of SCP3, MVH and STRA8, which are targets of DAZL, are dramatically lower in the testes of Bcas2F/;Vasa-Cre males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, the meiotic events (recombination and synapsis) do not occur in Bcas2F/;Vasa-Cre testes and the expression of marker genes of meiotic prophase is significantly reduced as early as P9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that Bcas2 might be is critical for meiotic initiation via regulating Dazl splicing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We also find that Bcas2 depletion affects splicing of several hundred genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The affected genes include genes of the functional class RNA processing, chromosome organization and regulation of transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, several verified genes are grouped in the functional class sexual reproduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of these genes play important roles in mouse spermatogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ehmt2 (also known as G9a) is an important mammalian H3K9 methyltransferase and is essential for mouse embryogenesis by transcriptional silencing60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  G9a deficient male germ cells are arrested at the early pachytene stage of meiosis prophase with disordered progression of synaptonemal complex formation61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hmga1 (the high mobility group A1) is critical for determining chromatin structure and is involved in transcriptional regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tubules of Hmga1+/ male mice are already apparently devoid of spermatocytes and no other stages of spermatozoa and spermatids62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, abnormalities in Ehmt2 and Hmga1 splicing regulated by Bcas2 may play a role in both male fertility and growth retardation of the germ cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we also found that the abundance of mature tuba3a, tuba3b and tubb4b mRNAs was lower in the Bcas2F/;Vasa-Cre testes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies showed that loss-of-function of CDC5 (core component of Prp19 complex) leads to cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase because of inefficient splicing of the tubulin-encoding TUB1 mRNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, microtubule dynamics function in determining Sertoli cell shape, and mitotic and meiotic spindle and sperm flagella development and are thus essential for male fertility63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these abnormal splicing events resulting from Bcas2 depletion may also account for the loss of spermatocytes and failure of meiosis initiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'BCAS2 has multiple functions in several pathways, including RNA splicing and DNA damage repair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we did not observe an accumulation of H2AX expression in spermatogonia in Bcas2F/;Vasa-Cre testes during the meiosis initiation phase (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the expression of most genes is not affected in Bcas2F/;Vasa-Cre testes at P9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that BCAS2 mainly functions through RNA splicing but not DNA damage in mouse spermatogonia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, our results suggest that BCAS2 is involved in pre-mRNA splicing in spermatogonia and is essential for mouse spermatogenesis and male fertility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This research provides the first evidence for alternative splicing machinery regulating meiosis initiation in germ cells during mouse spermatogenesis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Bcas2F/;Vasa-Cre samples by combining two P values calculated using the Fisher exact test (P value of junction read-counts and P value based on the alternative exon read coverage relative to its gene read coverage between control and Bcas2F/;Vasa-Cre samples) using a weighted arithmetic equation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GO term enrichment and functional annotation analyses of genes identified by ASD software were conducted using database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery (DAVID).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The integrative genomics viewer tool (IGV) was used for efficient and flexible visualization and exploration of spliced sites between control and Bcas2F/;Vasa-Cre samples on standard desktop computers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Statistical analysis', 'The results of all quantitative
