Cyanobacterial symbionts diverged in the late Cretaceous towards lineage-specific nitrogen fixation factories in single-celled phytoplankton  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The unicellular cyanobacterium UCYN-A, one of the major contributors to nitrogen fixation in the open ocean, lives in symbiosis with single-celled phytoplankton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  UCYN-A includes several closely related lineages whose partner fidelity, genome-wide expression and time of evolutionary divergence remain to be resolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we detect and distinguish UCYN-A1 and UCYN-A2 lineages in symbiosis with two distinct prymnesiophyte partners in the South Atlantic Ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both symbiotic systems are lineage specific and differ in the number of UCYN-A cells involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analyses infer a streamlined genome expression towards nitrogen fixation in both UCYN-A lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparative genomics reveal a strong purifying selection in UCYN-A1 and UCYN-A2 with a diversification process 91 Myr ago, in the late Cretaceous, after the low-nutrient regime period occurred during the Jurassic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that UCYN-A diversified in a co-evolutionary process, wherein their prymnesiophyte partners acted as a barrier driving an allopatric speciation of extant UCYN-A lineages.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Symbiotic relationships involving diazotrophic microorganisms, that is, those capable of converting dissolved dinitrogen gas into ammonia, are of relevant interest in marine biogeochemistry because they represent major sources of fixed nitrogen, a limiting nutrient for primary production in the worlds oceans1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, identifying these interactions is essential for understanding the role of symbiosis in biogeochemical cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fortunately, the application of novel approaches such as high-throughput sequencing and single-cell genomics has greatly accelerated the pace of microbial symbiosis research2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is notable in the case of Candidatus Atelocyanobacterium thalassa (UCYN-A), a unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacterium, and its partner, a single-celled eukaryotic alga of the class Prymnesiophyceae4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prymnesiophytes as well as UCYN-A are abundant and widely distributed members of the marine plankton and represent ecologically relevant players in carbon and nitrogen cycles5,6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The streamlined genome of UCYN-A and the striking lack of genes encoding the photosystem II complex, the Calvin/Benson/Bassham cycle for carbon fixation, as well as other essential pathways such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle, hinted at a symbiotic lifestyle10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  UCYN-A is now known to establish a mutualistic relationship based on the exchange of fixed carbon and nitrogen with two different cell-sized prymnesiophyte partners, the unicellular alga Braarudosphaera bigelowii (710 m)13,14 and an uncultured closely related prymnesiophyte (13 m)4,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Phylogenomic analyses have demonstrated the monophyly of UCYN-A within the marine cyanobacteria clade that includes Crocosphaera sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and Cyanothece sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  clades12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phylogenetic analysis of the UCYN-A nitrogenase gene (nifH) sequences, a common marker used to address the diversity of N2-fixing microorganisms, distinguished at least three distinct UCYN-A clades: UCYN-A1, UCYN-A2 and UCYN-A3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparative genomics revealed that UCYN-A1 and UCYN-A2 lineages share largely syntenic genomic structures, suggesting that both lineages diverged after genome reduction from a common ancestor12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, their time of evolutionary divergence and evolutionary pressures remain unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been suggested that these two variants could be adapted to different niches, that is, coastal waters (B. bigelowii) and open ocean (its closely related prymnesiophyte)14, but this ecological differentiation was recently ruled out9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the two prymnesiophyte partners could follow different ecological strategies9, the partner fidelity has never been tested in this symbiotic system, and therefore we cannot assume a similar ecological niche for their symbionts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparative gene expression studies could help to disentangle the ecological distinction of these two UCYN-A lineages but they are scarce and solely focused on the nifH gene expression without showing a clear differentiation in lineage-specific patterns14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By designing and applying new probes in double catalysed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH), we identified the specific symbiotic associations at the UCYN-A lineage level in samples from South Atlantic waters from the Tara Oceans expedition, where we had previously verified significant abundances of the prymnesiophyte partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new probes allowed us to differentiate both symbiotic systems that resulted to vary in the number of UCYN-A cells involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coupled analyses of metagenomes and metatranscriptomes from surface and deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) depths that encompassed four different plankton size fractions distinguish different prymnesiophyte partners based on difference in cell sizes captured in different size fractions, complementing and extending the results obtained by CARD-FISH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene expression was explored in the two UCYN-A lineages to decipher whether distinct lineages, in association with distinct partners, exhibit different expression patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we investigated the evolutionary pressures acting on UCYN-A1 and UCYN-A2 lineages by comparative genomic analyses and performed phylogenomic analyses to estimate the age divergence of the two symbiotic lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings support a symbionthost co-evolutionary scenario in the marine environment originating from a single ancestral symbiotic event in the late Cretaceous from which at least two different UCYN-A lineages diversified to become lineage-specific nitrogen fixation factories in their prymnesiophyte partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these investigations improve our understanding of the relevance of co-evolutionary processes in marine ecosystems and the ecological significance of N2-fixing symbiosis in the marine biogeochemical cycles.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results and Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Partner fidelity of the two UCYN-A lineages', 'Microscopic in situ identification of different UCYN-A lineages as well as their prymnesiophyte partners by specific CARD-FISH staining is crucial to determine the specificity of their relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CARD-FISH method has been successfully applied to identify unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacteria16 as well as specifically targeting the UCYN-A clade15,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to our knowledge there was not any reported probe to distinguish UCYN-A at the lineage level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We designed a competitor probe to be used with the UCYN-A732 probe15 to distinguish UCYN-A1 and UCYN-A2 lineages (Fig 1ac; Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, we designed two probes to distinguish the two prymnesiophyte partners, B. bigelowii (UBRADO69 probe) and the closely related prymnesiophyte (UPRYM69 probe) (Fig 1ac; Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The UCYN-A732 probe, in the absence of its competitor, labelled UCYN-A cells inside either B. bigelowii or the closely related prymnesiophyte partner (Fig 1a,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when the UBRADO69 probe was applied with the UCYN-A732 probe together with its competitor, UCYN-A cells were unlabelled or labelled when accompanying B. bigelowii or the closely related prymnesiophyte partner, respectively (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been proposed that smaller UCYN-A cells are associated with smaller prymnesiophyte cells and vice versa, indicating different growth stages17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, those findings were interpreted from microscopic observations of the UCYN-A symbiosis detected with the general prymnesiophyte PRYM02 and UCYN-A732 (without its competitor) probes, that is, without the ability to distinguish UCYN-A1 and UCYN-A2 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results presented here show that both prymnesiophyte partners are phylogenetically closely related but distinct species, and therefore we suggest that the observed differences in cell sizes of prymnesiophyte partners reflect distinct species rather than different growth stages of the same species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that UCYN-A lineages display partner fidelity with their prymnesiophyte partners, being B. bigelowii and the closely related prymnesiophyte in specific association with UCYN-A2 and UCYN-A1 lineages, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Partner specificity and variation of UCYN-A lineages with plankton size fraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ac) Epifluorescence microscopy images with the double-CARD-FISH assay showing the specificity of symbionthost pairs and (df) fragment recruitment of UCYN-A lineages in size-fractionated metagenomes from surface waters collected in station TARA_078.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ac) Left panels correspond to the 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole signal (blue-labelled DNA); right panels correspond to the combined signal of the prymnesiophyte-specific probes (green-labelled host under blue light excitation) and the UCYN-A probe (red-labelled symbiont under green-light excitation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) UCYN-A1 with its prymnesiophyte partner; (b) the two UCYN-A symbiotic pairs, indicating the specific labelling of UCYN-A1 (upper) and B. bigelowii (lower) with their specific partners, the small prymnesiophyte closely related to B. bigelowii and UCYN-A2 respectively; (c) B. bigelowii with UCYN-A2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inset in c shows the detail of non-associated UCYN-A2 cells within a common symbiotic structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prymnesiophyte partners are indicated by arrow heads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar in a represents 5 m and this scale is shared in ac except in the inset of c where it indicates 2 m.

shown that the prymnesiophyte partners can harbour one or two UCYN-A cells4,9,13,15, pointing to a coupling between the prymnesiophyte cell division and the number of symbiotic cells, at least for UCYN-A1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our samples, only one UCYN-A1 cell per prymnesiophyte cell was detected (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, B. bigelowii carried a symbiosome-like compartment with a variable but higher number of UCYN-A2 cells (310 cells) (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This structure was observed both attached to the host and in a free state, as an entity composed by several UCYN-A2 cells enclosed by a common envelope (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a previous study, the UCYN-A2 cells found in B. bigelowii were separated from the B. bigelowii cytoplasm by a single membrane, likely a perisymbiont membrane, and the envelope of the UCYN-A2 itself consisted of three layers, possibly an outer membrane, a peptidoglycan wall and a plasma membrane13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although UCYN-A1 and UCYN-A2 are very similar in terms of gene content, the genes involved in cell wall biogenesis and cell shape determination appear to be only present in UCYN-A2, suggesting clear structural differences associated with its host12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our observations hint at different symbiotic organizations: while the UCYN-A1 lineage has one or two separated cells per host, the UCYN-A2 lineage may harbour up to 10 cells per prymnesiophyte partner cell within a common symbiotic structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'UCYN-A lineages vary in different plankton size fractions', 'A total of eight marine metagenomes from stations TARA_078 and TARA_076 were analysed to assess the distribution of UCYN-A lineages in several plankton size fractions (0.23, 0.85, 520 and  greater than 0.8 m) of the microbial assemblages in surface and DCM waters (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the two UCYN-A genomes sequenced to date as reference genomes11,12 in the fragment recruitment of these metagenomic samples (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the UCYN-A partner fidelity displayed by double CARD-FISH (see above), metagenomic sequence reads from UCYN-A lineages should vary with size fraction as predicted by the different cell sizes of the prymnesiophyte partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequence reads from the UCYN-A1 lineage were primarily present in surface waters within the size fraction range of the small prymnesiophyte partner (0.23, 0.85 and  greater than 0.8 m; Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Almost 100% of the UCYN-A1 genome was recovered in each of the metagenomes from surface of these size fractions in the two stations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, UCYN-A1 sequence reads were poorly represented in the 520 m size fraction (10% of genome recovery; Fig 1df; Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, in TARA_078, the UCYN-A2 sequence read distribution in surface waters was consistent with the B. bigelowii cell size, that is, UCYN-A2 reads were nearly absent in the 0.23 m size fraction metagenomes, but were more abundant in the 0.85, 520 and  greater than 0.8 m fractions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all these larger fractions, the UCYN-A2 reached high genome recovery values (90%, 76% and 99%, respectively), except for the  greater than 0.8 m fraction in TARA_076 where UCYN-A2 was virtually absent (Fig 1df, Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the  greater than 0.8 m size fraction, UCYN-A1 was approximately nine times more abundant than UCYN-A2 in TARA_078 (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, in the same station, the small prymnesiophyte partner was more abundant than B. bigelowii based on V9 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) tags9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the DCM samples, both UCYN-A lineages were poorly represented in the metagenome sequences, accounting for  less_than 14% and 1% of genome recovery for UCYN-A1 and UCYN-A2, respectively (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same vertical distribution has been observed for their prymnesiophyte partners that were found preferentially in surface layers, while the rest of the prymnesiophyte assemblage peaked at the DCM9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, although the UCYN-A1 lineage was in general more abundant than UCYN-A2, a transition from the UCYN-A1 to UCYN-A2 lineage was observed from smaller to larger size fractions, likely explained by the partner fidelity and the difference in cell size of their prymnesiophyte partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Fragment recruitment (FR) of UCYN-A lineages.Full size table', 'Another interesting finding was that most of the metagenomic (and metatranscriptomic) reads mapping to the UCYN-A1 or UCYN-A2 genomes had very high sequence identities ( greater than 99% to their respective reference genome; Fig 1df), which suggests an extremely low microdiversity within populations that were sampled from geographically distant regions in the Pacific (ALOHA and SIO) and South Atlantic Oceans (this study).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The size-fractionated sampling strategy combined with the metagenomic analyses reported in this study will be also important to uncover the genomic pool of new UCYN-A lineages, such as UCYN-A3, to identify the lineage-specific distribution of UCYN-A populations and to set the cell size range of their partners, a first step for their identification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'UCYN-A expression is streamlined to fuel nitrogen fixation', 'The analyses of seven size-fractionated metatranscriptomes from two stations (TARA_078 and TARA_076) and depths (surface and DCM) allowed for the first time a whole-genome transcription profiling of these widely distributed diazotrophic cyanobacteria (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In surface waters, UCYN-A1 transcripts were in general more abundant than those from UCYN-A2, except in the 520 m size fraction (TARA_078) in which the latter were dominant (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gene expression of 1,131 and 1,179 protein-coding genes in UCYN-A1 (Supplementary Data 1) and UCYN-A2 (Supplementary Data 2), respectively, were examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both lineages, the nitrogen fixation operon, including the nifH gene, was the most highly expressed gene-cluster accounting for a quarter of the total transcripts (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the  greater than 0.8 m size fraction (TARA_078), despite UCYN-A1 being more abundant than UCYN-A2, the expressed nifH transcripts per cell were almost two times higher for UCYN-A2 (648.33) than for UCYN-A1 (396.60; Supplementary Data 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is well known that biological nitrogen fixation has a high energetic cost (16 mol of ATP to generate 2 mol of ammonia).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the F0F1-ATP synthase operon and genes encoding for the cytochrome b6f complex and photosystem I complex (PSI) were highly transcribed and positively correlated (P less_than 105, N=6, linear regression analysis) with the nitrogen fixation operon transcript abundances (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that the generation of reducing power and the ATP synthesis could be coupled to fuel the nitrogen fixation process in UCYN-A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, UCYN-A2 might have higher nitrogen fixation rates per cell than UCYN-A1 based on the higher number of nifH transcripts per cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is reasonable to assume that the differences in nifH gene expression between the UCYN-A lineages could simply reflect the differences in the cell size of their partners with differential nutrient requirements for growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, it has been indirectly demonstrated that the nitrogen fixation of UCYN-A supports the CO2 fixation of its prymnesiophyte partner18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we hypothesize that the larger B. bigelowii host cell would meet its larger N nutrient requirements by partnering with a larger number of UCYN-A2 symbiotic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Genome expression in UCYN-A1 and UCYN-A2 lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a)

oxygen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of the ability to use photosystem II that evolves O2 explains why UCYN-A appears to fix N2 and express the nitrogenase genes during the day19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, its association with an oxygen-evolving partner could make the nitrogenase enzyme in UCYN-A not completely safe from oxygen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that the sufB gene (cysteine desulferase), involved in the assembly or repair of oxygen-labile ironsulfur clusters under oxidative stress, was highly transcribed (Supplementary Data 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may be that UCYN-A requires high expression level of sufB genes to repair the nitrogenase enzyme from oxygenic inactivation, suggesting then a similar role than for the peroxidase genes found in their genomes11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings reveal that UCYN-A lineages dedicate a large transcriptional investment to fix nitrogen representing the first whole-genome expression profiling in environmental UCYN-A populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'UCYN-A diverged during the late Cretaceous', 'Our findings on partner fidelity in UCYN-A point to the hypothesis of symbionthost co-evolution14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To analyse the selection pressure and evolution of the protein-coding genes, we calculated the number of synonymous or silent (Ks) and non-synonymous (Ka, inducing amino-acid change) nucleotide substitutions20,21 for 887 protein-coding genes shared by the UCYN-A1 and UCYN-A2 genomes (Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ka/Ks ratio may offer important clues about the selection pressure where ratios  less_than 1 indicate purifying selection and ratios  greater than 1 point to positive selection22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that 873 out of the 887 protein-coding genes were under purifying selection (P less_than 0.05, codon-based Z-test) (Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 14 remaining genes also presented Ka/Ks less_than 1 but were not statistically well supported (P greater than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purifying selection means that synonymous mutations are maintained, while non-synonymous mutations are continuously removed from the population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not detect signs of large-scale positive selection, that is, no apparent strong adaptation to novel niches in UCYN-A lineages, suggesting that the evolutionary forces for niche adaptation would act on the prymnesiophyte partners rather than on UCYN-A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results are consistent with the fact that UCYN-A2 lacks the same major pathways and proteins that are absent in UCYN-A1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12), indicating then that the symbionts were genetically adapted to their hosts before they were separated by speciation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The age of divergence for UCYN-A1 and UCYN-A2 lineages was calculated by phylogenomic and Bayesian relaxed molecular clock analyses (Fig 3; Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that UCYN-A1 and UCYN-A2 lineages diverged around 91 Myr ago, that is, during the late Cretaceous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement, B. bigelowii has a fossil record extending back to the late Cretaceous (ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  100 Myr ago)23, reported from neritic and pelagic sediments, for example, in lower Paleogene sediments immediately above the K/Pg mass extinction level as well as in the Oligocene Diversity Minimum24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Jurassic, between 190 and 100 Myr ago, nutrient availability in the ocean was lower than at any point during the last 550 Myr ago26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore likely that the symbiotic relationship between the common ancestor of UCYN-A1 and UCYN-A2, and a Braarudosphaera-related species was established by the late Cretaceous to cope with extremely low-nutrient conditions and a generalized oligotrophy in marine surface waters, as it has been recognized for other symbiotic system such as the AcanthariaPhaeocystis symbiosis27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  UCYN-A then underwent purifying selection, progressively reducing its genome to the point that it became an obligate symbiont.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An analogous discovery was the case of the two Rhopalodiaceae freshwater diatom species, Rhopalodia gibba and Epithemia turgida having acquired N2-fixing endosymbionts28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the two UCYN-A partnerships described here, phylogenies of these two diatoms species and their intracellular symbionts were found to be congruent and, concordantly, a single symbiotic event has been proposed29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Probably, a similar scenario can be envisioned here for the two UCYN-A partnerships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Time-calibrated cyanobacteria tree.The phylogeny shown was estimated based on 135 proteins from 57 taxa.

phylogenetically dependent, that is, the larger B. bigelowii can harbour a variable number (up to 10) of UCYN-A2 cells, while the small prymnesiophyte partner harboured only one or two UCYN-A1 cells, it is reasonable to think that a larger nutrient acquisition could be linked to a larger number of symbionts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the whole-genome expression patterns suggested that the metabolic investment in UCYN-A1 and UCYN-A2 is mainly focused on the nitrogen fixation machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our evolutionary analysis revealed that UCYN-A1 and UCYN-A2 were genetically adapted to their prymnesiophyte partners before UCYN-A speciation (purifying selection) but, on the contrary, the prymnesiophyte partners seem to follow different ecological strategies9, suggesting a speciation process under positive selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that the partner fidelity shown by UCYN-A lineages together with the speciation in the common ancestor of B. bigelowii and its

symbiotic pairs co-exist without cross-symbiotic partnerships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that its distribution occupies new plankton size fractions accordantly to the host size should be considered in

Remarkably, about a quarter of the UCYN-A transcripts were from nitrogen fixation genes, highlighting the importance of nitrogen fixation in this symbiosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results present further evidences of a host and symbiont co-evolution scenario in the marine environment, probably derived from a single ancestral symbiotic event wherein at least two different lineages diversified in the
