Tau association with synaptic vesicles causes presynaptic dysfunction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Tau is implicated in more than 20 neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimers disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under pathological conditions, Tau dissociates from axonal microtubules and missorts to pre- and postsynaptic terminals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients suffer from early synaptic dysfunction prior to Tau aggregate formation, but the underlying mechanism is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that pathogenic Tau binds to synaptic vesicles via its N-terminal domain and interferes with presynaptic functions, including synaptic vesicle mobility and release rate, lowering neurotransmission in fly and rat neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pathological Tau mutants lacking the vesicle binding domain still localize to the presynaptic compartment but do not impair synaptic function in fly neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, an exogenously applied membrane-permeable peptide that competes for Tau-vesicle binding suppresses Tau-induced synaptic toxicity in rat neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work uncovers a presynaptic role of Tau that may be part of the early pathology in various Tauopathies and could be exploited therapeutically.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Accumulation of abnormal Tau in human brain has been implicated in major neurodegenerative diseases termed Tauopathies, including Alzheimers disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), and Frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonsim-17 (FTDP-17) (reviewed in refs 1, 2, 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More than 40 mutations in the Tau-encoding MAPT locus have been identified as a direct cause for FTDP-17, and slightly higher expression of Tau driven by the Tau H1 haplotype increases risk for AD and PD4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, several groups have shown that loss of Tau prevents A and other excitotoxin-induced neuronal toxicity and cognitive deficits in mouse models of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting that Tau is a direct mediator of neurodegenerative disease7,8,9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Synaptic dysfunction is thought to be an early pathological manifestation in AD and other Tauopathies13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies suggest that soluble Tau, rather than the neurofibrillary tangle-associated aggregated form, is the main toxic element that is able to induce early synaptic deficits preceding synapse and neuronal loss17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, pathogenic mechanisms of non-aggregated Tau in neurons remain enigmatic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Tau is mainly expressed in neurons and is highly concentrated in the axon, where it associates with microtubules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, under disease conditions, Tau detaches from microtubules as abnormal phosphorylation or FTDP-17 pathogenic mutations lower its binding affinity for microtubules3,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pathological Tau has been detected to colocalize with both pre- and post-synaptic markers in the staining of isolated synaptosomes from AD patient brains26,27,28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunohistological analyses of transgenic mouse brains made similar observations, that FTDP-17 pathogenic mutations drive mislocalization of Tau to both presynaptic terminals and dendritic spines30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data together implicate that Tau missorts to both pre- and post- synapses under pathological conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several studies have suggested a pathophysiological role of Tau at dendritic spines in affecting the trafficking of postsynaptic receptors21,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the role for mis-localized Tau at presynaptic terminals remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we show that FTDP-17 mutant Tau mislocalizes to presynaptic terminals in fly neurons, where it binds synaptic vesicles to elicit presynaptic dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The underlying mechanism involves a dual action of Tau in binding synaptic vesicles and simultaneously promoting presynaptic actin polymerization to crosslink vesicles and restrict their mobilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pathogenic Tau thus reduces synaptic transmission during prolonged neuronal activity in fly neurons, and similar defects are observed in rat neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disruption of the interaction between Tau and synaptic vesicles is sufficient to rescue these defects, suggesting that the mode-of-action we identified is a key mechanism for Tau-induced presynaptic pathology.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Pathogenic Tau binds to vesicles at presynaptic terminals', 'Pathological Tau was previously detected at both pre- and post-synaptic compartments in isolated synaptosomes from AD patient brains26,28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied array tomography to determine the localization of pathological Tau in situ in the brain of AD patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultrathin (70 nm) brain sections were prepared and labelled with antibodies against pathological phospho-Tau (AT8) and the presynaptic marker protein Synapsin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data shows that pathological phospho-Tau is present at presynaptic terminals of AD patient brains but is absent from the presynaptic terminals of healthy controls (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data, together with previous studies, argues for the relevance of exploring the role of presynaptic Tau in eliciting synaptic pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given that the mechanisms of presynaptic function are well conserved across species33,34, we resorted to Drosophila larval neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) to study the presynaptic role of Tau.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presynaptic terminals at the NMJ are large, allowing for imaging, and they can be genetically separated from the post-synaptic muscle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We inserted expression constructs of human wild type or FTDP-17 pathogenic mutant Tau (R406W, V337M and P301L, 0N4R isoform) at identical genomic loci in the fly genome, resulting in very similar expression levels (Supplementary Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared Tau expression to previously published lines35,36,37,38 and find our new constructs result in about four times lower expression levels (Supplementary Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the expression level of human Tau in fly brains is in a similar range of the level of Tau in human brain samples (Supplementary Fig 2e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our new lines are thus optimized to express Tau at a low level to recapitulate Tau expression in human brains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We then assessed Tau localization in fly neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In motor neurons, both wild type and pathogenic mutant Tau are localized to axons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, compared to wild type Tau, the pathogenic mutants show increased localization to presynaptic terminals labelled by the synaptic vesicle marker CSP (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increased presynaptic localization of the pathogenic mutant Tau is likely attributed to their lower affinity for binding microtubules, as previously reported3,25 and parallels our observations based on array tomography in human patient brains, where we also observed pathological Tau at presynaptic terminals (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Tau localizes to presynaptic terminals and binds to synaptic vesicles via its N-terminal domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Tau and CSP immunolabeling at neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) of Drosophila larvae expressing WT or FTDP-17 pathogenic mutant Tau (R406W, V337M or P301L) under the D42-Gal4 motor neuron driver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Axons (arrowheads) and synaptic boutons (arrows) are indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 20 m.

however, only mutant Tau is prominently present at presynaptic terminals, allowing it to bind to synaptic vesicles in vivo (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To determine the mode of vesicle binding we generated and purified Tau-deletion proteins and assessed if they could co-immunoprecipitate synaptic vesicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only truncation of the N-terminus (aa1112) of Tau, but not the truncation of any other domain, strongly impedes with the binding of Tau to synaptic vesicles (Fig 1hj).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement, the Tau N-terminal fragment alone co-immunoprecipitates vesicles (Supplementary Fig 3i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the N-terminus of Tau is necessary and sufficient for synaptic vesicle binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Pathogenic Tau restricts synaptic vesicle mobilization', 'Next we asked if vesicle-associated Tau elicits functional defects at presynaptic terminals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recorded the spontaneous miniature excitatory junctional potentials (mEJPs) at fly NMJs and found that Tau-expressing animals do not show differences from control animals in mEJP frequency and mean amplitude (Supplementary Fig 4ad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then stimulated motor neurons and recorded excitatory junctional potentials (EJPs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At low-frequency stimulation (0.2 Hz), the EJP amplitudes measured in controls and mutant Tau-expressing animals are similar (Supplementary Fig 4e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, during sustained high-frequency stimulation (10 Hz), pathogenic Tau mutant-expressing animals fail to maintain normal levels of release (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a defect could reflect slowed synaptic vesicle reformation by endocytosis40,41,42, a reduced number of synaptic vesicles that participate in release, and/or slower vesicle mobilization43,44,45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Pathogenic mutant Tau reduces synaptic transmission and vesicle cycling/release during sustained high-frequency stimulation.Drosophila larvae used in these assays express UAS-Tau (WT, R406W, V337M or P301L) under the D42-Gal4 motor neuron driver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) Electrophysiological recordings of synaptic transmission during 10 Hz stimulation for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plot of evoked junction potential (EJP) amplitudes (a) and representative traces (b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two-way ANOVA, ***P less_than 0.0001, n=7 (Control, WT) or 9 (R406W, V337M, P301L) NMJs (animals).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c,d) FM1-43 dye loading with stimulation at 3 Hz (recycling vesicle pool) or 10 Hz (reserve vesicle pool) for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Representative images of FM1-43 dye loading (c) and plot of FM1-43 dye loading intensity (d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One-way ANOVA, **P=0.0028 (R406W), ***P=0.0001(V337M, P301L), n=14 (WT, R406W, V337M, P301L) or 20 (Control) NMJs (animals).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 10 m.

pathogenic mutations in Tau lower its microtubule binding affinity, it is well-established that hyperphosphorylation of Tau in AD and related Tauopathies is the most common cause for impairments in microtubule binding3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus asked whether hyperphosphorylation of Tau affects synaptic vesicle dynamics in a manner similar to the pathogenic Tau mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used D42-Gal4 to express UAS-TauE14 in which 14 putative phospho-Serine/Threonine sites are mutated to glutamate51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the pathogenic mutants of Tau, we find phospho-mimetic TauE14 to localize to presynaptic boutons of fly NMJs (Supplementary Fig 8a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of this TauE14 at presynaptic terminals does not affect basal neurotransmitter release characteristics (Supplementary Fig 8c,d), but it reduced synaptic transmission during a 10 Hz stimulation train (Supplementary Fig 8e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also similar to our observations with expression of pathogenic mutant Tau, FRAP experiments of synaptotagmin-GFP in animals that express TauE14 indicates a lower synaptic vesicle mobility (Supplementary Fig 8f,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are in line with our model that increased levels of Tau at presynaptic terminals causes synaptic vesicle clustering defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The defects we observe with TauE14 are not because the phosphorylation of Tau affects synaptic vesicle binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the ability of in vitro phosphorylated Tau (by GSK3- and CDK5) to bind synaptic vesicles in co-sedimentation assays is indistinguishable from that of non-phosphorylated Tau (Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether these data suggest that hyperphosphorylated Tau can bind synaptic vesicles and can impair vesicle mobilization in a manner similar to pathogenic mutant Tau.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given that the Drosophila models used in the current study ectopically express mutant Tau under a wild type genetic background, we questioned whether competition between mutant Tau and endogenous Tau could contribute to the detected phenotypes of vesicle mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this question, we analysed tau/ flies to assess the possible effects of endogenous Tau on vesicle mobilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tau knockout flies are viable and fertile, and they do not show defects in basal synaptic transmission at NMJs (Supplementary Fig 10af), nor do they exhibit apparent defects in synaptic transmission during a high frequency (10 Hz) stimulation paradigm (Supplementary Fig 10g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, FRAP experiments at the NMJs did not detect a vesicle mobility phenotype in tau/ flies (Supplementary Fig 10h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, loss-of-function of endogenous Tau does not cause apparent vesicle mobilization phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the impairments of vesicle mobility observed in mutant Tau-expressing animals does not appear to rely on competition with endogenous Tau, and our data support a gain-of-toxic function mechanism of Tau mislocalized to synaptic terminals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Inhibiting Tau-vesicle binding rescues presynaptic deficits', 'To test our model that Tau binds and clusters vesicles through its N-terminal domain, we generated transgenic flies that express N-terminally truncated pathogenic mutant Tau (N_R406W, N_V337M and N_P301L) and assessed vesicle mobility and presynaptic function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These N-terminal truncation mutants all localize to presynaptic boutons (Supplementary Fig 11a,b) and increase presynaptic F-actin levels (Supplementary Fig 11e) to similar extents as their full-length counterparts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, N-pathogenic Tau mutants show a more diffuse localization, distinct from the CSP-labelled doughnut-like synaptic vesicle localization pattern (Supplementary Fig 11a and c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data corroborate the inability of N-Tau to bind vesicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed this observation using the shits1 vesicle depletion assay (see above and Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In stimulated shits1 mutants, CSP relocalizes to the plasma membrane but the N-pathogenic Tau mutants remain diffusely present in the boutons (Supplementary Fig 11d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these data indicate reduced association of N-Tau with synaptic vesicles in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To assess vesicle mobility we used the Synaptotagmin-GFP FRAP assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to synapses expressing full length pathogenic Tau, synapses expressing N-pathogenic Tau mutants show Synaptotagmin-GFP fluorescence recovery rates that are similar to those measured in controls (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, animals expressing N-terminally truncated pathogenic Tau mutants also do not show defects in the rate of synaptic vesicle mobilization and in the size of the active synaptic vesicle pool as assessed by SpH in the presence of bafilomycin (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, expression of N-terminally truncated Tau mutants does not cause defects in maintaining neurotransmitter release during 10 Hz stimulation (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the N-terminal domain of Tau mediates synaptic vesicle mobilization and the presynaptic defects upon expression of pathogenic Tau in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our data also indicate that increased F-actin levels alone are not sufficient to cluster vesicles and that Tau binding to vesicles is needed as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Interfering with Tau

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our work demonstrates that pathogenic mutant Tau alters presynaptic properties, complementing previous findings that expression of mutant Tau affects postsynaptic functions18,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both wild type and pathogenic mutant Tau can bind synaptic vesicles to a similar extent in vitro, but expression of the mutant form leads to increased localization of Tau to presynaptic terminals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to pathogenic mutations, abnormal phosphorylation of Tau in AD also results in the dissociation of Tau from microtubules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At fly NMJs, phospho-mimetic TauE14 behaves similar to pathogenic mutant Tau, as it mislocalizes to presynaptic terminals and impairs vesicle mobilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data also show that pathologically phosphorylated Tau binds to synaptic vesicles in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This again supports the notion that phosphorylation or clinical mutations drive Tau to the synapse where it comes in contact with vesicles, but does not directly affect the binding affinity of Tau to vesicles; this also makes sense in light of the fact that Tau phosphorylation sites (mostly within the proline-rich and C-terminal domains) and sites of disease-causing mutations in Tau (clustering around the microtubule binding domain) do not overlap with the vesicle binding domain (the N-terminal projection) that we identified here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we propose that this mechanism may be common to various Tauopathies associated with abnormal phosphorylation or mutations of Tau.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We propose a model in which when Tau is present presynaptically, it binds to vesicles with its N-terminal domain and polymerizes presynaptic actin using its proline-rich and microtubule-binding domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tau thereby crosslinks synaptic vesicles by binding vesicles and actin, and slows their mobilization, lowering synaptic transmission during intense stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest a multi-step mode of action in which disease conditions lead to the dissociation of Tau from microtubules, followed by an early soluble phase where the protein induces pathological synaptic dysfunction presynaptically as we show here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, recent studies in Tau transgenic Drosophila and mice both detected early synaptic dysfunction preceding pathological aggregation and neurodegeneration23,53, and we propose here that the pathway identified in the current work may underlie early presynaptic dysfunction, triggering a cascade of events ultimately leading to synaptic and neuronal loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We now show that Tau N-terminal-dependent vesicle binding is a key mechanism that induces presynaptic defects in the absence of tangle formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work also suggests that interfering with Tau-N-terminal dependent vesicle-binding could be exploited therapeutically to prevent these aspects of presynaptic pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The discovery of a function for the N-terminal projection dissociates the vesicle binding and actin polymerization role of pathogenic Tau at synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The N-terminal domain of Tau is dispensable for actin polymerization because N-pathogenic Tau mutants localize to presynaptic terminals and still support the formation of excess F-actin at synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results also indicate that Tau-induced actin polymerization at synapses alone is not sufficient to measurably hinder vesicle mobilization; rather, the direct binding of Tau to synaptic vesicles is also needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, Tau also dimerizes and multimerizes ahead of tangle formation and while not studied further here, this activity could potentially also add to the ability of Tau to impede with vesicle mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, a similar pathogenic function, the direct cross-linking of vesicles by multimerization, has been suggested for -synuclein54,55, a protein that aggregates in Lewy body disease and Parkinsons disease, suggesting that Tau and -synuclein may harbour overlapping effects on presynaptic function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our findings suggest that Tau employs a similar mode of vesicle immobilization as Synapsins, which also bind vesicles and F-actin to keep vesicles in a reserve pool50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this function, we observed a defect to maintain normal levels of neurotransmitter release in fly and rat neurons expressing pathogenic Tau.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This neurotransmitter release defect is similar to that seen upon overexpression of Synapsin, as in different model synapses, expression of Synapsin has been shown to result in a decline of neurotransmission in response to strong stimulation trains56,57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are previous studies showing reduced amplitudes of mEPSCs in primary neurons expressing mutant Tau at DIV 2230 (refs 21, 58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, at much earlier time points (DIV 1113), we did not detect such a change in mEPSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discrepancy is likely due to the postsynaptic accumulation of mutant Tau in older neuronal cultures, in which dendritic spines are more mature and relatively stable59,60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, the dendritic protrusions in younger neurons are rather transient and highly dynamic59,60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus we surmise our electrophysiological recordings at DIV 1113 mainly reflect the effects of Tau on presynaptic vesicle release, where we did not detect a deficit at basal level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are also electrophysiological studies performed in Tauopathy mouse models, but mostly at a stage where substantial synapse and neuron loss had already occurred and these studies also often focused on the post-synaptic role of Tau18,61,62,63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our observations that expression of Tau lowers neurotransmitter release efficiency, more recent studies in mice overexpressing Tau_P301L indicated early stage defects and show a loss of synaptic input before synapse loss in intact neocortical pyramidal cells as well as alterations in the probability of neurotransmitter release in entorhinal cortex19,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While a connection between vesicle mobilization defects and neuronal death awaits further investigation, it is conceivable that a defect to maintain normal release contributes to the early synaptic defects seen in neurodegenerative disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strength of the defects we observed are also subtle enough to explain the occurrence of disease symptoms only later in life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, in humans, long lasting high-frequency activity has been observed during cognitive tasks64,65,66, suggesting that Tau-induced vesicle mobilization defects and the inability to maintain normal levels of neurotransmitter release could potentially contribute to cognitive decline in dementia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A number of recent studies show that Tau N-terminal fragments, including a 17-kDa (Tau44230) fragment and a 35-kDa (Tau1391) fragment, are elevated in the brains of Tauopathy patients58,67.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two fragments are generated by Calpain and Caspase-2 cleavage of Tau, and they are shown to be neurotoxic in cellular and animal models58,67.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 35-kDa fragment acts similar to soluble pathogenic Tau, as it binds less efficiently to microtubules and missorts to dendritic spines to impair synaptic function58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains to be assessed, but it is likely, that the 35-kDa fragment also missorts to presynaptic terminals, where it can bind to synaptic vesicles and simultaneously promote actin polymerization, as it contains the required domains for both vesicle- and actin-binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether the 17-kDa fragment causes synaptic toxicity remains unknown, but it has been shown to inhibit aggregation of full-length Tau67.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus the presence of the 17-kDa fragment may potentially lead to an increase of soluble Tau under disease conditions, and subsequently more Tau missorting to the synapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work shows that increased soluble Tau at presynaptic terminals impairs vesicle dynamics, which could be a possible mechanism that contributes to the toxicity of these N-terminal fragments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work should assess these possibilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our work indicates that targeting the N-terminal domain of Tau is sufficient to alleviate the presynaptic defects induced by the expression of pathogenic Tau.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, expression of mutant Tau proteins lacking the N-terminal projection does not elicit presynaptic defects anymore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore reasoned that tools that compete with Tau for vesicle binding would be beneficial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treating rat neurons that express Tau_P301L with a membrane permeable N-terminal Tau domain (Tat-NTTau peptide), shown to compete for synaptic vesicle binding, rescues the pathological Tau-induced inability to maintain neurotransmitter release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work provides proof-of principle that it is possible to target the ability of Tau to interact with vesicles to rescue presynaptic defects elicited by the excessive presynaptic localization of pathogenic Tau.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings also pave the way for the development of more specific tools with higher affinity and specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In relation to this, while short-term exposure to the current N-terminal peptide itself did not elicit obvious neuronal toxicity, it will also be essential to assess if longer exposure of tools that inhibit Tau vesicle binding affect aspects of presynaptic or other neuronal function for their therapeutic potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, our work reveals a new aspect of Tau biology and suggests there is a window to tackle the presynaptic defects induced by pathological Tau.'
