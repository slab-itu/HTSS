High resolution analysis of tropical forest fragmentation and its impact on the global carbon cycle  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Deforestation in the tropics is not only responsible for direct carbon emissions but also extends the forest edge wherein trees suffer increased mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we combine high-resolution (30 m) satellite maps of forest cover with estimates of the edge effect and show that 19% of the remaining area of tropical forests lies within 100 m of a forest edge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tropics house around 50 million forest fragments and the length of the worlds tropical forest edges sums to nearly 50 million km.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Edge effects in tropical forests have caused an additional 10.3 Gt (2.114.4 Gt) of carbon emissions, which translates into 0.34 Gt per year and represents 31% of the currently estimated annual carbon releases due to tropical deforestation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fragmentation substantially augments carbon emissions from tropical forests and must be taken into account when analysing the role of vegetation in the global carbon cycle.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Tropical forests are the largest terrestrial component of the global carbon budget1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They account for 50% of the carbon stored in the global vegetation (350600 Gt C)3,4,5, rivalling the amount of carbon in the atmosphere (750 Gt C)6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carbon losses from tropical forests due to forest loss and degradation are currently estimated to be 1.1 Gt C per year7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, quantification of carbon fluxes of tropical forests suffer uncertainties in the measurement of stored biomass10,11 and rates of forest loss12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, deforestation alters the structure of the remaining foresta process referred to as fragmentation13,14,15,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Increased wind speed, vapour pressure deficit and disturbance pressure in the vicinity of forest edges increase tree mortality15, resulting in persistent carbon emissions long after deforestation occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fire, wind and desiccation can penetrate up to kilometres into the forest15,19,20, altering microclimate within 100300 m of the forest edge13,21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Field studies have estimated relative carbon losses in forest edges (e) averaging 11% (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24) and up to 36% (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22) and 50% (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25) of aboveground biomass within the 100 m edge zone, and modelling studies have shown biomass reductions of up to 70% in small fragments26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although regional estimates of fragmentation state and carbon losses have been obtained by combining local findings and modelling results27, a comprehensive pan-tropical analysis using high-resolution maps is missing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent pan-tropical analysis based on coarse-resolution data (500 m) found reductions of biomass extending 1.5 km from the forest edge20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another analysis estimated the distance from all forests to forest edge using remote sensing data18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we analysed the extent of tropical forest fragmentation and its effects on the global carbon balance of the terrestrial biosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We quantified the total number of forest fragments and the area of their edges across the tropics using a global, high-resolution (30 m) tree-cover data set from the year 2000 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated biomass loss in the edge area based on a biomass reduction factor and biomass values of the forest core areas that we extracted from a published aboveground biomass map29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then we overlaid the high-resolution forest edge analysis with this biomass loss assumption to incorporate the edge effect into the global carbon balance of tropical forests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that fragmentation substantially increases carbon emissions from tropical forests by 31% (of the currently estimated annual carbon losses due to tropical deforestation) and is hence relevant for the global carbon cycle.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Analysis of tropical forest fragmentation', 'The tropics house  greater than 50 million forest fragments with a mean fragment area of 29 ha and total area  greater than 1.5 billion ha (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sizefrequency distributions of forest fragments are similar across continents (see Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The length of the worlds tropical forest edges sums to nearly 50 million km, and a total of 295 million ha (19%) of tropical forest area is  less_than 100 m from the forest edge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on the complexity of each fragments shape, the proportion of a fragments edge area decreases with increasing fragment size (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In tropical America and Asia, the fraction of edge area lies between 16% and 18% of total forest area and is much lower than in Africa (26%) (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Forest fragmentation across tropical regions.Full size table', 'Figure 1: Fragment size distribution for tropical forest.Distribution of total forested area, core area (green) and edge area (blue;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'This estimated carbon losses due to tropical forest fragmentation (0.34 Gt C per year) equals 31% of the direct carbon emissions due to land-use changes in tropical forest regions7 globally (1.1 Gt C per year) and 8.5% of the overall annual atmospheric carbon gain5 (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas many studies have concluded the intact tropical biome are carbon sinks4,33, if land-use change is considered tropical forests are a carbon source8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results corroborate the latter and indicate that additional carbon emissions from tropical forest fragmentation increase overall carbon emissions to the atmosphere to be higher values than previously assumed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The estimated absolute carbon losses due to tropical fragmentation (10.3 Gt C) are higher than estimated values in a previous study (6.7 Gt C, Pütz et al.27) and are within the same order as another recent study based on coarser-resolution maps (9.4 Gt C, 500 m resolution, Chaplin-Kramer et al.20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study by Pütz et al.27 have calculated lower carbon losses compared to this study, as they did a detailed analysis only for South America.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the fragment counting and forest edge area is different for the continents (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As fragmentation effects occur on small spatial scales ( less_than 100 m), our study benefits from the high (30 m) resolution of the satellite-based tree-cover map, which avoided mixing of forest edges with unaffected forests and other land-cover types within pixels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Annual carbon emissions from tropical forests.Annual carbon emissions from tropical deforestation2 (grey bars) and additional emissions from tropical forest edges due to fragmentation from this study (orange bars).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentages represent the fraction of tropical fragmentation carbon emissions and tropical deforestation carbon emissions.Full size image', 'Our assumption for the distance of edge-depth penetration (d=100 m) and the resulting estimates of carbon loss are conservative; other studies have shown reductions of biomass extending up to 1.5 km from the forest edge20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the effect of the parameter for biomass reduction within the edge area, we investigated the range of lower (e=10%) to higher values (e=70%) and in our standard assumption e=50% (refs 20, 25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incorporating the shape and edge-length of forest fragments from satellite-based maps overcomes the potential limitation imposed by incorporating only estimates of area and simplified shapes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the assumption of the rate of edge creation over time depends on harvesting strategies12 and history34, so conclusions are challenging with the current state of knowledge and open up further questions in the field of dynamic landscape development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analyses show that forest fragmentation augments carbon emissions beyond those caused by deforestation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we expect that our study bases on conservative assumptions, they are already substantial enough to highlight the importance of forest fragmentation in the global carbon balance.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Methods summary', 'Our analysis is based on the GLCF (Global Land Cover Facility) tree-cover data set, a global, 30 m resolution map of fractional tree-canopy cover in the year 2000 (ref.

patches were calculated from fragment size and perimeter36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carbon losses were estimated based on a range of biomass-reduction factors and carbon densities of tropical forest from a global aboveground biomass map29 by calculating a mean aboveground biomass for each fragment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was thereby assumed, conservatively, that no root or soil carbon contributes to the emissions from the edge areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To account for uncertainties in the parameters, scenarios of edge depth and the fraction of carbon loss in edge areas were compared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The influence of the choice of underlying tree-cover data was assessed by comparing results between the GLCF global tree-cover map28 (30 m resolution), the Hansen global map of forest cover change31 (30 m resolution) and the GlobCover land cover map32 (300 m resolution) (Table 1, Supplementary Tables 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also compared results based on different biomass maps, including the biomass map by Saatchi et al.29 (1,000 m), the biomass map by Baccini et al.2 (500 m), the biomass map by Avitabile et al.37 (1,000 m) and mean values from the global biomass data set compiled from
