Shifting the optimal stiffness for cell migration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cell migration, which is central to many biological processes including wound healing and cancer progression, is sensitive to environmental stiffness, and many cell types exhibit a stiffness optimum, at which migration is maximal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present a cell migration simulator that predicts a stiffness optimum that can be shifted by altering the number of active molecular motors and clutches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This prediction is verified experimentally by comparing cell traction and F-actin retrograde flow for two cell types with differing amounts of active motors and clutches: embryonic chick forebrain neurons (ECFNs; optimum 1 kPa) and U251 glioma cells (optimum 100 kPa).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the model predicts, and experiments confirm, that the stiffness optimum of U251 glioma cell migration, morphology and F-actin retrograde flow rate can be shifted to lower stiffness by simultaneous drug inhibition of myosin II motors and integrin-mediated adhesions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Several models have been proposed to describe optimality in cell migration, beginning with the adhesion strength model of cell migration of DiMilla et al.1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model provided a theoretical framework for understanding the experimental observation that cells migrate fastest at intermediate adhesion strength2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it did not consider migration in compliant environments that is presumably the norm for migration in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, cell migration in vitro is highly sensitive to the mechanical stiffness of the environment, but the theoretical basis for these effects remains to be established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the observation of stiffness-sensitive cell migration by Lo et al.3, other cell migration models have provided some basis for stiffness sensitive cell migration by incorporating stiffness-dependent functions for force transmission4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, such approaches introduce stiffness dependence as an assumption a priori, as opposed to having it naturally emerge as an output of the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we currently lack a theoretical explanation for how cell migration depends on the mechanochemical environment and how cells determine the optimal stiffness of their environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We and others have previously presented a model of cellular force transmission based on the motorclutch hypothesis6 that naturally predicts biphasic stiffness dependence as an outcome of the model7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this model, intracellular molecular motors, such as myosin II, transmit force to the external environment through rigid actin filament bundles and compliant transmembrane molecular clutches, such as integrins (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the motorclutch-based modelling was used to study the effect of substrate stress relaxation on cell spreading, collective cell durotaxis and ex vivo cell migration as a function of adhesion molecule expression10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our messenger RNA (mRNA) analysis of U251 human glioma cells has identified the most likely candidates for components of the motorclutch model based on a previously published list13 of cell migration genes (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously performed a detailed sensitivity analysis on this model and determined that dual parameter changes were needed to account for the broad range of stiffness optima seen experimentally14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, coordinately increasing the expression of molecular motors and clutches shifted the stiffness optimum for maximal force transmission to higher stiffness14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our previous study only modelled a single F-actin-based protrusion, and therefore it is not clear whether the optimum shifting predicted by the motorclutch model would occur in a simulation of an entire cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the motorclutch model does not directly predict cellular level features, including cell area, shape and migration, the last being functionally important in nervous system development, immune response and cancer progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Cell

found in Supplementary Table 3.Full size image', 'To address these issues, we developed a stochastic whole cell migration simulator built from the motorclutch model to simulate cell migration in compliant microenvironments while enforcing force and mass balances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model predicts a stiffness optimum that can be shifted by altering the number of active molecular motors and clutches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then experimentally tested the model predictions under conditions of varying mechanical stiffness and coordinate shifts in the activity of motors and clutches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results confirmed the model predictions and illustrated the ability to shift the optimal stiffness by altering the number of motors and clutches.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cell migration simulator', 'While the motorclutch model set a foundation for migration sensitivity to stiffness, it did not describe the direct link between force transmission sensitivity and cell migration sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate this link, we developed a cell migration simulator based on our earlier motorclutch model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this simulator, we linked together multiple motorclutch systems, termed modules, such that the modules each exert a force on a central cell body (Fig 1a,b, see cell migration simulator parameters values in Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting cell migration arises due to a force balance among the motorclutch modules and the cell body as motors build load and clutch bonds to the substrate break stochastically, thus releasing load.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our previous theoretical analysis of a single motorclutch predicted that the optimal stiffness can be readily shifted by coordinately changing the numbers of motors and clutches14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether simulated cells exhibit an optimal stiffness for cell migration, and whether such a shift in the optimal stiffness occurs in our whole cell migration simulator, we simulated cell migration at high and low motor and clutch numbers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell migration simulator predicted a stiffness optimum for F-actin retrograde flow rate that was shifted by altering the numbers of motors and clutches (Fig 1c), consistent with the results for the simpler motorclutch model that only modelled one protrusion14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulator also predicted a stiffness optimum for cell traction force that was reduced by altering the numbers of motors and clutches (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the maximum of the simulated cell aspect ratio did not show an obvious shift when changing the number of motors and clutches (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the cell migration simulations exhibited a stiffness optimum that was shifted to a higher stiffness by increasing the numbers of motors and clutches (Fig 1f)again consistent with our previous motorclutch analysis14 (simulation movies depicting cell shape and migration are provided for 0.1, 10 and 1,000 pN nm1 substrates for low number of motors and clutches; Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A composite metric was created to mathematically combine all four metrics that also shows an increase in the stiffness optimum caused by coordinately increasing the number of motors and clutches in the cell migration simulator (Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'U251 glioma cell migration and morphology', 'To experimentally test the predictions of the cell migration simulator, U251 glioma cells were cultured on polyacrylamide hydrogel (PAG) substrates of varying Youngs modulus and surface-immobilized collagen type I (formulations in Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our cell migration simulator, cell migration rate and morphology are predicted to be substrate stiffness sensitive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in the representative images in Fig 2a, cell morphology depended on the substrate stiffness, such that on a 4.6 kPa gels the cells were small and round, while on a 100 kPa gel they were larger and more elongated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: U251 glioma cell migration and morphology have maxima with respect to substrate Youngs modulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Representative images of U251 glioma cells on 4.6, 100 and 200 kPa Youngs moduli polyacrylamide gels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Wind-rose plots of cell trajectories on 4.6, 100 and 200 kPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten randomly selected cell trajectories over 10 h are shown for each condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Cell random motility coefficient has a maximum between 20 and 200 kPa (P=0.04).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Projected cell area has a potential maximum at 200 kPa or higher.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Cell aspect ratio has a potential maximum at 9 kPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All error bars are s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of observations for each experiment can be found in Supplementary Table 3.Full size image', 'To quantify cell migration and morphology, an image segmentation algorithm was used to estimate cell position, spread area and aspect ratio (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2b shows representative wind-rose plots of cell trajectories on 4.6, 100 and 200 kPa, demonstrating the difference in cell migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each plot shows the trajectories of 10 randomly selected cells over 10 h. Qualitatively, the cells on 100 kPa migrate further in 10 h than the cells on either 4.6 or 200 kPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell positions were used to calculate the mean squared displacement for each cell over time intervals ranging from 15 min to 5 h (Supplementary Fig 2e) to estimate cell random motility coefficients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over a stiffness range of 50 Pa to 200 kPa, the mean cell random motility coefficient had a maximum at 100 kPa (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, mean cell area increased with increasing stiffness, although it did not exhibit a clear maximum (Fig 2d), a feature that we revisit later in the drug treatment studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to migration rate, the cell aspect ratio exhibited a maximum of 20100 kPa (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample movies of U251 glioma cells on 4.6, 100 and 200 kPa are presented in Supplementary Movie 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, mRNA expression was quantified for the cells on different stiffnesses to show that the migration differences were not the effect of changes in genes expression on the different stiffnesses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Few cell migration genes showed any significant expression difference among the stiffnesses, and nearly all the expression differences were found between plastic and the PAGs, rather than among the PAGs (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'F-actin retrograde flow and traction strain energy', 'Previous experimental measurements of embryonic chick forebrain neuron (ECFN) behaviour suggests that they have minimal actin flow and maximal traction strain energy on a stiffness of 1 kPa7,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because ECFNs have a lower optimum stiffness than the U251 glioma cells (1 kPa for ECFNs versus 100 kPa for U251 glioma cells), then, based on the cell migration simulator predictions (Fig 1c), this suggests the possibility that ECFNs have fewer motors and clutches than U251 glioma cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To experimentally test this prediction, we measured F-actin retrograde flow in EGFP-actin U251 glioma cells cultured on varying stiffness substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the cell migration simulator, we expect a shift up in retrograde flow minimum in U251 cells compared with ECFNs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of EGFP-actin has previously been shown not to affect F-actin retrograde flow rate in neurons, a finding that we now also confirm for U251 glioma cells in Supplementary Fig 4ac.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3a shows a representative fluorescent image of an EGFP-actin U251 cell, and Fig 3b shows a representative kymograph of actin flow at the edge of a U251 glioma cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the cell migration simulator (Fig 1c), the increase in optimal stiffness from 1 kPa for neurons to 100 kPa for glioma cells should correspond to an 100-fold increase in the minimum in F-actin retrograde flow rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3c, the actin flow for U251 cells has a minimum between 20 and 100 kPa that occurs at the Youngs modulus approximately two orders of magnitude greater than the minimum for ECFNs as predicted for 100-fold increase in the number of motors and clutches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Actin retrograde flow and traction strain energy of U251 glioma cells versus ECFNs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Representative fluorescent image of an EGFP-actin U251 glioma cell on a 100 kPa polyacrylamide gel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The boxed region represents an area selected for an actin flow kymograph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Actin flow kymograph for a U251 glioma cell on a 100 kPa polyacrylamide gel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Horizontal bar is 2 m.

Supplementary Table 3.Full size image', 'If the higher optimal stiffness for glioma cells versus neurons is due to an 100-fold increase in the numbers of motor and clutches, then the cell migration simulator predicts that cell traction forces should be two orders of magnitude larger for U251 cells than for ECFNs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, sensitivity analysis of the motorclutch showed that the optimal stiffness can be increased by orders of magnitude via a coordinate increase in the on and off rate constants for the clutches14 that would predict no change in traction force between U251 cells and ECFNs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using Fourier transform traction cytometry16, we estimated traction strain energy for both cell types on the same stiffness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3d, the U251 glioma cells clearly transmit more force, and when plotted on the same scale, the traction vectors for ECFNs are barely detectable compared with those for U251 glioma cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the prediction of increased motors and clutches, and inconsistent with the prediction of increased onoff clutch kinetics, the mean U251 glioma cell traction strain energy on 700 Pa modulus gels is 400 times greater than the mean ECFN traction strain energy (Fig 3e; measurements validated against measurement noise in Supplementary Fig 4d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The greater force transmission for U251 glioma cells suggests that they express at least two orders of magnitude more motors and clutches than the ECFNs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously shown that clutches must approximately balance motors to maintain stiffness sensitivity14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, since actin flow is stiffness sensitive for both cell types, the expression of clutches also likely differs by at least two orders of magnitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, if the numbers of motors and clutches is increasing, then the cell migration simulator predicts an optimal stiffness for maximal force transmission that will be shifted to higher stiffness for glioma cells than neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As predicted for increased motors and clutches, the mean traction strain energy for U251 glioma cells has a maximum of 10 kPa, an order of magnitude higher than the potential maximum of ECFN strain energy that is 1 kPa (Fig 3f; technical details for high stiffness measurements described in Supplementary Fig 4e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, the experimental measurements of F-actin retrograde flow rate and cell traction force support a motorclutch-based model where U251 glioma cells express 100-fold greater motors and clutches than ECFNs, and argue against a model where clutch onoff kinetics are altered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, we conclude that the large difference in stiffness optima between glioma cells and neurons is mainly due to glioma cells expressing 100-fold greater numbers of motors and clutches than neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Simultaneous inhibition of motors and clutches', 'As shown in Fig 1g, the cell migration simulator predicts a decrease in the optimal stiffness upon coordinate decrease in both motors and clutches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further test experimentally the prediction that coordinate changes in the numbers of active motors and clutches shift the optimum stiffness for a cell, we partially inhibited myosin II motors via blebbistatin and partially inhibited integrin-mediated adhesions to the collagen-coated substrate via cyclo(RGDfV) competitive binding using the U251 glioma cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As predicted by the cell migration simulator, the combined drug treatment shifted the minimum of actin flow to around 4.6 kPa (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This occurred due to a decrease in the actin flow rate on 4.6 kPa, but the actin flow rate on 100 kPa was not significantly affected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum in traction stain energy did not shift out of the control range due to the combined treatment, but the traction strain energy was reduced as shown in Fig 4b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On 4.6 kPa, each drug individually decreased the traction strain energy by about an order of magnitude, but the combined drug treatment actually increased the traction strain energy compared with the single drug cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the addition of a traction-inhibiting drug can actually increase the traction strain energy in the presence of the other traction-inhibiting drug, an effect predicted by the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On 9.3 kPa, the traction strain energy was reduced by about an order of magnitude in each single drug case and the combined treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Simultaneous inhibition of motors and clutches shifts the optimum stiffness to lower Youngs modulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Addition of both drugs shifted the minimum actin flow rate to 4.6 kPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cylco(RGDfV) alone increased actin flow on both 4.6 and 100 kPa, while blebbistatin alone reduced actin flow on 4.6 kPa but not significantly on 100 kPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combined drug treatment reduced actin flow on 4.6 kPa but did not significantly affect actin flow on 100 kPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Addition of both drugs decreased traction strain energy by approximately fourfold on all stiffnesses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum traction strain energy maintained its maximum at 9 kPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the combined drug treatment increased the traction strain energy compared with either individual drug treatment on 4.6 kPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Addition of both drugs caused the maximum area to be 9 kPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On 4.6 kPa, the addition of both drugs increased the cell area, while on 100 kPa they decreased the cell area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Addition of both drugs did not shift the maximum aspect ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On 4.6 kPa, blebbistatin individually and both drugs combined increase the aspect ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the drugged cases had a significant effect on the aspect ratio on 100 kPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Simultaneous addition of 6 M blebbistatin and 0.6 M cyclo(RGDfV) shifts the potential maximum U251 glioma cell random motility coefficient to 4.6 kPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On 4.6 kPa, addition of both drugs increases the random motility coefficient compared with the no drug, blebbistatin and cylco(RGDfV) cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On

an optimum for cell area at 10 kPa, implying that untreated cells optimum is 200 kPa or higher (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combined treatment had opposite effects on 4.6 kPa where it increased cell area and on 100 kPa where it decreased cell area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, combined drug treatment did not shift the optimum for cell aspect ratio (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On 4.6 kPa, this

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Here we confirmed a mechanism by which cells are able to determine the optimal stiffness of their environment that was predicted by the cell migration simulator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the cell migration simulator presented in this work provided accurate and unexpected, quantitatively accurate predictions that were validated experimentally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values for random motility coefficient, cell aspect ratio and actin flow rate differed at most by 25% from the experimental values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This accuracy for each of the three separate metrics of cell behaviour is especially remarkable given that many of the parameter values were order of magnitude estimates taken from broad experimental ranges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell migration simulator could also be used in the future to simulate a variety of cell migration behaviours in heterogeneous environments including durotaxis3 and confined migration17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the current version of the simulator acts in two spatial dimensions, it can be extended to three spatial dimensions by allowing modules to extend along a third coordinate and solving a force balance in the third dimension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps most importantly, the cell migration simulator could be used as an in silico diagnostic and treatment tool for diseases such as glioblastoma for which aberrant cell migration is a major contributor to poor prognoses18 (Fig 4g).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
