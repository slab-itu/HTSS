The influence of large cations on the electrochemical properties of tunnel-structured metal oxides  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Metal oxides with a tunnelled structure are attractive as charge storage materials for rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors, since the tunnels enable fast reversible insertion/extraction of charge carriers (for example, lithium ions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Common synthesis methods can introduce large cations such as potassium, barium and ammonium ions into the tunnels, but how these cations affect charge storage performance is not fully understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report the role of tunnel cations in governing the electrochemical properties of electrode materials by focusing on potassium ions in -MnO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the presence of cations inside 2 × 2 tunnels of manganese dioxide increases the electronic conductivity, and improves lithium ion diffusivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, transmission electron microscopy analysis indicates that the tunnels remain intact whether cations are present in the tunnels or not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our systematic study shows that cation addition to -MnO2 has a strong beneficial effect on the electrochemical performance of this material.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Metal oxides with an internal tunnel structure such as -MnO2, TiO2 and -FeOOH are widely used for charge storage in rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors where charge carriers such as Li+, Na+ and Mg2+ can be reversibly inserted and extracted1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these oxides, -MnO2, which possesses the typical octahedral molecular sieve structure, is characterized by well-ordered one-dimensional 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 tunnels5, as illustrated in Supplementary Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2 × 2 tunnel (4.6 × 4.6 Å) is large enough to accommodate charge carriers such as Li+, Na+ and Mg2+, enabling fast ion diffusion inside the tunnel cavity6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Mn-based oxides are low cost, environmentally friendly and safer with respect to over-charge conditions compared with Co-based oxide electrodes7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, -MnO2 has been extensively studied as a promising cathode material for lithium (sodium and magnesium) ion batteries8,9,10,11, lithium air batteries12,13 and supercapacitors14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recent research shows that large cations such as K+, Ba2+ and NH4+ can be introduced during synthesis of -MnO2 (refs 17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cations, which partially occupy the tunnel cavities at certain stabilized lattice sites, are expected to interact with the charge carrier (Li+, Na+ and Mg2+) and thus affect the charge storage performance of -MnO2 where tunnel-driven (de)intercalation contributes to the overall capacity16,18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite considerable research devoted to improving the charge storage performance of -MnO2, the underlying mechanism by which tunnel cations affect the insertion/extraction of charge carriers is poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the case of Li+ being the charge carrier, many researchers believe that the presence of large cations (K+, Ba2+) inside the 2 × 2 tunnels impedes the diffusion of Li+ by physical blocking and repulsive electrostatic forces18,21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Others have pointed out that fast (de)intercalation of Li+ requires a stable tunnel structure, and the existence of cations helps to prevent the collapse of the tunnels24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As yet, no conclusive evidence has been provided to clarify whether the tunnel cations promote or impede rapid migration of Li ions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important factor that contributes to this ambiguity is the difficulty of visualizing these cations and determining their content and position, given the spatial resolution limits of most non-aberration-corrected electron microscopes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is apparent that there is a pressing need to understand the effect of tunnel cations on charge storage behaviour of materials such as -MnO2 to allow the synthesis methods and properties of such tunnel-structured oxides to be optimized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this report, nanowires of K+-doped -MnO2 are hydrothermally synthesized and the K+ concentration is controlled and differentiated by acid solution treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of varying K+ concentration on the rate performance of a Li/-MnO2 battery is studied systematically by measuring the electronic conductivity and Li+ diffusivity in the -MnO2 cathode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The underlying mechanism is revealed using a powerful combination of aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (ACSTEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electrical response measurements of single -MnO2 nanowires, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and density functional theory (DFT) simulations.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Structural characterization of -KxMnO2', 'Hydrothermally synthesized -MnO2 nanowires were characterized using ACSTEM, and the results are shown in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be seen from Fig 1a,b that the -MnO2 nanowire is monocrystalline, growing in the 001 direction with a uniform diameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 100 atomic resolution high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) image in Fig 1c shows the 2 × 2 tunnels (dark stripes) surrounded by two Mn atomic columns (yellow spheres) corresponding to the tunnel walls on each side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can also be seen that the 2 × 2 tunnels are decorated with ordered K atomic columns (pink spheres) around their centre positions, based on which the 100 atomic model is provided in Fig 1d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  K+ ions are successfully introduced during synthesis because excess K+ are present in solution to support the 2 × 2 tunnels during their initial formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The down-tunnel image of one -MnO2 nanowire (Fig 1e) shows that the nanowire has a square shaped cross-section with four {100} lateral surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding crystal structure is shown in Fig 1f, in which 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 tunnels are clearly observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 × 1 tunnels are essentially empty while each 2 × 2 tunnel is found to contain one atomic column, in good agreement with the lateral HAADF image in Fig 1c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) along the 110 direction shown in Fig 1f confirmed the tunnel walls to be Mn and the central atoms inside the 2 × 2 tunnels to be K+ (Wyckoff 2a positions), from which the atomic model shown in the bottom inset of Fig 1f was constructed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these observations, the K+ concentration in as-synthesized -MnO2 was determined to be K0.25MnO2.

EDS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The XRD results are shown in Fig 2 with the refined lattice parameters and compositions shown in Supplementary Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be seen that the -MnO2 phase is well maintained during the acid treatment as no extra peak generation or elimination is observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, with the increase of treatment time, all the peaks gradually shift toward higher angles, and this trend is more clearly demonstrated by the inset image showing the (200)-MnO2 peak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Rietveld refinement in the table quantifies the trend of tunnel contraction during acid treatment by deriving lattice parameters a, b and c, where the anisotropic tunnel expansion (mainly along ab plane) is indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The estimated K+ concentration further confirms that the tunnel contraction is essentially determined by the gradual removal of K+ from the tunnels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: XRD patterns of the three groups of nanowires after acid treatment over different timescales.The inset image is the enlarged view of the -MnO2 (200) peak, where the gradual peak shift toward higher angle direction with increase of treatment time is observed.Full size image', 'The atomic imaging of the tunnels with different K+ concentrations in Fig 3 reveals that HNO3 treatment was effective in removing K+ from the 2 × 2 tunnels, and the K+ concentration can be controlled by altering the treatment time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 1-day treatment, K+ has been partially removed from the nanowire, and the 2 × 2 tunnels are thus only partially filled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 4-day treatment, -MnO2 is essentially free of any K+ ions, as confirmed by both the HAADF image showing no K+ contrast (Fig 3c) and the lack of any K+ signal in the EDS spectra shown in the inset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The compositions of -MnO2 nanowires without treatment and after 1- and 4-day acid treatment were thus deduced to be K0.25MnO2, K0.25xMnO2 and undoped MnO2, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also notable that the 2 × 2 tunnels slightly contract after K+ removal, as indicated by the {020} spacing changing from 4.97 Å for the untreated nanowire to 4.84 Å for the 4-day treated nanowire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This tunnel contraction trend is clearly illustrated in Fig 3df.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the tunnel experiences significant volume change, the overall tunnelled structure of -MnO2 is still maintained after K+ removal, enabling all these three types of nanowires to function as an intercalation cathode in a lithium ion battery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

atomic STEM imaging in determining the K+ concentration and lattice constants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is understandable considering that STEM focuses on local atomic structure of a single nanowire, while XRD provides average bulk information including the surface lattice and structural defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our case, since the composition of the nanowires without HNO3 treatment is determined by counting the Mn and K atoms in the STEM image, which is mathematically more accurate than XRD, we have identified these nanowires as K0.25MnO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that all 2a sites inside the 2 × 2 tunnels are occupied by K+ (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The composition for 4-day treated nanowires is determined to be nominally MnO2 because both atomic STEM/EDS and Rietveld refinement hardly show any signal for K+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For 1-day treated nanowires, we express the composition using K(0.25x)MnO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous studies suggest that the removal of K+ from 2 × 2 tunnels in acid solutions is explained by either the K+H+ exchange mechanism27,28, Mn oxidation mechanism23,29 or the existence of both30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The critical difference between them is whether the Mn valence is increased or not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, the dominant mechanism is found to be Mn oxidation to Mn4+ rather than K+H+ exchange.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detailed analyses of Mn valence change using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are provided in Supplementary Figs 2 and 3, respectively, and the discussions are given in Supplementary Note 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both EELS and XPS confirm the existence of Mn3+ in the nanowires before acid treatment (K0.25MnO2), while a portion of Mn3+ gradually decreases with increase of treatment time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average Mn valence gradually increases to Mn4+ as a result of K+ removal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structural techniques of Raman, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) (Supplementary Fig 4 and related discussions in Supplementary Note 2) are also provided to explore the chemical composition evolution during acid treatment, where the possibility of H+ presence in the tunnels is found to be negligible, which again supports the postulate that K+H+ exchange is not the dominant mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Before the electrochemistry analysis, the surfaces and thermal stability of the nanowires were characterized to check whether the nanowires are affected by the acid treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET) analysis given in Supplementary Table 2 (detailed discussions in Supplementary Note 5) and SEM images in Supplementary Fig 5 show no significant change in the surfaces of nanowires.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and in situ TEM heating techniques are used to test the thermal stability of the nanowires after K+ removal from the tunnels, and the results and detailed analysis are shown in Supplementary Figs 6 and 7, respectively, while the discussions are given in Supplementary Note 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results confirm that the nanowires after K+ removal from the tunnels are thermally stable without any phase transition or tunnel collapse up to 350 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Effect of K+ on electronic and ionic conductivities', 'Our previous simulation work17 suggest that 2 × 2 tunnels are the preferred Li+ transport channels in pure -MnO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have also reported previously that Li+ ions thermodynamically occupy the off-centred Wyckoff 8 h site inside each 2 × 2 tunnel rather than the tunnel centre8,17, which is also demonstrated by other groups31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, with K+ on the centred 2a sites and the tunnel expanded by K+, it is reasonable to expect the K+ concentration inside the 2 × 2 tunnels to affect both electronic and ionic transport and hence the electrochemical behaviour of an -MnO2 cathode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine these effects, the electronic conductivity and Li+ diffusivity of -MnO2 nanowires with different K+ concentrations were characterized using in situ TEM and EIS methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The electronic structure was also examined by DFT simulations and also by direct electrical probing within the microscope, the results of which are given in Fig 4a,b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This computational work complements and extends previous DFT studies8,16 on interstitial cation incorporation in -MnO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulated density of states (shown in Fig 4a) indicates that pure -MnO2 has a bandgap of 2.8 eV suggesting semiconductor behaviour, and agrees well with the reported value of Young et al.16 For K0.25MnO2, newly formed occupied states appear inside the original MnO2 bandgap, indicating mixed Mn4+ and Mn3+ in K0.25MnO2, which is compatible with previous reports32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the presence of K+ inside the 2 × 2 tunnels can enhance the electronic conductivity of -MnO2 through electron hopping between Mn4+/Mn3+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Conductivity measurements of -MnO2 nanowires after acid treatment over different timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Calculated electron density of states near the

concentration, the conductivity of three nanowires was measured to test reproducibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IV responses of all the nanowires with different K+ concentrations measured in situ in the microscope (inset of Fig 4b) are nonlinear but symmetric in the low-bias regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be ascribed to the Schottky barriers formed between the semiconducting nanowire and the metal (W) electrodes33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the large-bias regime (810 V), the IV curves exhibit a near-linear relationship, and the conductance (G) of the nanowires can be calculated according to G=dI/dV (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  G was calculated to be 0.150.19 S for K0.25MnO2, 0.0250.034 S for K0.25xMnO2 and 0.00110.0050 S for undoped MnO2; the results are plotted in Fig 4b, and details of the data fitting are provided in Supplementary Table 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the similar diameters and lengths of the selected nanowires used for testing, the conductivities of nanowires with different K+ concentrations should exhibit similar trends as the conductance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be seen that K0.25MnO2 has a conductivity about 40 times higher than that of pure -MnO2, indicating the important role of tunnel cations in enhancing the electronic conductivity of -MnO2 nanowires.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The origin of the improved electronic conductivity of -MnO2 containing K+ can be attributed to the electron hopping between heterovalent Mn pairs (Mn3+/Mn4+) induced by K+ doping35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing the cation content will produce more regions inside the nanowire with mixed Mn3+/Mn4+ valence states, resulting in higher electronic conductivity37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Li+ diffusion in -MnO2 nanowires with different K+ contents was characterized by EIS, and the results are shown in Fig 4c,d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 4c shows the impedance spectra (Nyquist plots) of electrodes with K0.25MnO2, K0.25xMnO2 or undoped MnO2 as the active material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the low frequency region the real part of the impedance (Z) is linear against the 1/2 power of the angular frequency (1/2), and the slope is called the Warburg coefficient ().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Linear fits to the Z versus 1/2 plots for the untreated and treated -MnO2 electrodes are shown in Fig 4d, and the corresponding  values are listed in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the equivalent circuit (inset of Fig 4c) was used to fit the spectra and the results are listed in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The charge-transfer resistance (Rct) increased after K+ removal, indicating that doping with K+ enhances lithium intercalation near the electrode/electrolyte interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Transport properties derived from the impedance

The measured values agree well with reported specific surface areas for hydrothermally synthesized -MnO2 nanostructures which is in the range of 2040 m2g1 (refs 12, 39, 40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values of  are listed in Table 1 showing that the chemical diffusion coefficient of Li+ is reduced by removal of K+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, extending the time of acid treatment from 1 day to 4 days leads to a three-orders-of-magnitude decrease in the value of .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results directly confirm that K+ in -MnO2 tunnels facilitates diffusion of Li+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although

1081012 cm2 s1 have been reported for Li+ diffusion in layered oxide cathodes such as LiCoO2 and Li(Ni,Mn,Co)O2 (refs 42, 43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase of Li+ diffusivity by the addition of K+ can be attributed mainly to the expansion of the tunnel cavity by the large centred K+ cation at 2a sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The improved e conductivity is also beneficial for Li+ conductivity in the tunnels with the presence of K+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Rate performance of -KxMnO2 cathodes', 'Since the presence of tunnel cations improves both the electronic conductivity and Li+ diffusivity of -MnO2, the rate performance of a Li/-MnO2 battery would be expected to be enhanced when K+ occupy the tunnels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before we examined the rate performance, the tunnel stability as well as the stability of K+ inside the tunnels during repetitive cycling are characterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementary Fig 8ac shows the morphology and phase analysis of three groups of nanowires

and after battery cycles for the electrode initially composed of K0.25MnO2 nanowires.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The K+ concentration in the tunnels is slightly reduced after cycling (probably lost into the electrolyte), while the majority of K+ remains inside the nanowires.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All the nanowires, including those with K+ (partially and totally) removed, retain their tunnelled -MnO2 structure with no obvious morphology change during battery cycling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore the good stability of K+ ions in the tunnels can retain their effect on the battery performance upon continuous cycling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To investigate the effect of K+ concentration on the first cycle performance, the galvanostatic discharge/charge curves for three groups of nanowires are shown in

than that of the treated nanowires (157 and 170 mAh g1), which can be ascribed to the addition of inactive mass of K+ into the electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon charge, however, the capacity of the treated nanowires is lower than the capacity of the nanowires with no treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To study the rate performance, the first discharge capacity of a Li/-MnO2 battery under different current rates (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 C) was measured for the three groups of nanowires.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To make the comparison more straightforward, the discharge capacity at 0.1 C was normalized to 100%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From Fig 5a, it can be seen that the first discharge capacities of cathodes made of K0.25MnO2, K0.25xMnO2 and undoped MnO2 were all reduced when the C rate was increased from 0.1 to 5 C. The capacity retention behaviour under high discharge currents, however, varied with different K+ concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Li/K0.25MnO2 exhibited 62% capacity retention at 5 C, while Li/K0.25xMnO2 retained only 54% capacity and Li/MnO2 showed capacity retention as low as 8% at 5 C.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this study, the effect of tunnel cations (K+) on the electrochemical performance of -MnO2 cathodes was examined using a powerful combination of analytical ACSTEM, in situ TEM, electrochemical testing and ab initio modelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -MnO2 nanowires with different K+ concentrations were prepared and imaged at sub-ångstrom resolution to determine the structure of tunnels as well as the location and content of K+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was found that the presence of K+ inside the 2 × 2 tunnels of -MnO2 nanowires improves both their electronic conductivity and Li+ diffusivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These enhancements facilitate favourable electrode kinetics, and thus result in good rate performance of Li/-MnO2 based batteries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The results of our systematic study provide a valuable framework for the rational selection of tunnel cations and their concentrations to improve the rate performance of tunnel-based intercalation electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the favourable effect of K+ incorporation suggests that further exploration of tunnel-based cathodes with new battery chemistries based on Na+, Mg2+, and Al3+ ions is also warranted.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#
