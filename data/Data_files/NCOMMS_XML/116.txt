Soluble LR11/SorLA represses thermogenesis in adipose tissue and correlates with BMI in humans  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) is an important component of energy expenditure in mammals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies have confirmed its presence and metabolic role in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Defining the physiological regulation of BAT is therefore of great importance for developing strategies to treat metabolic diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that the soluble form of the low-density lipoprotein receptor relative, LR11/SorLA (sLR11), suppresses thermogenesis in adipose tissue in a cell-autonomous manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice lacking LR11 are protected from diet-induced obesity associated with an increased browning of white adipose tissue and hypermetabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of adipocytes with sLR11 inhibits thermogenesis via the bone morphogenetic protein/TGF signalling pathway and reduces Smad phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, sLR11 levels in humans are shown to positively correlate with body mass index and adiposity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the need for tight regulation of a tissue with a high capacity for energy wastage, we propose that LR11 plays an energy conserving role that is exaggerated in states of obesity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Murine studies have demonstrated that increasing heat production in brown adipose tissue (BAT) can offset obesogenic effects of a high-fat diet (HFD)1,2, whereas reducing thermogenesis exacerbates them3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of BAT in adult humans has been reconfirmed by using modern imaging techniques and tissue biopsies4,5,6, increasing the importance of understanding BATs physiological regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, levels of detectable BAT correlate negatively with age, body mass index (BMI) and diabetes7, and using intermittent cold exposure to increase amounts of BAT is sufficient to increase post-prandial energy expenditure and improve insulin sensitivity8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that thermogenesis in BAT is an important factor contributing to human metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerous secreted and circulating factors have been identified to date with the ability to enhance the amount and/or activity of BAT9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the need for tight regulation of a tissue with such a high capacity for energy wastage, it is somewhat surprising that comparatively few negative regulators have been described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in levels of LR11 in humans have primarily been associated with Alzheimers disease, linked to its potential role in amyloid processing in the brain10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, LR11 has been shown to possess the required properties of a functional lipoprotein receptor and the soluble form (sLR11) has been shown to facilitate increased vascular smooth muscle cell migration in response to injury, hinting at an equally important peripheral role11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LR11 has also been shown to regulate lipoprotein lipase (LPL), a key enzyme regulating the supply of lipid to BAT, by coordinating both its anterograde and retrograde vesicular transport14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we show that mice lacking LR11 are protected from diet-induced obesity because of a hypermetabolic phenotype, facilitated by enhanced thermogenic gene expression in white adipose tissue (WAT) depots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data demonstrate that sLR11 is able to bind to bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptors and suppress thermogenic signalling via suppression of downstream Smad protein phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression profile of Lr11 and serum levels of sLR11 in mice increase at times of increased thermogenesis, suggesting a regulatory role of sLR11 in preventing excessive energy wastage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sLR11 levels correlate with adiposity in humans, leading us to conclude that sLR11 may be an important negative regulator of adipose tissue energy expenditure, which is dysregulated in obesity, potentially compromising metabolic responses to nutritional stimuli.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Lr11/ mice are hypermetabolic and protected from obesity', 'We previously generated a mouse lacking LR11 to examine its role in vascular smooth muscle cells in vivo and that of the cleaved soluble form (sLR11) in vitro11,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies highlighted a tendency for Lr11/ mice to be lighter than their wild-type (WT) littermates, and as such our central hypothesis was that LR11 was in some manner acting as a negative regulator of metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To formally assess differences in body weight, WT and Lr11/ mice were fed standard chow or HFD to maximally expose differences in weight gain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The body weight of WT 8-weeks-old mice on chow diet was similar to those of Lr11/ mice; however, the size of the retroperitoneal and reproductive fat pads were significantly reduced (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, HFD-fed Lr11/ mice had markedly lower body weights than WT controls, a large portion of which was accounted for by reductions in the weights of WAT and liver (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduced adiposity after 8 weeks of HFD was clearly evident from anatomical examinations (Fig 1af) and histological analyses revealed that Lr11/ mice had smaller lipid droplets in BAT (Fig 1e) and were protected from hepatic steatosis (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of weekly energy balance on chow diet confirmed no significant difference in rate of body weight change or daily food intake in 1011-week-old mice (Fig 1gi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Longer term monitoring of weight change in a separate study indicated a clear increase in weight gain in WT mice fed a HFD, with a high rate of divergence from the persistently lean Lr11/ mice observed by the comparative 10-weeks-old time-point (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Averaged daily food intakes over the course of this study again confirmed no difference between genotypes (WT=59.9±1.1, Lr11/=60.5±1.2 kJ day1) or HFD (WT=70.1±3.8, Lr11/=70.1±2.9 kJ day1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that increased energy expenditure was facilitating the reduction in the rate of weight gain in Lr11/ mice fed HFD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assessment of energy expenditure using indirect calorimetry confirmed that Lr11/ mice had a higher metabolic rate than WT mice when fed HFD (30±0.4 vs 27.5±0.3 J min1) (Fig 2b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lr11/ mice also displayed improved serum biochemistry profiles, with lower fasting glucose, insulin and triglyceride levels, particularly on HFD (Fig 2df).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other circulating factors such as free-fatty acids, T4, leptin and serum cholesterol were not significantly altered (Fig 2gk), nor were any significant alterations in LPL activity observed in Lr11/tissues (Fig 2l).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Tissue weights from wild-type and Lr11/ mice.Full size table', 'Figure 1: Lr11/ mice display reduced adiposity when fed a HFD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Representative images of body size, (b) intra-abdominal fat, (c,d) separate white adipose depots and (e) brown adipose tissue and (f) livers with haematoxylin and eosin staining of histological sections from mice fed HFD from 8 to 16 weeks of age; scale bars, 200 m.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our data demonstrate a role for sLR11 as a negative regulator of thermogenesis, acting through the BMP/Smad pathway in adipose tissue to suppress activation of thermogenic machinery and inhibit transcription of key thermogenic genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LR11 is regulated in tissues with inherent/adaptive thermogenic capacity, in response to changes in environmental temperature and diet, but not in other metabolic tissues such as liver (Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In absence of any endogenous LR11, nutritional stimuli that induce thermogenesis in scWAT are left unchecked, leading to increased recruitment of brown adipocytes, reduced lipid accumulation, hypermetabolism and overall leanness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our in vitro data support a cell-autonomous role of sLR11 in regulating adipose tissue responses to increased energy availability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is suggested by the peptides ability to suppress the known thermogenic signalling pathways and the lack of any significant change to energy balance on a standard chow diet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurological roles for LR11 have been previously described, although we hypothesize that if LR11 is required to maintain a central circuit regulating metabolic rate, it would be expected that its ablation would yield a consistent phenotype across environmental conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead metabolic rate changes only become apparent in Lr11/ mice fed HFD, when sympathetic tone to BAT and WAT depots increases and adaptive changes occur to strike a new balance between lipid oxidation and storage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of LR11 and thus sLR11, increased energy availability results in increased DIT in adipose tissue but without the appropriate anabolic response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where WT mice are able to store additional calories as triglyceride, Lr11/ mice can only increase the metabolic arm of the response and burn them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, even on a chow diet there is a slight tendency for Lr11/ mice to be lighter and consume slightly less food (Fig 1gi and Fig 2a) and it is also highly likely that DIT is itself regulated by discrete neuronal pathways that mediate alterations to sympathetic activation of thermogenic tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore we cannot rule out based on our current data, that LR11 may also play a central role in the initiation and maintenance of metabolic responses and energy balance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'LR11 has also been previously shown to increase vascular smooth muscle cell migration in response to injury11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not observe any alteration to vasculogenesis or angiogenesis in Lr11/mice, suggesting that perturbations in these processes are not causative of the hypermetabolic phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the documented ability of LR11 to regulate LPL activity15 was not evident as a mechanism by which its deletion led to hypermetabolism in our model (Fig 2l).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data also suggest that sLR11 levels are dependent on adipose mass in humans, increasing in line with fat mass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinical interventions such as bariatric surgery that lead to reductions in adiposity, also lower sLR11 levels (Table 3 and Fig 6h,i), potentially contributing to the observed increase in metabolic rate in such patients27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that the strongest correlation in all human subjects is between sLR11 and visceral and SFA, rather than BMI is further evidence that adipose tissue is the main site of sLR11 production and secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We identify LR11 as a key metabolic regulator, which functions to maintain the adequate balance between lipid storage and oxidation in response to changing environmental conditions and particularly when thermogenic activity is increased in capable tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism might be exploited for anti-obesity therapies or conversely, for the treatment of conditions such as anorexia nervosa or cachexia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apparent anabolic role of sLR11 may also be relevant for understanding its prior implication in cardiovascular disease and Alzheimers disease29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While an increasing number of factors and pharmacological molecules exist that either increase the number of brown adipocytes or their thermogenic capacity9,31, only a small number of negative regulators are apparent, namely nuclear receptor-interacting protein 140 (Rip140) and the diurnally regulated Rev-erb (refs 32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It seems likely that other negative regulators must exist to ensure effective control of this energy-expensive mechanism and to fine tune the thermogenic response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before our study, a lipoprotein receptor-mediated mechanism for regulation of BMP signalling in the regulation of thermogenesis has not been described.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
