Patients with genetically heterogeneous synchronous colorectal cancer carry rare damaging germline mutations in immune-related genes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Synchronous colorectal cancers (syCRCs) are physically separated tumours that develop simultaneously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand how the genetic and environmental background influences the development of multiple tumours, here we conduct a comparative analysis of 20 syCRCs from 10 patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that syCRCs have independent genetic origins, acquire dissimilar somatic alterations, and have different clone composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This inter- and intratumour heterogeneity must be considered in the selection of therapy and in the monitoring of resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SyCRC patients show a higher occurrence of inherited damaging mutations in immune-related genes compared to patients with solitary colorectal cancer and to healthy individuals from the 1,000 Genomes Project.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, they have a different composition of immune cell populations in tumour and normal mucosa, and transcriptional differences in immune-related biological processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests an environmental field effect that promotes multiple tumours likely in the background of inflammation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Several large-scale sequencing projects have extensively characterized the genomic landscape of colorectal cancer (CRC)1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite all efforts, several questions still remain unaddressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, around 25% of CRC patients present multiple primary tumours at initial diagnosis5,6,7 (synchronous CRC (syCRC)) but the causes of multiple tumours are still poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients with Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) have a higher incidence of syCRC8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and hyperplastic polyposis are known to predispose to synchronous tumours10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These conditions, however, only account for around 10% of syCRC8, thus suggesting that other predisposing causes likely exist7,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, a homozygous mutation in the base-excision repair gene NTHL1 has been associated with the onset of multiple colorectal adenomas in Dutch families14, but this mutation is absent in other affected individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the predisposing factors, it is uncertain whether paired tumours of a patient share the same genetic origin and acquire similar somatic alterations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, whether genetic or environmental field effects influence the way syCRCs originate and develop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparative analyses of syCRCs have so far focussed mostly on mutation hotspots in known cancer genes and on the status of microsatellites and mismatch-repair proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies report both concordant and discordant alterations between paired tumours, with the latter being predominant15,16,17,18,19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High methylation of CpG islands seems to be a recurrent feature of syCRC22,23,24 and has suggested the presence of an epigenetic field effect13,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these reports, a comprehensive characterization of syCRC is not yet available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Around 5% of CRCs available in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) are annotated as synchronous, but only one tumour has been sequenced in all cases, thus preventing a genome-wide comparison of somatic mutations between paired lesions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we performed a systematic genomic profiling of 20 syCRCs from 10 patients with the aim to compare their alterations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysed cohort included patients with Lynch syndrome, FAP, PeutzJeghers syndrome, familial CRC type X and sporadic CRC, not to bias the analysis towards a particular CRC type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared the landscape of acquired mutations between paired tumours to assess whether they share the same origin and converge towards a similar clone composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also analysed the inherited genotype of these patients to search for evidence of genetic predispositions to the development of multiple tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results contribute the elucidation of the genetics and of the predisposing mechanisms of syCRCs with possible impacts on their clinical management.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'syCRCs are genetically heterogeneous tumours', 'We extracted genomic DNA from multiple sections of one fresh frozen and 19 formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumours from 10 patients (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each tumour underwent quantitative pathological review to ensure a reliable estimation of tumour content based on macrodissected sections or across multiple regions of the tissue block (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We captured and sequenced the whole exomes of all 20 syCRCs and matched normal samples reaching an average depth of coverage of 125 × (Supplementary Table 2; Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We called and compared single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions and deletions (InDels) in tumour and corresponding normal (Supplementary Fig 3) to identify somatic mutations (Table 1; Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed several quality controls on the identified mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we re-sequenced the whole exome of eight tumours from independent libraries (Supplementary Fig 2) and confirmed that on average 81% mutations were present in both sequencing rounds (Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we re-called SNVs and InDels using independent variant callers, and measured 88 and 78% concordance, respectively (Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, we re-sequenced a panel of 151 cancer genes in six tumours at high depth of coverage (280 × , Supplementary Table 4) and confirmed all previously detected mutations (Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we randomly selected 24 SNVs and 11 InDels, and confirmed 32 of them with Sanger sequencing (91% specificity, Supplementary Table 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the majority of sequenced samples derived from FFPE tissues, we checked for possible sequencing artefacts due to formalin fixation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed similar signatures of somatic mutations between the 19 FFPE tumours and fresh frozen CRCs from TCGA (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the germline mutation patterns of FFPE samples were comparable to those of blood and TCGA samples (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This excluded the presence of sequence artefacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Somatic nonsilent mutations and copy-number variant genes in syCRCs.Full size table', 'In addition to SNVs and InDels, we also profiled copy number variations (CNVs) using genome-wide SNP array on tumours and normal samples, and identified genes undergoing somatic amplifications and deletions in each tumour (Table 1; Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected1,25, cancers associated with mismatch repair deficiency were hypermutated and mostly diploid, while non-hypermutated CRCs showed a high proportion of amplified or deleted genes (Fig 1a; Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also confirmed that cancers on the right side of the intestine were more mutated than those on the left side1,25 (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Landscape of somatic alterations in syCRC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Mutation frequency and percentage of amplified and deleted genes in 20 syCRCs from 10 patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dashed line represents the threshold of mutation frequency (eight mutations per mega base pairs) between hypermutated and non-hypermutated CRC1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FAP, familial adenomatous polyposis;

Supplementary Data 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was further confirmed in the deep sequencing experiment (Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess whether the few shared cancer genes were altered at similar stages during the tumour growth, we quantified the clonality of their alterations (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the majority of cases, alterations in cancer genes had different clonality (Fig 2a), indicating that the corresponding cancer genes were modified at different times in the two tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, alterations in PIK3CA and ARID1A were early events in tumour S13T2 (clonality  greater than 60%), but were detectable in  less_than 35% of cells in S13T1 (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients S3, S12, and to a lower extent, UH5 again represented exceptions because their tumours shared higher fractions of altered cancer genes (Fig 1d) and these alterations, albeit different (Supplementary Fig 6), often had similar clonality (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we checked whether, overall, tumours of a patient converged towards the alteration of the same genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that paired lesions of a patient did not share a higher fraction of altered genes or of cancer genes than any pair of tumours of different patients (P values=0.34 and 0.16, respectively, one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Fig 2b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether our analysis indicated that syCRCs had independent genetic origins, acquired different somatic alterations and developed into tumours that were as genetically heterogeneous in terms of cancer genes as tumours from different patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Comparison of somatic alterations between paired tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Clonality of putative driver alterations in cancer genes that are shared between paired tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alteration clonality corresponds to the fraction of cancer cells carrying the alteration (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumours of patient UH6 are not shown because they did not share any altered cancer genes (Supplementary Data 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b,c) Similarity matrix of all altered genes (b) and of altered cancer genes (c) across the 20 syCRCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each pair of tumours from same or different patients, the Jaccard coefficient was measured as the proportion of shared altered genes over the total number of altered genes.Full size image', 'syCRCs show distinct clone composition', 'Next, we sought to investigate whether syCRCs were also heterogeneous in terms of clone composition, because this may have consequences in their clinical management.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this aim, we derived the density distribution of clonality of somatic alterations and quantified the number of prevalent clones in each tumour using the allele frequency of somatic SNVs, InDels, amplifications and deletions (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For SNVs and InDels, we measured the allele frequency as the number of mutated reads over the total reads, after confirming the reliability of this estimation (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because amplifications and deletions modify the allele frequency of SNVs and InDels, we only considered mutations in diploid regions (on average 76% of all somatic mutations in each tumour, Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For amplified and deleted regions, we inferred the allele frequency based on the loss of heterozygosity of germline mutations (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We corrected the allele frequency of each alteration for the tumour content of the corresponding lesion to remove the fraction of wild-type alleles deriving from normal cells (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then assessed the fraction of cancer cells carrying each alteration (alteration clonality) and derived the density distributions of clonality for SNVs, InDels, amplifications and deletions independently (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, these density distributions indicated how many alterations were expected at each clonality as inferred from the observed counts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the peaks of the distributions showed at which clonality the alterations accumulated and were indicative of the clone composition of the tumour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further classify the tumour as monoclonal, biclonal or polyclonal, we divided somatic alterations into three groups according to their clonality ( greater than 80%, 3580% and  less_than 35%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest group of the three was indicative of the presence of one, two or multiple prevalent clones (Fig 3a; Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three out of 20 tumours (S3T1, S12T1 and S12T2) were classified as monoclonal because the majority of their somatic events were detectable in  greater than 80% of cancer cells (Fig 3b; Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten tumours (S13T1, S13T2, S6T1, S3T2, UH1T1, UH2T1, UH5T1, UH5T2, UH8T1 and UH11T2) were considered as biclonal because they showed an accumulation of modifications between 35 and 80% clonality, suggesting the co-existence of two prevalent clones (Fig 3b; Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining seven tumours (S6T2, UH1T2, UH2T2, UH6T1, UH6T2, UH8T2 and UH11T1) were considered as polyclonal because the majority of somatic events had clonality  less_than 35%, compatibly with the presence of multiple clones (Fig 3b; Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 6 out of 10 patients, the two tumours had distinct clone composition (Fig 3b), indicating that syCRCs differed not only in their genetic origin but also in their clonal development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, we obtained similar estimates of clone composition using an independent method to measure the alteration clonality26 (Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Inter and intratumour heterogeneity of syCRCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Method to rebuild the clone composition of a tumour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Allele frequency of each somatic alteration is corrected for the tumour content and used to infer the alteration clonality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density distributions of clonality for each type of alteration recapitulate the tumour clone composition (monoclonal, if the majority of alterations has clonality  greater than 80%; biclonal, if alterations accumulate between 35 and 80% clonality; or polyclonal if they have  less_than 35% clonality).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Clone composition of the 20 syCRCs as inferred from the clonality of their somatic alterations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Clonality of putative driver alterations in EGFR and in other six genes known or suspected to give resistance to anti-EGFR therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are shown in both lesions of all patients, except UH2 because neither tumour from this patient showed alterations in the EGFR pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Density distributions of clonality for somatic alterations in the two tumours of patient S6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dots represent alterations in CRC genes as collected from the Network of Cancer Genes61.Full size image', 'The inter- and intratumour heterogeneity of syCRCs may have implications in the response of patients to therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, several analysed tumours had amplification of EGF receptor (EGFR) (Fig 3c; Supplementary Data 4), which is a clinically relevant target in CRC27,28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, they also showed activating alterations of EGFR downstream effectors conferring resistance to anti-EGFR therapy30,31,32,33 (Fig 3c; Supplementary Data 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most cases, these alterations were heterogeneously distributed at different clonality between paired tumours (Fig 3c; Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, modifications of EGFR and PIK3CA were almost clonal in tumour S6T1 but absent in S6T2 (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We extended our analysis to a list of known actionable genes34 and again observed that most alterations either occurred in only one tumour or showed different clonality between tumours (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the different clone composition of syCRCs might have an impact on drug response and their genetic heterogeneity should be taken into account when selecting therapeutic regimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'syCRC patients carry damaging germline SNPs in immune genes', 'Our analysis of somatic alterations showed that syCRCs started independently and developed into heterogeneous tumours as a consequence of distinct driver events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we asked whether there was any genetic predisposition of these individuals to develop independent tumours as compared to patients with solitary CRC (soCRC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified 406 soCRCs and 23 additional syCRCs in TCGA and verified that overall the two cohorts did not significantly differ in terms of age at initial diagnosis, gender, ethnicity and CRC type (Supplementary Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only significant difference was the higher occurrence of extra-colonic malignancies in syCRC patients (P value=0.03, Fishers exact test, Supplementary Fig 11), which supports the hypothesis of their predisposition to develop multiple tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Since known hereditary conditions account only for a small fraction of syCRC8, we hypothesized that syCRCs result from the constitutional alteration not of a single gene, but of several genes contributing to the same biological process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To detect such altered processes, we developed a mutation enrichment gene set analysis (MEGA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MEGA systematically compares the cumulative distribution of mutations within a process between two cohorts and identifies those processes that are overall more frequently altered in one cohort (Fig 4a, see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using MEGA, we compared the distribution of rare single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with predicted damaging effects on the protein in 186 manually annotated KEGG gene sets35 between syCRC and soCRC patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focused on rare damaging SNPs (minor allele frequency  less_than 1%) because they are most likely to cause disease36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the TCGA samples were sequenced at different centres, we re-called mutations using the same pipeline as for our samples (Supplementary Data 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In syCRC patients, we observed a significantly higher number of rare damaging SNPs in four of the 186 KEGG gene sets (cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, Toll-like receptor signalling, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and cytosolic DNA sensing pathways, false discovery rate, FDR  less_than 10%, Supplementary Data 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To exclude possible biases, we repeated the analysis using different reference cohort and gene sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To change cohort, we re-called and annotated germline mutations in 756 individuals of the 1,000 Genomes Project37 (Supplementary Data 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We again confirmed the enrichment of syCRC patients in rare damaging SNPs affecting the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and in the Toll-like receptor signalling pathways (FDR  less_than 2%, Fig 4b; Supplementary Data 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To change gene sets, we grouped 6,589 disease-associated genes38 according to disease and obtained 346 disease-associated gene sets (Supplementary Data 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Applying MEGA we found that syCRC patients had significantly more rare damaging SNPs in four disease-associated gene sets as compared to both the soCRC and to the 1,000 Genomes cohorts (FDR  less_than 5%, Fig 4b; Supplementary Data 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these we found IBD, which is known to predispose to syCRC10,11,12 and four of the enriched gene sets were clearly related to immune response (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also controlled for the effect of sample size (33 syCRC patients as compared to 406 soCRC patients and to 756 individuals from the 1,000 Genomes) using a bootstrapping procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For 10,000 times, we randomly extracted 33 individuals from the soCRC and from the 1,000 Genomes cohorts separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At each iteration, we compared the distribution of rare damaging SNPs in the four immune-related gene sets between the 33 syCRC patients and the randomly extracted individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that syCRC patients had significantly more rare damaging SNPs (P value  less_than 0.05, one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test) in the vast majority of comparisons (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Rare damaging SNPs in immune-related genes of syCRC patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Mutation enrichment gene set analysis (MEGA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mutations in members of a given gene set are counted in all samples of two cohorts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting distributions of mutations are compared between the two cohorts using the one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test and corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini & Hochberg method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) KEGG and disease-associated gene sets that are enriched in rare damaging SNPs in syCRC patients (33) when compared to soCRC patients (406) and to individuals from the 1,000 Genomes Project (756).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only gene sets with FDR  less_than 10% in both comparisons are reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since FDR was always  less_than 5%, FDR ranges from 0 to 5%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Results of the bootstrapping procedure applied to the four immune-related gene sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant comparisons had P value  less_than 0.05, one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Genes of the four immune-related gene sets with rare damaging SNPs in syCRC patients.Full size image', 'Several gene sets that were frequently mutated in syCRC patients are involved in immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and the Toll-like receptor signalling pathways mediate immune response while IBD and allergic senitization arise in response to abnormal antigen recognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, 24 out of 33 syCRC patients (73%) had rare damaging SNPs in these four immune-related gene sets (Fig 4d), with an average of one mutation per patient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a comparison, only 94 soCRC patients (23%) and 200 individuals from 1,000 Genomes (26%) had rare damaging SNPs in the same gene sets, with an average of 0.3 mutations per individual (Supplementary Data 6 and 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the genes in these gene sets were mutated in only one syCRC patient (Fig 4d), confirming that it is the alteration of the immune response rather than of a specific gene to recur across these patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only exception was the stopgain mutation in the interferon domain of IFNA5 that recurred in three patients (Fig 4d; Supplementary Data 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'syCRC patients have abnormal mucosa immune composition', 'To understand whether inherited alterations of immune-related genes were reflected in differences in the immune cell composition, we stained and counted T cells in the normal colonic mucosa of syCRC and soCRC patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found significantly higher fraction of CD8+ T cells in the normal mucosa, which was also evident when the lamina propria was scored independently (P values=0.03 and 0.028, respectively, one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Fig 5a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, intraepithelial T cells were more frequent in the surface epithelium of syCRC patients, though not in the crypt epithelium (P values=9 × 103 and 0.5, respectively, one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Fig 5c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the normal colonic mucosa of syCRC patients has a different immune cell composition than the normal colonic mucosa of soCRC patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify whether differences were also detectable in the tumours, we compared the levels of immune cell infiltrates in syCRCs and soCRCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio because it has a prognostic value in colorectal cancer39,40 and found that it was significantly higher in syCRCs (P value=1.5 × 104, one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was due to a higher number of neutrophils in syCRC (Supplementary Fig 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since microsatellite instable (MSI) tumours show higher immune cell infiltrates, usually lymphocytes41, we removed MSI tumours and verified that the difference between syCRCs and soCRCs remained significant (P value=1.5 × 103, one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Fig 6b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then analysed only syCRCs and verified that the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was similar in MSI and microsatellite stable (MSS) syCRCs and slightly higher in T2 than in T1 (P values=0.69 and 0.013, respectively, one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Fig 6c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, despite being genetically heterogeneous, syCRCs showed consistently higher level of tumour-associated inflammation, particularly in neutrophils (Fig 6d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we sought to investigate whether these differences in the immune cell composition were reflected at the transcriptional level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared the entire transcriptomes of syCRCs and soCRCs using an approach conceptually similar to MEGA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we derived the overall distributions of gene expression in 14 syCRCs and 193 soCRCs that had RNA sequencing data in TCGA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, we grouped genes in four classes (not expressed, lowly expressed, medium expressed, highly expressed; see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we compared the fractions of genes in each of the four classes between syCRCs and soCRCs in the 186 KEGG gene sets to search for significant differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the exception of the olfactory transduction pathway, we found no difference in the fractions of highly and medium expressed genes (Supplementary Data 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, syCRCs showed significantly higher fractions of not expressed and lowly expressed genes in 10 gene sets, seven of which had clear connections with immune response (FDR  less_than 10%, Fig 6e; Supplementary Data 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the cytokinecytokine receptor interaction and the Toll-like receptor signalling pathways had an average of 10 and 3% not expressed genes per tumour, respectively (Fig 6e; Supplementary Data 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed similar results with the bootstrapping to control for sample size (Supplementary Fig 13) and with a gene set enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, we found 47 significantly down regulated gene sets (FDR  less_than 9%), 18 of which are immune-related including all those found in the previous analysis (Supplementary Data 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we observed an overall tendency of genes in the immune-related pathways (Figs 4d and 6e) to have lower expression when mutated as compared to wild-type, particularly in the presence of stopgain mutations (Supplementary Fig 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these results indicated a different functionality of immune-related processes at the transcriptional level in syCRCs as compared to soCRCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Immune cell composition of normal colonic mucosa of syCRC and soCRC patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Percentages of CD8+ T cells over all CD3+ cells in the normal mucosa and lamina propria of syCRC and soCRC patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Distributions were compared using the one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Example of immunostaining for CD8 (Novocastra, Clone 4B11) and CD3 (Novocastra, Clone LN10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dotted lines mark the boundary between the epithelium and lamina propria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arrowheads indicate intraepithelial lymphocytes in the surface epithelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Magnification 200 × ;

'In this study we show that syCRCs have independent genetic origins and develop into genetically heterogeneous tumours, in agreement with single observations in other anatomical sites such as kidney42 and lung43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, tumour heterogeneity affects response to treatment because it may reduce the efficacy of therapies targeting specific gene aberrations44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the particular case of syCRC, the scenario is complicated by the presence of genetically distinct tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, no specific guidelines exist for the management of syCRC45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results highlight the need for testing all synchronous tumours to inform on the most appropriate clinical decisions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, anti-EGFR therapy and monitoring of mutations in EGFR downstream effectors as biomarkers of resistance may have limited applicability in syCRC patients because of the genetic contribution of distinct clones from multiple tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We also contribute a better understanding of the factors that predispose to multiple tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis of germline mutations suggests that inherited damaging alterations of immune-related genes may increase the frequency of independent cancer-initiating events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be due to the inflammatory microenvironment that favours tumorigenesis via increased genomic instability or through the production of cytokines and growth factors46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this respect, our results suggest the presence of an environmental field effect mediated by inflammation promoting the onset of multiple independent tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to germline alterations, we report a higher proportion of CD8+ T cells in the lamina propria and a higher abundance in the surface intraepithelial compartment of the normal colon mucosa of syCRC patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD8+ T cells, in particular those with intraepithelial location, are associated with maintenance of epithelial integrity48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is not clear if their relative abundance in syCRC is associated with tumorigenesis or increased surveillance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observe a higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and differences in the tumour expression of immune related genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of immune cells in promoting neoplastic progression is well known46,49, and it is usually mediated through the production of cytokines46,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, bacterial biofilms, which contribute to chronic inflammation, are also known to favour the onset of colorectal cancer51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It would be interesting to check whether the gastrointestinal microbiome also contributes to the environmental field effect of syCRC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies on the deregulation mechanisms of these immune processes are required to fully understand the onset of multiple primary tumours, including extending the analysis to other organs.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
