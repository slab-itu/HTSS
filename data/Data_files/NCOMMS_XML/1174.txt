YAP determines the cell fate of injured mouse hepatocytes in vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The presence of senescent, transformed or damaged cells can impair tissue function or lead to tumorigenesis; therefore, organisms have evolved quality control mechanisms to eliminate them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that YAP activation induced by inactivation of the Hippo pathway specifically in damaged hepatocytes promotes their selective elimination by using in vivo mosaic analysis in mouse liver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These damaged hepatocytes migrate into the hepatic sinusoids, undergo apoptosis and are engulfed by Kupffer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, YAP activation in undamaged hepatocytes leads to proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cellular stresses such as ethanol that damage both liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and hepatocytes switch cell fate from proliferation to migration/apoptosis in the presence of activated YAP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This involves the activation of CDC42 and Rac that regulate cell migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we suggest that YAP acts as a stress sensor that induces elimination of injured cells to maintain tissue and organ homeostasis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cellular stress in tissues and organs leads to senescent, transformed or damaged cells1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells can impair tissue function or lead to tumorigenesis and therefore need to be eliminated and their loss compensated for through cell proliferation to maintain tissue and organ size5,6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the molecular mechanisms that act to maintain tissue and organ homeostasis during cellular stress are largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The liver plays a central role in metabolic homeostasis due to its role in metabolism, and the synthesis, storage and redistribution of nutrients10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The liver is also one of the main detoxifying organs, removing waste and xenobiotics through metabolic conversion and biliary excretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The waste and xenobiotics come from the gastrointestinal tract via the portal vein, and diffuse into small blood vessels known as hepatic sinusoids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the liver is constantly exposed to various stresses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The liver consists of several different cell types including hepatocytes, which have metabolizing and detoxifying abilities, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), which form the sinusoidal wall and cover the hepatocytes, and Kupffer cells, which are sinusoid-resident macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The Hippo pathway regulates organ size and cancer formation by modulating cell proliferation and death via regulation of YAP activation12,13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Central to the Hippo pathway is a kinase cascade wherein Mst (the mammalian orthologue of the Drosophila Hippo) phosphorylates and activates the adaptor protein Mob and the protein kinase LATS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activated LATS then phosphorylates the transcription coactivator YAP, and inhibits its activation by cytoplasmic retention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unphosphorylated YAP translocates into the nucleus, interacts with the transcription factor TEAD and induces target gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene knockout of Hippo pathway components induces hepatomegaly and liver cancer in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, we reported that loss of Mob causes YAP activation and cancer formation in mouse liver17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depletion of the YAP gene suppressed liver cancer formation in Mob-knockout mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the liver phenotypes caused by an impaired Hippo pathway are strongly dependent on YAP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we examine the dynamics of YAP-activating hepatocytes by in vivo mosaic analysis in mouse and discover that the fate of YAP-expressing hepatocytes changes from proliferation to migration/apoptosis depending on the status (healthy or damaged) of the LSECs.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'YAP-activated hepatocytes are lost in mouse liver', 'To examine how the Hippo pathway affects the fate of individual hepatocytes, we first established mosaic conditions by using hydrodynamic tail vein injection (HTVi) to introduce Myc-tagged YAP-wild type (WT), or one of three active YAP mutants (YAP (1SA), YAP (2SA) or YAP (5SA)), into mouse liver in vivo19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under such conditions, HTVi achieves exogenous gene expression in 30% of hepatocytes (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that YAP (WT) localized in the cytoplasm and active YAP (1SA, 2SA and 5SA mutants), as expected, localized in the nucleus (Fig 1a, insets).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Real-time PCR showed that expression of one of the YAP target genes, connective tissue growth factor (ctgf), was increased in YAP (1SA, 2SA and 5SA) but not YAP (WT) during days 1 and 2 (Supplementary Fig 1b), consistent with functional YAP activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the number of hepatocytes expressing active YAP markedly decreased during days 37 post-HTVi, whereas no such reduction occurred in YAP (WT) livers (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoblotting confirmed a corresponding reduction in the active-YAP but not YAP (WT) protein (Fig 1c and Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify that loss of active YAP (5SA) hepatocytes caused this decrease, ROSA26-LacZ reporter mice were injected with Myc-YAP (5SA)-IRES-Cre plasmid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  YAP- and Cre-expressing cells were detected by immunostaining with anti-Myc and anti--galactosidase (-gal) or 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl--D-galactoside (X-gal) staining, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both cell populations decreased in parallel within 7 days of HTVi (Fig 1d and Supplementary Fig 2), confirming the loss of YAP (5SA)+ hepatocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, normal liver size was maintained in YAP (5SA) mice (Supplementary Fig 3a), prompting us to investigate the effect on hepatocyte proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In YAP (5SA), but not YAP (WT), liver at days 37 post-HTVi, the proliferation of mainly Myc-negative hepatocytes was increased (Supplementary Fig 3bd).

elimination dependent on CD4+ T cells (termed senescence surveillance)22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether senescence surveillance also played a role in the loss of YAP (5SA) hepatocytes in our system, we first examined the mouse livers for senescence-associated (SA)--gal+ hepatocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forced expression of activated K-Ras (G12V) induced hepatocyte senescence as expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, YAP (5SA) hepatocytes were SA--gal and thus not senescent (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also explored more directly whether adaptive immunity was involved in the loss of YAP

hepatic sinusoids, sinusoid intravasation of hepatocytes (Supplementary Fig 5ad) and were surrounded and engulfed by Kupffer cells (liver-resident macrophages) (Fig 2c,d and Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, we found that Kupffer cells also exist in the immunodeficient NOG mice (Supplementary Fig 5e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we depleted Kupffer cells from the YAP-expressing mice using clodronate liposomes24, and found that the loss of YAP (5SA) cells from the liver was suppressed, and instead TUNEL+ apoptotic cells coexpressing Myc appeared (Fig 2e,f and Supplementary Fig 6).

 Thus, specifically in the presence of both activated YAP and cellular damage induced by HTVi, hepatocyte fate changes from proliferation to migration/apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To investigate in more detail the type of liver injury that can change hepatocyte fate in the presence of activated YAP, we treated Ad-Cre/Ad-YAP (5SA)-infected ROSA26-LacZ mice with either carbon tetrachloride (CCl4),

the involvement of CDC42, which are small Rho family GTP proteins that regulate cytoskeleton organization and cell migration (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed migration is not likely due to epithelialmesenchymal transition because microarray analysis showed that epithelialmesenchymal transition marker gene expression was not altered (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

CDC42 and Rac, but not WT CDC42 and Rac, suppressed the elimination of YAP-activating hepatocytes by day 7 post-HTVi (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, both CDC42 and Rac contribute to YAP-activated

with ethanol or HTVi, whereas no such induction was observed in livers of mice that were infected with YAP (5SA)-expressing adenovirus and treated with CCl4 (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, YAP activation plus HTVi or ethanol induce Ect2 and Fgd3 upregulation, which triggers CDC42 and Rac activation in hepatocytes and drives their migration to sinusoids where they undergo Kupffer cell-mediated elimination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest a complex model for how the fate of hepatocytes in a liver subjected to myriad stresses is managed (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When YAP activation was induced in hepatocytes by the adenovirus vector, the cells did not migrate or die but instead proliferated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, hepatocytes expressing activated YAP in the presence of liver injury by HTVi or ethanol migrated into sinusoids, underwent apoptosis and were engulfed by Kupffer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a change in hepatocyte fate from proliferation to migration/apoptosis depends on a mechanism of stress detection involving YAP.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The hepatocyte proliferation induced by adenovirus-mediated expression of activated YAP matches the phenotype observed in mice deficient for a Hippo pathway component and in mice transgenically expressing YAP12,13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, hepatocyte migration/apoptosis induced by HTVi/ethanol shown in this study is a novel cellular response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed apoptosis may occur through anoikis in a p73-independent manner because YAP (5SA/WW1,2*) induced hepatocyte loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore consider this hepatocyte elimination mechanism to be a primitive cellular response that is independent of adaptive immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'F-actin formation promotes YAP activation37, and YAP regulates actin remodelling through the Rho GTPase-activating protein38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we found that YAP induces the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors Ect2 and Fgd3 in a manner dependent on an additional signal from LSECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, F-actin formation and YAP activation regulate each other through a feedback mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cultured MadinDarby canine kidney epithelial cells overexpressing YAP (5SA) are removed by apical extrusion when surrounded by normal MadinDarby canine kidney cells39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This apical extrusion in vitro corresponds to the elimination of YAP (5SA) hepatocytes in vivo observed here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in vivo, hepatocyte elimination requires not only YAP activation but also liver injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recently, Su et al.40 reported interesting findings that YAP activation is insufficient to promote cellular proliferation in normal livers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They found YAP-expressing hepatocytes proliferate specifically in the presence of hepatocyte damage or inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, we found a novel cell response whereby YAP-expressing hepatocytes migrate into sinusoids on both hepatocyte and LSEC injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicated that YAP-expressing hepatocytes have altered cellular dynamics depending on the status of LSECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In mice, impairment of the Hippo pathway or activation of YAP in intact hepatocytes leads to their proliferation and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma (Supplementary Fig 11)12,13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In humans, YAP activation is observed in cases of liver fibrosis and/or liver cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our study has shown that YAP activation specifically in damaged hepatocytes triggers their elimination in normal liver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Hippo pathway is constitutively activated and rapidly inactivates YAP by phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, when the Hippo pathway is inactivated by stress, YAP immediately becomes unphosphorylated, translocates into the nucleus and induces target gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on this, it is considered that YAP plays a role in an emergency stress response to maintain tissue homeostasis due to the elimination of injured cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings demonstrate the complexity of cell fate determination mechanisms in vivo, and highlight a new role for YAP in tissue dynamics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
