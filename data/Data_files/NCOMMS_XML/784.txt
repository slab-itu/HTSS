Enzyme I facilitates reverse flux from pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate in Escherichia coli  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate-carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) consists of cascading phosphotransferases that couple the simultaneous import and phosphorylation of a variety of sugars to the glycolytic conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the primary route of glucose uptake in E. coli, the PTS plays a key role in regulating central carbon metabolism and carbon catabolite repression, and is a frequent target of metabolic engineering interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that Enzyme I, the terminal phosphotransferase responsible for the conversion of PEP to pyruvate, is responsible for a significant in vivo flux in the reverse direction (pyruvate to PEP) during both gluconeogenic and glycolytic growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use 13C alanine tracers to quantify this back-flux in single and double knockouts of genes relating to PEP synthetase and PTS components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings are relevant to metabolic engineering design and add to our understanding of gene-reaction connectivity in E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  coli.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The phosphoenolpyruvate-carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) is used by many bacteria and some archaea for the uptake and phosphorylation of sugar substrates1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is the main mechanism of glucose uptake and utilization in the model organism Escherichia coli, where it also has an important role in carbon catabolite repression and regulating central carbon metabolism1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PTS consists of four proteins carrying out successive phosphotransferase reactions, coupling glucose transport and phosphorylation to the lower glycolytic reaction of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate (PYR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allows for the coupled regulation of substrate uptake and glycolytic flux, as the PEP/PYR ratio has been shown to act as part of a flux sensor4,5 and controller of phosphofructokinase (encoded by pfkA) activity via allosteric inhibition by PEP6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to its central metabolic function and complex regulatory role, the PTS is a frequent target of metabolic engineering interventions7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although individual steps of the PTS are known to be reversible1,3,11, current understanding allows only for a net forward flux during the uptake of a PTS sugar (for example, glucose).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the conversion from PEP to PYR, which is also facilitated by pyruvate kinases (encoded by pykA and pykF in E. coli), is often assumed to be a committed step in lower glycolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assumption has practical implications, for example in the analysis of stable isotope labelling data through 13C metabolic flux analysis and in flux balance analysis studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reverse reaction, PYR to PEP, is carried out by the gluconeogenic enzyme PEP synthetase (PpsA, encoded by ppsA in E. coli).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This enzyme is minimally expressed during growth on glycolytic substrates12, as significant activity would cause a wasteful futile cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, PpsA is actively expressed under gluconeogenic conditions via transcriptional regulation by Cra13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this work, we show that Enzyme I (EI), the terminal phosphotransferase in the PTS responsible for the conversion of PEP to PYR, is responsible for a significant in vivo flux in the reverse direction (that is, PYR to PEP) during both gluconeogenic and glycolytic growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use knockout strains and 13C alanine tracer experiments to directly quantify this reverse flux and determine genereaction relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that PpsA and EI are able to interchangeably and exclusively support the major gluconeogenic flux from PYR to PEP during growth on acetate and pyruvate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar experiments under growth on glycolytic substrates glucose and xylose demonstrate that this reverse flux is mainly attributable to EI, indicating an unexpected role for this enzyme in the context of central carbon metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we show that this reverse flux is modulated by genetic perturbation of other PTS components.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Enzyme I supports a significant gluconeogenic flux', 'There are two possible gluconeogenic routes for acetate metabolism (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acetate enters central carbon metabolism as acetyl-CoA (AcCoA) and can either be metabolized to PEP via PEP carboxykinase (Pck; shown in green in Fig 1a) or via malic enzyme (MaeAB) followed by conversion of PYR to PEP (shown in purple).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As discussed above, this latter reaction is known to be carried out under gluconeogenic conditions by PEP synthetase (PpsA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Quantification of alternative routes of PEP generation during growth on acetate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic showing two routes of PEP synthesis during growth on acetate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After malate is produced via glyoxylate shunt, malic enzyme (maeAB) can convert malate to PYR, from which PEP can be formed by the activity of ppsA or ptsI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, pck can convert oxaloacetate (OAC) to PEP directly.

knockout strain; however, the flux is completely eliminated in the double knockout, indicating dual responsibility of ppsA and ptsI for the conversion of PYR to PEP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data presented in

introduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The error presented in g reflects the propagation of GC-MS measurement error through the calculation.Full size image', 'To resolve the relative contribution of these two gluconeogenic routes, a tracer experiment using 1-13Calanine was applied (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tracer was added during growth on excess acetate (growth rates shown in Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alanine equilibrates with intracellular PYR (Fig 1f), which results in a PYR pool (observed via valine labelling) that is a mixture of unlabelled PYR (M0) produced from unlabelled sources in central carbon metabolism, and 1-13CPYR (M1) produced from the tracer (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As oxaloacetate (OAC, observed via aspartate) is almost entirely unlabelled (Fig 1d; the labelled C-1 of PYR is lost in the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction before entering the TCA cycle), the relative contribution of each route to PEP production (as measured by phenylalanine labelling, Fig 1e) is easily calculated (Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the wild type, a significant amount (60%) of PEP was generated from PYR (Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that PpsA was responsible for this flux, the tracer experiment was repeated with a ppsA knockout strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, the contribution of PYR to PEP (65%) was similar to the wild type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following a database search for enzymes able to interconvert PYR and PEP14, we hypothesized that Enzyme I (EI, encoded by the gene ptsI) may be involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EI is known to react reversibly15, but is not known to have a role in gluconeogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the knockout strain ptsI, the contribution of PYR to PEP (65%) was still similarly high to the wild-type and ppsA strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether any other enzymes were involved with this flux, a double knockout, ppsAptsI, was constructed and the tracer experiment was repeated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this double knockout, PEP labelling was entirely eliminated, indicating that the flux from PYR to PEP was zero (Fig 1e,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that PpsA and EI interchangeably and exclusively support the large gluconeogenic flux from PYR to PEP observed in the wild type during growth on acetate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result was also observed during growth on pyruvate (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With pyruvate, the WT, ppsA and ptsI strains grew similarly well (0.25 h1), while ppsAptsI was unable to grow (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the three viable strains, nearly 100% of PEP was generated directly from PYR (Supplementary Fig 1b), indicating that alternative routes via the glyoxylate shunt and PCK or MAE reactions were not utilized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unaffected growth rates and PYR to PEP fluxes in both ppsA and ptsI during growth on acetate and pyruvate reveal a high degree of flexibility in the system, which requires either rapid transcriptional compensation or large excess capacity for each enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A significant back-flux is measured during growth on glucose', 'Given the surprising activity of EI under gluconeogenic growth conditions, we next sought to determine whether there was any measureable flux from PYR to PEP during growth on glucose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This flux was expected to be minimal or nonexistent, as this reaction is traditionally understood to have a large forward thermodynamic driving force, and gluconeogenic flux via PpsA would create a futile cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glucose is a PTS sugar, meaning that during its consumption EI actively participates in the conversion of PEP to PYR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimental approach was modified slightly from the acetate and pyruvate cases by using U-13Calanine as tracer instead of 1-13Calanine (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, PYR labelling was observed via valine labelling, OAC via aspartate, and PEP labelling via phenylalanine labelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contributions to PEP from OAC and PYR were distinguishable due to M1 labelling in OAC, generated from scrambling in the TCA cycle (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During growth on glucose, the wild type was determined to have a statistically significant back-flux through which 10% of PEP was generated from PYR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When ppsA strain was analysed, it was found to have the same back-flux as the wild type (Fig 2g), a result consistent with the reports of minimal PpsA expression during growth on glucose12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the dual contribution of PpsA and EI to gluconeogenic flux under growth on acetate and pyruvate, it was suspected that EI may also be responsible for this back-flux on glucose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: During growth on glucose there is

the EI mutant (ptsI) is known to grow minimally on glucose, and only after a long lag phase10,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After pre-growth on LB medium and transferring to minimal medium with glucose, little or no growth was observed over 60 h (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have found that growth on glucose can be facilitated by the induction of the gal operon, natively used for galactose transport and metabolism7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon induction, the GalP proton-symport transporter is able to non-specifically transport glucose10,16,17,18, which can be subsequently phosphorylated by glucokinase (glk).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To take advantage of this phenomenon, ptsI and ppsAptsI strains were pre-grown in minimal medium with galactose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon transferring to minimal medium with glucose, growth immediately commenced, albeit at a relatively slow growth rate (0.1 h1; Fig 2b, Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of PTS transport was confirmed by the lack of growth under the same conditions of a ptsIglk double knockout strain (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In both the ptsI and ppsAptsI strains first pre-grown in this way, a significant amount of PEP labelling was observed (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ptsI, 13% of PEP came from PYR, indicating significant PpsA activity (Fig 2g), which is likely a result of active expression of ppsA in the altered regulatory state of this strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the ppsAptsI strain, almost all of the PEP labelling was generated from OAC via the PCK reaction (note the significant M1 labelling in Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, only 2.4% of PEP was generated from PYR, demonstrating again responsibility of EI and PpsA for this flux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is important to note that in these experiments WT and ppsA strains take up glucose via the PTS system, while ptsI and ppsAptsI strains are using non-PTS transporters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To get a more direct comparison of these four strains during glycolytic growth, the non-PTS sugar xylose was chosen for subsequent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Enzyme I accounts for back-flux during growth on xylose',

into the cell via an ABC transporter (xylGHF) or a proton symporter (xylE)19 (Fig 3a), which renders EI non-essential for growth (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During growth on xylose, the back-flux observed in the wild type was similar to that observed during growth on glucose, with 11% of PEP formed from PYR (Fig 3g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once again, this flux was not significantly reduced in the ppsA strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this flux was almost completely eliminated in the ptsI and ppsAptsI strains (Fig 3g), providing strong evidence that EI was exclusively responsible for the conversion of PYR to PEP under these conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, during growth on xylose, PpsA was not active as may be expected under normal glycolytic growth conditions12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

system could conceivably result in expression of gluconeogenic genes, for example, through the activation of the global regulator Cra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To help to assign responsibility for the increased back-flux in these strains, several double knockouts of ptsG, crr, ppsA and ptsI were constructed (Fig 4b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strain ptsGppsA had a significant reduction in back-flux, down to 10% from 21% in the single knockout during growth on glucose (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus the excess back-flux in ptsG, relative to the wild-type, was attributable to PpsA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

analysis of the interactions of PTS component perturbations with the back-flux activity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The results presented here show that Enzyme I facilitates reverse flux from PYR to PEP in E. coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This function is active both under conditions in which the PTS is the primary means of transporting substrate (growth on glucose) and is not (growth on acetate, pyruvate or xylose).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knowledge of this genereaction relationship will improve our understanding and annotation of E. coli central carbon metabolism, which is of central importance in metabolic modelling and engineering efforts such as 13C metabolic flux analysis23 and the development of production strains7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This metabolic activity also raises biological questions about the PTS, its regulation and whether there are additional unannotated connectivities in the network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, are there other kinases that interact with HPr or EI to provide the phosphoryl groups needed to sustain this large flux from PYR to PEP?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the gluconeogenic conditions studied here, there is clearly an unknown phosphate donor that allows EI to drive a large net flux from PYR to PEP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the glycolytic conditions, it is less clear whether the observed labelling is a result of simple reversibility in the EI/HPr system, or whether there is another donor specifically responsible for the PYR to PEP flux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large increase in the back-flux in crr, along with its elimination in ptsH during growth on glucose, is consistent with a model in which HPr is the primary or sole phosphotransferase partner of EI, and the crr mutation perturbs the equilibria of the PTS chain as the less abundant or efficient EIIMan is substituted for EIIGlc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would cause the phosphorylated form of HPr to accumulate, driving the partial reversal of the EI and PEP/PYR reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that this also occurs during growth on xylose is surprising, and indicates either a robust dynamic equilibrium in the PTS system even when not being actively used or the activity of other unknown factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The complexity of the enzymatic and regulatory interactions in the PTS system require caution when interpreting these results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that EI could phosphorylate or activate another, yet unknown enzyme which phosphorylates PYR, or that the altered phosphorylation states of PTS components in the mutant strains studied result in the activation of such an enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, PEIIAGlc activates adenylate cyclase, generating cAMP that activates the global regulator Crp3, which controls transcription of over 100 genes24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other regulatory functions spanning from carbon and nitrogen metabolism to chemotaxis are directly influenced by the phosphorylation state of PTS components1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, we were able to deconvolute the role of PpsA, which was active in some knockout strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further work is needed to clarify the network, including potential candidates implicated in this work (for example, a phosphotransferase donor during gluconeogenic growth) as well as to rule out the presence of any more unknown intermediary enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The reversibility of the PEP to PYR step in glycolysis is also surprising in the global sense, particularly in the context of textbook understanding of this reaction as a committed step with a large Gibbs free energy drop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the results presented here are consistent with a recent study that estimated in vivo G values in central carbon metabolism using measured metabolite concentrations and observed cellular G values25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reaction, the estimated G was significantly lower than historically assumed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar labelling studies to those presented here demonstrated the reversibility of pyruvate kinase in human iBMK cells25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results are cause for reconsideration of our understanding of the thermodynamics, control, and engineering targets of central carbon metabolism.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
