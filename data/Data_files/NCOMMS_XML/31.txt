A predictive structural model for bulk metallic glasses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Great progress has been made in understanding the atomic structure of metallic glasses, but there is still no clear connection between atomic structure and glass-forming ability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we give new insights into perhaps the most important question in the field of amorphous metals: how can glass-forming ability be predicted from atomic structure?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We give a new approach to modelling metallic glass atomic structures by solving three long-standing problems: we discover a new family of structural defects that discourage glass formation; we impose efficient local packing around all atoms simultaneously; and we enforce structural self-consistency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fewer than a dozen binary structures satisfy these constraints, but extra degrees of freedom in structures with three or more different atom sizes significantly expand the number of relatively stable, bulk metallic glasses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present work gives a new approach towards achieving the long-sought goal of a predictive capability for bulk metallic glasses.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'From the moment metallic glasses were discovered in 1960 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1), questions arose about their atomic structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dense random packing (DRP) model was introduced independently to describe the structure of monatomic liquids2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The metallic glass community adopted the DRP model, even though it consisted of single-sized atoms and metallic glasses always had atoms of different sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Attempts to put smaller atoms in the natural gaps of the DRP model5,6 were abandoned since the gaps were too small and too few to agree with metallic glasses7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a dramatic break from the DRP model, the stereo-chemically defined (SCD) model used efficiently packed, solute-centred clusters with total coordination of 9 as structural building blocks for metal-metalloid glasses8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model included atoms of unequal size and gave a physical basis for chemical short-range order (SRO) known to exist in metallic glasses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it could not explain the medium-range order (MRO) found soon after the SCD model was introduced9, there was never a satisfying description of how efficiently packed clusters were arranged to avoid packing frustration10, and it could not explain the full range of atom sizes and concentrations that produced metallic glasses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies clearly showed that metallic glass structures were, indeed, efficiently packed11,12,13,14, but none were able to explain how glass structures accomplished this feat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reviews of the first 30 years of metallic glass structural modelling are available15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Thus, 40 years after their discovery1, three seminal questions for metallic glasses remained: what is their atomic structure; how does structure influence glass-forming ability (GFA); and what chemical interactions are needed for good GFA?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Great strides have been made in the past 10 years in resolving the first question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By extending ideas from the SCD model, a new model that uses efficiently packed solute-centred atom clusters as structural building blocks has been established18,19, and quantitative predictions of SRO20, MRO21 and density22 have validated and refined this efficient cluster-packing (ECP) model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model gives new ways to interrogate atomic simulations19, opens new ways to analyse experimental data23 and has inspired new experimental techniques24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bulk metallic glasses (BMGs, glasses with the smallest amorphous dimension 1 mm) were first discovered nearly 25 years ago25,26, but finding new BMGs still requires tedious trial-and-error methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the ECP model has inspired the discovery of new BMGs without full recourse to empiricism27,28,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Efficient local atomic packing around the minority (solute) atoms and a preference for bonds between unlike atoms gives the physical motivation for structure-forming clusters16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Efficient packing is achieved for specific radius ratios between solute and solvent atoms, , that give solute-lean clusters with a central solute atom surrounded by Z solvent atoms31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most stable glasses are typically solute rich, where the solute atom first shell contains both solute and solvent atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ECP model gives a good account of both solute-lean and solute-rich structures32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional details of this model are given in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In spite of this progress, current structural models are not predictive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ECP model describes the structure once a glass is formed, but it cannot predict which structures will have good GFA (defined here as the maximum fully amorphous thickness or diameter produced by quenching from the liquid), which will form marginal glasses, and which will not produce glasses at all.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Important questions that may give insights into GFA remain unanswered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the dozen  values that give efficient local atomic packing (9Z20), there is no explanation why five values are strongly preferred, giving all of the most stable binary glasses32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even more troubling, the basis for preferred radius ratios that underpins the ECP model seems to disappear in solute-rich glasses, where efficient filling of the first coordination shell can be achieved at any radius ratio by adjusting the constitution of the first shell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structural features that are essential for metallic glasses to compete with crystalline phases thus remain a mystery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we solve three persistent problems to give new insights into this seminal question: we identify a new family of structural defects that discourage metallic glass formation; we learn how to enforce efficient packing around every atom in the glass simultaneously; and we determine the relative atom sizes and concentrations and the distinct clusters that they enable for self-consistent compositions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These ideas are consistent with earlier work on the ECP model, and solution of these problems emphasizes atomic structures that are solute-rich (have sufficiently high concentrations so that cluster first shells must contain all of the atom species present) or where the smaller atoms are the majority species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such structures represent a large number of BMGs, and their inclusion was not always clear in earlier developments of the ECP model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present work thus gives a more predictive, robust and complete description of metallic glass atomic structures.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Glass suppression via super-substitutional atomic defects', 'To predict which alloys will form glasses, we must first understand why some alloys do not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consider binary systems of A and B atoms with radii rA less_than rB and A atom fraction fA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atom size-concentration space is bounded by 0fA1 and radius ratios 0RA/B1, where RA/B=rA/rB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metallic glasses are generally limited to 0.6RA/B1 due to the radii of metallic elements32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glasses with fA greater than 0.6 account for 40% of atom size-composition space but fewer than 20% of

#@NEW_LINE#@#  Glasses can form above fA, min, but they are discouraged between fA, min and the higher solute fraction, fcrit, that is needed for glasses to compete more effectively with crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solute atoms produce local elastic strains in crystal structures that compete with the glass, and a glass can form when the volume strain throughout the competing crystal reaches a critical value, crit (refs 33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solutes with large local strains can be far apart (have low fcrit), while solutes with smaller strains must have higher concentrations to reach crit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnitude of elastic strains depends on the type of defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Substitutional defects dominate when RA/B greater than 0.81 and A atoms are solutes (left-hand

as RA/B decreases, reaches a minimum near RA/B=0.81, then increases with further reduction in RA/B (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For B-atom solutes (right-hand side of Fig 1a), earlier approaches only considered substitutional defects where a solute replaced a single solvent atom33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gives fcrit values that decrease continuously as RA/B decreases (fcrit=1fA when B is the solute), and a large portion of the sparsely populated size-composition space for fA greater than 0.6 remained unexplained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we show that large solutes may replace more than one solvent atom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These super-substitutional defects (see Methods) have lower strainsand higher fcrit valuesthan single substitutional defects near the radius ratios where these defects form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five super-substitutional fcrit peaks now discourage most size-composition combinations on the right-hand side of Fig 1a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This new family of atomic defects explains for the first time why the large portion of atom size-composition space at fA greater than 0.6 produces relatively few metallic glasses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Simultaneous efficient packing in binary metallic glasses', 'We now turn our attention from excluded and discouraged glasses to predicting those that are most likely to form metallic glasses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Packing efficiency has long been considered important12,14,35 and local packing efficiency around solute atoms is the basis for the ECP model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concept that packing may be efficient around both solute and solvent atoms36 was not included in the ECP model earlier due to several problems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The packing efficiency bounds (±10%) were too broad to be meaningful, validation was given for only a small number of marginal glasses, and the earlier work did not give a physical model proving that efficient packing could be achieved around all atoms simultaneously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Broad statements have suggested that local packing is efficient around solute and solvent atoms37, but this remains an unproven concept that still requires a compelling physical model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

of the most stable binary BMGs (Pd100xSix, 18x20, Cu64Zr36 and Cu65Hf35) are nearly coincident with two such intersections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there is no compelling correlation between these intersections and the full set of binary BMGs (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below we show that such a convergence can be achieved in some (but not all) binary systems, but at different atom sizes and

occur19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, the number of occupied  and  sites (structural sites between an octahedron and a tetrahedron of clusters, respectively21) in a structure may vary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

BMGs fall between these S-points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shows that glasses can form between S-points that have the same RA/B values and are compositionally close to each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GFA of such glasses may depend on the compositional distance from the bounding S-points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, relatively stable glasses form between  less_than 10,14 greater than A and  less_than 10,15 greater than B S-points in the range 0.25fA0.40 (Fig 1), but they do not form BMGs because the composition distance between the bounding S-points is large.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The radius ratio of CuZr and CuHf glasses (RA/B=0.797) is very close to the radius ratio of these S-points, and the widest composition range allowed by the crit criteria also occurs near RA/B=0.80.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these

observed binary glasses is good.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No glasses occur in excluded regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glasses discouraged by atomic defects in competing crystals (yellow regions of Fig 1) are relatively few, generally have one efficiently packed cluster (Fig 1a) and are always marginal glasses (amorphous thickness, ta less_than 1 mm with a difference between crystallization and glass transition temperatures, Tx0 K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S-points are uncommon, consistent with the restricted number of BMGs and near-BMGs (ta less_than 1 mm but Tx10 K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each S-point has BMGs or near-BMGs (or both) nearby and all BMGs and near-BMGs are close to S-points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A most favoured S-point ( less_than 10,14 greater than A) gives the only exceptional binary BMG

an exceptional BMG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results in Table 1 for PA=PB=100% are not substantially changed by varying PA and PB within ±1%, but agreement degrades outside these bounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

spheres is a much simpler three-dimensional approach to reduce frustration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the gaps in an icosahedron disappear when the central sphere has a radius that is 0.9022 that of the surrounding spheres, eliminating packing frustration around the central sphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structures built from such efficiently packed clusters are more efficiently packed than equal-sized spheres but remain frustrated, since packing around the first shell atoms is still inefficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This frustration is apparent by the gaps between clusterscalled  and  sites in the ECP model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In principle, packing frustration can be further reduced by filling  and  sites, but these sites are typically smaller than metallic atoms so that filling these sites pushes the surrounding clusters apart and actually decreases global packing efficiency22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, unequal spheres can reduce packing frustration relative to systems of equal-sized spheres, but most atoms remain inefficiently packed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This example uses iscosahedrathe same is true for structures of efficiently packed clusters with different total coordination numbers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we further reduce packing frustration and increase global packing efficiency by establishing the specific conditions for efficient packing around all atoms simultaneously in systems of unequal spheres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simply stated, if every atom is efficiently packed locally, then the structure may be more efficiently packed globally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This becomes apparent by realizing that atoms in the first shell of one efficiently packed cluster are the centres for other efficiently packed clusters (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simultaneous efficient packing and self-consistency are achieved only on average throughout the structure, since some variability in actual partial coordination numbers, and hence in local packing efficiency, is expected due to kinetic constraints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using atomic volumes and measured densities, global packing fractions above 0.70 and as high as 0.76 are typical for the most stable binary metallic glasses22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The face-centred cubic (fcc) cluster-packing scheme of the ECP model is still an essential feature, since it gives the medium-range atomic order observed in metallic

relative atom sizes combine with the glass composition and partial coordination numbers to give efficient local packing around all three atom species simultaneously.Full size image', 'Another advance is a description of the origin and impact of compositional frustration in metallic glasses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compositional frustration cannot be avoided in binary glasses due to the limited degrees of freedom, and structures that minimize this frustration give the best binary glasses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extra degrees of freedom in structures with three or more different atom sizes overcome this limitation, so that the composition around all atom types can simultaneously match the bulk composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GFA of ternary and higher order glasses is consequently improved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While compositional frustration is not required in complex glasses, it may nevertheless exist due to kinetic constraints from quenching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The present work introduces new ways to think of metallic glass structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ECP model has the simple view that an atom occupies either a solute site at a cluster centre (,  or ) or a solvent site in the cluster first shell ().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we fundamentally change this simple description by showing that an atom satisfies requirements for both of these sites at the same time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, an atom that is the centre of one cluster is also in the first shell of other atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this seems self-evident, none of the earlier structural models were able to formalize this dual identity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These ideas are illustrated in Fig 4 for the Al25La55Ni20 BMG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three constituent clusters are all inter-connected and have partial coordination numbers that combine with the relative atom sizes to give efficient local atomic packing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not only are the partial coordination numbers self-consistent, but their arrangements are also self-consistent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is seen by careful inspection of Fig 4, which shows that any atom site common to two clusters is occupied by the same atom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 4 also illustrates the surprising result that the preferred SRO around each atom type (reflected by partial coordination numbers and cluster composition) matches the bulk composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is unusual, since strong SRO is usually associated with chemical heterogeneity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the local solute concentrations of metalloid-centred clusters in metal-metalloid glasses are typically half the bulk concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that strong SRO is achieved with essentially no local chemical heterogeneity in ternary and more complex glasses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 4 illustrates the elegant inter-connections that allow structures to achieve this challenging set of conditions simultaneously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Structure, kinetics

a direct relationship between structural ordering and kinetic fragilities in metallic glasses47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This connection between atom sizes and kinetics supports the foresight of Cahn48, a

chemically distinct atoms can have significantly different GFA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, BMGs form in the ZrCu system but not in ZrNi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since Cu and Ni atoms are essentially the same size, this GFA difference is attributed to a chemical effect49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full predictive power of the present model has therefore not yet been achieved, since it predicts the same GFA

form BMGs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify new structural defects that significantly limit binary BMGs but have a less dramatic effect in more complex glasses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that BMGs require efficient local packing around all atom species and show how this is accomplished.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural self-consistency gives constraints that are met by only a limited set of binary glass structures, but additional degrees of freedom in higher order systems dramatically expand the number of BMGs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present model thus gives significant progress towards the long-sought goal of a predictive capability for the most stable metallic glasses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These conditions are necessary but not sufficient and some feature is missingthis is suggested to be a chemical contribution that forms the remaining seminal question in metallic glass stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  And while some of the connections between structure, free volume, fragility, viscosity and GFA are emerging, a more quantitative connection between these features is still desired.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
