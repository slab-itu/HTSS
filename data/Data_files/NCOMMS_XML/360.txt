Symmetric spike timing-dependent plasticity at CA3CA3 synapses optimizes storage and recall in autoassociative networks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'CA3CA3 recurrent excitatory synapses are thought to play a key role in memory storage and pattern completion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether the plasticity properties of these synapses are consistent with their proposed network functions remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we examine the properties of spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) at CA3CA3 synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low-frequency pairing of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and action potentials (APs) induces long-term potentiation (LTP), independent of temporal order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The STDP curve is symmetric and broad (half-width 150 ms).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these STDP induction properties, APEPSP sequences lead to supralinear summation of spine Ca2+ transients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, afterdepolarizations (ADPs) following APs efficiently propagate into dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons, and EPSPs summate with dendritic ADPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In autoassociative network models, storage and recall are more robust with symmetric than with asymmetric STDP rules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a specialized STDP induction rule allows reliable storage and recall of information in the hippocampal CA3 network.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The hippocampal CA3 region plays a critical role in the storage, recall and processing of spatial and non-spatial information in the brain1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A hallmark property of the CA3 network is that recall can be triggered by partial or degraded cues, a phenomenon referred to as autoassociative recall or pattern completion2,3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several lines of evidence suggest that CA3CA3 recurrent synapses are the main subcellular correlates of pattern completion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the CA3CA3 synaptic system is the most extensive synaptic system in the entire brain7, generating a connectivity matrix with potentially huge storage capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, CA3CA3 synapses show robust long-term plasticity, rendering them suitable for sustained information storage8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, selective genetic deletion of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors in CA3 pyramidal neurons impairs pattern completion, presumably by abolishing plasticity at CA3CA3 synapses11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, network models endowed with recurrent connectivity and Hebbian synaptic plasticity can reproduce storage, recall and pattern completion2,3,4,5,6,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is the primary candidate mechanism for the storage of information in autoassociative networks4,6,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conventional STDP, prepostsynaptic pairing induces long-term potentiation (LTP), whereas pairing in reverse order triggers long-term depression (LTD)15,16,17,18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is, however, unclear whether LTP with such induction rules would support storage and autoassociative recall of information in CA3 pyramidal neuron ensembles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent recordings from dendrites and axons of CA3 pyramidal neurons revealed that dendritic backpropagation of the action potential (AP) over a short distance is faster than axonal forward propagation over a longer distance21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, synchronous activity of CA3 pyramidal neurons (for example, during network oscillations or mossy fibre activation) is expected to generate a postpresynaptic activity sequence, which would induce LTD, rather than LTP15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, CA3CA3 synapses are often located on CA3 pyramidal cell dendrites at a considerable distance from the soma (100200 m)7,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  STDP may be biased towards LTD under these conditions20,24,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, whether the plasticity properties of CA3CA3 synapses are consistent with their proposed network functions remains unresolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although associative plasticity has been demonstrated in CA3 pyramidal neurons in organotypic slice culture9,10, the plasticity properties in intact neuronal preparations have not been examined yet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore experimentally determined the STDP induction rules at CA3CA3 recurrent synapses in acute slices from 21- to 29-day-old rats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, pairing of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and APs induced LTP, independent of temporal order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these novel STDP induction properties, both prepostsynaptic and postpresynaptic sequences led to efficient summation of spine Ca2+ transients and dendritic depolarizations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we incorporated different STDP induction rules into autoassociative network models, recall was substantially more robust in models with the novel induction rule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a specific LTP induction rule at CA3CA3 synapses facilitates information storage and recall in the hippocampal CA3 network.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A novel STDP induction rule at CA3CA3 recurrent synapses', 'To examine whether the plasticity properties of CA3CA3 recurrent synapses are consistent with their proposed function in storage and recall, we studied synaptic plasticity of these synapses in acute hippocampal slices from mature (21- to 29-day-old) rats (Fig 1a; Supplementary Fig 1; Methods and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presynaptic axons were stimulated in the stratum oriens, whereas compound EPSPs were recorded in CA3 pyramidal cells in the whole-cell current-clamp recording configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Noncanonical STDP induction rules at CA3CA3 recurrent synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Neurolucida reconstruction of a representative CA3 pyramidal neuron filled with biocytin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inset shows AP phenotype (1-s current pulse, 630 pA); recording and stimulation pipettes are indicated schematically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blue, soma and dendrites; red, axon; sp, stratum pyramidale; so, stratum oriens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b,c) Prepostsynaptic pairing induces LTP at CA3CA3 recurrent synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plot of compound EPSP peak amplitude against experimental time before and after prepostsynaptic pairing (t=+10 ms; vertical grey bars).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-cell data (b) and mean data (c; 9 cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d,e) Postpresynaptic pairing also induces LTP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar plot as in b, c, but for postpresynaptic pairing (with t=10 ms).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-cell data (d) and mean data (e; 17 cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insets in b and d show the average of 60 evoked EPSPs before (black) and 2030 min after induction (grey).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar in b also applies in d.

Fig 1b,c and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next compared the extent of pairing-induced LTP with LTP induced by high-frequency stimulation (HFS), a paradigm expected to maximally potentiate synapses8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple rounds of HFS stimulation (four 100-Hz trains of 1-s duration, repeated every 10 s) induced a synaptic potentiation of 196.8±18.4% of control under identical conditions (14 cells, P=0.0002; Supplementary Fig 2 and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the amount of pairing-induced LTP was comparable to that of HFS-induced LTP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LTP was associative, since neither EPSPs nor postsynaptic APs induced LTP when presented in isolation (isolated presynaptic stimulation: 102.8±2.9%, 6 cells, P=0.31; isolated postsynaptic stimulation: 95.7±4.4%; 6 cells, P=0.38; Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, CA3CA3 recurrent synapses exhibited an associative form of LTP, with an extent of potentiation comparable to that of the most efficient LTP induction paradigms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Next, we tested pairing protocols with an inverse (that is, postpresynaptic) sequence (Fig 1d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to our expectations, such a pairing protocol led to an increase of EPSP amplitude, to 159.3±11.5% of the control value (17 cells, P=0.00002; Fig 1d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we compared the mechanisms of STDP induction for LTP induced by prepostsynaptic versus postpresynaptic sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pairing-induced LTP was abolished by bath application of the NMDA receptor antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (D-AP5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of 20 M D-AP5, the extent of potentiation was 101.2±5.2% for the prepostsynaptic sequence (7 cells, P=0.03; Fig 1f) and 100.5±4.2 % for the postpresynaptic sequence (6 cells, P=0.001; Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, NMDA receptor activation was necessary for LTP induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, pairing-induced LTP was abolished by 20 min prior intracellular loading with the Ca2+ chelator ethylene glycol-bis(2-aminoethylether)-N,N,N,N-tetraacetic acid (EGTA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of 20 mM EGTA in the pipette solution, the extent of potentiation was 101.8±7.2% for the prepostsynaptic sequence (8 cells, P=0.02; Fig 1f) and 103.0±9.0% with the postpresynaptic sequence (6 cells, P=0.01; Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a rise in postsynaptic Ca2+ concentration was necessary for LTP induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, pairing-induced LTP was inhibited by bath application of the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nimodipine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of 10 M nimodipine, the extent of potentiation was 91.1±6.0% for the prepostsynaptic sequence (5 cells, P=0.04; Fig 1f) and 105.0±6.1% for the postpresynaptic sequence (5 cells, P=0.01; Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, activation of NMDA receptors and L-type Ca2+ channels was necessary for LTP induction by both prepostsynaptic and postpresynaptic pairing (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To further characterize the induction rules of STDP at CA3CA3 cell synapses, we tested pairing protocols with different time intervals between pre- and postsynaptic stimulation (Fig 1h,i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plotting the extent of LTP against pairing time interval t revealed that the STDP induction curve was nearly symmetric and surprisingly broad, with a maximum near t=0 and a half-duration of 142 ms (Fig 1i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained at 22 and 33 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At near-physiological temperature (33 °C), the maximal amount of LTP (202.2±25.3% for t=+10 ms; 6 cells) and the shape of the curve were comparable (half-duration 133 ms; Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, CA3CA3 recurrent synapses exhibited robust STDP with a temporally symmetric and broad induction window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the STDP induction rule at CA3CA3 recurrent synapses was unique, differing from previously reported STDP rules for glutamatergic synapses in a variety of circuits20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Spine Ca2+ summation may explain symmetric LTP induction', 'To test whether the properties of spine Ca2+ transients can explain the noncanonical STDP induction properties, we measured Ca2+ transients in spines of CA3 pyramidal neurons, using the low-affinity Ca2+ indicator dye Fluo-5F (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dendritic spines were located 50200 m from the soma, congruent with the location of CA3CA3 synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ca2+ transients were evoked by either EPSPs following stimulation of nearby CA3 cell axons, or backpropagated APs following somatic current pulses (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control experiments with HFS (5 APs at 100 Hz) revealed that the Ca2+ indicator Fluo-5F was not saturated under our experimental conditions (Supplementary Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synaptic stimulation and backpropagated APs evoked Ca2+ transients with comparable amplitude, but different spatial profiles (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ca2+ transients evoked by synaptic stimulation were larger in the spine than in the adjacent shaft, whereas transients evoked by backpropagated APs showed similar amplitudes in the two locations (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ca2+ transients evoked by synaptic stimulation were enhanced by removal of Mg2+ from the bath solution and blocked by 20 M 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and 20 M D-AP5, suggesting a contribution of NMDA-type glutamate receptors (Supplementary Fig 5c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ca2+ transients evoked by backpropagated APs were completely blocked by 200 M Cd2+ or 10 M nimodipine, indicating that they were generated by Ca2+ inflow through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (Supplementary Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ca2+ transients decayed with a time constant of 136±32 ms for synaptic stimulation and 145±25 ms for single backpropagated APs (9 and 13 cells, respectively), suggesting a broad window for temporal summation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Summation of EPSP- and AP-induced Ca2+ transients in spines of CA3 pyramidal neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Fluorescence image of a CA3 pyramidal neuron loaded with Fluo-5F and Alexa Fluor 594 (maximum projection of stack of 48 1-m confocal sections;

Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, pairing of EPSPs and APs led to a supralinear enhancement of spine Ca2+ transients, potentially contributing to the associative nature of STDP (Fig 1 and Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To relate the summation properties of the Ca2+ transient with the properties of STDP, we measured the amount of summation at different time intervals (Fig 2d,e,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the amplitude of the spine Ca2+ transients was not significantly different between t=+10 ms and t=10 ms (P=0.62;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The present paper identifies a new STDP induction rule at CA3CA3 recurrent synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to previously reported induction rules20, the STDP curve at CA3CA3 synapses was broad and symmetric.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although anti-Hebbian STDP induction rules were previously reported25,31,32,33,34,35,36, none of the prior studies demonstrated a broad and symmetric potentiation curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both blockers of NMDA receptors and L-type Ca2+ channels blocked STDP, showing that two independent Ca2+ sources were required for plasticity induction at these synapses15,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spine Ca2+ transients mediated by NMDA receptors and L-type Ca2+ channels showed temporally symmetric summation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the properties of spine Ca2+ signalling provide a possible mechanistic explanation for the temporally symmetric plasticity rule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Backpropagated dendritic APs are key associative signals in STDP induction38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a prepostsynaptic activity sequence, backpropagated APs are thought to relieve the Mg2+ block of the NMDA receptor40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism may also operate in CA3CA3 synapses, and may be particularly effective, because of active AP backpropagation caused by the high dendritic Na+ channel density in these cells21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But what are the dendritic mechanisms of postpresynaptic pairing?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that the ADP27,28,29, a hallmark of CA3 pyramidal neuron excitability, may play a critical role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two properties of the ADP make it particularly suitable as an associative signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the ADP propagates into dendrites without attenuation, and second, it effectively summates with subsequent EPSPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in CA3 cells postpresynaptic sequences can produce large dendritic depolarizations, which will be particularly effective in both relief of Mg2+ block of NMDA receptors and activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These summation properties appear to be specific for CA3 pyramidal neurons, as in layer 5 neocortical cells APs shunt subsequent EPSPs, rather than boosting their amplitude41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies in CA3 pyramidal neurons in organotypic slice culture demonstrated STDP with asymmetric induction rules9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apparent difference may be caused by developmental factors43, as our results were obtained in relatively mature animals (postnatal day 2129), whereas cultured cells are likely to be less developed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this idea, postpresynaptic pairing induced LTD at CA3CA3 recurrent synapses in acute slices from young animals (R.K.M., unpublished observations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, the difference may be caused by costimulation of neuromodulatory inputs in extracellular stimulation experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent results suggested the involvement of dopamine receptors in the regulation of STDP induction rules44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, postpresynaptic activity sequences induced LTP in the presence of dopamine receptor antagonists (R.K.M., unpublished observations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, postpresynaptic activity sequences induce LTD in Schaffer collateralCA1 pyramidal neuron synapses18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'If STDP induction at CA3CA3 synapses is symmetric, and an LTD component is lacking, how is stability achieved in the network?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several additional regulatory mechanisms may be at work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, homeostatic plasticity at CA3CA3 synapses may counteract saturation in the network45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, homeostatic plasticity at mossy fibre synapses on CA3 pyramidal neurons could play a role47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, LTD has been reported in hippocampal mossy fibreCA3 pyramidal neuron synapses early in development48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether and how such LTD mechanisms can be reactivated in the mature brain remains to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our autoassociative network model shows that the novel STDP rule enhances the computational power of the network, increasing the reliability of pattern completion and the storage capacity2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temporally symmetric STDP rule addresses two issues with previous models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, it solves the problem that synchronous activity in ensembles generates LTD via a postpresynaptic sequence, because the time for dendritic propagation is shorter than that for axonal propagation of the AP21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, it addresses how autoassociative network models can work under conditions of slightly asynchronous activity in CA3 pyramidal neuron ensembles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the broad and temporally symmetric STDP rule could be useful for the reactivation of cell assembly patterns of freely moving animals in open fields50, and for the incorporation of contralateral CA3 pyramidal neurons into bi-hemispheric neuronal assemblies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
