Subnatural-linewidth biphotons from a Doppler-broadened hot atomic vapour cell  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Entangled photon pairs, termed as biphotons, have been the benchmark tool for experimental quantum optics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantum-network protocols based on photonatom interfaces have stimulated a great demand for single photons with bandwidth comparable to or narrower than the atomic natural linewidth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the past decade, laser-cooled atoms have often been used for producing such biphotons, but the apparatus is too large and complicated for engineering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the generation of subnatural-linewidth ( less_than 6 MHz) biphotons from a Doppler-broadened (530 MHz) hot atomic vapour cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use on-resonance spontaneous four-wave mixing in a hot paraffin-coated 87Rb vapour cell at 63 °C to produce biphotons with controllable bandwidth (1.93.2 MHz) and coherence time (4794 ns).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our backward phase-matching scheme with spatially separated optical pumping is the key to suppress uncorrelated photons from resonance fluorescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result may lead towards miniature narrowband biphoton sources.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Biphotons (entangled photon pairs) are the benchmark tools in the field of quantum optics for probing fundamental quantum properties of light quanta such as the wave-particle duality and non-locality1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They have also played an important role in developing advanced technologies in quantum information processing2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantum-network protocols based on efficient photonatom interaction require photons have bandwidth sufficiently narrower than the atomic natural linewidth3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we are interested in generating frequency-anticorrelated biphotons whose sum frequency is fixed and the biphoton bandwidth refers to the spectrum of individual photons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a fast time-resolved detector, narrowband biphotons can be used to generate pure heralded single photons with the bandwidth equal to the biphoton bandwidth5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In earlier days, spontaneous parametric down conversion using nonlinear crystals6,7 and four-wave mixing in optical fibres8 were standard methods for producing biphotons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these biphotons have typically very wide bandwidth ( greater than THz) and short coherence time ( less_than ps), which make them extremely difficult for implementing photonic quantum information processing in an atomic-memory-based quantum network9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To solve this problem, many researches have focused on narrowing down the paired photon bandwidth by putting the nonlinear crystal inside an optical cavity11,12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Subnatural-linewidth biphotons with controllable waveforms have been produced from spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) in cold atoms (10100 K) assisted with electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)15,16,17,18,19 or cavity20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, cold-atom systems require expert knowledge in laser cooling and trapping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A cold-atom apparatus is not only expensive, but also large and complicated in its vacuumopticalelectronicmechanical configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, operating cold atoms for producing paired photons requires a complex timing control with a low duty cycle21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'If a hot atomic vapour cell can be used as an alternative source to produce narrowband biphotons, the system size and operation can be markedly simplified and the cost will be significantly reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the use of hot atomic vapour cell for producing narrowband biphotons has not been as successful as those with cold atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an early demonstration in 2005, Lukin et al.22 generated nonclassical correlated light pulses from a room temperature 87Rb atomic vapour cell with writingreading pulse operation, but these photons are not time-frequency entangled and the photon number in each pulse is barely below the two-photon threshold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, we focus on paired photon generation with time-frequency entanglement in continuous-wave operation mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There have been some attempts in generating biphotons from hot atomic vapour cells, but with coherence time not exceeding 20 ns, corresponding to a bandwidth of  greater than 50 MHz that is much wider than the typical atomic natural linewidths23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we demonstrate generating subnatural-linewidth biphotons using on-resonance SFWM in a hot 87Rb vapour cell assisted with EIT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different from the off-resonance double-Raman scheme26 and diamond energy-level scheme24,25, where the photon bandwidth (500 MHz) is determined by the Doppler-broadening decoherence time (2 ns) of the excited atomic states, the EIT effect can significantly prolong the photon coherence time and narrow down the bandwidth27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when directly applying the EIT-assisted SFWM scheme to a hot vapour cell, there is a serious noise problem: uncorrelated photons generated from resonance Raman scattering of the strong coupling laser field overwhelm the entangled photon pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome this problem, we coat the inner wall of the cell with paraffin to increase the atomic ground-state coherence time and apply an additional strong optical-pumping beam to suppress the on-resonance scattering of the coupling field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optical-pumping beam is spatially separated from the SFWM volume and does not interfere with the biphoton generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This noise reduction together with other optical filtering allows us observing biphotons with a high contrast ratio.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

experimental set-up are described in the Methods section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In presence of two counter-propagating pump (p) and coupling (c) laser beams, backward and phase-matched Stokes (s) and

#@NEW_LINE#@#  These photons have the same central frequency and polarization as the anti-Stokes photons, and cannot be filtered away by the polarization and frequency filters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To clean up the residual atoms in the level |5S1/2, F=2, we apply a strong optical-pumping beam (op) on the transition |5S1/2, F=2|5P3/2, F=1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order not to interfere with the SFWM transitions, the optical-pumping beam is aligned parallel to the Stokesanti-Stokes mode without spatial overlap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The atoms in the level |5S1/2, F=2 are optically pumped to the ground level |5S1/2, F=1, and thus the Raman scattering on the anti-Stokes channel is suppressed, owing to the long ground-state coherence time because of the paraffin coating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1:

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In summary, we demonstrate generation of subnatural-linewidth biphotons from a hot paraffin-coated 87Rb vapour cell using EIT-assisted SFWM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biphoton coherence time, controlled by the coupling laser power, can be as long as 94 ns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding bandwidth of 1.9 MHz is substantially narrower than the natural linewidth 6 MHz of Rb D1/D2 transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be used to generate nearly pure heralded single photons5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exponential waveform with tunable time constant is perfect for interacting with atoms30 and coupling to an optical cavity31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, the heralding efficiency of the photon pairs is 3.1%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is determined by the small optical depth of 1 of the atomic vapour cell, which is limited by the maximally allowed temperature ( less_than 70 °C) of the paraffin coating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we can further increase the cell temperature while maintaining a low spin relaxation rate, we expect to improve the heralding efficiency and generate biphotons with richer waveforms by engineering the spatial profile of the pump beam, as those demonstrated in cold atoms19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The two key elements to make the SFWM narrowband biphoton generation feasible are the paraffin coating and the spatially separated optical pumping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The long ground-state coherence time preserved by the paraffin coating enables the efficient optical pumping, which is spatially separated from the biphoton generation volume, for the flying atoms without interfering the SFWM transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a general state preparation method, the technology demonstrated here can be immediately applied to reduce incoherent photon noise thus improve the fidelity of the Raman-based quantum memory32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future improvements could include improving the quality of optical frequency filtering (etalon FabryPerot cavity, polarization filter, spatial-mode filter) and optimizing the power and spatial profile of the optical pump beam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As compared with the cold-atom experiments33,34, the hot atomic vapour cell configuration is much simpler for operation and maintenance, and it is a continuous biphoton source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our demonstration may lead to miniature narrowband biphoton sources based on atomic vapour cells for practical quantum applications and engineering.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
