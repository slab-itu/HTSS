A tachykinin-like neuroendocrine signalling axis couples central serotonin action and nutrient sensing with peripheral lipid metabolism  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Serotonin, a central neuromodulator with ancient ties to feeding and metabolism, is a major driver of body fat loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, mechanisms by which central serotonin action leads to fat loss remain unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report that the FLP-7 neuropeptide and its cognate receptor, NPR-22, function as the ligand-receptor pair that defines the neuroendocrine axis of serotonergic body fat loss in Caenorhabditis elegans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FLP-7 is secreted as a neuroendocrine peptide in proportion to fluctuations in neural serotonin circuit functions, and its release is regulated from secretory neurons via the nutrient sensor AMPK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FLP-7 acts via the NPR-22/Tachykinin2 receptor in the intestine and drives fat loss via the adipocyte triglyceride lipase ATGL-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, this ligand-receptor pair does not alter other serotonin-dependent behaviours including food intake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For global modulators such as serotonin, the use of distinct neuroendocrine peptides for each output may be one means to achieve phenotypic selectivity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The central nervous system plays a critical role in regulating energy balance and body fat stores, distinct from its effects on feeding behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In recent years, strong evidence across metazoan systems has emerged to show that different brain regions potently control lipid metabolism in peripheral tissues, independently of changes in feeding behaviour1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, discrete neural circuits and neuronal subpopulations regulate body fat metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although for certain central regulators the neural circuits governing peripheral metabolism are now beginning to be understood, identifying neuroendocrine factors that selectively govern fat metabolism has remained a long-standing challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the extent to which nutrient sensing by the brain modulates peripheral metabolism via such neuroendocrine factors is poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The ancient central nervous system neuromodulator serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is a valuable paradigm for the study of global regulators of animal physiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In metazoans, 5-HT controls food intake and feeding behaviour, mood, adiposity, locomotion and energy expenditure4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In humans, with respect to the control of energy balance, global serotonergic agonists and antagonists have long been administered to suppress appetite, increase energy expenditure, or both7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However the limited efficacy of these global serotonin-boosting compounds is often accompanied by substantial side effects, and has mitigated their use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, the importance of 5-HT signalling in stimulating fat metabolism across many species suggests that the identification of selective factors that function downstream of central 5-HT to stimulate fat metabolism would be valuable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A body of evidence has revealed a broad framework for the effects of neuronal 5-HT on whole body energy balance by exploiting the tractability of the C. elegans system9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Manipulations of 5-HT levels via exogenous administration or by endogenous control using genetic approaches reveal that, as in mammals, neuronal 5-HT is a potent stimulator of body fat loss and energy expenditure11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the nematode C. elegans, 5-HT is synthesized by the conserved rate-limiting enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH-1) in only a few pairs of neurons, and is not present in the intestine or in other metabolic tissues under normal conditions5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of the TPH-1 enzyme leads to undetectable levels of neuronal 5-HT and a significant increase in body fat reserves accompanied by decreased energy expenditure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional studies reveal that of all the biogenic amine receptors in the genome, a 5-HT-gated chloride channel called MOD-1 is the sole receptor essential for body fat loss1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the intestine, the major metabolic organ for C. elegans and the predominant site for fat metabolism, the rate-limiting enzyme adipocyte triglyceride lipase ATGL-1 is transcriptionally induced by 5-HT signalling and serves to stimulate fat breakdown via hydrolysis of stored triglycerides to fatty acids1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNAi-based screens also revealed that increased 5-HT signalling elicits a cascade of -oxidation enzymes in the intestine that convert fatty acids to energy in the mitochondria11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite its neuronal origins, the metabolic effects of 5-HT occur in the intestine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our previous work, we deciphered the neural circuit for 5-HTergic fat mobilization in C. elegans1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that 5-HT synthesis is required in the ADF chemosensory neurons whereas MOD-1 the critical serotonergic channel is necessary and sufficient in a single pair of neurons called URX, which receive direct synaptic input from the ADF neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we found that octopamine (OA), the invertebrate analogue of adrenaline, provides a permissive cue to maintain 5-HT signalling via regulating tph-1 expression and 5-HT levels in the ADF neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the primary components of the 5-HT pathway: the biosynthetic enzyme and the receptor, reside in the nervous system, and the collective evidence indicates that 5-HTergic regulation of body fat loss occurs indirectly, perhaps via the relay of neuroendocrine factor/s from the nervous system, to the intestine1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has remained a challenge to identify selective neuroendocrine factors that stimulate body fat mobilization downstream of central mediators of energy balance, in any system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pioneering biochemical approaches were used to identify neuropeptide hormones that communicate in endocrine fashion from the mammalian hypothalamus to control the physiology of stature, reproduction and other aspects of whole animal physiology12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these immense advances, biochemical approaches relying on the relative abundance of peptides in the mammalian hypothalamus did not lead to the identification of neuroendocrine hormones that control body weight, and endocrine factors that potently stimulate body fat loss have since remained unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we identify a secreted neuropeptide ligand and its cognate receptor that constitute the core 5-HT neuroendocrine axis and selectively stimulates body fat loss in C. elegans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ligand is secreted in proportion to 5-HT circuit functions and the activity of the nutrient sensor AMPK, in the secretory neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the intestine, activation of the receptor promotes fat loss via induction of the ATGL-1 lipase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The broad conservation of this signalling axis suggests that such approaches are valuable in identifying novel and selective neuroendocrine factors that underlie the central control of body fat metabolism.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Neuropeptide signalling is required for 5-HT-mediated fat loss', 'Our previous work describing the 5-HTergic neural circuit revealed that rather than 5-HT itself, an unknown neuroendocrine factor is released from the nervous system and relayed to metabolic tissues to stimulate body fat loss1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C. elegans intestine is not directly innervated (www.wormatlas.org) and therefore offers a valuable platform to identify neuroendocrine factors that communicate between the nervous system and the metabolic tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diversity of known mechanisms of neuroendocrine signalling across different species prompted us to use a process of elimination followed by a screen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To begin investigating the nature of this neuroendocrine signal, we first measured the extent to which serotonin-mediated fat loss was dependent upon the release of canonical neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, -amino butyric acid and glutamate), versus that of neuropeptidergic signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the nervous system, canonical neurotransmitters are localized to clear synaptic vesicles, which require a protein called UNC-13 (MUNC-13 in mammals) for fusion with the plasma membrane at the synapse15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, neuropeptides and biogenic amine neurotransmitters are localized to dense core vesicles, which require the conserved calcium-dependent activator protein (CAPS) or UNC-31/CAPS in C. elegans17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both unc-13 and unc-31 are broadly expressed in the C. elegans nervous system, and not in other tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, loss of unc-13 function leads to a block in the release of the canonical neurotransmitters, whereas loss of unc-31 blocks the release of neuropeptides and biogenic amines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured the extent to which unc-13 and unc-31 mutants were essential in promoting 5-HT-mediated fat loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With respect to body fat content, vehicle-treated unc-13 mutants resembled wild-type animals; however, unc-31 mutants had 50% greater body fat than either genotype (Fig 1a), suggesting that the contents of dense core vesicles from the nervous system regulate fat stores under basal conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As reported previously1,11, 5HT-treated wild-type animals retained approximately 4050% of the body fat seen in vehicle-treated controls, as did the unc-13 mutants (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, 5-HT-treated unc-31 mutants fully suppressed serotonergic fat loss and retained as much body fat as the vehicle-treated controls (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a UNC-31/CAPS-dependent secretory process is required for the effects of 5-HT on body fat loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Neuropeptide signalling is required for 5-HT-mediated fat loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,c) Vehicle- and 5-HT-treated animals were fixed and stained with oil Red O.

Fig 1b) for suppression of 5-HT-induced fat loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One neuropeptide gene called flp-7 emerged as a robust partial suppressor (Fig 1b,c and Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative to wild-type animals, 5-HT-treated flp-7(ok2625) null mutants retained a significantly greater proportion of body fat (Fig 1c; 45% versus 75%), whereas vehicle-treated flp-7 mutants resembled wild-type animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggested that flp-7 is required for 5-HT-induced fat loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In wild-type animals, constitutive overexpression of flp-7 under its own promoter led to a readily apparent decrease in body fat reserves (Fig 1d), suggesting that its activity promotes body fat loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Physiological properties of FLP-7', 'In examining the metabolic effects of 5-HT in the intestine, we had previously uncovered a role for ATGL-1, a conserved rate-limiting enzyme that converts triglycerides into fatty acids27 that are in turn, utilized for -oxidation and energy production in the mitochondria1,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A reporter line and qPCR experiments had shown that 5-HT treatment induces transcription of atgl-1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we examined whether flp-7 was required for 5-HT-mediated atgl-1 induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  flp-7 mutants show a near-complete suppression of the transcriptional induction of the atgl-1::GFP reporter line in 5-HT-treated animals (Fig 1e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, RNAi-mediated inactivation of atgl-1 abrogated the increased fat loss seen with flp-7 overexpression (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments show that the effects of 5-HT on atgl-1-mediated fat loss require flp-7 signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In C. elegans, in addition to its effects on body fat mobilization, neuronal 5-HT regulates food intake5, reproduction and locomotor changes based on food availability6,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, the 5-HTergic regulation of body fat stores employs a distinct neuronal circuit and regulatory cascade in the intestine1,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address the question of how such selectivity might be achieved, we measured the extent to which flp-7 is required for other phenotypes associated with the food-5-HT signalling axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that loss of the flp-7 gene did not lead to changes in 5-HT-induced food intake (Fig 1g), reproduction (Fig 1h) or the enhanced slowing response, a satiety-like locomotor response to food availability (Fig 1i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that flp-7 mutants have a decreased egg-laying rate relative to wild-type animals (Fig 1h); however, the decreased egg-laying did not correlate with changes in body fat because vehicle-treated flp-7 mutants do not display a body fat phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, flp-7 mutants suppress 5-HT-induced fat loss without suppressing 5-HT-stimulated egg-laying.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus the serotonergic effects on egg-laying and body fat loss are not causally linked by flp-7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, under conditions of serotonergic stimulation, the FLP-7 neuropeptide selectively stimulates body fat loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flp-7 gene encodes peptides that resemble the mammalian tachykinin peptide family exemplified by Substance P (Supplementary Fig 1b,c) and are secreted neuropeptides regulating gut motility29, but have not previously been associated with fat metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that FLP-7 is essential for serotonin-dependent fat loss, and that its overexpression leads to a substantial reduction in body fat stores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The ASI neurosecretory neurons are the site of FLP-7 synthesis', 'A fluorescent transgenic reporter line revealed that flp-7 is expressed in a few pairs of head neurons (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We wanted to determine the identity of the neurons from which FLP-7 expression regulates 5-HT-induced body fat loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A flp-7-rescuing transgene under the control of its own promoter showed vivid expression in a few pairs of head neurons (but not in the intestine, the muscles or the hypodermis) and fully restored 5-HT-induced fat loss in the intestine (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed reproducible flp-7 expression in the ALA and the AVG interneurons and in the ASI sensory neurons (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ALA motor neuron is known to regulate locomotion30 and the AVG neuron is essential for ventral cord development31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the ASI sensory neuron pair regulates whole body physiology during development and is involved in lifespan control via the secretion of regulatory peptides32,33,34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested the sufficiency of flp-7 expression in ASI neurons using two independent promoters, daf-7 and str-3, both of which fully restored 5-HT-induced fat loss observed in flp-7 mutants (Fig 2b), to the same extent as seen in wild-type and flp-7 transgenic animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, RNAi-mediated anti-sense inhibition of the flp-7 gene in the ASI neurons recapitulated the flp-7 mutant phenotype and led to robust suppression of 5-HT-induced fat loss (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, flp-7 expression in ASI neurons is necessary and sufficient to maintain 5-HTergic fat loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: The tachykinin-related neuropeptide FLP-7 functions in the ASI neurons to regulate 5-HT-induced fat loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Fluorescent image of a transgenic animal bearing a polycistronic flp-7::mCherry transgene under the control of the endogenous flp-7 promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  White arrowheads indicate expression in ASI neurons, the open arrowhead indicates expression in ALA and the grey arrowhead indicates expression in AVG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A, anterior;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Here, we present the identification of a secreted neuroendocrine peptide called FLP-7 and its cognate in vivo GPCR NPR-22, the ancestral orthologues of the tachykinin/neurokinin signalling system, as the neuroendocrine signalling axis that connects the 5-HT circuit from the nervous system, to its metabolic actions in the intestine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FLP-7 and NPR-22 function together as a ligand-receptor pair and define a conserved signalling pathway with an unexpected role in fat metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the FLP-7 peptide is secreted from neurons, and acts in the intestine via the tachykinin 2 receptor orthologue NPR-22 to mobilize fat stores (Fig 8b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that FLP-7 is a potent and selective stimulator of body fat loss without altering 5-HT-dependent changes in food intake, locomotion or reproduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our studies presented here uncover a previously undefined neuroendocrine signalling pathway that preferentially stimulates body fat loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that for global neuromodulators of physiology and behaviour such as 5-HT, one mechanism by which phenotypic selectivity is achieved is to deploy distinct neuropeptides for each phenotypic output.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, identification of selective regulators for distinct physiological outputs represents a path forward to uncover novel and potent neuroendocrine regulators of physiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our identification of the ASI sensory neurons as the source of FLP-7 secretion is tantalizing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several lines of evidence indicate a role for these neurons as gatekeepers of communication from the sensory nervous system to the metabolic organs of the body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, these neurons resemble the mammalian hypothalamus-brainstem complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the ASI neurons are known to regulate both lifespan and dauer formation33,34,47, an alternate physiological state that is triggered by unfavourable environmental conditions during development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, at least two distinct neuropeptides are already known to be secreted from ASI neurons: the TGF ligand DAF-7 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  48), and the insulin DAF-28 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these neuropeptides do not have roles in 5-HTergic fat loss, they are nonetheless regulators of global physiological state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, ASI neurons regulate locomotor and feeding behaviours in response to food availability and pheromones49,50,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, ER stress-induced unfolded protein response and innate immunity pathways are activated in ASI neurons to promote dauer diapause52,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The demonstration of a role for FLP-7 secretion from the ASI neurons in response to 5-HT signalling and the nutrient sensor AMPK suggests that these neurons integrate nutrient information to regulate multiple physiological outputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose a model in which nutrient information from the environment regulates fat metabolism via this neuroendocrine pathway (Fig 8b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nutrient replete conditions that evoke increased neuronal 5-HT keep AAK-2/AMPK inactive in the ASI neurons, which de-represses CRTC-1, thus stimulating FLP-7 secretion and promoting fat loss via NPR-22 in the intestine (Fig 8b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, nutrient depletion activates AAK-2/AMPK signalling in the ASI neurons, represses CRTC-1, resulting in reduced FLP-7 secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, fat loss is halted in the face of decreased food availability (Fig 8b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One implication of our results is that limiting rapid fat loss and mitochondrial beta oxidation via modulation of FLP-7 secretion may be the principal mechanism underlying the increased lifespan of AMPK overexpression43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A major future challenge would be to decipher the relationship between nutrient sensing in the nervous system, and the mechanisms governing the secretion of each distinct neuropeptide from the ASI neurons to elicit context-dependent responses that sculpt the physiological response to metabolic and lifespan control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Of the many neuropeptide genes encoded by the C. elegans genome, FLP-7 emerged as the predominant suppressor of 5-HT-mediated fat loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tachykinin family of peptides was discovered over 80 years ago with the extraction and isolation of its founding member Substance P, from horse intestine and brain54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is now known that the mammalian tachykinins are excitatory neuropeptides found predominantly in the hypothalamus and in the primary sensory neurons of the enteric nervous system and in the dorsal root, trigeminal and vagal ganglia that innervate the gastrointestinal tract29,55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tachykinin brain-gut peptides have many roles in mammalian physiology including gut motility, but have been studied primarily with respect to their roles in nociception and inflammation56,57,58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mammals there are three tachykinin receptors (all GPCRs), called NK1R-NK3R (refs 59, 60, 61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NK1R is the best-studied receptor, is widely expressed, and NK1R antagonists are in clinical use as anti-emetics62,63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NK2R, the orthologue of the C. elegans NPR-22 identified in this study, is perhaps the most under-studied tachykinin receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is expressed in several metabolic tissues in mice and humans including the intestine, pancreas, liver and kidney (www.biogps.org).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, NK2R has not previously been associated with changes in adiposity or energy balance in mammals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will be interesting to determine the extent to which central 5-HT action leads to stimulation and release of the tachykinin peptides from specific primary sensory neuron populations in other systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In C. elegans, another neuropeptide called FLP-18 also regulates behaviour and metabolism through two GPCRs, NPR-4 and NPR-5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike FLP-7, FLP-18 has broad roles in coordinating behaviour and metabolism across many tissues, suggesting a complex regulatory landscape for neuropeptide biology64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Other than the requirement for UNC-31/CAPS, the mechanisms of neuropeptide release have remained unknown, in any species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in the case of the regulated release of synaptic vesicles65, it is likely that there are many additional factors regulating the release of dense core vesicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identifying such regulators has the potential to reveal insights into many aspects of neuromodulation and neuroendocrine biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, despite recent strides in functionally characterizing the roles of neuropeptides in behaviour24,66,67, the great majority of neuropeptides in metazoan genomes remain unannotated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that the many non-cell-autonomous physiological effects described in the C. elegans literature stem from neuropeptides that function as endocrine factors68,69,70,71.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The approach presented here could be one useful strategy to uncover novel facets of neuroendocrine biology.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
