'Adding a mechanical degree of freedom to the electrical and optical properties of atomically thin materials can provide an excellent platform to investigate various optoelectrical physics and devices with mechanical motion interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large scale fabrication of such atomically thin materials with suspended structures remains a challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate the wafer-scale bottomup synthesis of suspended graphene nanoribbon arrays (over 1,000,000 graphene nanoribbons in 2 × 2 cm2 substrate) with a very high yield (over 98%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polarized Raman measurements reveal graphene nanoribbons in the array can have relatively uniform-edge structures with near zigzag orientation dominant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A promising growth model of suspended graphene nanoribbons is also established through a comprehensive study that combined experiments, molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical calculations with a phase-diagram analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe that our results can contribute to pushing the study of graphene nanoribbons into a new stage related to the optoelectrical physics and industrial applications.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Atomically thin materials such as graphene1,2 and other two-dimensional (2D) materials3,4 attract intense attention because of their prominent electrical and optical properties5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of their extraordinarily small thickness, large surface area, low mass density and high Youngs modulus, atomically thin materials also have excellent mechanical properties and can be used as good detectors of mass, force and charge8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining these superior optoelectrical features with their excellent mechanical properties can open up the possibility of utilizing atomically thin materials in wide variety of scientific fields and applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To use the mechanical degree of freedom, a freely suspended structure allowing mechanical vibration is necessary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the fabrication and integration of atomically thin materials with suspended structures is one of the most important subjects from both fundamental and industrial points of view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Up to now, various suspended devices with nanoscale materials have been demonstrated, including single-walled carbon nanotubes10,11, graphene12,13, nanowire14 and other 2D materials.15,16, resulting in many promising features such as the quantum-coherent coupling of a mechanical oscillator with optical cavities17, current-induced black-body radiation18, ballistic interference19 and a nanoscale mechanical resonator20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Graphene nanoribbon (GNR), which consists of strips of graphene, is another candidate for such atomically thin materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has a high carrier mobility, clear band gap, and spin-polarized edge state, which do not appear in other materials21,22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that suspended GNR can provide a promising platform for a wide variety of scientific fields and applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The preparation of GNRs is now possible using both topdown and bottomup approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GNRs with high-width controllability can be fabricated by etching 2D graphene21,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unzipping of carbon nanotube can prepare high-quality GNR27,28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decomposition of SiC can realize the integrated synthesis of GNRs30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The edge structures can be controlled through the organic synthesis of GNRs32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these GNR fabrication methods are limited to on-substrate structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are few methods for fabricating suspended GNRs, which are the combination of 2D graphene (carbon nanotube) etching (unzipping) and partial etching of the SiO2 substrate under GNRs to bridge the GNRs between electrodes34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This topdown approach is limited to a small sample area, and causes significant damage, which results in a low device performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, we developed a novel bottomup synthesis method for suspended GNRs that combines a Ni nanobar catalyst and advanced plasma processing35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Site and alignment-controlled GNR growth with a suspended form can be realized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this technique has huge potential for the integration of suspended GNR devices, the GNR growth yield is very low, which strongly restricts its utilization in various studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unknown growth mechanism also makes it difficult to control the structures of the suspended GNRs, which is the critical issue to obtain better device performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we solve these critical issues and realize a wafer-scale (2 × 2 cm2) high-yield synthesis (over 98%) of suspended GNR arrays (1,000,000 GNRs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polarized Raman mapping measurements reveal the suspended GNR array includes uniform D-band to G-band intensity ratio with parallel polarization (ID// over IG//=0.95±0.25), which should denote the uniform-edge structure with near zigzag rich orientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Local-gate operation with this suspended GNR is also demonstrated, showing that various electrically addressable logic circuits can be fabricated on a large scale using this suspended GNR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A short (below 100 nm) GNR with a suspended structure shows very high electrical conductivity (approximately 106 Sm1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The growth kinetics of the suspended GNR is also systematically investigated through a comparison of thermal chemical vapour deposition (CVD) and plasma CVD results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theoretical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations are also used to identify the detailed nucleation dynamics of the suspended GNR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Locally gate-tunable suspended GNR arrays with high electrical conductivity can open up a novel stage for both fundamental studies and practical applications of GNR in various optoelectrical, chemical and biological application fields in combination with the mechanical degree of freedom.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Wafer-scale high-yield synthesis of suspended GNRs', 'The synthesis of GNRs was carried out using the previously developed rapid-heating plasma CVD (RH-PCVD)35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The typical fabrication process is shown in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Ni nanobar (width ranging from 20 to 100 nm) was fabricated with large Ni electrodes using conventional electron beam lithography and a lift-off process followed by Ni deposition (thickness: 80 nm) (Fig 1a; see Methods section for more detailed conditions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The systematic comparison of plasma and thermal CVD was possible by simply turning on and off the radio frequency (13.56 MHz) power supplied to the coils placed outside a quartz tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of thermal CVD, the Ni nanobar was broken, and GNRs could not be grown (Fig 1be), whereas suspended GNRs could be formed between the Ni electrodes using plasma CVD (Fig 1fi; the detailed growth dynamics will be discussed later).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Comparison of growth method between thermal CVD and Plasma CVD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ad,fh) Schematic illustration of growth method for suspended GNR by (ad) rapid heating thermal CVD and (a,fh) rapid heating plasma CVD (RH-PCVD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arrows in b,f and c,g shows the direction of hydrocarbon (CxHy) supply and dewetting of Ni nanobar, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e,i) Typical SEM images of the (e) broken Ni nanobar and (i) suspended GNR with sub 10 nm width.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 100 nm (e,i).Full size image', 'To improve the growth yield of suspended GNRs, we optimized the various growth conditions such as the growth temperature, temperature increasing rate, total process time, cooling rate, gas pressure, gas mixture ratio, plasma generation power and plasma irradiation time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The growth yield of GNRs was estimated using the GNR conversion rate from Ni nanobar in dense array structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each Ni nanobar space was set at 250 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementary Fig 1a shows the growth yield of suspended GNRs as a function of the plasma irradiation time (tp), which is one of the most sensitive growth parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In region A, where the growth yield is low, a broken Ni nanobar was often observed (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in region C, the amount of Ni residue was high (Supplementary Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high-yield synthesis of suspended GNRs could only be realized between these conditions in region B (Supplementary Fig 1a,c; Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This narrow growth window and high sensitivity to tp could be well explained by the growth model established in this study (see Discussion section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under suitable conditions, we succeeded in the fabrication of GNR arrays with a high growth yield of 98% in a wafer-scale substrate (totally over 1,000,000 suspended GNRs on 2 × 2 cm2 substrate; Fig 2af).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the first time that the formation of suspended GNR arrays has been realized on a wafer-scale (Supplementary Fig 2; Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sub-10-nm order (minimum: 6.9 nm) of narrow GNRs can be also grown by our method (Supplementary Fig 3; Supplementary Note 3), which is almost same order of GNRs produced by the other method both for topdown and bottomup approaches21,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Wafer-scale synthesis of suspended GNR arrays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ac) (a) low- and (b) high-magnification optical microscope image and (c) SEM image of wafer-scale synthesis of suspended GNR arrays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 200 m (b);

see Methods section for detailed measurement set-up).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bright and dark patterns can be appeared in D-band intensity mapping with parallel polarization (ID//), which well matches with the location of GNRs confirmed by SEM, denoting the polarized Raman signal can be obtained from each individual GNR (Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plot of ID// against to the polarized angle () shows periodic oscillation, which can be fitted with a function of cos4 (Fig 3c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with previous reports38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polarized Raman features can be also obtained from G-band (Supplementary Fig 4;

Supplementary Note 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the local-gate operation of a suspended GNR transistor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A very high electrical conductivity could also be observed for the relatively short suspended GNR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conductivity of the short-channel (77 nm) suspended GNR (width: 50 nm) was about 106 Sm1 at 15 K (Fig 4i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This value was almost the same order or slightly higher than that of a GNR grown by unzipping carbon nanotube29, which is known to produce a very high-quality GNR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the difficulty of thickness measurement of suspended GNR, the thickness of GNR was assumed as 5 nm for the conductivity calculation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variation of conductivity calculated with different thickness from 1 to 10 nm was also shown as error bars in Fig 4i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the electrical performance in this study was measured using a two-point contact measurement because of the unique device structure, implying that the intrinsic conductivity of the suspended GNRs may be far higher than that obtained by this two-point measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Side-gate operation of suspended GNRs device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ac) (a) Schematic illustration and (b,c) SEM images of side-gate suspended GNR transistor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 100 nm (b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (df) IdsVbg curves of suspended GNR transistor under different Vsg bias voltages ((d) Vsg=10 V, (e) 20 V, (f) 30 V).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The red and black arrows in df show the position of charge neutral point and transition of carrier type between p and n, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (g) Contour plot of Ids as function of Vbg and Vsg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (h) Plot of VCN varying with Vsg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Red line in h shows the linear fitting line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (i) Conductivity of short suspended GNR under 15 and 300 K.

second, relatively uniform-edge structure with near zigzag orientation; third, electrically addressable local-gate structures; and fourth, high electrical conductivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These can contribute to pushing GNR studies from basic science to practical use, especially in the optoelectrical field for various sensors (gas, chemical and biological), highly sensitive photon detectors in the terahertz region, and also the spintronic device application using unique spin state in zigzag edge GNRs in combination with the mechanical motion of GNRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Growth dynamics of suspended GNR', 'We demonstrated the successful fabrication of highly conductive suspended GNR arrays on a wafer-scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further adjustments in the GNR structures such as the width, length and layer number can open up the application field of this novel device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To realize the fine tuning of GNR structures, it is necessary to thoroughly understand the detailed growth mechanism of suspended GNRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In general, there are two different growth modes in graphene, depending on the catalyst.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In case of a catalyst with low carbon solubility such as Cu, the supplied carbon migrates on the catalyst surface, and graphene grows along the surface of the catalyst from the nucleation center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is called the surface diffusion model and is known as an isothermal reaction42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, in case of a catalyst with high carbon solubility such as Ni, the supplied carbon penetrates into the catalyst.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereafter, the graphene is grown during the cooling process by the precipitation of carbon, which is called the bulk diffusion model and is governed by a non-isothermal reaction43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Because we used a nanoscale Ni catalyst (Ni nanobar) in this study, we basically used the non-isothermal model to describe the GNR growth in our method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the isothermal reaction can occur even with Ni under low-temperature (600 °C) growth44, the temperature range used in this study was much higher (900 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explain the experimental result, that is, suspended GNRs being formed from Ni nanobar, the following two required conditions should be considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the Ni nanobar should maintain its fine structure even under a high-temperature condition (900 °C), at least until just before the cooling process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the Ni nanobar should be spatially dissipated, followed by the GNR growth during the cooling process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To establish an accurate growth model satisfying the above two requirements, we carried out experiments by focusing on the following two essential questions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The one is for the reason why a Ni nanobar can maintain its fine structure even under high-temperature (900 °C) conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other is about the formation mechanism of the suspended GNR structures during the cooling process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Because systematic investigations were required to obtain the answers to these questions, we used a thin Ni film instead of the Ni nanobar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the GNR growth from the thin Ni film was also confirmed to be similar to that with the Ni nanobar (Supplementary Fig 7; Supplementary Note 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To answer the former question, the stability of Ni is one of the key issues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantitatively investigate the stability of the Ni film, we measured the depression rate of the surface coverage of Ni (SNi) based on SEM images using automatic image processing (Supplementary Fig 8; Supplementary Note 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SNi values were analysed for various CVD experiments as functions of the CVD time, temperature and CVD type (thermal or plasma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, a clear difference in the SNi values could be observed between the thermal CVD and plasma CVD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of the thermal CVD, SNi reached around 80% at 750 °C (Fig 5ac,g), whereas SNi could be maintained at a low value (below 20%) even at 900 °C (Fig 5df,g) with plasma CVD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar difference was found for the growth-time dependence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The value of SNi rapidly increased at around 510 min of growth with thermal CVD (800 °C; Fig 5h), whereas the value of SNi did not reach 10% even after 20 min with plasma CVD (800 °C) (Fig 5h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To elucidate the most critical reason for this difference between thermal CVD and plasma CVD, the atomic components were analysed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for the Ni film after thermal CVD and plasma CVD at 800 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The depth profile of the Ni film was carefully analysed in combination with Ar ion sputtering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In case of the Ni film after thermal CVD, the carbon concentration on the surface of the Ni was slightly higher than that of the untreated sample (Fig 5i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the carbon concentration obviously decreased inside the Ni, which was at the same level as the untreated one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, more than 10% of the carbon could be found inside the Ni after plasma CVD (Fig 5j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion of the integrated intensity of C1s to Ni2p2/3 (IC1s/INi2p2/3) was also calculated (Fig 5k), where Sigma () represents the summation of peak intensity for C1s (IC1s) and Ni2p2/3 (INi2p2/3) along the film thickness direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicated that the carbon concentration in the Ni after plasma CVD was at least three times higher than that after thermal CVD (Fig 5k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Comparison of Ni-film stability between thermal CVD and plasma CVD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (af) SEM images of Ni surface after (ac) thermal CVD and (df) plasma CVD under various temperature conditions ((a,d) 700 °C, (b,e) 800 °C, (c,f) 1,000 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 5 m (af).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (g,h) Plot of SNi as a function of (g) temperature and (h) CVD time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The red and blue colours in g and h show the thermal and plasma CVD, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The multiple SEM images were taken for each sample used for the plot in g and h.

Supplementary Note 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, to make an appropriate comparison between the results of the calculation and experiment with Ni nanobar, we used a temperature normalized by the melting point of the Ni (bulk crystal or nanobar) (Tm) (T/Tm) instead of the absolute one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two blue lines in Fig 6a denote the phase boundaries between the liquid and fcc phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a control experiment, we first performed simple annealing of Ni nanobar under the Ar atmosphere (250 Pa) without CH4 at 900 °C for the same process time as the CVD growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the simple annealing, the Ni nanobar was converted to Ni nanoparticles, indicating that the Ni nanobar should be in the liquid phase at 900 °C (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we plotted the state of the Ni nanobar during simple annealing at 900 °C as point A in Fig 6a, where T/Tm=1.5 (we assumed the melting point of Ni nanobar is 600 °C due to the nanoscale effect as shown in Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the Ni nanobar during the thermal CVD, the temperature was the same (900 °C), but carbon was weakly supplied from the CH4 gas phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it could be plotted at position point B in Fig 6a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the Ni nanobar in the plasma CVD included a higher concentration (10%) of carbon, it was possible to plot it at position point C in Fig 6a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the liquid temperature gradually decreases with increasing carbon composition in Fig 6a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, these indicate that all three states (point A, point B and point C in Fig 6a) should be the liquid phase of Ni+C under the high-temperature condition (900 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Model for Ni nanobar stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Typical phase diagram of NiC binary system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The points A,B and C in a correspond to the state of Ni nanobar during simple annealing with Ar, thermal CVD and plasma CVD, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (be) (b,c) Histogram of contact angle and (d,e) typical SEM images for Ni+C nanoparticles formed by (b,d) thermal CVD and (c,e) plasma CVD, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 200 nm (d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) Results of the molecular dynamics simulation for Ni nanoparticles on SiO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (g) Contact angle of Ni nanoparticle on a SiO2 substrate given by five replicate molecular dynamics simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum and minimum value of each error bars in g corresponds to the maximum and minimum contact angle over the calculation time (from 50 to 100 ps).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (hm) Schematic illustration of Ni nanobar (h) before and after (ik) thermal CVD and (l,m) plasma CVD.Full size image', 'To obtain the answer for the first question, we have to discuss the following point about why the stability of the Ni+C liquid phase varies between the thermal and plasma CVD at 900 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be explained by the difference in the wetting probability of the Ni+C liquid on a SiO2 substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figs 6b,c and 6d,e shows histograms of the contact angle and typical SEM images, respectively, of a Ni nanoparticle after thermal CVD (Fig 6b,d) and plasma CVD (Fig 6c,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that a slightly higher temperature and longer process time were used to enhance the morphology transition of the Ni thin-film to nanoparticles, which was required to measure the contact angle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In case of the thermal CVD, almost all of the Ni+C nanoparticles showed larger contact angles, with an average value of 120° (Fig 6b,d), whereas the plasma treated Ni+C nanoparticles tended to show smaller contact angles, with an average of 30° (Fig 6c,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicated that the thermal and plasma treated Ni+C particles were hydrophobic-like and hydrophilic-like state, respectively (Supplementary Fig 11; Supplementary Note 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To support this experimental result, the wettability of the Ni nanoparticles on SiO2 was also estimated using a molecular dynamics simulation, revealing that the pure Ni nanoparticles tended to have higher contact angles on a SiO2 substrate, with an average angle of 138.9° and a hydrophobic-like behaviour (Fig 6f,g; see Methods section, Supplementary Figs 1214, and Supplementary Note 11 for more details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the hydrophobic-like behaviour of Ni+C nanoparticles with a lower carbon concentration (thermal CVD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hydrophobic-like nanobar tended to form particle-like shapes to satisfy the minimum surface energy, as explained by the PlateauRayleigh (PR) instability46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, during thermal CVD the Ni nanobar was in a hydrophobic-like liquid state as a result of the lower carbon concentration, resulting in a morphology change from the nanobar to nanoparticles (Fig 6hk).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in the plasma CVD, a higher concentration of carbon could be supplied to the Ni nanobar, forming a hydrophilic-like liquid state, which was relatively stabler than a hydrophobic-like liquid, making it possible to maintain the Ni nanobar structure at a high-temperature condition (Fig 6h,l,m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decrease of contact angle of Ni+C liquid with carbon supply can be explained by considering the surface tension of Ni+C liquid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contact angle () can be calculated with the Young equation: cos =(SLS)/L, where S, L, LS shows surface tension of solid (SiO2), liquid (Ni+C) and solid (SiO2)-liquid (Ni+C) interface, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of the literatures, it was reported that the surface tension of metal liquid can decrease with an increase in carbon concentration47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low L increases cos , resulting in the low contact angle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This address the question about why the Ni nanobar was stable in the plasma CVD even under a high-temperature condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Next, we will discuss the second issue, which is about how the suspended GNRs can be formed during the cooling process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because graphitic crystallization should occur during the cooling process as a result of the non-isothermal reaction, another phase diagram was calculated by considering the following three states: liquid, fcc, and graphite (Fig 7a; see Methods section and Supplementary Fig 9b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As discussed in Fig 6a, the starting point during the cooling process for thermal and plasma CVD can be plotted point B-i and point C-i in Fig 7a, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The representative positions of step by step cooling process for point B and point C are described with i to iii and i to v, respectively (Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By decreasing the temperature, point B-i and point C-i can move to the low-temperature position with keeping initial carbon concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once it crosses to the red curve in Fig 7a, graphitic crystallization should occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In case of thermal CVD, it cannot cross to the red curve until very low temperature (T/Tm=0.3), indicating GNR growth is not possible with thermal CVD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The states of Ni nanobar at point B-i, point B-ii and point B-iii in Fig 7a correspond with that shown in Fig 6ik, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the plasma CVD, it can cross to the red curve around the high-temperature condition (T/Tm=1.05), then move to the low-temperature side by following the red curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this stage, the GNRs could be nucleated on the surface of the liquid (point C-ii and point C-iii in Fig 7a, Fig 7b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, a large number of carbon atoms were used to form GNRs (Fig 7b), and the carbon concentration in the liquid rapidly decreased (Fig 7c), which could cause the change in the liquid state from hydrophilic-like to hydrophobic-like, as previously discussed (Fig 7d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, the Ni+C liquid under the GNRs became unstable and tended to form particle-like structures due to the PR instability (Fig 7e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be mentioned that there is another possibility causing the Ni nanobar breaking, which is end pinching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, further detailed explanation of the breaking of Ni nanobar liquid was considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was reported that the breaking of continuous fluid is sensitive to the aspect ratio of fluid  and Ohnesorge number , where L, R0, ,  and , denotes length, radius, dynamic viscosity, density and surface tension of liquid, respectively48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simple calculation shows that the OhR for Ni nanobar (20-50 nm width (R0=1025 nm)) is OhR=0.2150.34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was reported that there is a threshold for OhR, around 0.1, and lower and higher OhR than 0.1 causes end pinching and PR instability, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the breaking of Ni nanobar liquid in our experiment should be caused by not end pinching, but PR instability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, the aspect ratio =1025 (L=500 nm) matches with the unstable fluid region in -OhR plot in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  48 (Supplementary Fig 15; Supplementary Note 12), showing the Ni nanobar liquid can be broken by PR instability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wavelength of perturbation () can be also written by the simple correlation 9.02R0 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm the possibility of PR instability, we also counted the GNR length grown from 20 nm width (R0=10 nm) of Ni nanobar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, almost all of GNRs has longer than 80100 nm, which is almost same with the 90.2 nm (Supplementary Fig 16; Supplementary Note 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This also indicates that the PR instability should be one of the possible explanations causing the breaking of liquid-phase Ni nanobar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: Formation model of suspended GNRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Typical phase diagram of NiC binary system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (bf) Schematic illustration of suspended GNR nucleation process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each process has the following steps, (b) just before cooling, (c,d) GNR segregation at initial cooling process, (e) dewetting of Ni nanoparticle under GNR and (f) suspended GNR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each step of b,c,d,e and f corresponds to the position of point C-i, C-ii, C-iii, C-iv and C-v in a, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inset in e is the schematic cross sectional image of Ni nanobar just after the breaking due to PR instability.Full size image', 'After the breaking of Ni+C nanobar liquid, it received a capillary force (F), which is defined by the following equation50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', '', 'where w denote the GNR width.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we assumed that the width of the Ni nanobar and GNR was 50 nm, and =120°, the equation (1) gives F=88.5 nN (we used the value of L for pure Ni in the liquid phase at 1,728 K (melting point), which is 1.77 Nm1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  51)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since  is obviously larger than 90° as shown in Fig 6b,d,f,g the direction of F is towards the side of the GNR (Fig 7e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relatively high surface energy of Ni+C nanobar liquid also causes the morphology change to particle-like shapes of Ni+C liquid to satisfy the minimum surface energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simple calculation shows that the surface to volume ratio of Ni+C nanobar decreases with length of Ni+C nanobar, reaching 64% (length: 60 nm) of initial structures (length: 250 nm; Supplementary Fig 17; Supplementary Note 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of these results, it can be revealed that the combination of capillary force towards GNR end and morphology change caused by surface-energy stability can cause the movement of Ni+C liquid under GNR to the end of GNR, resulting in the formation of suspended GNRs (Fig 7f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be the answer of the second question about the formation mechanism of suspended GNRs.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'As previously discussed, through the comparison of experimental results, molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical calculations with the phase-diagram theory, we established a possible growth model for suspended GNRs from Ni nanobars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the segregation of GNRs happened within very short period during the cooling process, we think that the non-equilibrium reaction should mainly govern the formation process of GNR in our method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall tendency of experimental results can be well explained by traditional phase diagram, which is based on the equilibrium state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This knowledge should be useful not only for GNR synthesis but also for the synthesis of other types of nanomaterials with high controllability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also true that further progress is required to have the quantitative discussion for the growth model of GNRs, which can be realized with advanced phase-diagram analysis considering the non-equilibrium state and also nanoscale effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be the future work of this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, a similar crystal growth with PR instability has been reported for nanowire synthesis52, indicating that these unique reactions have huge potential as a future method for nanomaterial synthesis with the desired controllability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, the high-yield (over 98%) synthesis of over 1,000,000 suspended GNR arrays in a wafer-scale (2 × 2 cm2) was realized using a RH-PCVD method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polarized Raman analysis revealed that the edge structure of suspended GNRs arrays can have very uniform structure with near zigzag orientation dominant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A locally addressable side-gate transistor operation and highly conductive short-channel structures could also be demonstrated with the suspended GNRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the detailed growth dynamics of suspended GNRs were also investigated based on systematic experiments, molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high rate of carbon supply during plasma CVD was one of the critical factors to stabilize the liquid-phase Ni nanobar under the high-temperature condition because of the wettability change from hydrophobic-like to hydrophilic-like state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the nucleation of GNRs during the cooling process, the PR instability could break nanobars into nanoparticles, and the combination of capillary force and surface-energy balance could move the liquid-phase Ni into both ends of the GNR, forming a suspended GNR shape.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
