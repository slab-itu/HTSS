Nuclear Perilipin 5 integrates lipid droplet lipolysis with PGC-1/SIRT1-dependent transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial function  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Dysfunctional cellular lipid metabolism contributes to common chronic human diseases, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, fatty liver disease and diabetic cardiomyopathy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How cells balance lipid storage and mitochondrial oxidative capacity is poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we identify the lipid droplet protein Perilipin 5 as a catecholamine-triggered interaction partner of PGC-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report that during catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis, Perilipin 5 is phosphorylated by protein kinase A and forms transcriptional complexes with PGC-1 and SIRT1 in the nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perilipin 5 promotes PGC-1 co-activator function by disinhibiting SIRT1 deacetylase activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show by gain-and-loss of function studies in cells that nuclear Perilipin 5 promotes transcription of genes that mediate mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that Perilipin 5 is an important molecular link that couples the coordinated catecholamine activation of the PKA pathway and of lipid droplet lipolysis with transcriptional regulation to promote efficient fatty acid catabolism and prevent mitochondrial dysfunction.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'During increased energy demand, fatty acids hydrolyzed from triacylglycerol stored in cytoplasmic lipid droplets fuel energy production via mitochondrial -oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excessive delivery of fatty acids to mitochondria results in incomplete fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial inefficiency and insulin resistance3,4 that may be prevented by activation of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4), a transcriptional regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and function5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How cells sense the flux of fatty acids from lipid droplets in order to coordinately boost mitochondrial metabolic capacity is poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Perilipin 5 is a member of the Perilipin family of lipid droplet coat proteins, which by virtue of their localization on the surface of lipid droplets regulate access of cytoplasmic lipases to the neutral lipid stored within9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to Perilipin 1, which is most highly expressed in white adipose tissue11, the major lipid storage depot in mammals, Perilipin 5 is expressed in tissues with high oxidative capacity including heart, liver, brown adipose tissue (BAT) and oxidative skeletal muscle12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of Perilipin 5 as a cytoplasmic lipid droplet protein that coordinates the actions of lipases at the lipid droplet surface and may mediate interactions between lipid droplets and mitochondria has been investigated and reviewed12,13,14,15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to localizing to lipid droplets and mitochondria, pools of Perilipin 5 are present in the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum18,19, but its functions at these sites are unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with its tissue distribution, Perilipin 5 gain-of-function in cells increases gene expression of enzymes involved in oxidative catabolism and promotes both triacylglycerol (TAG) storage and fatty acid oxidation12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accord with these in vitro findings, Perilipin 5 skeletal muscle protein positively correlates with both TAG content and palmitate oxidation16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in both TAG storage and fatty acid catabolic capacity suggests that Perilipin 5 promotes flux of fatty acid substrates into and out of the storage depot in order to facilitate rapid mobilization of energy in times of increased demand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the molecular mechanisms by which Perilipin 5 contributes to oxidative metabolism remain largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To better understand how Perilipin 5 responds to metabolic conditions and whether changes in its organellar localization may influence its function, we investigated the subcellular distribution of Perilipin 5 in mouse tissues and in cultured cells under fasting and catecholamine-stimulated conditions, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, we identified significant enrichment of Perilipin 5 in nuclear fractions under these conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, as reported herein, we demonstrate that during catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis Perilipin 5 enriches in the nucleus, forms transcriptional complexes with PGC-1 and SIRT1, and promotes the PGC-1 gene program, thereby identifying Perilipin 5 as a previously unrecognized transcriptional co-regulator that helps match mitochondrial capacity to the lipid load.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Perilipin 5 regulates cellular lipid metabolism', 'To further investigate the cell autonomous functions of Perilipin 5 in lipid metabolism, we used siRNA duplexes to knockdown its expression in MLTC-1 mouse Leydig tumour cells, which express endogenous Perilipin 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that Perilipin 5 knockdown attenuates TAG accumulation, catecholamine-stimulated glycerol release, fatty acid oxidation and ATP levels but promotes basal glycerol release (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with the gain-of-function studies referenced above and confirm that Perilipin 5 has an important role in regulating cellular lipid metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Triggered enrichment of Perilipin 5 in the nucleus', 'We prepared subcellular fractions from tissues of mice fed ad libitum or fasted for 16 h. We observed that Perilipin 5 protein increased upon fasting in whole-cell lysate (Supplementary Fig 2a) as well in the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significant nuclear enrichment of Perilipin 5 upon fasting as compared with the fed mice is remarkable because to date no Perilipin family member has been reported to localize in the nucleus under these conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Fasting and catecholamine stimulation induce Perilipin 5 enrichment in the nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) WB for Perilipin 5 in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions prepared from heart (H), soleus (S), gastrocnemius (G), white adipose tissue (W), liver (L), BAT (B) and quadriceps (Q), of wild-type mice fed (left) or fasted (right) for 16 h.

quantification in Supplementary Fig 2d); this enrichment appeared to reach a maximum at 120 min and was reversible starting at least 2 h after Iso/IBMX medium was replaced with regular growth medium (Supplementary Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Iso/IBMX treatment of MLTC-1 cells also led to nuclear enrichment of Perilipin 5 (Fig 1c; quantification in Supplementary Fig 3a), which is consistent with our finding of nuclear enrichment of Perilipin 5 in multiple tissues upon prolonged fasting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with Iso/IBMX treatment, oleate loading of MLTC-1 cells resulted in increased Perilipin 5 protein expression (Supplementary Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However in contrast to Iso/IBMX treatment, oleate loading was not associated with nuclear enrichment of Perilipin 5 (Fig 1d; quantification in Supplementary Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that nuclear enrichment of Perilipin 5 is not due simply to increased cellular Perilipin 5 levels but rather reflects specific signalling and trafficking events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To determine whether nuclear enrichment is a general property of the Perilipin family, we isolated nuclear, cytoplasmic and fat cake fractions from MLTC-1 cells after treatment with vehicle or Iso/IBMX for 120 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, only Perilipin 5 protein expression was increased with Iso/IBMX (Supplementary Fig 4a), and only Perilipin 5 was enriched in the nucleus with catecholamine treatment compared with vehicle, thereby suggesting that dynamic nuclear enrichment is a unique property of Perilipin 5 within the Perilipin family (Fig 1e; quantification in Supplementary Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We used two additional independent methods to confirm catecholamine-stimulated nuclear enrichment of Perilipin 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we expressed mCherry-Perilipin 5 or Perilipin 2 fusion proteins in transfected C2C12 myoblasts and assessed for red fluorescence under vehicle and Iso/IBMX-treated conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our western blotting data of endogenous Perilipin 5 in C2C12 myotubes and MLTC-1 cells, the signal for mCherry-Perilipin 5 increased in the nucleus compared with basal conditions by 120 min of Iso/IBMX stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the mCherry-Perilipin 2 signal did not enrich in the nucleus (Fig 1f, quantification in Supplementary Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that the western blotting data do not reflect antibody cross-reactivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed by western blot (WB) that the nuclear signal for mCherry-Perilipin 5 did not originate from mCherry flourophore that had been cleaved from the mCherry-Perilipin 5 fusion protein (Supplementary Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we examined the distribution of endogenous Perilipin 5 by immunofluorescence microscopy in MLTC-1 cells (Supplementary Fig 6a), and found that endogenous Perilipin 5 localizes to the cytoplasm under basal conditions but is present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus under catecholamine-stimulated conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our western blotting data indicate that nuclear enrichment of Perilipin 5 begins at least as early as 5 min after the initiation of catecholamine treatment of both C2C12 myotubes and MLTC-1 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This early effect suggests that at least some of the Perilipin 5 that localizes to the nucleus likely comes from existing pools.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, when we repeated catecholamine treatment in the presence of cycloheximide to inhibit new protein synthesis, we observed persistent Iso/IBMX-dependent Perilipin 5 nuclear enrichment, which suggests that nuclear enrichment results at least in part from Perilipin 5 mobilization from existing depots (Supplementary Fig 6b) as opposed to new synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To address how Perilipin 5 targets to the nucleus, we used sequence analysis software (SeqNLS and NucPred) to search for potential nuclear localization signals (NLS), but none were identified within Perilipin 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Perilipin 5 nuclear localization is PKA-dependent', 'Perilipin-1 was initially identified as the major PKA substrate in adipocytes11 and recent 32P-orthophosphate labelling studies have shown that Perilipin 5 is phosphorylated after treatment with forskolin15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using Perilipin 5 immunoprecipitation and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), we identified a peptide of mouse Perilipin 5 phosphorylated on serine 155 after treatment with Iso/IBMX (Supplementary Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably serine 155 lies in a PKA consensus motif (RRXS/T) that is conserved among mammals (Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed that Perilipin 5 phosphorylation is PKA-dependent in cells treated with specific PKA inhibitors (PKI and RpcAMP) and Iso/IBMX or vehicle (Supplementary Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if serine 155 phosphorylation affects the subcellular localization of Perilipin 5, we expressed in C2C12 myoblasts mutants of mouse Perilipin 5 that were either nonphosphorylatable, serine 155 to alanine (S155A), or phosphomimetic, serine 155 to glutamic acid (S155E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the S155A mutant did not leave its punctate cytoplasmic localization nor enrich in the nucleus during Iso/IBMX treatment; whereas, the S155E mutant localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus even in the absence of Iso/IBMX (Fig 1h; quantification in Supplementary Fig 8a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As was the case for mCherry-Perilipin 2, transfected wild-type Perilipin 2 did not localize in the nucleus with Iso/IBMX treatment (Supplementary Fig 8b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we performed nuclear/cytoplasmic fractionation and WB to confirm the subcellular localization of the Perilipin 5 mutants (Supplementary Fig 8c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Perilipin 5 physically interacts with PGC-1/SIRT1 complexes', 'We next asked what function Perilipin 5 might have in the nucleus, and specifically whether Perilipin 5 directly regulates gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We treated OP9 mouse adipocytes that stably expressed myc-Perilipin 5 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12) with Iso/IBMX or vehicle for 2 h and prepared whole-cell lysates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoprecipitation of myc-Perilipin 5 from these lysates was followed by identification of interacting polypeptides by mass spectrometry (MS), which revealed an Iso/IBMX-dependent peptide sequence that corresponded to PGC-1, thereby suggesting formation of a catecholamine-stimulated Perilipin 5/PGC-1 complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PGC-1 expression and activity are finely tuned to reflect energy needs so that conditions of increased energy demand induce its expression8,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, both isoproterenol and forskolin induce PGC-1 expression22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings from the literature prompted us to confirm the Perilipin 5/PGC-1 interaction by multiple independent methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we confirmed in our hands that Iso/IBMX treatment increases PGC-1 expression (Supplementary Fig 9a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then we corroborated the Perilipin 5/PGC-1 interaction by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) of endogenous PGC-1 and endogenous Perilipin 5 from nuclear extracts of C2C12 myotubes (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed that the Perilipin 5/PGC-1 interaction occurs in vivo by co-IP of these complexes from intrascapular BAT isolated from mice treated with the 3-agonist compound CL 316,243 or vehicle (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Catecholamine treatment triggers Perilipin 5 interaction with PGC-1 and SIRT1 that promotes PGC-1 deacetylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Immunoprecipitation (IP) of PGC-1 (left) and of Perilipin 5 (right) from nuclear extracts of C2C12 myotubes treated with vehicle or Iso/IBMX for 2 h.

that are immunoprecipitated by Perilipin 5 antibody (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To confirm the specificity of WB bands observed after IP, we used siRNA duplexes for PGC-1 and Perilipin 5 and performed reciprocal co-IP using an immortalized BAT cell line that endogenously expresses both proteins (Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The immunoreactive bands detected by the PGC-1 and Perilipin 5 antibodies decreased significantly with siRNA knockdown of these proteins but not with non-targeting siContol, thereby confirming the specificity of the antibodies for PGC-1 and Perilipin 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we overexpressed myc-Perilipin 5 and flag-PGC-1 and performed co-IP using flag and myc antibodies, which confirmed our previous co-IP results of the endogenously expressed proteins (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data make clear that our detection of Perilipin 5/PGC-1 complexes is not an artefact of antibody cross-reactivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also tested in cells transfected with wild-type Perilipin 5 or Perilipin 2 and PGC-1 whether Perilipin 2 also forms catecholamine-stimulated complexes with PGC-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these transfected cells,

method, we performed the proximity ligation assay (PLA) in C2C12 differentiating myoblasts that express both proteins endogenously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Iso/IBMX treatment induced formation of PLA signals (red dots) in the nucleus, thereby indicating the proximity of these proteins within  less_than 40 nm of each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are consistent with the catecholamine-stimulated Perilipin 5/PGC-1 nuclear interaction revealed by co-IP (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used antibodies to Perilipin 2, primary antibodies only and probes only as negative controls (Supplementary Fig 10b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also immunoprecipitated Perilipin 5 and western blotted for PGC-1, histone H3, Creb and actin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only PGC-1 coimmunoprecipitated with Perilipin 5, which increases the likelihood that the Perilipin 5 interaction with PGC-1 is specific (Supplementary Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In that PKA phosphorylation of Perilipin 5 and PKA-driven activation of lipases occur in coordinated fashion during catecholamine stimulation, we next asked whether Perilipin 5/PGC-1 complex formation is lipolysis-dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We treated immortalized brown adipocytes with orlistat, a nonspecific lipase inhibitor, or siRNA duplexes for adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) in order to inhibit lipolysis by two independent methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite lipase inhibition by either treatment, Iso/IBMX still triggered Perilipin 5/PGC-1 complex formation, which suggests that these complexes are catecholamine-dependent more than lipolysis-dependent (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, even if catecholamine-stimulated Perilipin 5/PGC-1 complex formation is able to proceed independently of lipolysis, in normal physiology these events occur simultaneously upon activation of PKA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Perilipin 5 influences PGC-1 acetylation status', 'Given that SIRT1 mediated PGC-1 deacetylation is one mechanism involved in the control of PGC-1

non-targeting control siRNA duplexes (siCon) into MLTC-1 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After treatment with Iso/IBMX, we immunoprecipitated PGC-1 and then subjected the immunoprecipitates to western blotting with an antibody that recognizes acetylated lysine residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that PGC-1 is deacetylated after treatment with Iso/IBMX, in agreement with a previous report that forskolin, epinephrine and clenbuterol each promote PGC-1 de-acetylation28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that Perilipin 5 knockdown is associated with reduced Iso/IBMX-dependent PGC-1 deacetylation.

promoter activation (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the requirement of nuclear relocalization of Perilipin 5 for its effects on transcription, we also tested the Perilipin 5 S155A and S155E mutants for their ability to augment catecholamine-stimulated PGC-1 promoter activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The S155A mutant had no significant effect in PGC-1 promoter activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the S155E mutant showed a trend to increased promoter activation under unstimulated conditions that did not reach statistical significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, with the S155E mutant there was no further increase in promoter activation upon catecholamine stimulation (Fig 5d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we transfected siRNA duplexes targeting PKA, which resulted in a significant reduction of the Perilipin 5 effect on the PGC-1 promoter (Fig 5e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together with our findings on the importance of serine 155 as a PKA substrate for Perilipin 5 localization, these data suggest that the phosphorylation of Perilipin 5 by PKA and the nuclear enrichment of Perilipin 5 are necessary for its effects on the PGC-1 promoter, and likely on other gene promoters that are co-activated by PGC-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That the S155E mutant under unstimulated conditions did not fully mimic the effect of wild-type Perilipin 5 in the luciferase activity under catecholamine stimulation likely reflects the fact that substitution of glutamic acid is an imperfect mimic of phosphoserine for the purposes of proteinprotein interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we showed in Fig 2h, Perilipin 5 knockdown is associated with reduced Iso/IBMX-dependent PGC-1 deacetylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further test the effect of Perilipin 5 on PGC-1 deacetylation, we used a previously described PGC-1 acetylation deficient mutant, in which 13 lysine residues have been mutated to arginine (R13 PGC-1) (kindly provided by Pere Puigserver)27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we co-transfected wild type PGC-1 and Perilipin 5, we observed increased Iso/IBMX-stimulated PGC-1 promoter activity, as compared with wild-type PGC-1 alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, when we transfected R13 PGC-1, we observed increased PGC-1 promoter activity under vehicle treatment with no further increase with Iso/IBMX or Perilipin 5 co-transfection (Fig 5f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that the deacetylation of PGC-1 is necessary for Perilipin 5 to increase PGC-1 luciferase promoter activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Perilipin 5 promotes catecholamine-driven PGC-1 promoter activity in a

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Perilipin 5 coats the surface of intracellular lipid droplets, where it promotes TAG storage by inhibiting lipolysis under metabolic and hormonal conditions of energy sufficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exact mechanism of inhibition remains unclear, but a prevailing notion is that cytoplasmic Perilipin 5 binds either ATGL or CGI-58, an activator of ATGL lipase activity, and thereby prevents their interaction with each other13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This Perilipin 5 brake on unfettered lipolysis may prevent chronic overload of mitochondrial capacity to fully catabolize the released fatty acids, thereby maintaining mitochondrial function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data herein (Supplementary Fig 1) and that of others15 suggest that in response to catecholamine treatment, Perilipin 5 promotes TAG hydrolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But how do cells in oxidative tissues take full advantage of the liberated free fatty acids by fully catabolizing them to produce ATP or heat and avoid the accumulation of incompletely oxidized lipid species that would damage mitochondria?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, we demonstrate a mechanism whereby nuclear Perilipin 5/PGC-1 actions globally reprogram lipid metabolism in response to extracellular signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that acutely following catecholamine treatment Perilipin 5 is phosphorylated in a PKA-dependent manner and enriches in the nucleus, where it enters a complex with SIRT1 and PGC-1, promotes the deacetylase activity of SIRT1 by displacing the SIRT1 inhibitor DBC-1, and thereby augments deacetylation of PGC-1 and, consequently, co-activation by PGC-1 of target genes that promote fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial efficiency (working model, Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, whether Perilipin 5 inhibits or stimulates lipolysis and downstream fatty acid catabolism varies according to cellular energy status, hormonal milieu and its subcellular localization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These collective actions of Perilipin 5 would be expected to promote catecholamine-stimulated flux of fatty acids from lipid droplets to mitochondria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that the nuclear actions of Perilipin 5 via PGC-1 activation represent an important homeostatic mechanism that matches mitochondrial oxidative capacity with the increased flux of intracellular fatty acids released from lipid droplets during catecholamine stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have shown that Perilipin 5 deficiency in brown adipocytes reduces mitochondrial DNA, reduces basal OCR, and abolishes the catecholamine-stimulated increase in OCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that this mechanism ensures that lipolysis does not overwhelm the capacity of the mitochondria to fully oxidize fatty acids and maximizes the efficiency of ATP or heat production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, such a mismatch in flux would damage mitochondria, thereby leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced metabolic flexibility and potentially insulin resistance in some tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these deleterious metabolic consequences of mitochondrial overload may contribute to the pathophysiology of diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This working model of Perilipin 5 function is consistent with (a) the tissue toxicity that arises in global Perilipin 5 knockout mice (see below) and (b) the adaptive storage of fatty acids as triacylglycerol in lipid droplets, such as occurs with endurance training of muscle in humans, which is associated with increased Perilipin 5 gene expression and protein levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: Model of the proposed mechanism for Perilipin 5 regulation of PGC-1/SIRT1-dependent transcriptional activation.During stimulation of cells or tissues by catecholamines, fasting and perhaps other stimuli such as cold exposure and exercise, Perilipin 5 is phosphorylated by protein kinase A and enriches in the nucleus to form transcriptional complexes with PGC-1 and SIRT1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perilipin 5 activates the deacetylase activity of SIRT1 by displacing DBC1, an inhibitor of SIRT1, thereby promoting PGC-1 co-activator activity via deacetylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this PGC-1/SIRT1-dependent manner, nuclear Perilipin 5 augments expression of genes that promote mitochondrial biogenesis and function.Full size image', 'Our data do not reveal the mechanism by which Perilipin 5 targets to the nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps as has been shown in osteoblasts for -catenin32, which also lacks a nuclear localization sequence33, PKA phosphorylation generates a signal that directs Perilipin 5 to the nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, Perilipin 5 may contain a cryptic NLS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These issues remain for further investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The role of Perilipin 5 in regulating SIRT1 activity must be considered in the context of other signalling pathways that also promote SIRT1 deacetylase activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Puigserver laboratory has identified a conserved serine (S434) in the catalytic domain of SIRT1 that is phosphorylated upon activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway by exposure either to catecholamines or to cold28 and is required for SIRT1-dependent augmentation of gene expression and fatty acid oxidation under those conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, activation of SIRT1 neither by cAMP/PKA-dependent phosphorylation nor by its interaction with Perilipin 5 as we report is associated with increased cellular NAD+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These modes of NAD+-independent SIRT1 regulation contrast with AMP-kinase (AMPK) driven activation of SIRT1, which is mediated by increased production of NAD+ (refs 34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How these distinct modes of regulation may interact with each other remains for future study, but it is likely that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of SIRT1 results in rapid augmentation of SIRT1 de-acetylase activity that may be maintained through AMPK-driven changes in NAD+28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that Perilipin 5 exerts its effect on SIRT1 activity early following catecholamine stimulation and on gene expression within a few hours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results are consistent with several previous reports of Perilipin 5 in rodent models and in human subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, acute overexpression of Perilipin 5 via adenoviral delivery into mouse skeletal muscle increases intramyocellular lipid levels without impairing insulin sensitivity and increases gene expression that favours fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial function36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, endurance trained humans have increased skeletal muscle (vastus lateralis) Perilipin-5 protein compared with lean sedentary insulin-sensitive humans37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a third study, Perilipin 5 expression was upregulated in skeletal muscle of mice that specifically overexpressed PGC-1 in muscle, as well as in skeletal muscle of exercise-trained humans38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, Perilipin 5 expression in skeletal muscle positively correlated with insulin sensitivity in those exercise-trained subjects38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these studies suggest that TAG accumulation mediated by Perilipin 5 is an adaptive mechanism to buffer lipid loads and to permit healthy intracellular lipid flux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Against the backdrop of recent data from others, our results suggest that certain aspects of Perilipin 5 may be cell-type specific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perilipin 5 overexpression in mouse models positively correlated with increased tissue steatosis in heart39,40, skeletal muscle36,41 and liver42, which is consistent with our cell culture data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the heart specifically, indices of mitochondrial function, gene expression related to oxidative metabolism (PPAR, PGC-1 and related genes), and fatty acid oxidation negatively correlated with Perilipin 5 expression39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such differences may relate to the intrinsic capacity of the healthy adult heart to handle high rates of TAG turnover and fatty acid flux independent of Perilipin 5, a feature that dramatically changes with cardiac hypertrophy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether myocardial Perilipin 5 actions are adaptive in cardiac hypertrophy, for example in the context of pressure overload, remains to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is notable that PGC-1 expression positively correlates with that of TCA cycle enzymes4 that would enhance anaplerosis, an essential process that becomes defective in the failing heart due to suppression of malic enzyme expression43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps enhancement of Perilipin 5 expression in the failing heart would activate PGC-1 and improve anaplerotic replenishment of TCA cycle intermediates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Nevertheless, in concordance with our data, whole-body Perilipin 5 knockout mouse models have shown reduced triacylglycerol content and lipid droplets in skeletal muscle44, liver45 and heart46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This consistent phenotype of lipid droplet depletion was associated with adverse tissue-specific sequelae, as predicted by our working model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In skeletal muscle, whole-body Perilipin 5 deficiency was associated with increased ceramide accumulation and insulin resistance44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In liver, whole-body Perilipin 5 deficiency was associated with increased hepatocellular non-esterified fatty acids with PPAR activation and with increased markers of ER stress, inflammation, and tissue injury (elevated transaminases)45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice with whole-body Perilipin 5 deficiency developed age-related cardiomyopathy associated with increased fatty acid oxidation46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The published Perilipin 5 mouse knockout models reflect chronic and potentially developmental effects on whole-body physiology with the potential for activation of compensatory metabolic responses that may complicate the determination of the specific functions of Perilipin 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, inability to sequester fatty acids in lipid droplets as triacylglycerol may lead to increased production of PPAR ligands that compensate for the loss of Perilipin 5-dependent PGC-1 activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, our data reflect the cell autonomous effects of acute/subacute changes in Perilipin 5 expression on cellular gene expression and lipid metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative importance of Perilipin 5 function in different organelles (lipid droplet, mitochondria and nucleus) likely is specific to the tissue being considered and to the metabolic context (fasting versus feeding, thermoneutrality versus cold, rest versus exercise).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The function of Perilipin 5 as a transcriptional regulator likely has less to do with establishing the tonic level of oxidative gene expression and mitochondrial capacity than with matching gene expression and mitochondrial capacity to changing nutrient and hormonal conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, the dual actions of Perilipin 5 resemble those of lipin-1 in sensing and coordinating TAG metabolism47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In sum, our work makes clear that Perilipin 5 functions extend beyond its role at the lipid droplet surface in regulating lipid storage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we report for the first time herein, Perilipin 5 also functions in the transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial respiration via nuclear translocation and direct interaction of Perilipin 5 with the PGC-1 mitochondrial gene program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transcriptional effects of nuclear Perilipin 5 on metabolism may not be entirely cell autonomous, as suggested by the recent report that Perilipin 5 overexpression in skeletal muscle is associated with increased muscle gene expression and serum levels of FGF21 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  41), a PPAR target gene48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies will determine whether nuclear Perilipin 5 regulates deacetylation states of known SIRT1 targets beyond PGC-1, such as p53, FOXO, NFB, LXR, CRTC2 and SREBP-1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  49) This last question is significant given the known and proposed roles of SIRT1 as an integrator of metabolic signalling relevant to cancer biology, aging, inflammation, thermogenesis and exercise, in addition to energy balance.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
