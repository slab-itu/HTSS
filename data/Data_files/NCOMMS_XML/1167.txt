ITK signalling via the Ras/IRF4 pathway regulates the development and function of Tr1 cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells differentiate in response to signals engaging the T cell receptor (TCR), express high levels of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10, but not Foxp3, and can suppress inflammation and promote immune tolerance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that ITK, an important modulator of TCR signalling, is required for the TCR-induced development of Tr1 cells in various organs, and in the mucosal system during parasitic and viral infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ITK kinase activity is required for mouse and human Tr1 cell differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tr1 cell development and suppressive function of Itk deficient cells can be restored by the expression of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Downstream of ITK, Ras activity is responsible for Tr1 cell induction, as expression of constitutively active HRas rescues IRF4 expression and Tr1 cell differentiation in Itk/ cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that TCR/ITK signalling through the Ras/IRF4 pathway is required for functional development of Tr1 cells.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'T regulatory (Treg) cells promote immune tolerance and suppress inflammation1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike Treg cells that stably express the transcription factor Foxp3, type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells have no or transient expression of Foxp3; however, they produce high levels of IL-10 and can suppress effector cell responses in an IL-10 dependent manner1,3, via CTLA-4 and PD-1 interactions, or by directly killing pro-inflammatory cells with granzymes2,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mice and in humans, induction of antigenic tolerance during haematopoietic stem cell transplantation and specific-antigen immunotherapy are positively correlated with the abundance of Tr1 cells5,6, and Tr1 cells can prevent allergic asthma induced by the house dust mite peptidase 1 variant Derp 1 in murine models7, and prevent the development of bacterial-induced atopic dermatitis8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, like Foxp3+ Treg cells, Foxp3IL-10+ Tr1 cells have therapeutic potential for inflammatory diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although much is known about the development and function of Treg cells, substantially less is known about Tr1 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A better understanding of the development and function of Tr1 cells should provide a wider array of therapeutic options for inflammatory diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'IL-2 inducible T cell kinase (ITK) is a Tec family non-receptor tyrosine kinase expressed by T cells, and has a pivotal role downstream of the T cell receptor (TCR); the loss of ITK function leads to attenuated TCR signalling and alters the T cell subset differentiation and function9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Naive CD4+ T cells can differentiate into Tr1 cells upon TCR engagement in the presence of IL-27, and although Tr1 cells can express IFN-, production of IFN- or T-bet are not required for Tr1 cell development10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, Tr1 cells can result from Th17 trans-differentiation during the resolution of inflammation11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that Tr1 cell differentiation may share some pathways of regulation with Th1 and Th17 cell development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mice with ITK deficiency, naive CD4+ T cells have defects in the differentiation of Th17 cells12, and enhanced Th1 differentiation with impaired Th2 and Th9 programming that leads to attenuated allergic asthma13,14,15, and have enhanced differentiation of Foxp3+ Treg cells16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether ITK also has a function in modulating the development and/or function of IL-10-producing Tr1 cells, is unexplored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Beyond the finding that the cytokine IL-27 and the transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (cMAF) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) are important for Tr1 cell differentiation, we have limited knowledge of the signalling pathways that regulate the development and, importantly, function of Tr1 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that, in the absence of ITK, TCR engagement does not induce optimal differentiation of Tr1 cells in multiple organs and during parasitic or viral infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression and activity of ITK are crucial for Tr1 cell fate programming in both mouse and human, and for Tr1 cell function to suppress effector cell expansion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ITK deficiency impairs IRF4 expression in both mouse and human Tr1 cell development, and restoring IRF4 expression rescues Tr1 cell fate programming and suppressive function in Itk deficient cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RAS/MAPK signalling axis is indispensable for Tr1 cell development, and constitutively active RAS signalling completely rescues induction of IL-10 and IRF4 during Tr1 cell differentiation of Itk deficient cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings identify ITK as a crucial component that bridges extracellular signals, RAS signalling and IRF4 expression during Tr1 cell fate programming, and suggest that ITK signalling components are potential targets for modulating Tr1 cell development and function for clinical benefit.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our data presented in this report support a requisite role for ITK in Tr1 cell development in both mouse and human.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, the activity of ITK is required for the suppressive function of Tr1 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This function is executed through the kinase activity of ITK, and its down-stream signals through HRas activation and IRF4 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although both Tr1 cells and Foxp3+ regulatory T cells can produce IL-10 and can suppress T cell proliferation, the role of ITK is different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We and others have reported that ITK, and its kinase activity, suppresses the development of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our work here indicates that the requirement for ITK in Tr1 cells is more analogous to its role in T effector cells such as Th2, Th9 and Th17 cells12,15,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the signals downstream of ITK in inducing Th1 differentiation remains unclear, ITK regulation of the transcription factor NFAT has been shown to be critical for its ability to regulate naive cell differentiation to Th2 and Th17 cell fates12,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Schwartzberg and colleagues recently reported that ITK signals via IRF4 to regulate naive cell differentiation to Th9 cell fate and production of IL-9 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, in the absence of ITK, Th9 cell differentiation is fully rescued by the presence of IL-2, production of which is also defective in the absence of ITK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These previous findings suggest that IL-2 may play a role in the function of ITK in Tr1 cell differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, addition of exogenous IL-2 is able to partially rescue Tr1 cell differentiation in the absence of ITK, although addition of exogenous TGF- is unable to do so (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We found that the absence of ITK or its kinase activity resulted in defects in expression of the transcription factor AHR, cMAF and IRF4 in T cells activated under Tr1 cell-differentiation conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These three transcription factors have all been shown to be important in Tr1 cell differentiation and IL-10 production in T cells 24,25,27,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, an AHR ligand is unable to rescue the Tr1 cell differentiation defects in the absence of ITK, and cMAF expression is not affected in human T cells when ITK kinase activity is inhibited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings that re-expression of IRF4 rescues both Tr1 cell differentiation and function, suggests that IRF4 plays an important role in this process downstream of ITK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AHR can bind to cMAF promoter and regulates cMAF expression during Tr1 cell differentiation24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have also found that re-expression of IRF4 rescued AHR expression in Itk/ CD4+ T cell under Tr1 cell-differentiating condition (Supplementary Fig 3c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that IRF4 is sufficient to compensate for a lack of ITK as re-expression of IRF4 rescues Tr1 cell differentiation and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, IRF4 has been reported to lie upstream of Blimp-1, and together both are required for IL-10 production in Foxp3+ regulatory T cells27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, despite the requisite role of ITK signals for the expression of Blimp-1 in Tr1 cells, re-expression of Blimp-1 in ITK deficient cells does not rescue Tr1 cell differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that IRF4-regulated genes are critical for this process, and the process cannot be rescued by Blimp-1 alone in the absence of ITK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We found that inhibition of Ras, and the downstream MAP kinase pathways, particularly ERK and JNK, reduced both Tr1 differentiation and the expression of IRF4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, over-expression of HRas, or constitutively active HRas, in Itk/ T cells also rescued Tr1 cell differentiation, along with IRF4 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the re-expression of IRF4 in the absence of ITK rescues Tr1 function, we infer that the HRas pathway, by rescuing IRF4, is able to rescue Tr1 cell function as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TCR pathways leading to IRF4 are unclear, and our data shows for the first time that downstream of the TCR and ITK, the Ras/MAPK pathways leads to IRF4 expression during Tr1 cell differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to conventional differentiation of Tr1 cells from naive CD4+ progenitors, it has recently been shown that Tr1 cells can be derived from cells that had once been Th17 cells but then lost IL-17 production (exTh17 cells) during the resolution of inflammation11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our unique Itkas mice allowed us to be able to generate Th17 cells, where ITK could be specifically targeted by 3MBPP1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that similar to the role for ITK in differentiation of Tr1 cells, the kinase activity of ITK is also required for optimal trans-differentiation of exTh17 cell into Tr1 cells (Supplementary Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given that ITK kinase activity is also required for Th17 cell development, survival, proliferation and maintenance of RORt expression under Tr1-polarizing condition (Supplementary Fig 5a,c), the effect of inhibiting ITK on down-regulation of IRF4 expression and inhibition of IL-10 production might be the result of a combination of cell survival, proliferation and cell fate reprogramming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether ITK functions in trans-differentiation of exTh17 cell into Tr1 cells in vivo remains to be further explored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Comparing our results in the mouse and human T cells, we found that in human cells, two different ITK inhibitors exhibit differential effects inhibiting the level of IL-10, cell surface markers LAG3/CD49b and transcription factor IRF4 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be because of the different characteristics and IC50s of these compounds, as well as potentially different off target effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that our work with the 3MBPP1 on the murine cells expressing the Itkas allele is much more indicative of what would happen when we only inhibited ITK activity, however, we are not able to use this inhibitor in the human T cells for obvious reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it is recently reported that IL-10-producing T cells derived from human CD4+ memory T cells exhibit low levels of LAG3/CD49b expression36, in contrast to what was observed in human Tr1 cells derived from naive human CD4+ T cells1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the effect of inhibiting ITK in human IL-10-producing CD4+ T cells needs to be further explored to consider those derived from naive precursors versus memory cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In our experiments, we also examined the responses of Itk/ mice to infection with N. brasiliensis and Flu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the response of Itk/ mice to infection with N. brasiliensis has been previously reported34, this work was performed before the discovery of Tr1 cells, and the response of these mice to infection with Flu have not been reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both infection models, we found that the Tr1 cell response was quite organ specific, with significant Tr1 cell response found largely in the lungs and to a lesser extent in the mesenteric/draining lymph nodes in both models, with little response in the spleen (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, while infection with N. brasiliensis led to increased recovery of parasites in the absence of ITK (Supplementary Fig 6), there was no difference in the recovery of virus from the lungs of Flu infected mice, and no difference in body weights, although there was reduced survival of Itk/ mice (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complex immunological phenotype of the Itk deficiency beyond our analysis of Tr1 cell responses in vivo, with multiple cell types exhibiting different phenotypes12,13,14,15,16,17,23,26,32,34,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46, makes it more challenging to provide an explanation for these phenotypes without significant additional experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Regulatory T cell function can be a double-edge sword, beneficial in controlling inflammation and promoting immune tolerance, but detrimental in causing immune depression under conditions of infections or in the face or tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tr1 cells have been found to be abundant in chronic hepatitis C virus47 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis48 infection, as well as in tumour microenvironments49,50, which may lead to a lack of or reduced immune response to clearing viruses, bacteria or tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the functional requirement for ITK kinase activity in differentiated Tr1 cells, targeting ITK activity and its signalling pathway specifically in Tr1 cells may be a promising strategy in modulating immune suppression due to the functions of Tr1 cells under such circumstances, although further work in humans will have to be done to determine this.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings place ITK and its signalling axis as promising therapeutic targets to modulate Tr1 cell numbers and activity for treating diseases such as inflammation, chronic infection and tumours.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
