The severity of hereditary porphyria is modulated by the porphyrin exporter and Lan antigen ABCB6  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Hereditary porphyrias are caused by mutations in genes that encode haem biosynthetic enzymes with resultant buildup of cytotoxic metabolic porphyrin intermediates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A long-standing open question is why the same causal porphyria mutations exhibit widely variable penetrance and expressivity in different individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that severely affected porphyria patients harbour variant alleles in the ABCB6 gene, also known as Lan, which encodes an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasma membrane ABCB6 exports a variety of disease-related porphyrins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional studies show that most of these ABCB6 variants are expressed poorly and/or have impaired function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, homozygous disruption of the Abcb6 gene in mice exacerbates porphyria phenotypes in the Fechm1Pas mouse model, as evidenced by increased porphyrin accumulation, and marked liver injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these studies support ABCB6 role as a genetic modifier of porphyria and suggest that porphyrin-inducing drugs may produce excessive toxicities in individuals with the rare Lan() blood type.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The inherited porphyrias are metabolic disorders of haem biosynthesis caused by mutations in genes coding for enzymes in the haem biosynthetic pathway1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intermediates of haem biosynthesis are toxic and their accumulation is particularly damaging to the liver, haematopoietic system, skin and neural tissues, accounting for the characteristic clinical symptoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most porphyrias are inherited as autosomal dominant mutations with marked variability in phenotypes that cannot be accounted for by the causal mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, a long-standing clinical mystery has been why some porphyria patients become more ill than others, even within the same pedigree3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that the variable penetrance and expressivity of porphyrias might be due to genetic modifiers3,5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is unknown if porphyrin transporters modify the severity of porphyria, especially those transporters that are expressed in red blood cells where most of haem biosynthesis occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple porphyrins are exported from differentiating red blood cell model systems, but the identity of the transporter(s) in normal red blood cells remains unknown8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that porphyrin transporters might impact porphyria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disruptions in porphyrin export might produce overaccumulation of toxic porphyrins (protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), coproporphyrins (CPs) and uroporphyrins (Uros))10 in red blood cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The export of PPIX from red blood cells is mediated by the plasma membrane transporter ABCG2 (refs 11, 12, 13, 14), but it is unknown if this is the sole energy-dependent exporter of porphyrins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another porphyrin transporter, ABCB6, was recently identified as the Lan blood group antigen in the plasma membrane of red blood cells15, but its function in the red cells as a porphyrin exporter has not been directly tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we show that variant alleles of ABCB6 gene that are identified in individuals with severe cases of porphyrias have poor expression and/or are defective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also demonstrate that ABCB6 mediates the plasma membrane export of porphyrins in red cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imposing Abcb6 deletion on the Fechm1Pas mouse model exacerbates porphyria symptoms, as evidenced by increased red blood cell and hepatic porphyrin concentrations, and enhanced liver injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies show that rare ABCB6 variant alleles modify the severity of porphyria symptoms in patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More generally, we show how complementary clinical observations, genetic and biochemical studies synergize to inform precision medicine.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'WES reveals ABCB6 variants in severely affected patients', 'At the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Australia, a cohort of 36 porphyria patients of European descent and their family members were evaluated for clinical history, biochemical profile and detection of pathogenic mutations in haem biosynthetic pathway genes (HMBS, CPOX, PPOX or FECH; Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) on seven individuals with the most severe clinical phenotypes (symptomatic intensive care unit (ICU); for patient stratification, see Supplementary Methods; Fig 1a, Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The WES data of these individuals were filtered to develop a prioritized candidate gene list, then enrichment analysis was performed using Database of Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID)16,17 (see Methods; Supplementary Fig 1a; Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ABC transporters cluster defined by KEGG_PATHWAY and INTERPRO was significantly enriched among the candidate genes (Supplementary Table 3; enrichment score=1.93, false discovery rate P less_than 0.20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ABC transporters mostly consist of four domains, two transmembrane domains, each composed of six membrane-spanning helices, and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the NBDs are highly conserved, the transmembrane domain are diverse, a likely reflection of the wide variety of substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ABC cluster cluster included two porphyrin transporters, ABCG2 and ABCB6 (refs 11, 12, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ABCG2 mediates PPIX export from red blood cells, the major site of haem synthesis11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasma membrane ABCB6 defines the Langereis (Lan) antigen15, which can cause severe haemolytic transfusion reactions and haemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lan() individuals are typically asymptomatic, thus the physiological function of plasma membrane ABCB6 is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Clinical and biochemical analyses of rare variant alleles of ABCB6 in porphyric patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Flow chart describing strategies

presumably to reduce cytotoxicity and/or membrane damage during massive haem synthesis8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we focused on porphyrin transporter genes ABCB6, ABCG2, TSPO20 and FLVCR1 (refs

variants in TSPO and FLVCR1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then analysed ABCB6 and ABCG2 V12M in our entire porphyria patient cohort by Sanger sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequency of ABCG2 V12M variant in the severely affected individuals was not significant compared with the rest of the cohort (Fishers exact test, P=0.076, two sided).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Non-synonymous ABCB6 variants identified in the cohort.Full size table', 'Overall, 6/7 (85%) of the severely affected patients were heterozygous for ABCB6 variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ICU admission rate was 7.1% for porphyria patients with homozygous wild-type (WT) ABCB6 alleles versus 62.5% for those with heterozygous rare or low-frequency non-synonymous ABCB6 alleles (Fishers exact test, P=0.0026).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The urinary porphyrin concentrations were almost 2-fold higher (P=0.029) in patients harbouring ABCB6 variant alleles versus patients with WT ABCB6, and 5.9-fold higher than individuals without porphyria22 (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher frequency of these ABCB6 variants in these severely affected porphyria patients of European descent compared with European Americans tabulated in the NHLBI Exome Variant Server (22.2% versus 3.8%, Fishers exact test, P=0.0034, two sided; http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/; Supplementary Table 4) suggests these variants might be non-functional.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Variant ABCB6 alleles are non-functional', 'ABCB6 is a half transporter composed of a single membrane-spanning domain (MSD) and a cytoplasmic NBD23 that functions as a homodimer18,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 1c, the variant residues are highlighted on a homology model of ABCB6 (Supplementary Fig 1b) with the ABCB6 monomer shown for clarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The substitutions at R276W and A492T are in the MSDs, whereas T521S is in an extracellular loop, and G588S and A681T are near the NBD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In silico analyses25 predicted that R276W and A681T are damaging variants (Supplementary Table 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these computational approaches are not sensitive or specific26, but our homology models for ABCB6, in both the inward-facing conformation (Supplementary Fig 5, PDB ID 3ZDQ) and the outward-facing conformation (a model based on Sav1866 (PDB ID 2HYD)), suggest that the interaction between R276 and D397 would be disrupted with the latter exposed to the hydrophobic portion of the lipid bilayer (a thermodynamically unfavourable location).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we carried out functional studies to validate the significance of the variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'There was minimal or no difference in translation of the WT or ABCB6 variants (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the R276W, T521S, G588S, A681T and R192Q variants (FLAG tagged) were expressed either poorly or undetected when transiently expressed (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We examined the effects of the only mutations that produced detectable levels of ABCB6 (R192Q and A492T) on ATP and substrate (haem) binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein extracts prepared from NIH3T3 cells expressing V5-tagged ABCB6 WT, R192Q, A492T or K629G (a non-ATP-binding mutant18) were incubated with ATP- or hemin-agarose beads, and the amount of ABCB6 bound to the beads was determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both R192Q and A492T were capable of binding haem (Supplementary Fig 2b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ABCB6 R192Q-bound ATP-agarose normally, while the A492T-substituted protein displayed markedly impaired ATP binding and as expected the positive control K629G did not bind ATP (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To investigate A492T function, we used CRSPR-Cas9 technology27 to create Abcb6 deficiency in an erythroid cell line (murine erythroleukaemia (MEL) cells28; Supplementary Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A membrane vesicle transport assay was established that demonstrated maximal ATP-dependent CPIII transport in ABCB6 proficient cells (Supplementary Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To directly compare A492T with WT, both complementary DNAs were subcloned into a retroviral expression vector that harboured a downstream ribosomal entry site followed by a green fluorescent protein (GFP) to allow selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The A492T and WT retroviruses were transduced into the Abcb6-null cells and membrane vesicles prepared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite similar protein levels (Supplementary Fig 2d) in the membrane vesicles, A492T was incapable of transport (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Abcb6-null cells were then used to determine the plasma membrane expression of A492T and R192Q using surface biotinylation labelling29 (Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The surface expression of A492T was only 26% of WT and R192 was barely detectable (Fig 1h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, reduced membrane expression and defective ATP-binding appear to account for A492T loss of function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Because these porphyria patients are heterozygous for the variant alleles, we co-expressed each FLAG-tagged variant with V5-tagged WT ABCB6 (Fig 1i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT ABCB6 rescued expression of the R192Q protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, by immunoprecipitation with the anti-FLAG, WT ABCB6 expression was reduced by variants R276W, T521S and G588S, indicating that these behave as dominant-negative proteins (Fig 1j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The near-normal ATP- and hemin binding of R192Q, in the presence of WT ABCB6, are consistent with this individual being asymptomatic and normal urinary porphyrin level (9 nmol mmol1 per porphyrin creatinine).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Porphyrin exporter ABCB6 modifies porphyria phenotypes', 'PPIX, CP and/or Uro levels are elevated in the urine and faeces of porphyria patients1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bone marrow transplantation studies cured erythropoietic protoporphyria30, indicating that most of these porphyrins are derived from haematopoietic cells, specifically red blood cells, where  greater than 85% of haem synthesis occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early studies noted that both CPs and Uros were exported from erythroid cell lines via unknown mechanisms8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Candidate proteins expressed in erythroid cells include FLVCR, ABCB6 and ABCG2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigated red blood cell membrane expression of ABCG2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insufficiency or deficiency of ABCB6 was not associated with increased ABCG2 protein (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While ABCG2 exports PPIX (refs 11, 12, 21), it is unknown if it exports other porphyrins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We prepared red cell plasma membrane ghosts from Abcg2-null and WT animals to assess transport of other porphyrins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, Abcg2 loss had no effect on CP transport (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate whether ABCB6 was a physiologically important porphyrin exporter, reticulocytes from WT or Abcb6/ mice were incubated with PPIX and/or fumitremogin C, a specific ABCG2 inhibitor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ABCB6 and ABCG2 appear to have additive effects with the strongest PPIX accumulation occurring when both ABCB6 was absent and ABCG2 was inhibited (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, direct membrane transport of CPs by ABCB6 was measured using red cell ghosts prepared from WT and gene-ablated mice (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of ABCB6 strongly reduced CPIII transport in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 2d), with over 75% of total CPIII transport in red cell membranes accounted for by ABCB6 (Vmax: WT 59.4, Abcb6+/ 28.13 and Abcb6/ 11.51 pmol min1 mg1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, ABCB6 also readily transported CPI, UroI and UroIII (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, ABCB6 is the predominant CPIII exporter, at least in murine red blood cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure

with the elevated PPIX concentration found in reticulocytes, we determined faecal concentrations of PPIX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of PPIX in the faeces of Abcb6//Fechm1Pas animals was 64% higher than in the Fechm1Pas animals (Fig 2j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hepatic concentration of PPIX might have been even higher if not for the compensatory increase in hepatic expression of the canalicular-localized ABCG2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33; Fig 2k,l).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the urinary concentration of CPs in Fechm1Pas mice was greatest when both Abcb6 alleles were absent and modestly increased by the loss of one Abcb6 allele (Fig 2m,n).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, insufficiency of Abcb6 increases the porphyrin concentrations in tissues and excreta in a mouse model for

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Although elevated porphyrins are a hallmark of multiple types of porphyria, the role of porphyrin transporters (TSPO, ABCG2, ABCB6 and FLVCR1) as modulators of disease severity has not been investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using deep sequencing, biochemical analysis and a new mouse model, we show here that ABCB6 is a genetic modifier of porphyria that mitigates its severity by expelling porphyrins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A previous report showed that ABCB6 was expressed at the red blood cell membrane, but did not uncover a function15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was probably because, among healthy non-porphyric individuals, ABCB6 deficiency per se would not result in excess porphyrin accumulation, although ABCB6 acts as a broad spectrum exporter of multiple porphyrins at the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the impact of ABCB6 deficiency emerges only when porphyrins accumulate during disrupted haem biosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the current porphyria cohort is small, this study indicates that among individuals with porphyrias, functionally defective ABCB6 alleles are strongly associated with disease intensification, providing new mechanistic insights into the genetics and biochemistry of porphyrias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By stimulating haem synthesis and porphyrin production, a wide array of drugs can exacerbate porphyria symptoms in patients (http://www.porphyriafoundation.com/drug-database).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that these drugs could elicit porphyria-like symptoms in Lan() individuals with normal haem synthetic enzyme genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, drugs that also interfere with ABCB6 function might produce similar symptoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this proposition is our finding that mice lacking one copy of Abcb6 have increased porphyrins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, unanticipated drug or xenobiotic-induced porphyrias might be especially prevalent among Lan() individuals.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

the sample size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, statistical analysis of the porphyria patients harbouring the WT ABCB6 allele indicated that these were normally distributed (DAgostino and Pearson omnibus normality test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Causative porphyria mutations were identified by Sanger sequencing in all 36 patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The severity of porphyria was categorized into four

ABCB6 is a homodimer that localizes to both the outer mitochondrial membrane18,39,40,41 and the plasma membrane of cells15,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because ABC transporter substrates typically interact with the MSDs, homology models of ABCB6 were developed based on the outward-facing structure of the homodimeric ABC transporter, Sav1866 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  42), and the inward-facing structure of the homodimeric ABCB10 (refs 43, 44; Supplementary Figs 4 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Outward- and inward-facing models for ABCB6 were built using the Sav1866 structure (PDB ID 2HYD) and the ABCB10 structure (PDB ID 3ZDQ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model starts with residue L248 (excluding R192 from the analysis) and ends close to the C terminus at G827.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preliminary sequence alignment was carried out with CLUSTALW and the most conserved region with fewest gaps (248827) was selected for alignment against Sav1866 (residues 1578).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All the necessary modifications of the PDB file were performed utilizing the PDB cleaner routine45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The alignment was then imported into the Modeller 9.11 program46 for the generation of 100 structural models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The models were structurally aligned against the template structure and the best was used for the generation of a dimeric complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Energy minimization of the homodimer was carried out using MMTK47 implemented within the Chimera software suite48 with 1,000 steps of steepest descent and of step size 0.002 nm to remove significant clashes, followed by 10 steps of conjugate gradient minimization (step size 0.002 nm) with no atoms fixed, hydrogen atoms included and charged residues assigned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quality of the models was monitored at intervals during the minimization procedure using the Procheck program49, and a final model was selected in terms of clashes and stereochemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Visual inspection of the model was also used as a check for its accuracy, especially for the relatively poorly conserved transmembrane regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If correctly aligned, the model would be expected to display a 4 nm thick band of hydrophobic residues exposed to the lipid bilayer with few or no lipid-exposed charged residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a band is clearly observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model offers no clues as to the location of the N-terminal membrane-spanning region of ABCB6 (which shows no homology with known ABC protein structures).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No patch of polar or charged residues on the surface of the model could be identified that might point to the packing of additional transmembrane helices at such a position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Biochemical studies', 'Surface biotinylation, immunoblotting,
