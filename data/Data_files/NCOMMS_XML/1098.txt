Tailoring nanoscopic confines to maximize catalytic activity of hydronium ions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Acid catalysis by hydronium ions is ubiquitous in aqueous-phase organic reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that hydronium ion catalysis, exemplified by intramolecular dehydration of cyclohexanol, is markedly influenced by steric constraints, yielding turnover rates that increase by up to two orders of magnitude in tight confines relative to an aqueous solution of a Brønsted acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher activities in zeolites BEA and FAU than in water are caused by more positive activation entropies that more than offset higher activation enthalpies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher activity in zeolite MFI with pores smaller than BEA and FAU is caused by a lower activation enthalpy in the tighter confines that more than offsets a less positive activation entropy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecularly sized pores significantly enhance the association between hydronium ions and alcohols in a steric environment resembling the constraints in pockets of enzymes stabilizing active sites.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Understanding and maximizing the rates of acid-catalysed dehydration of alcohols is key to many synthetic strategies1,2,3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For reactions catalysed at the gassolid interface, the catalytic consequences of acid strength7,8,9,10, charge reorganization9,11 and spatial constraints8,10,12 have been studied in detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the solidliquid interface, however, the parameters controlling acidbase catalysis are hardly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extrapolation from gas-phase reactions is challenging, as the organization in condensed phase has profound consequences13 for the interaction of the reacting substrates with the catalyst, the nature of the acid/base active sites as well as the reaction pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the presence of high concentrations of water, nearly complete proton transfer occurs from acidic hydroxyls at the solid surface to a cluster of water molecules14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21, making hydrated hydronium ions (for example, (H2O)n·H3O+) the prevalent form of Brønsted acid sites (BAS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the structurefunction relations of hydronium ions generated at solid surfaces are complex3,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed previously23 that the catalytic activity of hydronium ions for aqueous-phase cyclohexanol dehydration is more than an order of magnitude higher in HBEA zeolite than in the acidic solutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding the causes and consequences of such rate enhancement induced by confined nanoenvironments is the key to designing novel catalysts that maximize acid-catalysed rates in condensed phase by utilizing inorganic and organic nanoenvironments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We report here on the fundamentals of the impact of steric confines on hydronium ions and the kinetic and thermodynamic consequences for catalysis, using aqueous-phase dehydration of cyclohexanol as a prototypical example.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that properly sized confines can be exploited to both maximize the substratehydronium ion association and lower the intrinsic free energy of activation for alcohol dehydration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rate of hydronium ion-catalysed elimination reactions can vary by up to two orders of magnitude with changing size of the confines, relative to aqueous-phase acid solutions, pointing to the possibility of designing catalysts that can achieve enzyme-like rates for acid-catalysed reactions under mild conditions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Hydrated hydronium ions are the most acidic species in aqueous acidic solutions; therefore, the hydronium ion-normalized rate of an acid-catalysed reaction, such as the alcohol dehydration studied here, is independent of the intrinsic strength of the dissolved acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This holds true not only for cyclohexanol (Fig 1), but also for hydronium ion-catalysed dehydration of substituted cyclohexanols and even more complex molecules such as xylose13 (see Supplementary Note 7, where thoughts about rational design of acid catalysts for dehydration of alcohols in aqueous phase are also provided).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under such conditions, the association between hydrated hydronium ions and the reacting substrate is weak, and thus the reaction shows a nearly first-order kinetic behaviour (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present case, only 1519% of the hydronium ions were on time average associated with cyclohexanol in a solution containing 0.02 M H3PO4 and 0.32 M cyclohexanol at reaction conditions34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full alcoholhydronium ion association in aqueous solutions would require alcohol concentrations of more than 5 M cyclohexanol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, this association was nearly complete in a pore of 0.7 nm in zeolite BEA, with the ratio of cyclohexanol to water being more than 20 times larger in the pore than in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, molecularly sized confines create a unique nanoenvironment favouring specific alcoholhydronium ion interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specific substrate-active centre interaction in this nanoenvironment depends markedly on the local geometry and the ordering of substrates and solvents in this environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The process is enthalpically favoured with zeolites MFI and BEA, while it is entropically favoured with zeolite FAU (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The enthalpies, entropies and free energies of activation (at 443 K), derived from kinetic measurements and the transition state theory formalism, are compiled in Table 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cases, the magnitude of the entropy gain points to significant product-like character in the TS, interpreted as stabilization of the transition state by the environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variations in the entropy of activation, however, should not be simplistically interpreted as an indication of an earlier or later TS, as it was shown that there is significant CH bond breaking (that is, a late TS) in reaching the kinetically relevant TS (TS3 in Fig 3, CO already broken) for all aqueous-phase dehydration catalyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differences in G° (Table 3) indicate that the catalytic activity of hydronium ion is intrinsically lower in the unconstrained aqueous solution than in MFI and BEA zeolites (but not FAU).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intrinsic activity of the intraporous hydronium ions is the lowest for FAU, as indicated by the largest G°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the entropy-induced nearly complete association of hydronium ion and alcohol substrate must be solely responsible for the higher TOF on FAU than aqueous acids (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 3 Intrinsic activation parameters for aqueous-phase dehydration of cyclohexanol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  *Full size table', 'For zeolite-catalysed dehydration, both H° and S° increased with increasing pore size, most prominently from MFI to BEA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be qualitatively attributed to the increased van der Waals contacts for the larger-sized TS (loosely bound carbenium ion and water) relative to the adsorbed alcohol with the internal walls of smaller pores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is important to mention that the observed activation enthalpies and entropies may include contributions from changes in the organization of the reactant molecule itself and water molecules before and after reaction47 that likely depend on the (liquid or intraporous) environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also note that while the extent of additional solvation by intraporous water of intermediates and TS may change with the concentration of hydrophilic entities in the pores, the relatively minor variations in zero-order rate constants on MFI and BEA samples3 with different Al concentrations appear to indicate that such intraporous water solvation occurs to similar extents for H-bonded cyclohexanol and the kinetically relevant TS within a given zeolite framework structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, the catalytic activity of hydronium ion is drastically altered by the constraints and the local organization of solvents and substrate molecules induced by its environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The compensation between enthalpy and entropy induced by the nanoscopic environment results in a ranking of free energy of activation that perfectly explains the measured activities and allows predictions of activities for other Brønsted acids and alcohol substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings show that a molecular environment can be tailored to dramatically enhance reaction pathways for acid catalysis in water, opening new opportunities for designing catalysts for selective conversions, utilizing confinement principles in analogy to enzymatic systems.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
