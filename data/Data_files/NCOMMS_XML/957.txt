Bio-inspired Murray materials for mass transfer and activity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Both plants and animals possess analogous tissues containing hierarchical networks of pores, with pore size ratios that have evolved to maximize mass transport and rates of reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The underlying physical principles of this optimized hierarchical design are embodied in Murrays law.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we are yet to realize the benefit of mimicking natures Murray networks in synthetic materials due to the challenges in fabricating vascularized structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we emulate optimum natural systems following Murrays law using a bottom-up approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such bio-inspired materials, whose pore sizes decrease across multiple scales and finally terminate in size-invariant units like plant stems, leaf veins and vascular and respiratory systems provide hierarchical branching and precise diameter ratios for connecting multi-scale pores from macro to micro levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our Murray material mimics enable highly enhanced mass exchange and transfer in liquidsolid, gassolid and electrochemical reactions and exhibit enhanced performance in photocatalysis, gas sensing and as Li-ion battery electrodes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Natural systems and their hierarchical organization are not only optimized and designed for durability but also have the capability to adapt to their external environment, to undergo self-repair, and to perform many highly complex functions1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To achieve transfer and exchange of substances with extremely high efficiency and minimum energy consumption, evolution by natural selection has endowed many classes of organisms with hierarchically porous networks, in which the pore sizes regularly decrease (and branch) across multiple scales and finally terminate in size-invariant units, such as those seen in plant stems, leaf veins and vascular and respiratory systems5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The entire natural porous network connected within a finite volume minimizes transport resistance for all the pores and ensures fluent transfer throughout the network as a precondition, commonly referred to as Murrays law7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By further branching and space-filling to maximize the exchange surface, such networks have to be initiated with coarse macropores ( greater than 50 nm), extended by multi-scale pores with increasing numbers but reducing diameters11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The organisms, described as living Murray networks, thus sustain life and grow obeying Murrays regularity with precise diameter ratios for connecting multi-scale pores from macroscopic to microscopic levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in plant stems and leaf veins, the sum of the radii cubed, that is, the pore volume of pores, remains constant across every branch point to maximize the flow conductance, which is proportional to the rate of photosynthesis8,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For insects relying upon gas diffusion for breathing, the sum of radii squared, that is, the surface area of tracheal pores remains constant along the diffusion pathway, to maximize the delivery of CO2 and O2 in gaseous forms, about 104 and 106 times faster in air than in water or tissues8,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, Murrays law stipulates the optimized hierarchical design for porous materials with maximized transfer properties7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Human progress has long benefitted from natural and man-made materials inspired from natures hierarchical structures1,2,3,4,7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since its discovery as the basis for vascular and blood systems, Murrays law has attracted very little attention and has thus far been completely overlooked in the areas of physics, chemistry and applied materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By mimicking natures hierarchical networks in synthetic materials with multi-scale pores based on Murrays law, such synthetic Murray materials can potentially offer important structural superiority and performance enhancement for a wide range of applications such as in photocatalysis, gas sensing and Li-ion batteries, which could help mitigating current energy and environmental issues14,15,16,17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is envisioned that the introduction of Murrays law into the design of materials could revolutionalize properties of engineered materials and launch a new era in the field of materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the original Murrays law is only applicable to mass transfer processes involving no mass variations8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant theoretical advances need to be made to apply Murrays principle more broadly to the fields of chemistry, applied materials and industrial reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The way forward towards its applications also faces bottlenecks in the construction of multi-scale interconnected pores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, various synthesis methods have been developed for the preparation of hierarchically porous materials4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most popular approach to fabricate macropores ( greater than 50 nm) uses self-assembled silica or polymer spheres as a starting template14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in these strategies, removal of sacrificial templates by washing with hydrofluoric acid or calcination at high temperature (for example, at 500 °C under oxygen atmosphere) severely restricts the choice of materials and thus, the functionality14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because most of the functional metal oxides and metal substrates ideal for applications in energy, sensing and so on are unstable under such harsh chemical treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further crystallization of these materials via high-temperature annealing is usually necessary, but results in clogged mesopores (250 nm) or micropores ( less_than 2 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking inspiration from natures self-organization of cellular units into complex organisms, self-assembly of nanocrystals as building blocks may offer a very broad and applicable approach towards the development of porous materials16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, progress in this area remains at an elementary level, hindered by the lack of control towards the design of complex hierarchical structures17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we demonstrate a bio-inspired, self-assembled material with space-filling macromesomicropores (MMM) designed based on revisited Murrays law.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hierarchically porous networks are formed using a bottom-up, layer-by-layer evaporation-driven self-assembly process employing microporous nanocrystals as the primary building blocks under ambient conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such porous Murray materials, composed of interconnected channels with precise dimensions spanning the macro-, meso- and micro-length scales can be fabricated for a broad range of applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, we demonstrate three different representative and important applications of the same Murray material in the energy and environmental fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to highly enhanced mass exchange and transfer in liquidsolid, gassolid and electrochemical reactions, we achieve outstanding performance compared to state-of-the art materials in the areas of photocatalysis, gas sensing and Li-storage, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work on designing materials according to Murrays law paves the way for pursuing optimized properties of hierarchically porous materials for various applications.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Murrays law for vascularized networks', 'Over millions of years of evolution, biological organisms have developed a highly hierarchical structure obeying Murrays law for optimized transfer and exchange performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, to optimize the rate of photosynthesis for energy conversion, plants possess leaf veins that show increasing number of branches and narrowing porous channels from macro to micro levels for water and nutrient transfer (Fig 1a)11,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SEM image of the cross-section of leaf vein reveals layer-by-layer macroporous networks for such efficient transportation (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, for efficient breathing, insects employ open spiracles with hierarchical pores following Murrays law for gas diffusion (Fig 1c)12,13,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A representative SEM image of spiracles (Fig 1d) from an insect also shows open macropores on the body surface, which are extended in the interior to enable gas diffusion in and out of the tissues efficiently22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1e,f presents the hierarchically porous network models abstracted from these living Murray systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include a parent circular pore (radius r0) connecting to many children pores (radius ri) for substance transfer and exchange.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the original Murrays law involving no mass variations (see Methods and Supplementary Methods), it can be theoretically deduced and experimentally verified that for laminar flow transfer in plant stems and leaf veins, the sum of the radii cubed of pores remains constant (Fig 1e)8,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, for insect breathing systems, Murrays law dictates an area-preserving branching network formation for optimized gas diffusion (Fig 1f)8,12,13.

However, since its discovery, little attention has been paid to exploit this law for designing advanced materials, reactors and industrial processes for maximizing mass transfer to improve material performance and process efficiency14,15,16,17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Following Murrays law, we emulate optimized natural systems on the basis of a bottom-up layer-by-layer evaporation-driven self-assembly (EDSA) strategy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Well-defined microporous ZnO nanoparticles are used as the primary building blocks, which are further assembled into vascularized Murray networks with interconnected macropores, mesopores and micropores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2 illustrates the porous network model abstracted from our desired hierarchically porous material self-assembled by NPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Murrays principle is based on optimizing mass transfer by minimizing transport resistance in pores with a given total volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We revisited original Murrays law and developed the generalized Murrays law applicable to optimized mass transfer involving mass variations (see Methods and Supplementary Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Hierarchically porous

Murrays principle to optimize mass transfer for an individual circular pore and for hierarchical pores with a parent pore (radius r0) and many children pores (radius ri; see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By combining Murrays principle and the law of mass conservation, we deduced the generalized Murrays law involving mass variations (mass loss/increase ratio X) in synthetic vascularized Murray materials: , where the exponent  (2 or 3) is dependent on the type of the transfer, and X is the ratio of mass variation during mass transfer in the parent pore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This demands a reasonable tolerance adjusted for area-preserving branching networks involving mass diffusion or ion transfer (=2) with mass variations during the optimum transfer process (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The generalized Murrays law is applicable for optimizing mass transfer in chemical reactions and other mass diffusion or ionic transfer processes involving mass variations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For the case of our materials with space-filling pores for mass transfer and exchange (Fig 2c), Murrays law demands hierarchical branching networks with well-defined regular and multi-scale pores to achieve optimum transfer along the pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The macroporous channels are openings, similar to those found in the leaf veins and insect spiracles, and are further connected to numerous surrounding mesoporous branches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To maximize mass exchange, organisms pursue full-branching but with narrowing pores, depending on the size restriction of the functional cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking such biological restrictions into account, microporous branching connected with the upper mesopores can be further introduced through porous nanoparticles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For microporous NPs self-assembled on a substrate surface, the size of the NPs and the film thickness have a finite value, thus leading to a given pore volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To connect macropores with mesopores, and mesopores with micropores, we applied the generalized Murrays law to derive the size ratios between multi-scale pores expressed by equations (1) and (2) (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', '', '', 'The physical relationships in the equations can be used as a guide for the fabrication of Murray materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These equations reveal that the micro-scale parameters for materials (Fig 2c), including the film thickness (h), wall width (l) and diameter (Dmacro) of the macropore are closely dependent on the nanoscale structural parameters of the NP building-blocks (d, n, S, Smicro, Dmicro and Dmeso).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, d is the diameter of nanoparticles, n is the average number of micropores within a single NP, S is the specific surface area of all the NPs, Smicro is the surface area of the micropores Dmicro and Dmeso are the diameters of micropores and mesopores, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Fabrication of Murray materials', 'To fabricate synthetic vascularized Murray materials, uniform microporous nanoparticles with defined microporosity were first synthesized as the primary building unit using a controllable organic solution-phase approach (vide infra).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The secondary and tertiary mesoporous and macroporous networks were constructed by our bottom-up layer-by-layer evaporation-driven self-assembly procedure under room temperature and atmospheric pressure conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solvent evaporation drove the formation of uniform networks of macropores and assembled mesoporous arrays of the primary microporous nanoparticles, resulting in a hierarchical porous network where the pore size ratio was defined by the generalized Murray principle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Layer-by-layer deposition of pre-fabricated Murray networks extended the structures in the thickness direction defining the length of the macropores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As an example, we employed multi-functional ZnO NPs to construct the Murray material with MMM (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because ZnO is a widely used multi-functional material in various applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Zn-oleylamine complex prepared at 80 °C is thermally decomposed at 150 °C to form ZnO NPs23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the reaction, spontaneous release of gas molecules from the precursors leads to the formation of nanochannels within the ZnO NPs25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After tuning the ratio of the reactants and the reaction time, uniform ZnO nanocrystals of 30 nm in diameter (d=30 nm) are obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each NP contains on average eight microporous channels (n=8), confirmed via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Supplementary Figs 1, 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Argon adsorptiondesorption measurements of the self-assembled pristine NPs (micro and mesoporous) allowed determination of the specific surface areas for all NPs in a sample (S=76 m2 g1, Smicro=38 m2 g1), and the diameters of micropores and mesopores (Dmicro=1.1 nm, Dmeso=18 nm) (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the construction of a single layer of macromesomicroporous Murray network using microporous ZnO NPs with the above parameters, the macroporous wall width l should be 502 nm according to equation (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evaporation-driven self-assembly of the NPs dispersed in hexane was used to obtain the macromesomicroporous film with the required macroporous structures on various substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Holes induced by the spontaneous evaporation of hexane could nucleate and expand, forming macroporous rings28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NPs are pushed to the edges and aggregated by the expanding holes, resulting in compact walls composed of mesopores between the NPs30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For self-assembling 30 nm microporous ZnO NPs at room temperature, we find that the distribution density of vapour holes and their expansion range are strongly influenced by the ZnO concentration in hexane, varying from 0.03125 to 0.5 mg ml1 (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, the inter-particle mesoporosity remains invariable during the EDSA process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After tuning the ZnO concentration, a layer of Murray material with a well-defined macroporous network and wall width l of 0.5 m and macropore diameter Dmacro of 1 m is obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For building a three-dimensional (3D) Murray macromesomicroporous network with the above parameters following equation (1), the required film thickness is h 885 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could be achieved using a layer-by-layer deposition technique (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3a shows a macromesomicroporous network realized via layer-by-layer evaporation-driven self-assembly of ZnO NPs from a 0.25 mg ml1 suspension in hexane on a carbon-coated TEM grid (inset of Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A large area with open 1 m diameter macropores is clearly observed, accompanied by many net-like walls along the rims, with an average width of 0.5 m (l) (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under higher magnification, these compact walls are found to be constructed from numerous closely packed NPs, resulting in an inter-particle mesoporous space of 18 nm (Dmeso) (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, numerous open micropores in the NPs are observed with 1 nm pore diameter (Dmicro; Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A high-resolution TEM lattice image shows the crystallized pores and lattice fringes, with an adjacent fringe spacing of 1.91 Å (inset in Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This corresponds to the (102) planes for hcp ZnO, in agreement with the XRD data analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TEM observation confirms that this hierarchical macromesomicroporosity is topographically highly interconnected throughout one solid body, resulting in fully open macroporous networks branched by surrounding mesoporous channels, which are further extended by the internal micropores in NPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The synthesized material containing porous channels with increasing numbers and reducing diameters shows bio-mimetic space-filling fractal-like pores following Murrays Law, which are expected to endow the structure with greatly improved mass transfer and exchange.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3e shows a 3D vascularized porous network with a 0.9 m thickness, after layer-by-layer deposition on a Si wafer (ZnO MMM,

intrusion measurements confirmed a macropore distribution centred at 1 m (Dmacro; Fig 3j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Argon adsorptiondesorption isotherms analysed via the BarrettJoynerHalenda model26,27 reveal a narrow mesopore distribution with a mean size of 18 nm (Dmeso) (Fig 3k), corresponding to the inter-particle space of 3D closely packed microporous NPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This spacing is consistent with that determined from grazing-incidence small-angle x-ray scattering measurements (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Micropores with 1.1 nm size (Dmicro) within the NPs are elucidated from the low relative pressure region of the argon adsorption isotherm using the non-local density functional theory method31 (Fig 3l).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pore-size measurements are based on the model of circular porous channels, consistent with the pore model in Murrays law8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pore characterization results confirm that the pore size ratios for macromesopores and mesomicropores are very close to Murrays regularity in equations (1) and (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the synthetic Murray material is expected to greatly favour mass transfer for applications where mass diffusion or ion transfer is the dominant transport process8,9,10,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is demonstrated in the following section, through example applications in photocatalysis, gas sensing and Li-storage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZnO with mesomicropores (MM) built by identical microporous NPs and 19 nm mesopores, and ZnO with only mesopores (M) built by 30 nm solid NPs and mesopores of 22 nm, and purchased bulk ZnO (Methods, Supplementary Methods, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figs 6 and 7) are used as standards for performance comparisons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Application examples', 'Figure 4a presents the photocatalytic efficiencies of different ZnO samples for the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) under ultraviolet irradiation (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the ZnO NPs submerged in an aqueous solution of RhB are irradiated by ultraviolet light, they absorb photons and react with the H2O molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This produces hydroxyl radical species ·OH which decompose RhB32,33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diffusion of RhB and ·OH with reaction products (through the porous networks) is a dominant transfer process that influences the degradation rate34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rates can be obtained from the slope of plots of ln(C/C0) versus irradiation time, since the photocatalytic degradation profiles are consistent with a pseudo-first-order kinetic model34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the Murray network architecture for mass diffusion and exchange, our vascularized micromesomacroporous ZnO (ZnO MMM) shows an extremely high degradation rate: 2.5 times higher than that of micromesoporous ZnO (ZnO MM) containing two level Murray regularity, 5 times higher than that of ZnO containing only mesoporosity (ZnO M), and 17 times higher than that of the ZnO bulk sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared to ZnO MM with an equivalent specific surface area (76 m2 g1), the macropores connecting to mesopores with Murray regularity in ZnO MMM increase the degradation rate by 2.5 times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be attributed to a boosted mass transfer in macromesomicroporous Murray networks35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Highly enhanced accessibility of diffusing species to the films were further confirmed by monitoring the dark adsorption kinetics of RhB in agreement with a pseudo-first-order model36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reveals that ZnO MMM delivered a 2.5 times faster adsorption rate of RhB than ZnO MM (Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photocatalysis, inspired by plants for photosynthesis with Murray networks, has widely been used for degrading organic pollutants based on fully dispersed nano-semiconductors37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a 3D Murray network inspired from photosynthetic leaves, the relative photocatalytic rate of ZnO MMM is comparable to that of fully dispersed ZnO NPs (25 nm) via stirring in a RhB solution with the best photocatalytic activity ever reported for ZnO nanomaterials32,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to
