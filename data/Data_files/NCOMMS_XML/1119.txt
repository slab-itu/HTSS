Microwave-free nuclear magnetic resonance at molecular scales  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The implementation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) at the nanoscale is a major challenge, as the resolution of conventional methods is limited to mesoscopic scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approaches based on quantum spin probes, such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond, have achieved nano-NMR under ambient conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the measurement protocols require application of complex microwave pulse sequences of high precision and relatively high power, placing limitations on the design and scalability of these techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate NMR on a nanoscale organic environment of proton spins using the NV centre while eliminating the need for microwave manipulation of either the NV or the environmental spin states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show that the sensitivity of our significantly simplified approach matches that of existing techniques using the NV centre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Removing the requirement for coherent manipulation while maintaining measurement sensitivity represents a significant step towards the development of robust, non-invasive nanoscale NMR probes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The discovery of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and its related technologies, was one of the great scientific achievements of the twentieth century, contributing to significant advances in areas ranging from materials science to healthcare.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the limitation in sensitivity of traditional induction-based detection has required the development of different detection schemes in order to extend NMR technology to the nanoscale, where the study of processes at the molecular scale is of intense interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond1 has seen remarkable developments as a high-sensitivity nanoscale magnetometer2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In recent years, the NV centre has been utilized to achieve nanoscale NMR at sensitivities close to that required for single-proton detection11,12,13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its room-temperature operation also makes it an ideal candidate for biological nano-NMR17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, current NMR protocols using the NV centre require the application of complex, high-power and high-precision microwave pulsing sequences in order to filter the environmental spectrum, placing significant constraints on nano-magnetic resonance imaging applications19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The application of strong microwave pulses is potentially invasive given the attendant electric fields as an inevitable by-product in the generation of the magnetic control fields20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, achieving such quantum control on a large ensemble of NV centres over a wide field of view21, or on a scanning probe microscopy tip22,23,24, remains a challenge due to the requirement for homogeneity in the driving field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the adaptability of such high-precision control to dynamic environments such as in vitro17 is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this work, we demonstrate microwave-free nano-NMR on a nanoscopic sample of proton nuclear spins within an organic sample external to the diamond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We achieve this via static field tuning to the natural spin interactions between sensor and target, and measure a change in the longitudinal relaxation time, T1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting all-optical microwave-free protocol can be applied in a non-invasive manner (for example, through optical excitation constrained within the diamond using total internal reflection26), significantly widening the range of applications where NV-based nano-NMR can be used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate the microwave-free NMR technique using both isotopic forms 14NV and 15NV, which exhibit different fundamental characteristics in this context, and use the data to estimate the NV-sample distance (1012 nm for the studied NVs), as well as the number of protons detected ( less_than 105).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we directly compare our microwave-free nano-NMR to the prevailing microwave control based nano-NMR technique, and find that both approaches offer comparable sensitivity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Principle of T1-based NMR', 'The microwave-free technique for magnetic resonance spectroscopy is based on T1 relaxometry detection7,27,28,29,30 and precise magnetic field tuning to bring the NV into resonance with the Zeeman split target spin transitions31,32,33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This technique was proposed and demonstrated for quantitative electron spin resonance spectroscopy using an ensemble of NV centres25 and extended to hyperfine-coupled nuclear spin spectroscopy with single NV centres35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ultimate goal of nano-NMR is the spectroscopic detection of bare nuclear spins in molecular systems (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without the assistance of strong hyperfine coupling this is a significant challenge due to the low nuclear magnetic moment35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Applying the T1-NMR technique to this problem requires the precise tuning of the NV probe to near its ground state level anti-crossing (GSLAC), where the systems dynamics are dominated by a relatively complex landscape of electronnuclear spin mixing36,37,38, in order to bring the electronic NV transitions into resonance with the nuclear spin transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a resonance point (which in principle could occur both before and after the GSLAC as depicted in Fig 1b), the longitudinal relaxation time T1 of both the NV centre and the environmental spin(s) are significantly reduced, due to their mutual dipoledipole interaction25,33,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To probe these resonances, the strength, B, of a static background magnetic field aligned with the NV quantization axis, is swept near the GSLAC (B1,024 G) and the T1 decay is optically measured at each corresponding transition frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Principle of microwave-free nano-nuclear magnetic resonance.

target spins can exchange energy via their mutual magnetic dipoledipole interaction, causing an increase in their respective longitudinal relaxation rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) The measurement sequence

range considered), is set by the sum of the contributions of all resonant target spins, .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contribution of each ith spin can be expressed as35', '', 'where NV and t are the gyromagnetic ratios of the NV and target spins, respectively; i is the polar angle of separation between the two spins relative to the quantization axis; ri is the separation distance;  is the total

valid when the intrinsic relaxation (1,int) is dominated by magnetic noise acting on the |0|1 transition, which is generally the case near the GSLAC (Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimentally, rather than recording a full curve IPL(), it is generally sufficient to probe a single, well chosen value of , from which one can retrieve 1,tot(B) using equation (2), provided I0 and are initially calibrated via measurement of a full decay trace IPL(,B) at a given B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a single-point T1 measurement is done via an initialize, wait, and read-out scheme (Fig 1c), without any microwave pulsing of either the NV spin or target spin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the relaxation rate induced by each target spin, expressed by equation (1), has a different overall angular dependence for the two resonances before and after the GSLAC, as illustrated in Fig 1d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference allows  to be inferred, in the case of a single target spin, by directly comparing the transition strengths on either side of the GSLAC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The simplified picture of resonances near the GSLAC shown in Fig 1b is in reality modified by hyperfine interactions within the NV centre, associated with the nitrogen nuclear spin which is either 14N (spin-1) or 15N (spin-1/2)36,37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While sensing experiments generally use implanted 15NV centres, as they can be distinguished from native centres of the most abundant isotope, 14N (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39), it has become apparent from recent experiments36 that 14NV and 15NV centres present distinct differences when considering their application for T1-NMR spectroscopy due to their different GSLAC electron-nuclear state mixing properties36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, both isotopic forms of the NV probe were investigated in this work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Nano-NMR detection of 1H spins', 'To demonstrate T1-based NMR, a custom-built confocal microscope was used, incorporating a permanent magnet mounted on a 3-axis scanning stage to precisely control the applied background field35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diamond sample comprises a high purity CVD homoepitaxial layer, grown in a Seki AX6500 diamond reactor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample was implanted firstly with 3.5 keV 15N+ ions and then with 3.5 keV 14N+ ions (expected implantation depth in the range 515 nm (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  40)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both implants were done to a dose of 0.5 × 109 cm2 and this was followed by annealing in vacuum at 800 °C and acid cleaning in a boiling mixture of sulfuric acid and sodium nitrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diamond has a (100) surface, so that the NV centres have their symmetry axis at 54.7° to the surface normal (Fig 1a,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NV centres were identified as either 15NV or 14NV via their characteristic hyperfine splittings under low-power optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR)39,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a standard proton sample, we used either the oil employed with the oil-immersion objective lens, or a layer of Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) deposited on the diamond surface11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We first report the results of T1-NMR using a 14NV centre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ODMR spectrum as a function of the background field strength (B) around 1024 G is shown in Fig 2a, revealing a characteristic GSLAC structure resulting from hyperfine couplings and dynamic polarization of the NV nuclear spin36,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NV transitions are shown as black lines, while the 1H spin transition is shown in green and corresponds to a Larmor frequency H4.4 MHz in this range of fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the NV avoided crossing before the GSLAC, there is only one measurable resonance point with 1H (green dot in Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To probe this resonance, the PL intensity is measured as a function of B, using evolution times =1 s, which serves as reference for normalization (as no T1 decay is expected at such time scale), and =200 s, optimized to probe the 1H resonance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the instance of an unknown signal frequency and strength, a scan with an evolution time of  would give optimal

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In summary, we have demonstrated the detection of proton spins external to a diamond using a microwave-free nano-NMR technique based on T1 relaxometry of a single NV centre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the electron-nuclear spin physics near the NV GSLAC are relatively complex, we have shown that the microwave-free T1 protocol can nevertheless be implemented and the 1H resonances observed, which we have demonstrated using both isotopic forms of the NV centre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we have shown a sensitivity comparable to an existing nano-NMR protocol which requires quantum state manipulation via microwave excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sensitivity as well as the spectral resolution of our approach could be improved via engineering of the diamond surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the resulting all-optical technique can be implemented using non-invasive excitation constrained within the diamond, using total internal reflection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The removal of microwave quantum control eliminates the possibility of spurious harmonics within the measurement and opens up applications in areas where such control is inherently difficult to achieve and/or invasive, such as spectroscopic imaging over wide fields of view or in scanning probe microscopy experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, it is worth mentioning that the demonstrated T1 protocol can be used not only for sensing but also to hyperpolarise the target nuclear spins via spin transfer, which may have important applications in medical NMR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'All relevant data are available from the authors on request.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
