Linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex coordinates late thymic T-cell differentiation and regulatory T-cell homeostasis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) is essential for innate immunity in mice and humans, yet its role in adaptive immunity is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that the LUBAC components HOIP, HOIL-1 and SHARPIN have essential roles in late thymocyte differentiation, FOXP3+ regulatory T (Treg)-cell development and Treg cell homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LUBAC activity is not required to prevent TNF-induced apoptosis or necroptosis but is necessary for the transcriptional programme of the penultimate stage of thymocyte differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treg cell-specific ablation of HOIP causes severe Treg cell deficiency and lethal immune pathology, revealing an ongoing requirement of LUBAC activity for Treg cell homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data reveal stage-specific requirements for LUBAC in coordinating the signals required for T-cell differentiation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The thymus orchestrates the differentiation of haematopoietic precursors into diverse T-cell sub-lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These lineages include conventional T-cell receptor (TCR) CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, Forkhead box-P3+ (FOXP3+) regulatory T (Treg) cells, natural killer T (NKT) cells, TCR T cells and CD8 T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A major determinant of cell fate is the specificity of the newly rearranged TCR for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) or MHC-like molecules presenting self-constituents, yet this stimulus alone is not sufficient to elaborate the many different T-cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T-cell differentiation is also influenced by cytokine receptors, members of the tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily, chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, precisely how these various cues are integrated to coordinate T-cell differentiation is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Positive selection rescues double-positive (DP) thymocytes from death-by-neglect and initiates the largest transcriptional re-programming in T-cell differentiation1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The upregulation of the CC chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7) mediates the migration of thymocytes from the cortex to the medulla as they differentiate into CD4+ or CD8+ single-positive (SP) cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During residency in the medulla2, SP thymocytes undergo further maturation that involves a switch in TCR responses from apoptosis to proliferation and acquisition of the capacity to emigrate from the thymus3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Few of the stimuli that drive this maturation are known, although the nuclear factor-B (NF-B) pathway and interleukin (IL)-7 receptor signalling are important3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Treg cells are a potent immune modulatory subset of CD4+ T cells that emerge during the late stage of thymocyte differentiation6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The integration of cues from the TCR, members of the TNFR superfamily and cytokine receptors (mainly the IL-2 receptor) culminate in the expression of the key transcription factor, FOXP3 (refs 7, 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NF-B signalling pathway is critical for Treg cell differentiation, in particular, c-REL is necessary to consolidate FOXP3 expression to enable Treg cell proliferation6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the periphery, Treg cells continue to rely on TCR and co-stimulatory inputs for their proliferation and differentiation into the various effector states that are required for proper immune regulation9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) is composed of at least three proteins: ring finger protein 31 (RNF31/HOIP), RanBP-type and C3HC4-type zinc finger containing 1 (RBCK1/HOIL-1) and SHANK-associated RH domain interacting protein (SHARPIN/SIPL1)12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LUBAC can regulate diverse cell signalling pathways by catalysing the addition of linear ubiquitin chains to substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Innate and adaptive immune responses depend on LUBAC activity downstream of TNFR1, NOD2, TLR, NLRP3, TCR and B-cell receptor ligation13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These signals involve the linear ubiquitination of NEMO to reinforce canonical NF-B signalling, although it is likely to be that other LUBAC substrates exist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of LUBAC activity drives cells into apoptosis or necroptosis following exposure to TNF, lymphotoxin  or genotoxic stress15,16,17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All three LUBAC components are required for maximal linear ubiquitination; however, not all components are equal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although HOIP deficiency alone completely ablates LUBAC activity18,19, SHARPIN-deficient cells still display substantial linear ubiquitination, because HOIL/HOIP complexes are able to sustain significant LUBAC function17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these observations, HOIP-deficient mice are embryonic lethal18, whereas the SHARPIN-deficient mice from the chronic proliferative dermatitis mutation (cpdm) strain (hereafter referred to as Sharpincpdm mice) are born viable, but succumb to severe dermatitis at 1214 weeks of age20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Patients with loss-of-function mutations in RBCK1 (encoding HOIL-1) or RNF31 (encoding HOIP) exhibit impaired NF-B responses, defects in B-cell activation and hyper-responsiveness of monocytes to IL-1, the latter presumably driving auto-inflammatory disease22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These patients also had evidence of T-cell defects, including low thymic output and decreased TCR+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which exhibit poor proliferative responses to mitogens and antigens22,23, but whether these defects represent T-cell intrinsic defects is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we examine the requirement for each LUBAC component in T-cell and Treg cell lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data reveal that LUBAC components play pivotal roles in late thymocyte differentiation of conventional T cells, non-conventional T cells and Treg cell homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LUBAC activity is necessary for the transcriptional programming of late thymocyte differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the distinct requirements for HOIL and HOIP versus SHARPIN in linear ubiquitination, the T-cell defects observed are more severe with HOIL-1 or HOIP deficiency compared with Sharpin deficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data highlight previously unappreciated roles for LUBAC in T-cell biology.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'LUBAC activity is required for thymic T-cell differentiation', 'To determine whether T-cell differentiation requires LUBAC activity, we used loss-of-function genetic models for each of the three known components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a Cd4Cre transgene to induce conditional excision of loxP-flanked alleles of Rnf31 (the gene encoding HOIP) or Rbck1 (the gene encoding HOIL-1) to create mice with T-lineage-specific deletion (hereafter termed HoipCd4 or HoilCd4, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of the third LUBAC component was investigated using Sharpincpdm mice, which lack SHARPIN in all cells and were analysed before the development of extensive skin pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The peripheral immune organs of HoipCd4 and HoilCd4 mice were almost completely devoid of CD8+ and CD4+ TCR+ T cells (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the proportions of FOXP3+ Treg cells among TCR+ CD4+ T cells were normal in HoipCd4 and HoilCd4 mice, their number was greatly reduced, in line with the overall T-cell deficiency (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The residual TCR+ T cells in HoipCd4 and HoilCd4 mice were predominantly CD44hi CD62Llo (Fig 1c,d), suggestive of an activated/effector phenotype that is often associated with homeostatic expansion during lymphopenia24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the numbers, proportions and activation status of conventional CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in Sharpincpdm mice were comparable to controls (Fig 1ad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with recent reports25,26, we observed that Treg cells were reduced in Sharpincpdm mice, although to a much lesser extent compared with the HoipCd4 and HoilCd4 mice (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that the LUBAC components HOIL-1 and HOIP are necessary for conventional CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell differentiation, and that SHARPIN is dispensable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Absence of HOIP or HOIL-1 causes T-cell deficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Flow cytometry of splenic cells from

selection thymocytes (CD69low/high MHC Ilow) were comparable among all strains (Fig 3b), with normal numbers of CD4+CD8low/intermediate cells27 progressing through differentiation (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, both HoipCd4 and HoilCd4 mice exhibited specific loss of the late selection/mature subsets (CD69high MHC Ihigh and CD69low MHC Ihigh, termed Fractions 4 and 5, ref.

differentiation into the Treg cell lineage following high-avidity TCR stimulation29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We noted a marked reduction in the proportions and numbers of HELIOShigh FOXP3 CCR7+ CD4SP in HoipCd4, HoilCd4 and Sharpincpdm mice compared with controls (Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, CD5 levels (a surrogate marker of TCR signal strength) in mice lacking LUBAC components were comparable to those seen in controls (data not shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that the reduction in HELIOShigh FOXP3 CCR7+ CD4SP cells in mice lacking LUBAC components was not associated with altered TCR signal strength but rather impaired induction of differentiation programmes parallel to or downstream of high-avidity TCR signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interactions between maturing thymocytes and thymic epithelial cells are essential for the induction of a normal thymic medulla, primarily via the provision of ligands for members of the TNFR superfamily that are expressed by the epithelium30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the possibility that defects in the thymic microenvironment might contribute to the block in SP thymocyte differentiation observed in HoipCd4 and HoilCd4 mice, we created irradiation chimeras reconstituted with 50:50 mixtures of haematopoietic precursors from the mutant mice with CD45.1+ congenically marked wild-type (WT) mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the double-negative (DN) and DP thymocyte precursor populations showed 4050% representation of the CD45.2+ HoipCd4 or HoilCd4 compartments, there was a specific loss of CD45.2+ cells at the CD8SP, CD4SP CCR7+ wave 2 and FOXP3+ Treg cell stages (Fig 3g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Virtually, no HOIP- or HOIL-1-deficient T-lineage cells were detected in the periphery of these chimeras (Fig 3g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data demonstrate that the requirement for LUBAC activity is T-cell intrinsic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We then tested whether LUBAC deficiency was causing apoptosis of SP thymocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LUBAC activity might be required to prevent induction of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins or to upregulate pro-survival BCL-2 proteins downstream of TCR signalling31, or in response to DNA damage15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we tested whether the complete ablation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis would rescue T-cell differentiation in HoipCd4 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The multi-BH domain pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins BAX and BAK are essential for the mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization that executes this pathway of apoptosis32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extensive redundancy between BAX and BAK, and the early lethality observed in Bax/Bak/ mice necessitated conditional deletion of Bax using Cd4Cre on a Bak/ background to induce T-cell-specific ablation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the DN block observed in Bax/Bak/ haematopoietic chimeras33 was bypassed in BaxCd4Bak/ mice, yet expansion of CD4SP, CD8SP and mature DN thymocytes, and increased percentages of peripheral T cells were observed (Fig 3h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The compound loss of BAX and BAK in HoipCd4 mice did not restore late-stage thymocyte differentiation or peripheral T cells (Fig 3h and data not shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that LUBAC was neither required to antagonize thymocyte deletion nor to transduce pro-survival signals to block the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'NF-B signalling is partially impaired by LUBAC deficiency', 'Previous studies found that LUBAC is critical for optimal NF-B activation downstream of immune receptor signalling in B-cell lymphomas and Jurkat T cells by associating with the CARD11/BCL-10/MALT1 (CBM) complex34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we compared the kinetics and extent of activation of the NF-B pathway following CD3/CD28 stimulation of thymocytes from HoilCd4, Sharpincpdm and control mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The degradation of inhibitor of B (IB) is a hallmark of NF-B activation and was apparent within 0.5 h of CD3/CD28 stimulation of control thymocytes (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in CD3/CD28-stimulated thymocytes from HoilCd4 mice, IB degradation was delayed (Fig 4a), suggesting that loss of this LUBAC component caused defects in NF-B activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the kinetics of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation following CD3/CD28 stimulation of HoilCd4 and Sharpincpdm thymocytes was comparable to controls (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these data show that LUBAC is involved in transducing TCR-dependent NF-B signals in thymocytes, this defect is unlikely to explain the block in late-stage thymocyte differentiation observed in HoilCd4 and HoipCd4 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of CARD11, BCL10 or MALT1 completely blocks NF-B activation following TCR stimulation of thymocytes, yet these defects do not impair conventional T-cell development (for example, see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these findings suggest a requirement for LUBAC in thymocyte differentiation beyond NF-B activation downstream of TCR and the CBM complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we tested whether LUBAC was also required in thymocytes for NF-B activation downstream of stimulation of TNFR family members.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TNF stimulation of WT thymocytes induced phosphorylation of p65 (RELA) within 5 min and degradation of IB within 15 min (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HOIL-1 or HOIP deficiency reduced and delayed TNF-induced p65 phosphorylation and IB degradation (Fig 4b).

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'These data reveal an essential, cell intrinsic role for LUBAC in multiple aspects of T-cell differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HOIP and HOIL-1 were required for the differentiation of conventional T cells, FOXP3+ Treg cells and NKT cells in the thymus (in HoipCd4 and HoilCd4 mice) and maintenance of Treg cells in the periphery (in HoipFoxp3 mice).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that the T-cell deficiency observed in patients with loss-of-function mutations affecting HOIL and HOIP is a primary defect22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thymic phenotypes caused by loss of HOIL or HOIP are reminiscent of those observed with T-cell-specific deletion of NEMO47 or TAK1 (refs 5, 48, 49) and align well with the interactions described between LUBAC and these components of NF-B signalling13,14,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, constitutive activation of the NF-B pathway only partially rescued these defects in HOIP-deficient thymocytes, suggesting additional roles for LUBAC in thymocyte differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By contrast, SHARPIN deficiency had a relatively mild impact on T-cell differentiation; SP maturation was normal but HELIOS upregulation in CD4SP was impaired, and numbers of Treg precursors and differentiated thymic FOXP3+CD25+ Treg cells markedly reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These distinct phenotypes are likely to reflect the relative roles of HOIP and SHARPIN in linear ubiquitination; loss of HOIP completely ablates linear ubiquitination following TNF stimulation, yet SHARPIN deficiency only partially impairs LUBAC activity (refs 17, 18, 19, our unpublished data).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, HOIL-1/HOIP complexes would sustain sufficient LUBAC function to support conventional thymocyte and NKT cell differentiation, yet optimal LUBAC activity (including SHARPIN) is necessary for the Treg cell sub-lineage, which is more heavily reliant on NF-B signals6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'LUBAC is likely to coordinate signals from several stimuli essential for T-cell differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a role for LUBAC in mediating B-cell receptor- and TCR-driven NF-B signals via interactions with the CBM has been described34,35, the normal T-cell differentiation observed in CARD11-, BCL10- or MALT1-deficient mice (for example, see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36) and our data showing that constitutive active IKK2 cannot restore peripheral T cells suggest that there are other LUBAC-dependent signals downstream of the TCR that are required for SP thymocyte maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, a role for SHARPIN has been implicated in JNK and ERK activation downstream of TCR signals25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another possibility is that LUBAC is required to transduce signals from other cell surface receptors critical for SP maturation, such as members of the TNFR superfamily.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This scenario may be particularly pertinent to the defects observed in HELIOS upregulation and thymic Treg differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GITR, TNFR2 and OX40 play important, redundant roles in the intra-thymic differentiation of Treg cells that have received high affinity TCR signals8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data indicating that LUBAC has an important role in TNFR signalling in thymocytes support the notion that TNFR superfamily signals might also be important for the final stages of conventional T-cell differentiation in the thymus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this context, an important LUBAC function in several cell types is the inhibition of death receptor-mediated apoptosis or necroptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SHARPIN deficiency can predispose cells to caspase-8-dependent apoptosis or necroptosis, the latter via a pathway involving RIP3K and MLKL in cells receiving TNF signals17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several lines of evidence suggest that induction of these cell death pathways does not account for the T-cell developmental defects we observed: (1) simultaneous genetic ablation of both of these cell death pathways did not rescue the impaired generation of thymic Treg cells in Sharpincpdm mice or the block in conventional thymocyte differentiation in HoipCd4 mice; (2) HOIL-1-, HOIP- and SHARPIN-deficient thymocytes were not predisposed to TNF-induced cell death; (3) pharmacologic inhibition of apoptosis or necroptosis did not alter thymocyte viability; and (4) TNF blockade in vivo did not rescue thymocyte differentiation in HoipCd4 mice or the loss of Treg cells in HoipFoxp3 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data contrast recent findings that TNF deficiency could restore late thymocyte differentiation in IKK-deficient mice51 or TAK1-deficient mice5 and suggest roles for LUBAC beyond inhibiting TNF-induced cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the failure of combined BAX/BAK deletion to rescue SP thymocyte maturation in HoipCd4 mice provides evidence that LUBAC activity is not required to antagonize thymocyte deletion triggered by BH3-only proteins or to mediate cytokine-derived survival programmes (such as IL-7 or IL-2), stimuli that affect the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we cannot exclude that alternative cell death pathways might be activated in LUBAC-deficient thymocytes, it is likely to be that LUBAC transduces other signals necessary for the transcriptional programmes guiding conventional T-cell and Treg cell differentiation in the thymus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The partial rescue of thymocyte maturation observed in HoipCd4IKKca mice suggests that LUBAC-mediated NF-B activation is important, but not sufficient to drive the final stages of thymocyte differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our transcriptional analysis comparing postpositive selection thymocytes from HoipCd4 and Sharpincpdm mice suggests a prominent role for pathways regulating cytokine responsiveness and metabolic fitness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies will establish how LUBAC activity influences these pathways, but it is likely to be that this role also extends to peripheral Treg cell homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deletion of HOIP following the thymic differentiation of FOXP3+ cells caused near-complete loss of peripheral Treg cells, establishing a cell intrinsic requirement for ongoing LUBAC activity in this lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The kinetics of the ensuing immunopathology was much swifter compared with that observed in mice lacking the pro-survival BCL-2 family member, MCL-1, specifically in Treg cells52, but was similar to that seen in Foxp3-deficient scurfy mutant mice44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding indicates an acute requirement for continued LUBAC-dependent signalling in Treg cells following their export to the periphery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We conclude that LUBAC is essential for coordinating multiple signals required for the differentiation and homeostasis of conventional and non-conventional T-cell types required for adaptive immunity and tolerance.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

used as standards.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'RNA sequencing', 'Thymocytes were prepared from three mice of each genotype (WT, HoilCd4 and Sharpincpdm), and CD69+ MHC Ilow and CD69+ MHC Ihigh cells were FACS purified on a MoFlo cell sorter (Beckman Coulter), with a dump channel to gate out PI+, CD25+, CD44+, NK1.1+, B220+, MHC II+, Gr1+, Mac-1+ and TCR+ cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sorted cells were preserved in RNAlater (ThermoFisher Scientific) and frozen at 80 °C, then RNA was isolated with RNeasyPlus Mini kit (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Messenger RNA reverse transcription and complementary DNA libraries were prepared using the TruSeq RNA Sample preparation kit (Illumina) following the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indexed sample libraries were subjected to 75 base single-end sequencing

(mm10) using the subread aligner58 implemented in the Rsubread software package.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene-level read counts were obtained using featureCounts59 and its inbuild mm10 annotation, which includes Entrez gene ID, chromosome and gene length information, corresponding to the NCBI RefSeq annotations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene annotation was obtained from the NCBI Mus musculus gene info file (downloaded 25 September 2015).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analysis used the edgeR60 and limma61 software packages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes were filtered as not expressed if they failed to show at least 0.5 count per million reads in at least 3 samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As there are female and male mice in this experiment, genes from chromosome Y and the gene Xist were filtered out so as to correct for gender effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Predicted genes and the genes without official gene symbols were also filtered out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TMM scale normalization62 was applied and read counts were transformed to log2 counts per million with a prior count of 1 using the edgeR cpm function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Linear models were used to test for expression differences between different genotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Empirical array quality weights were estimated to allow for differences in quality between the RNA samples63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each mouse was treated as a random block, allowing for correlation between CD69+ MHC Ilow and CD69+ MHC Ihigh cells from the same mouse64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differential expression between genotypes were assessed using empirical Bayes moderated t-statistics, allowing for an abundance trend in the s.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and for robust estimation of Bayesian hyperparameters65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Benjamini and Hochberg method66 was used to adjust the P-values so as to control the false discovery rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A list of NF-B target genes was obtained from http://www.bu.edu/nf-kb/gene-resources/target-genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of steps were required to convert the various gene identifiers to mouse Entrez Gene IDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where possible, gene aliases were converted to current official human gene symbols using the Bioconductor annotation package, org.Hs.eg.db.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Otherwise, human RefSeq accession numbers were converted to human symbols using org.Hs.eg.db and mouse RefSeq accession numbers were converted to mouse Entrez Gene IDs using org.Mm.eg.db.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, human symbols were mapped to mouse Entrez Gene IDs using the Jackson Laboratory mousehuman orthologue table downloaded December 2012 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  67) and the NCBI mousehuman homologue table downloaded August 2013.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NF-B target genes that were differentially expressed at 5% false discovery rate between CD69+ MHC Ihigh versus CD69+ MHC Ilow cells in WT mice were then used for gene-set testing between CD69+ MHC Ihigh versus CD69+ MHC Ilow in Sharpin and between CD69+ MHC Ihigh versus CD69+ MHC Ilow in HOIL-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene-set testing was conducted using limmas roast function68, with 9,999 residual rotations and the same linear model settings as for the differential expression
