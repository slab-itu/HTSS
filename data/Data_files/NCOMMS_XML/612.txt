Structural and quantum chemical analysis of exciton coupling in homo- and heteroaggregate stacks of merocyanines  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Exciton coupling is of fundamental importance and determines functional properties of organic dyes in (opto-)electronic and photovoltaic devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that strong exciton coupling is not limited to the situation of equal chromophores as often assumed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quadruple dye stacks were obtained from two bis(merocyanine) dyes with same or different chromophores, respectively, which dimerize in less-polar solvents resulting in the respective homo- and heteroaggregates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structures of the quadruple dye stacks were assigned by NMR techniques and unambiguously confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heteroaggregate stack formed from the bis(merocyanine) bearing two different chromophores exhibits remarkably different ultraviolet/vis absorption bands compared with those of the homoaggregate of the bis(merocyanine) comprising two identical chromophores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantum chemical analysis based on an extension of Kashas exciton theory appropriately describes the absorption properties of both types of stacks revealing strong exciton coupling also between different chromophores within the heteroaggregate.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The molecular exciton theory pioneered by Kasha1 and Davydov2 in the 1960s has contributed tremendously to the understanding of the optical properties of dye aggregates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, in the last decades, a plethora of dye aggregates3,4,5,6,7,8 have been realized and considerable efforts have been invested to rationalize the optical properties of dye self-assemblies based on exciton coupling9,10,11,12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these research activities are mainly focused on homoaggregates (that is, dye aggregates comprising the same type of chromophores), while heteroaggregates with different types of chromophores have rarely been approached15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is actually quite surprising since self-assembly of different chromophores into heteroaggregates can lead to systems with exceptional properties that cannot be achieved by using chromophores of the same type17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, it is often a common perception that exciton coupling between different types of chromophores is weak, and thus changes of the optical properties of heteroaggregates are supposed to be insignificant19, or arise only from exciton coupling between the same type of chromophores within the heteroaggregates20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the contrary, optical evidence for strong coupling between different chromophores was reported for head-to-tail connected squaraine dye co-polymers21 as well as for mixed films composed of different dyes22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Very recently, we have also communicated that intramolecular exciton coupling between two different chromophores within a bis(merocyanine) foldamer is quite strong leading to significant changes in absorption properties of the dyes24, which motivates for further investigations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Reliable studies on the exciton coupling require distinct orientations and distances between the chromophores, which is difficult to realize for self-assembled supramolecular aggregates of -conjugated dyes because the prevailing dispersion interactions between -systems often enable various --stacking arrangements of similar energy25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, more sophisticated strategies are needed to obtain discrete -stacks like, for example, the usage of coordination cages27, co-crystallization with appropriate spacer molecules28 or organic molecular beam epitaxy29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, merocyanine dyes are promising as they enable the design of well-defined aggregate structures due to their dipolar nature that results in strong dipoledipole interactions with high directionality30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, this class of dyes tend to self-assembly in non-polar solvents forming dye stacks with an antiparallel orientation of the chromophores, leading to an annihilation of the overall dipole moment of the dye stack limiting the size of the aggregates31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way well-defined aggregate structures can be obtained, which can act as model systems for studies on exciton coupling between chromophores within a stack.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Keeping this in mind, we have designed bis(merocyanine) dyes 1 and 2 in which two merocyanine chromophores of same or different conjugation lengths are tethered by a rigid naphthalene spacer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, both bis(merocyanine) dyes self-assemble into highly defined dimer aggregates in less-polar solvents resulting in stacks of four chromophores, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While for the symmetric bis(merocyanine) 1 only one type of dimer structure is possible, that is, homodimer, in principle three different types of heterodimers can be formed by self-assembly of the unsymmetric bis(merocyanine) 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the purpose of structural elucidation of the predominantly formed heteroaggregate by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, an ethyl group was attached to the thiophene unit of the short chromophore of bis(merocyanine) 2, which self-assembles exclusively into heterodimers with the long chromophores located in the interior and the shorter ones in the terminal of the quadruple stack.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structures of the homo- and heteroaggregate dimers have been assigned by different NMR techniques and unambiguously confirmed in the solid state by X-ray analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heteroaggregate dye stacks exhibit unexpected absorption spectral features compared with those of the respective monomeric dyes and the homoaggregate stacks indicating strong exciton couplings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simulated absorption spectra of the homo- and heteroaggregate dimers obtained by time-dependent DFT calculations (TDDFT) resemble the respective experimental spectra and their spectral differences could be rationalized by extending Kashas exciton theory to heteroaggregates revealing strong exciton coupling also between different types of chromophores within the quadruple dye stack of bis(merocyanine) 2.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Synthesis', 'The symmetric bis(merocyanine) 1 (Fig 1a) was synthesized via Knoevenagel condensation reaction of literature known napthalenedimethylene-bridged bis(pyridone) 3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31) and aminothiophene 4 (refs 32, 33; Fig 1c) in 55% yield.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The synthesis of the unsymmetrical bis(merocyanine) 2 (Fig 1b) bearing two different merocyanine chromophores that are tethered by the same spacer unit as in 1 could also be accomplished by condensation of bis(pyridone) 3 with the aminothiophenes 5 and 6 in a one-pot reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While aminothiophene 6 is literature known34, the unknown derivative 5 was synthesized in three steps starting with the commercially available 3-ethylthiophene 7 as outlined in Fig 1c (bottom).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first step, VilsmaierHaack formylation of 7 according to a literature known procedure35 led to the formation of a 3:1 regioisomeric mixture of 3-ethylthiophene-2-carboxaldehyde 8 and 4-ethylthiophene-2-carboxaldehyde 9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The undesired regioisomer 9 could not be separated by column chromatography due to similar polarity of both isomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the obtained mixture was brominated to give the corresponding regioisomeric bromothiophene derivatives 10 and 11 again in a 3:1 mixture, which was then subjected to a microwave reaction with dibutylamine resulting in exclusive formation of aminothiophene 5 by selective amination of the major bromothiophene isomer 10, where the bromine substituent is sterically less encumbered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structures of the hitherto unknown bis(merocyanine) dyes 1 and 2 were confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, high-resolution mass spectrometry (electrospray ionization), and single-crystal X-ray analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the synthetic procedure of all new compounds see the Supplementary Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding NMR spectra are depicted in Supplementary Figs 17.

with a maximum at 541 nm for the utilized monomeric merocyanine chromophore (Fig 2a)34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon increasing the concentration (up to 6.0 × 104 M), the absorption band at 541 nm decreases with concomitant appearance of a new, hypsochromically shifted absorption band at 490 nm, which is an indication for the formation of strongly exciton coupled H-type aggregates1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the symmetrical bis(merocyanine) 1, the monomer solution of unsymmetrical bis(merocyanine) 2 in chlorobenzene at a low concentration (c=5.0 × 107 M) displays two absorption bands with maxima at 549 and 663 nm (Fig 2b), which closely resemble those of the individual merocyanine chromophores34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon increasing the concentration (up to 3.4 × 104 M), both bands decrease in an analogous manner, while a new broad band at 517 nm appears concurrently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypsochromically shifted band signifies the formation of excitonically coupled H-type aggregates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the concentration-dependent spectra of both bis(merocyanine) dyes clear isosbestic points at 510 and 579 nm (for 1) and at 538, 580 and 691 nm (for 2) were observed, revealing an equilibrium between two species, respectively, these are the monomer and the respective dimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the concentration-dependent UV/vis absorption data of bis(merocyanine) dyes 1 and 2 could be properly fitted to the dimer model31 (fitting curves are shown in the inset of Fig 2a), corroborating the formation of bimolecular complexes in both cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a dimerization constant (KD) of 5.04 × 105 M1 (for 1) and 2.24 × 104 M1 (for 2) in chlorobenzene and Gibbs free energies (GD0) of 32.5 and 24.8 kJ mol1, respectively, were calculated based on the dimer model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this, the ideal monomer (turquoise line) and dimer (magenta line) spectra could be calculated (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculated dimer spectra of bis(merocyanine) 1 (Fig 2a, magenta line) exhibits an intense absorption band at 490 nm with a very weak transition at 573 nm, while the calculated dimer spectrum of 2 (Fig 2b, magenta line) shows two absorption bands at 517 and 678 nm, the latter being of considerably strong intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the dimer spectrum of 1 can easily be rationalized based on Kashas exciton coupling theory (only developed for homoaggregates), the situation for 2 is obviously more complicated and does not enable us to relate the UV/vis spectra to one of the structural models I, II or III shown in Fig 1b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

which the chromophores maintain their individuality and the exciton coupling is described as an interaction between the oscillating transition dipole moments of the localized transitions.

transition dipole moments of the chromophores is decreasing from three for the lowest excited state to zero for the highest excited state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both aggregate structures, the transition to the highest excited state is strongly allowed since all the transition dipole moments of the chromophores are oscillating in phase resulting in a large magnitude of the overall transition dipole moment (|eg|).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the excitation to the lowest and third excited state is forbidden since the overall transition dipole moment amounts to zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is due to the fact that the transition dipole moments that oscillate with the same coefficients (note: the magnitude of the coefficient is indicated by the length of the arrows that represent the transition dipole moments) are out of phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the transition to the second lowest excited state is partially allowed for both aggregate structures since the transition dipole moments of the outer chromophores are oscillating with different coefficients than the transition dipole moments of the inner chromophores resulting in overall transition dipole moments of 4.2 D (for

excitation energies of the given chromophores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The positions of the calculated absorption maxima (477 and 572 nm for 1 and 517 and 663 nm for 2, respectively (Supplementary Table 7)) are in good agreement with the ones of the experimental dimer spectra obtained by concentration-dependent UV/vis measurements in chlorobenzene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the oscillating transition dipole moments shown in Fig 6 correctly describe the transition densities of the excited states obtained by TDDFT calculations (Supplementary Fig 20).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The UV/vis absorption properties of the quadruple -stack homoaggregate of bis(merocyanine) 1 can be rationalized by Kashas exciton theory assuming an exciton coupling between the four identical chromophores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the quadruple -stack can be classified as H-type aggregate exhibiting a hypsochromic shift of the absorption with respect to the monomeric chromophore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the absorption spectrum of the quadruple -stack heteroaggregate of bis(merocyanine) 2 is more complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It shows a hypsochromically shifted main absorption band of high intensity and a second band of considerably strong intensity and a bathochromic shift.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation cannot be rationalized by presuming an exciton coupling only between the same types of chromophores which should result in two hypsochromically shifted absorption bands with respect to the absorption bands of the corresponding monomeric chromophores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our extension of the molecular exciton theory to heteroaggregates adequately describes the absorption spectrum of the aggregate of bis(merocyanine) 2 and is in accordance with the results obtained by TDDFT calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, exciton coupling in -stacked dyes is not only present between the same type of chromophores, as is often assumed, and significantly influences the optical absorption properties of the heteroaggregate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our extension of Kashas theory for hetero--stacks may be applied to larger homo- and hetero-aggregates and enable the design of desirable absorption features and to predict materials properties for bulk systems of larger complexity as required in many research fields including (opto-)electronics and photovoltaics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we are currently focusing on the construction of well-defined supramolecular -stacks of larger size based on dipolar interactions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
