Deep sleep maintains learning efficiency of the human brain  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'It is hypothesized that deep sleep is essential for restoring the brains capacity to learn efficiently, especially in regions heavily activated during the day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, causal evidence in humans has been lacking due to the inability to sleep deprive one target area while keeping the natural sleep pattern intact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we introduce a novel approach to focally perturb deep sleep in motor cortex, and investigate the consequences on behavioural and neurophysiological markers of neuroplasticity arising from dedicated motor practice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the capacity to undergo neuroplastic changes is reduced by wakefulness but restored during unperturbed sleep.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This restorative process is markedly attenuated when slow waves are selectively perturbed in motor cortex, demonstrating that deep sleep is a requirement for maintaining sustainable learning efficiency.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Many of us know from personal experience that a single night of low quality sleep can make mental tasks effortful and inefficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, one theory proposes that sleep is crucial for restoring the brains metabolic1 and neural homeostasis2,3, thus ensuring efficient functioning during the next bout of wakefulness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Environmental inputs are constantly experienced when awake and lead to a progressive increase of synaptic strength4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perpetual increases in synaptic strength, however, would render the brain highly insensitive to new inputs because neurons would lose their ability to fire selectively and synapses could not be further potentiated, thus saturating neural plasticity7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the need for cellular maintenance2 and the removal of potentially neurotoxic waste1 would be markedly enhanced causing an unsustainable level of energy consumption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deep sleep in particular is thought to be essential for down-regulating synaptic strength3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During deep non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep neurons start to oscillate between a depolarized on-state when they fire and a hyperpolarized off-state when they are silent8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because neurons are highly interconnected, synchronization of on- and off-states within larger neuronal assemblies drives 0.54.5 Hz oscillations, termed slow waves, which are typically detected in the surface electroencephalogram (EEG) or local field potentials during NREM sleep9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slow wave activity (SWA, EEG power between 1 and 4.5 Hz) is highest shortly after falling asleep, that is, when the sleep need is still high, while it is markedly reduced at the end of the night after restorative processes have taken place10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, until now the proposal that SWA is necessary for restorative processes has been mainly supported by correlative evidence demonstrating that neural plasticity induced while awake (for example, by practicing a specific task) leads to more SWA during sleep11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect is highly localized with SWA being significantly higher in brain areas that were activated during the task than in non-task areas, suggesting that the brain responds to a locally increased need for sleep3,5,11,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in order to demonstrate that slow waves are directly responsible for restorative processes, one has to establish a causal relationship between these phenomena.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such an endeavor has thus far proved impossible due to the inability to manipulate SWA in humans on a local level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we introduce a novel perturbation approach where real time closed-loop acoustic stimulation was timed to coincide precisely with the vulnerable down-phase of EEG slow waves2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We targeted SWA in primary motor cortex (M1), taking advantage of well-established behavioural and neurophysiological markers of motor training-induced neuroplasticity to estimate the effect of locally perturbed deep sleep in M1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that the capacity to undergo neuroplastic changes in response to learning is reduced by wakefulness but restored during unperturbed sleep.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This restorative process is markedly attenuated when slow waves are selectively perturbed in motor cortex.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Local slow wave perturbation', 'We report data from 13 volunteers (21.2±0.4 years of age, all right handed, 6 females) who were first familiarized with the procedures and participated then in two experimental sessions (see Supplementary Fig 1 for subject drop-out and outlier detection).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each session consisted of three learning assessments: a new motor sequence (finger tapping) was learned on the morning of Day 1 (Mor D1), another new motor sequence was learned on the evening of Day 1 (Eve D1) which was followed by one night of sleep in the laboratory during which high-density (HD) EEG was measured, and another new motor sequence was learned on the morning of Day 2 (Mor D2, for an overview of the study design see Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During one experimental session sleep was perturbed by acoustic stimulation triggered by the down-phase of local slow waves in M1 (STIM), while in the other session subjects were allowed a normal night of sleep (NOSTIM, Fig 1a,b; see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subjects were blind to this experimental manipulation and subjective sleep ratings were not significantly different between sessions (Supplementary Table 1, nor were subjective ratings of different psychological parameters (for example, focus, motivation or tiredness; Supplementary Table 2) or objective measures of vigilance (Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acoustic stimulation was switched on during stable NREM sleep and it was triggered by slow waves in the 0.52 Hz frequency range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stimulation caused a local reduction of SWA, most prominently in the low frequency range (low SWA, 12 Hz; Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a 12.00±3.92% power reduction in low-SWA during the STIM session compared to the NOSTIM session in a cluster of 9 electrodes (Fig 2, for a comprehensive overview of the entire frequency range (0.525 Hz) Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional analyses focused on the hotspot-electrode in M1 (for details see Methods section, Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low-SWA measured by this electrode was reduced by 13.4±4.12% (P=0.007, paired t-test; n=13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During STIM sleep we applied acoustic stimulation on 53.1±3.71% of all slow waves present during the night.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This caused a significant acute effect (evoked manipulation) by steepening the slope of the up-phase and shortening the duration of the perturbed slow wave (Fig 3a,b, P less_than 0.001, paired t-test; n=13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stimulation also changed general slow-wave characteristics throughout sleep (Fig 3c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the level of synchronization necessary for the generation of large amplitude waves was reduced, and as a consequence, SWA was also reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is also supported by the positive correlation between the slope reduction of the down-phase and the reduction in low-SWA (Spearmans rho=0.69, P=0.01; n=13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exploratory analyses including all channels revealed that the general effects of acoustic stimulation are locally restricted (Fig 3e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Overview of the experimental protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) After a familiarization session, volunteers participated in two experimental sessions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These were separated by 1 week, with both sessions including three separate learning assessments, the first in the morning of day 1 (Mor D1), the second in the evening on the same day (Eve D1), and a third in the morning the next day (Mor D2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the night, sleep was recorded using high density EEG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a cross-over counter balanced design, in one experimental session, slow waves were localy perturbed over left primary motor cortex by acoustic stimulation delivered time-locked to the donw-phase of sleep slow waves (STIM, yellow) while in the other experimental session no stimulation was applied (NOSTIM, green, b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During each learning assessment participatns were subjected to a new motor sequence training (finger taping task) and corticomotor excitability was measured via an IO curve before and after performing the motor sequence training, in order to determine changes indicative of motor plasticity as a consequence of training (c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) In the STIM sessions slow waves were perturbed using acoustic stimulation precisely time-locked to the down-phase of sleep slow waves (yellow arrows) detected in the electrode located closest to the sensorimotor representation of the trained hand (red electrode and signal).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) During each learning assessment subjects acquired a new six-element motor sequence during 12 training trials (that is, 30 s tapping followed by 30 s rest) lasting 12 min in total.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in corticomotor excitability of the right first dorsal interosseus (FDI, red dot) were measured before motor training (TMS-PRE)

interval in s), and Tapping Variability (average s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of inter-tap intervals in completed sequences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given that a new sequence was performed during each learning assessment (Mor D1, Eve D1, Mor D2) of each experimental session (STIM, NOSTIM), it is not surprising that a significant increase in Performance Score (Fig 4a) and a significant reduction in Tapping Variability were observed (Fig 4b) in both STIM and NOSTIM sessions (training trial effect for each learning assessment and stimulation session, all P less_than 0.001; mixed effects models, n=11 after outlier rejection, see Methods section and Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These learning dynamics were highly similar across learning assessments and on both sessions (three-way stimulation session × learning assessment × training trial interactions all P greater than 0.5; two-way stimulation session × training trial interactions all P greater than 0.91 for both Performance Score and Tapping Variability; mixed effects models, n=11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, low-SWA perturbation during STIM session sleep significantly decreased the performance score, and increased Tapping

learning assessment interaction, P=0.4; stimulation session main effect, P=0.7; mixed effects model, n=11), but it was evident that low-SWA perturbation during STIM session sleep significantly

excitability is typically increased (steeper IO curves) after prolonged motor training14,15,16,17,18 indicating LTP-like plasticity14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Learning a new motor sequence in the morning

POST learning was observed for both experimental sessions (Fig 4c,d; prepost × intensity interaction for STIM and NOSTIM: F(1,63)2.97, P less_than 0.05; mixed effects model, n=10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, corticomotor excitability decreased from PRE to POST learning when a new sequence was practiced in the evening (Eve D1) (Fig 4c,d; prepost × interaction effect for NOSTIM: F(1,63)=4.18,

slight decrease in excitability on Mor D2 was observed after perturbed sleep (Fig 4d; P=0.99, mixed effects model, n=10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Since the steepness of the IO curve can vary strongly across individuals, we summarized the above changes in IO curves by calculating a Facilitation Index for each learning assessment and experimental session which can then be related to SWA:

the index finger (FDI) and the little finger (abductor digiti minimi (ADM)), that is, two main muscles involved in the motor learning task (Supplementary Fig 4 shows each muscle separately).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that the FacIndex was highest on the first morning and decreased in the evening for both STIM and NOSTIM sessions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, on the morning of day 2, the FacIndex was only restored after unperturbed sleep, while restoration was markedly reduced after perturbing low-SWA in M1 (Fig 5c; stimulation session × learning assessment interaction

excitability as measured during PRE was added as a covariate of no interest (random effect), indicating that these differences between STIM and NOSTIM do not result from changes in baseline excitability but rather by a diminished capacity of plasticity in response to motor training the next morning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Next, we investigated whether differences in low-SWA measured under the hotspot-electrode (Fig 5a) between the STIM and NOSTIM sessions (expressed as SWA ratio=SWAhotspot STIM/SWAhotspot NOSTIM, Fig 5d) were related to the degree of overnight changes in either motor variability or corticomotor excitability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We first calculated overnight changes in motor variability (Variability ratio=VarMorD2/VarEveD1) and corticomotor excitability (FacIndex ratio=FIMorD2/FIEveD1) (Fig 5b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then we quantified how much these ratios differed between the STIM and NOSTIM sessions (Variability  ratio, FacIndex  ratio) and expressed this as a percentage (Fig 5e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interestingly, the SWA ratio at the hotspot-electrode was positively correlated with the Variability  ratio (Fig 5h; Spearmans rho=0.60, P less_than 0.04, one tailed; n=10 after outlier rejection, see Methods section and Supplementary information 1) indicating that subjects whose SWA was strongly reduced during STIM sleep exhibited elevated levels of motor variability the next morning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the SWA ratio at the hotspot-electrode was negatively correlated with the FacIndex  ratio (Fig 5i; Spearmans rho=0.7, P less_than 0.05; n=9 after outlier rejection, see Methods and Supplementary Fig 1) indicating that subjects whose SWA was strongly reduced during STIM sleep did not recover their capacity to exhibit a training-induced increase in corticomotor excitability overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No correlation was found between the Variability  ratio and FacIndex  ratio (Fig 5g; P greater than 0.05, Spearmans rho, n=7)

phenomena.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of a direct association between these markers has been demonstrated before19,20,21,22, corroborating the view that changes in corticomotor excitability and behavioural markers of motor learning are two complementary measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While behavioural markers are a compound measurement capturing adaptation at multiple levels of the neuromuscular system, corticomotor excitability reflects a subset of the circuits involved in learning with a strong focus on the primary motor cortex22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, our findings indicate that both markers of learning are significantly modulated by SWA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Control experiment', 'Finally, we conducted a control experiment where subjects (n=7) followed the exact same overall procedures but a control electrode overlying right temporo-parietal cortex was targeted during the STIM night.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall sleep architecture was similar between the two nights except for N2 sleep, which was increased by 17.9±5.8 min during the STIM night (paired t-test P=0.02, n=7, Supplementary Table 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stimulation caused a significant reduction of SWA by 14.46±4.28% in a cluster of 5 electrodes over the right temporo-parietal area (Fig 6a,b) while SWA was virtually unchanged at the hotspot-electrode of the left hemisphere (increase of 2.74±5.21%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, applying acoustic stimulation to a control electrode over the right temporo-parietal cortex modulated SWA at the hotspot-electrode significantly less than targeting the hotspot-electrode directly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding was further quantified by SWA ratios which did not differ-significantly from 1 and were significantly smaller than when SWA was perturbed at the hotspot-electrode (Wilcoxon rank-sum, 2 groups, n=7 and n=13, one-sided, P=0.04, Fig 6c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also in the control experiment during training, a significant increase in Performance Score and a significant reduction in Tapping Variability were observed at all time points (all P less_than 0.02, mixed effects models, n=7), despite no significant stimulation session x learning assessment interactions for either measure (all P greater than 0.5, mixed effects models, n=7, Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, mean Variability  ratio did not differ significantly from zero (Wilcoxon Sign Rank, P=0.3, n=7) indicating that perturbing SWA over the right temporo-parietal cortex did not cause an overnight-change in motor variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast perturbing SWA at the hotspot-electrode (main experiment) caused the Variability  ratio to significantly deviate from 0 (Wilcoxon sign-rank, P=0.04, n=10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing the Variability  ratio directly between the main and the control experiment failed to reach significance (Wilcoxon Ranksum one-sided, P=0.3, 2 groups, n=7 and n=10, Fig 6d), however, perturbing SWA at the hotspot-electrode caused a behavioural effect (Cohens d=0.66) approximately twice as large than perturbing SWA in right temporo-parietal cortex (Cohens d=0.33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also analysed the FacIndex for the same muscles as in the main experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We scrutinized in particular whether stimulation changed the FacIndex from the evening of day 1 to the morning of day 2 as indicated by the FacIndex  ratio, which did not differ significantly from zero (Wilcoxon sign-rank P=0.81, n=7), and exhibited a very small effect size (Cohens d=0.03).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, perturbing SWA at the hotspot-electrode had a large effect on FacIndex  ratio (Cohens d=1.09), which differed significantly from zero (Wilcoxon Sign Rank P=0.027, n=9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing the FacIndex  ratios of the main and control experiments directly, the result was verging upon significance (Wilcoxon Ranksum one-sided, P=0.057, 2 groups, n=7 and n=9, Fig 6e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, the results suggest that perturbing SWA under the hotspot-electrode (main experiment) influenced motor plasticity in response to motor training the next morning substantially more than

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Using a novel approach to perturb slow waves during NREM sleep we demonstrated that a reduction of SWA in M1 causally influenced the capacity to undergo motor learning and adaptive brain responses to motor training the next morning, such that larger reductions in SWA due to our experimental manipulation were associated with less efficient adaption at the behavioural and neural level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, perturbing SWA in M1 had little influence on average performance gains in response to training, however, it significantly increased tapping variability which remained elevated after reaching plateau performance and it prevented a training-induced increase in corticomotor excitability that is otherwise observed in response to motor training.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This finding in healthy human volunteers was revealed using a non-invasive approach with the defining feature that acoustic stimulation was triggered by slow waves detected by the EEG electrode that was closest to the FDI hotspot, timed such that the slow waves returned more rapidly to the positive up-phase when compared to unperturbed sleep (Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence large amplitude slow waves occurred less frequently (Fig 3d) and this effect was only observed for electrodes close to the target area, with a tendency to spread to the back of the head.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since slow waves are not phase locked across different brain areas23, our paradigm caused these specific local effects because slow waves in M1 were consistently stimulated during the negative phase, while slow waves in other areas were most likely stimulated at random phases (for topographical slow wave detection distribution see Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, slow waves are not stationary either.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority originate in the frontal cortex and travel backwards23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we quantified the travelling of slow waves in an exploratory analysis (using the toolbox presented in Mensen et al.24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slow waves, travelling through the hotspot electrode, passed significantly less electrodes located posterior from the hotspot-electrode in the STIM night compared to the NOSTIM night.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, by interacting with the ongoing slow oscillation at the hotspot-electrode the travelling of the slow waves might be interrupted, which might explain the reduction of low SWA posterior from the hotspot-electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precise interaction of local slow wave disturbance and the consequences on slow wave travelling needs to be elaborated in more detail in future studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Moreover, the general sleep architecture was very similar between the two sessions, except for a tendency toward reduced N3 sleep during STIM night (mean difference 12.7±5.6 min).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the difference in N3 sleep was not related to the impaired recovery process of cortical excitability nor the reduced improvement in variability (VAR: Spearmans rho=0.2, P=0.58, FacInd: Spearmanss rho=0.17, P=0.68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, psychological measurements (that is, motivation, mood, attention etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  assessed by questionnaires) were also very similar across sessions, illustrating that the perturbation was highly specific to low-SWA in M1 (Supplementary Discussion) and that our behavioural and neural measurements were unlikely confounded by lack of attention, motivation or other side effects typically associated with general sleep deprivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of course, our viewpoint from the surface of the scalp provides only an indirect measure of brain activity, as we detect only large population neuronal oscillatory activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, using this completely non-invasive method we provide the first evidence that local deprivation of sleep slow waves can be achieved in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The value of this tool is further increased by the recent observation that a similar approach also serves to boost slow waves25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, this simple and non-invasive approach allowing long-term stimulation is also ideally suited for clinical translation, for example, benefitting new therapeutic approaches that take advantage of sleep to modulate specifically affected brain areas in a way that will not affect daytime performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Motor training was tested using different motor sequences because this task is well-suited to repeatedly probe the effect of motor training26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During all learning assessments motor sequence production was optimized by repetitive training, which resulted in more accurate (Fig 4a) and less variable motor execution (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though this finding might be surprising at first, one has to keep in mind that we changed SWA in M1 only by approximately 13%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, similar to the recent observation by Lustenberger et al.27 one would expect that our experimental manipulation causes relatively small behavioural effects which might be most strongly reflected by temporal aspects of task performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that perturbing SWA in M1 during sleep resulted in a general increase in tapping variability the next morning that was significantly elevated when compared to performance after unperturbed sleep (Figs 4b and 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, even though the subjects improved their mean performance, motor execution was generally less efficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The benefit of local deep sleep for motor behaviour may be to keep baseline motor variability low to assure optimality of motor control and learning28, a result in line with previous evidence indicating that sleep reduces variability of both postsynaptic firing and behaviour via a down-scaling mechanism29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We further demonstrated that sleep modulated neurophysiological responses to motor training.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Motor training has been shown to strengthen input-output relationships of the activated motor circuits (that is, the same TMS input evokes a larger physiological response after training) most likely by potentiating synapses via a LTP-like mechanism31,32,33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the brains capacity to exhibit synaptic potentiation is high in the morning but significantly reduced in the evening (Figs 4c,d and 5c), lending further support to the hypothesis that synaptic plasticity gets saturated during long periods of wakefulness26,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One night of unperturbed sleep increased the brains capacity to exhibit synaptic potentiation the next morning, however, locally perturbing SWA in motor cortex was sufficient to diminish this effect (Fig 5c,i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A control experiment further confirmed that overnight changes in the ability to effectively reduce motor variability due to practice as well as changes in the neurophysiological response to motor training were much less influenced when SWA was perturbed in a control region (that is, right temporo-parietal cortex).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, local deep sleep appears to be mechanistically involved in re-normalizing synaptic potentiation overnight, thus ensuring that the brains capacity to efficiently adapt to the environment via plastic changes at the synaptic level is restored on a day-to-day basis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our stringent statistical outlier detection procedures resulted in low sample sizes for some analyses containing only a sub-set of participants, and as such, those results should be interpreted as preliminary and warranting future replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, it is clear that our method for modulating deep sleep is promising and that effectiveness might be further enhanced by more precise timing of the tones relative to the phase of slow waves as shown in Supplementary Fig 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such we introduce a new tool to shed further light upon important concepts regarding the biological function of sleep and to provide additional evidence that there is a causal link between SWA while sleeping and re-normalization of neural processes that restore the capacity of plasticity in response to motor training.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together our findings consistently indicate that local deep sleep is essential for maintaining the brains capacity to respond efficiently to motor training and thus for adapting to the environment.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

conditions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After visual and semiautomatic artefact removal49 the remaining data of each subject were re-referenced to an average value across all 109 channels above the ears.

and Supplementary Table 7) of consecutive 20 s epochs (FFT routine, Hamming window, averages of five 4 s epochs, resolution of 0.25 Hz) of each channel was performed and data were log-transformed for parametrical statistical analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparisons between STIM and NOSTIM sessions were performed for an individual hotspot-electrode (that is, the EEG electrode showing the strongest reduction of low SWA during STIM night out of the three selected TMS hotspot-electrodes (CH30, CH29 and CH36 of the HCG sensor Net 128 of EGI) to account for anatomical differences related to the combined MEP of ADM and FDI as done previously, for example, in11, as well as for each EEG channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Further analysis based on single sleep slow waves was performed for the individual hotspot-electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both sessions, the EEG signal (sampling rate 500 Hz) of the hotspot-electrode was offline re-referenced to the mean value of the earlobe and filtered, using the same filter as for the online detection (Butterworth 0.52 Hz (stop-band  less_than 0.1 and  greater than 10 Hz)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In a first step the immediate response to the acoustic stimulation was analysed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore the following procedure was applied: ', '

For both nights, sleep slow waves were detected offline (similar to the online algorithm applied during STIM session).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A trigger was set, every time the signal crossed a default threshold of 30 V, in all artifact free N2 and N3 epochs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2
All detected slow waves slower than 0.5 Hz were excluded to ensure that the signal is not influenced by the filter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3
To account for overall changes in slow wave characteristics (in particular the slope)50 we controlled for the number of detected slow waves across the night.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do so, individual sleep cycles were defined for both nights and only sleep cycles including at least 100 triggers during both nights were considered for the analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4
For the NOSTIM session the timing of the first trigger was individually matched to the timing of the first trigger of the STIM session (after 1015 min of stable N3 sleep).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5
For the STIM session only triggers where a tone was presented during the night were included.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the STIM session we aimed to stimulate as much as possible without waking up the subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence the stimulation algorithm was turned off by the experimenter if there was any sign of arousal, or during the cycle transitions (from NREM to REM or vice versa).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, some slow waves were missed during the STIM session, where no tones were played.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, less slow waves were detected during the STIM compared to the NOSTIM session.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To account for this difference in the number of detected slow waves, we matched the number of analysed waves between the two nights.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do so, for each sleep cycle, equal amounts of detected slow waves during the STIM session were randomly selected in the NOSTIM session.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, the immediate peak-to-peak up-slope following the stimulation (dividing peak-to-peak amplitude by the time between negative and positive amplitude) and the duration of the slow waves were calculated (time between the negative zero-crossing (start of the down-phase) prior to stimulation and the next negative zero-crossing (end of the up-phase)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach led to similar results as calculating the median peak-to-peak up-slope and duration of slow waves, including all detected slow waves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the former approach always results in slightly different numbers, the median peak-to-peak up-slope and duration of slow waves were taken for further statistics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In a second step the induced changes of slow wave characteristics throughout the night (that is, not only including slow waves which were directly disturbed) were analysed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this the following procedure was applied: ', '

1
All waves starting from the zero crossing of the up-phase, that is, the positive part of the wave, and ending at the second zero crossing of the next down-phase of any amplitude between 0.5 and 2 Hz during N2 and N3 sleep were detected offline, using a similar routine as described by Riedner et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2
From these detected waves the mean peak-to-peak down-slope (dividing peak-to-peak amplitude by the time between positive and negative amplitude) for each subject and night were calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3
Moreover, the probability of slow waves (defined as slow waves with a peak-to-peak amplitude greater than 75 V) was calculated by dividing the number of detected slow waves ( greater than 75 V) by the total number of detected waves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For exploratory purposes the analysis of induced changes on general slow wave characteristics was extended to all channels (for this analysis data were down sampled to 128 Hz to reduce computational load).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Since all sleep data were normally distributed (normality of the data was confirmed using Shapiro-Wilk-Test), paired t-tests (two-tailed) were used for intra-individual comparisons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For topographical comparisons nonparametric cluster-based statistical testing was applied, using a suprathreshold cluster analysis to control for multiple comparisons11,51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In short: For each topographical statistical analysis (paired Students t-test and Spearmans correlation) new datasets were generated by randomly relabelling the condition label from original data and either paired Students t-test or spearman correlations were performed, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each permutation the maximal size of resulting clusters with neighboring electrodes reaching a t-value above the critical value was counted to build a cluster size distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this cluster size distribution the 95th percentile was defined as critical cluster size threshold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the true comparison (STIM vs. NOSTIM) only electrodes reaching a t-value beyond the CV and located within a cluster larger than the critical cluster size threshold were considered as significant (paired Students t-test: CV=2.3, number of permutations 5000, n=13, spearman correlations: CV=0.68, number of permutations 1,000, n=9 and CV=0.6, number of permutations 1000, n=10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All offline analyses of the sleep data and statistical analyses were performed in MATLAB (MathWorks).

regular sleep wake cycle or not tolerating the auditory stimulation (n=3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seven naïve, healthy, right-handed (95.4±6.2%; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36) subjects (23.76±1.03 years, 4 females) completed the control experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The control experiment followed the exact same experimental procedure as the main experiment, only that slow waves were perturbed using acoustic stimulation (STIM) precisely time-locked to the down-phase of sleep slow waves detected at an electrode overlying the temporo-parietal cortex of the right hemisphere (that is, the hemisphere ipsilateral to the moving hand).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the mean amplitude of slow waves is generally lower over the temporo-parietal region compared to the TMS hotspot region (that is, primary motor cortex) we also adapted the threshold for online slow wave detection slightly, to ensure that in the control experiment the same number of slow waves were detected as in the main experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do so we calculated the mean amplitude over the temporo-parietal electrode (control electrode) and the hotspot-electrode of the main experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the mean amplitude was reduced by 20% over the temporo-parietal cortex compared to the hotspot-electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence we reduced the amplitude threshold from 30 to 25 V for the control experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrode over temporo-parietal cortex was selected because the right temporo-parietal area is believed to have only a minor contribution to the sequence learning task and previous experiments from our lab have indicated that coherence in the SWA frequency range was low between the hotspot-electrode and the control electrode over right temporo-parietal cortex, indicating that slow waves occur independently in the two areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Outlier detection, data analysis and statistics for the control experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated the same parameters as above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No outliers were detected when we applied the same cutoff-criteria as in the main experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our statistical analysis focused on the Variability  ratio and the FacIndex  ratio because these parameters summarize how STIM versus NOSTIM influences changes of behavioural and electrophysiological learning indices between the evening of Day 1 and the morning of Day 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the sample size of the control group (n=7) and the sample size of the experimental group (n=13) was relatively low we applied non-parameteric statistics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used (i) the Wilcoxon sign-rank test to probe whether STIM induced SWA reduction, Variability  ratio or the FacIndex  ratio differed significantly from zero for either the experimental or the control group; and ii) the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for probing whether STIM induced SWA reduction, Variability  ratio or the FacIndex  ratio differed significantly between the main and the control experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since we had a clear directional hypothesis the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was one-sided.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we calculated Cohens d effect sizes
