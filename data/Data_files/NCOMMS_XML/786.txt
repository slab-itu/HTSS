Observation of the topological soliton state in the SuSchriefferHeeger model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The SuSchriefferHeeger (SSH) model, which captures the most striking transport properties of the conductive organic polymer trans-polyacetylene, provides perhaps the most basic model system supporting topological excitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The alternating bond pattern of polyacetylene chains is captured by the bipartite sublattice structure of the SSH model, emblematic of one-dimensional chiral symmetric topological insulators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This structure supports two distinct nontrivial topological phases, which, when interfaced with one another or with a topologically trivial phase, give rise to topologically protected, dispersionless boundary states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, using 87Rb atoms in a momentum-space lattice, we realize fully tunable condensed matter Hamiltonians, allowing us to probe the dynamics and equilibrium properties of the SSH model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report on the experimental quantum simulation of this model and observation of the localized topological soliton state through quench dynamics, phase-sensitive injection, and adiabatic preparation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Remarkably, the conductivity of the polymer trans-polyacetylene can be increased by over 10 orders of magnitude through halogen doping, transforming it from a simple organic insulator into a metallic conductor1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This unusual electronic property stems from topologically protected solitonic defects that are free to move along the polymer chain4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To account for such behaviour, Su, Schrieffer and Heeger (SSH) proposed a simple one-dimensional (1D) tight-binding model with alternating off-diagonal tunnelling strengths to represent doped polyacetylene4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SSH model has since served as a paradigmatic example of a 1D system supporting charge fractionalization5,6 and topological character7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The emergence of such exotic phenomena in a simple 1D setting has naturally inspired numerous related experimental investigations, including efforts to probe aspects of the SSH model by quantum simulation with pristine and tunable ultracold atomic gases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, using real-space superlattices8,9, several bulk characteristics of the SSH models topological nature have been explored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include the measurement of bulk topological indices10 and the observation of topologically robust charge pumping11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Topological pumping has also been observed in a magnetic lattice based on internal-state synthetic dimensions13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cold atom experiments have even begun to probe topological boundary states, with recent evidence for boundary localization in the related 1D Dirac Hamiltonian with spatially varying effective mass15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Highly tunable photonic simulators16 have provided a complementary window into the physics of topological systems17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, evidence for topological 1D bound states has been found19 in the discrete quantum walk of light in a Floquet-engineered20 system resembling the SSH model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Related bound state behaviour has also been observed in 1D photonic quasicrystals21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, using an atom-optics23,24 realization of lattice tight-binding models25,26, we report on the direct imaging and probing of topological bound states in the SSH model through quench dynamics, phase-sensitive injection, and adiabatic preparation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our technique, based on the controlled coupling of discrete atomic momentum states through stimulated Bragg transitions, allows for arbitrary and dynamic control over the tunnelling amplitudes, tunnelling phases, and on-site energies in an effective 1D tight-binding model25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use these unique capabilities to prepare, probe, and directly image topological boundary states of the SSH model with unprecedented resolution and control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The molecule trans-polyacetylene consists of a 1D carbon chain connected through alternating single and double bonds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This sublattice bond structure, emblematic of 1D chiral symmetric topological insulators7, leads to two distinct topological phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interesting electronic properties arise when these two phases (or one of the phases and a trivial, nontopological phase) are interfaced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1a shows an example of an edge defect carbon atom interfacing a polyacetylene chain with the nontopological vacuum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of a central defect, the two distinct topological phases of the SSH model are interfaced at a defect carbon atom with two single bonds, as illustrated in Fig 1b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: The SSH model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Top: Chemical structure of trans-polyacetylene showing the two-site unit cell structure.

basis of which may be found by examining the effective 1D tight-binding model proposed by SSH in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this simplified picture (see Fig 1a,b), the polymer chains carbon backbone acts as a 1D lattice for electrons, with the alternating double and single bonds represented as strong (t+) and weak (t) tunnelling links, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Hamiltonian describing the SSH model is given by', '', 'where t is the average tunnelling strength and 2 the tunnelling imbalance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This bipartite sublattice structure, the result of a Peierls distortion in the polyacetylene chain, leads to a two-band energy dispersion as in Fig 1(c, inset) with an energy gap Egap=2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When distinct topological phases of these SSH wires are directly interfaced, spatially localized mid-gap eigenstates appear in the middle of this energy gap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1c displays such a localized mid-gap state wavefunction for the case of an edge (site zero) defect as in Fig 1a, with the particular choice of /t=0.41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several key features of the topological boundary state are illustrated by Fig 1c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, it is localized to the defect site with a characteristic decay length  due to its energetic separation by  from the dispersive bulk states, where d is the spacing between lattice sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, this topological boundary state exhibits the absence of population on odd lattice sites and a sign inversion of the wavefunction on alternating even sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both of these features can be understood from the fact that the state is composed of two quasimomentum states with q=±/2d, leading to a cos(n/2d)-like variation of the eigenstate wavefunction underneath the aforementioned exponentially decaying envelope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below, we directly explore these properties of the mid-gap state wavefunction through single-site injection, multi-site injection, and adiabatic preparation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Overview', 'We begin with a brief description of our experimental methods for studying the SSH model, as discussed previously in refs 25, 26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We initiate momentum-space dynamics of 87Rb condensate atoms through controlled, time-dependent driving with an optical lattice potential formed by lasers of wavelength =1,064 nm and wave number k=2/.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lasers coherently couple 21 discrete atomic momentum states, creating a momentum-space lattice of states in which atomic population may reside.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The momentum states are characterized by site indices n and momenta pn=2nk (relative to the lowest momentum value).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coupling between these states is fully controlled through 20 distinct two-photon Bragg diffraction processes, allowing us to simulate tight-binding models with arbitrary, local, and time-dependent control of all site energies and tunnelling terms25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This control enables the creation of hard-wall boundaries and lattice defects, among other features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Site-resolved detection of the populations in this momentum-space lattice is enabled through time of flight absorption imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Single-site injection', 'One method for probing topological bound states of the SSH model is to abruptly expose our condensate atoms, initially localized at only a single lattice site, to the Hamiltonian (equation (1)) and observe the ensuing quench dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When population is injected onto a defect site, we expect to find a large overlap with the mid-gap state, resulting in a relative lack of dynamics as compared to injection at any other lattice site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observations using this quench technique are summarized in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these experiments, population is injected at a single lattice site of our choosing, and the subsequent dynamics are observed with single-site resolution and 10 s (0.01 h/t) time sampling.

population in the defect site at long times, suggesting localization at the defect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We additionally observe characteristics of the mid-gap states parity in these dynamics, that is, the odd lattice sites remain sparsely populated as some atoms spread away from the edge to the second lattice site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas edge injection results in localization, injecting population into the bulk (site five) leads to faster dynamics and increased population spread, as shown in Fig 2b for /t=0.40(1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these cases of edge and bulk injection, the normalized

engineering of the atomic population prior to quenching the SSH Hamiltonian.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we can initialize the atoms to match the defining characteristics of a mid-gap state localized to an edge defect: decay of amplitude into the bulk, absence of population on odd lattice sites, and  phase inversions on successive even sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect that such an initialization should more closely approximate the mid-gap eigenstate, resulting in the near absence of dynamics following the Hamiltonian quench.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if the relative phases of the condensate wavefunction at different lattice sites are inconsistent with those of the mid-gap state, significant dynamics should ensue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We prepare an approximation to the mid-gap state through a two-stage process, as illustrated in Fig 3a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first stage of the sequence, only sites zero and one are coupled, with roughly 35% of the atomic population transferred to site one with a natural phase shift of /2, that is, H(1)=t(c0+h.c.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, in the second stage, sites one and two are coupled to allow full transfer of the population at site one to site two with a chosen phase shift.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This second stage is characterized by the Hamiltonian , such that the total relative phase between sites zero and two is .

state (=±), the average distance from the edge of the system is minimized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, a phase difference of zero results in population spreading furthest from the defect site.

This energy gap is reduced as final/t decreases, with dispersions as in Fig 1(c, inset) for intermediate values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gap finally closes and a single dispersive band emerges as final/t0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4 summarizes our results using this adiabatic preparation method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both simulated and averaged experimental absorption images for an adiabatically loaded lattice with the defect on the left edge are shown in Fig 4b, demonstrating excellent agreement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adiabatic preparation was also performed for a lattice with a defect at its centre, and Fig 4c presents simulated and averaged experimental absorption images for this case, also showing good agreement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As mentioned earlier and shown in Fig 1c, the amplitude of the mid-gap state wavefunction is largest at the defect site and decays exponentially into the bulk, owing to the energy gap .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In units of the spacing d between lattice sites, the decay length  should scale roughly as the inverse of this energy gap (normalized to the average tunnelling bandwidth t).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus expect highly localized mid-gap states for  (dimerized limit) and an approach to full delocalization over all 21 sites for  (uniform limit).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using our ability to tune the normalized tunnelling imbalance, we present in Fig 4d a direct exploration of the mid-gap states localization decay length as a function of final/t.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we determine the decay length by fitting the measured atomic populations on even sites at the end of the ramp to an exponential decay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For very small final/t, we expect the observed decay length to differ from that of the true mid-gap state due to deviations of our ramping protocol from adiabaticity with respect to a vanishing energy gap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, our smooth ramps of final/t should have a duration that greatly exceeds the time scale associated with the smallest energy gap (that is, ) to remain fully adiabatic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our ramp duration is actually shorter than /final for the cases when final/t less_than 0.13, and we should thus expect significant deviation from the predictions for the exact (adiabatic) mid-gap state as we approach small values of final/t.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Still, the data in Fig 4d are in good qualitative agreement with the simple expectation of an inverse dependence on final/t, and are mostly consistent with both a numerical simulation of the actual experimental ramping protocol (blue dashed line) as well as predictions based on the exact mid-gap state (red line).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Having observed clear evidence for the topological mid-gap state of the SSH model in the non-interacting limit, we will extend our work to study the stability of this state under the influence of nonlinear atomic interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repulsive, long-ranged (in momentum space) interactions are naturally present in our system due to the atoms short-ranged interactions in real space, however the present investigation employs large tunnelling bandwidths that dominate over the interaction energy scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future explorations of interacting topological wires may be enabled by reducing the imposed tunnelling amplitudes, enhancing the atomic interactions (or their variation in momentum space27), or through related techniques based on trapped spatial eigenstates28 instead of free momentum states25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition, our arbitrary control over the simulated model naturally permits investigations of critical behaviour and quantum phase transitions in disordered topological wires29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Topological phase transitions may also be explored in the context of coupled topological wires30,31 upon extension of our technique to higher dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More generally, given our direct control of tunnelling phases, momentum-space lattices in higher dimensions will allow for the creation of arbitrary and inhomogeneous flux lattices for cold atoms (this control has recently been realised and will be reported elsewhere32).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
