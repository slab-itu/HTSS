Femtosecond electron imaging of defect-modulated phonon dynamics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Precise manipulation and control of coherent lattice oscillations via nanostructuring and phonon-wave interference has the potential to significantly impact a broad array of technologies and research areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resolving the dynamics of individual phonons in defect-laden materials presents an enormous challenge, however, owing to the interdependent nanoscale and ultrafast spatiotemporal scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report direct, real-space imaging of the emergence and evolution of acoustic phonons at individual defects in crystalline WSe2 and Ge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Via bright-field imaging with an ultrafast electron microscope, we are able to image the sub-picosecond nucleation and the launch of wavefronts at step edges and resolve dispersion behaviours during propagation and scattering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discover that the appearance of speed-of-sound (for example, 6 nm ps1) wavefronts are influenced by spatially varying nanoscale strain fields, taking on the appearance of static bend contours during propagation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations provide unprecedented insight into the roles played by individual atomic and nanoscale features on acoustic-phonon dynamics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Phononsquantized elastic oscillationsare at the core of innumerable atomic-scale physical processes and mesoscale phenomena, from structural variations associated with lattice fluctuations, phase transitions and bond modulation1,2,3,4,5 to electromagnetic and electronic properties, including electric susceptibility and electron mobility6,7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the atomic-scale manipulation and control of phonon modes has been proposed and vigorously pursued for enabling and enhancing myriad technological developments, including electromagnetic confinement in optically driven cavities11,12 and, especially, thermal-energy management and conversion13,14,15,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Achieving this requires a deep understanding of the profound influence that phonons have on emergent properties in both engineering and advanced materials through the fundamental structurefunction relationships at work therein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, the formulation of a comprehensive microscopic description of the real-time interaction of propagating modes with individual lattice discontinuities would constitute a significant advance toward ultraprecise directed-energy nucleation and mode guiding in defect-laden materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Of particular interest is the development of a detailed understanding of phonon dynamics in nanostructured and disordered semiconducting materials (for example, SiGe alloys and composites)19,20,21, especially those having tunable band gaps, such as the layered transition metal dichalcogenides (for example, WSe2, MoS2, NbSe2 and so on)5,6,9,10,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These compounds have generated an enormous amount of interest owing to dramatic differences in, and tunability of, transport properties (thermal and electronic) along different crystallographic directions and with varying numbers of layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, it was shown with WSe2 that the cross-plane thermal conductivity could be made several times smaller than the predicted minimum value (indeed, the smallest measured for any fully dense solid) via disordering of the two-dimensional sheets23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was attributed mainly to phonon localization stemming from the incommensurate nature of the individual crystalline WSe2 planes, thus restricting these modes from significantly contributing to thermal transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To elucidate the dynamics of collective excitations in the presence of individual atomic-scale defects, one must contend with the difficult-to-access spatiotemporal regimes in which these phenomena operate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the unit-cell level, speed-of-sound phonon wavefronts typically transit such spatial dimensions in less than 100 femtoseconds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The propagating energy causes local bond modulation and a transient elastic deformation of the lattice, briefly re-orienting the atoms in a manner dictated by the symmetry of the mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural dynamics of this nature are amenable to study with ultrafast methods that make use of the dependence of scattering wavevectors on lattice orientation and symmetry24,25,26,27,28; movement or spacing and symmetry changes of the reciprocal lattice on a fixed Ewald sphere produces a commensurate modulation or re-configuration of the resulting coherent-scattering pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In reciprocal space, the dearth of phase information, combined with the probing of lattice motion within material volumes that are large relative to nanoscale discontinuities (for parallel-beam conditions), produces an ensemble-averaged picture of the dynamics, despite being sensitive to symmetry changes29,30,31, bond dilation and breaking2,3 and atomic-vibration amplitude32,33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, phase information is retained with femtosecond electron imaging35,36,37,38, thus enabling spatiotemporal localization of discrete phonon-nucleation events and resolution of propagation dynamics at individual atomic-scale defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report direct visualization of the nucleation, evolution and decay of individual acoustic phonons in the vicinity of atomic-scale defects and nanoscale variations in lattice orientation via femtosecond real-space imaging with an ultrafast electron microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimentally, we observe the launch of individual phonon wavefronts following coherent optical excitation of macroscopically ordered but microscopically disordered materials: here, crystalline tungsten diselenide (WSe2) and germanium (Ge).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transient low-energy elastic deformations associated with the propagating waves produce a slight re-orientation of the lattice and thus a localized, rapidly varying Bragg condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This manifests as coherent diffraction-contrast wavetrains in the real-space images, the nucleation and apparent dynamics of which are found to be strongly dictated by even minor lattice imperfections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, we observe that the appearance and directionality of the propagating wavefronts, as seen in the femtosecond bright-field images, are strongly influenced by individual step edges, interfaces and crystal bending.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By isolating and quantifying the transient contrast modulation, we extract the spatially dependent vibrational-mode shapes and propertiesnamely, symmetries, frequencies, phase velocities and decay timesover fields-of-view on the order of the phonon wavelengths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations open the way to detailed study of the effects of individual atomic-scale defects, spatially varying lattice orientations and associated strain fields on ultrafast energy propagation in less-than-pristine materials.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Overview of WSe2 and Ge specimens', 'To locate and characterize specific defects and other nanoscale imperfections of interest, the WSe2 and Ge specimens were initially surveyed using bright-field imaging and parallel-beam electron diffraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Static structural and morphological characterization of specific specimen regions of interest, on which subsequent femtosecond electron imaging studies were conducted, are summarized in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As can be seen from the diffraction patterns, the WSe2 and Ge specimens are oriented such that the electron beam travels approximately down the 001 and 110 zone axes, respectively (Fig 1c,f)39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined, the bright-field images and corresponding diffraction patterns illustrate the macroscopically crystalline but microscopically disordered nature of the regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the images, several features of interest for the present study can be identified, which, conversely, are not readily apparent from the diffraction patterns alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include step edges and terraces, wrinkles, folds, vacuum-crystal interfaces and cracks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, bend contours are quite prominent and widespread, as are moiré fringes in the WSe2 specimen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See the Methods section below for descriptions of how the specimens were prepared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Morphological heterogeneity and atomic-scale order of the WSe2 and Ge specimen regions of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,d) Bright-field images of (a) a WSe2 flake and (d) a thin Ge crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The red, dashed circle denotes the position of the selected-area aperture used to generate the diffraction patterns shown in b and e.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'For all the studies reported here, the laser-excitation wavelength used was 515 nm (2.41 eV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This photon energy is significantly larger than the band gaps of both WSe2 and Ge (1.6 and 0.66 eV, respectively)46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the roles played by charge-carrier excitation and recombination on localized acoustic-phonon nucleation and launch may be non-negligible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the question of why acoustic phonons first appear at specific locations in the material is nontrivial to answer considering the sequence of events that occurs following femtosecond excitationespecially in a disordered materialand the mechanisms of contrast formation in the bright-field images (discussed below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this topic is the subject of current systematic studies in our lab, it nevertheless is perhaps worthwhile to draw comparisons to multi-photon pump-probe photoemission electron microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this variant of photoemission electron microscopy, resonant excitation is used to induce surface-plasmon oscillations and image their launch, propagation and evolution with femtosecond resolution48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An analogous methodology dubbed photon-induced near-field electron microscopy50,51, which is not reliant on resonant excitation52,53,54, has recently been used to image wave-particle properties of surface plasmon polaritons and induce Rabi oscillations in swift, unbound electron packets55,56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the resonant-excitation approach in mind, one can envision femtosecond electron imaging experiments on acoustic-phonon dynamics, where the pump-photon energy is varied with respect to the band gap of the material under study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, one may be able to determine the roles played by the various dynamic and transport phenomena at work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Beyond the acoustic-phonon excitation and nucleation mechanisms, it will be important to quantify the precise manner in which contrast is formed in the femtosecond electron images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is well known that deviations of a few milliradians in the local Bragg condition can produce significantly different contrast patterns in bright-field micrographs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, this sensitivity to local morphology is what enables observation of dynamic contrast from small angular perturbations caused by in-plane propagating waves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is expected that the nature of the contrast resulting from the acoustic waves is highly dependent on both vicinity to a zone axis and the specific zone axis itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that each of the videos of the WSe2 flake presented in this study are acquired at slightly different orientations (due to the variability of sample insertion from one experiment to the next) and in fact show noticeable differences in static diffraction contrast (compare Supplementary Videos 1 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each case, however, the waves appear to emanate from the same features, and the frequencies and phase velocities extracted are the same.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the exact dependence of specimen orientation with respect to specific dynamic modulations indeed is an open question (and will be the subject of a forthcoming publication).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we have reported the direct, real-space imaging of acoustic-phonon dynamics in macroscopically ordered but microscopically disordered crystalline WSe2 and Ge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Via femtosecond electron imaging, we have discovered that phonon nucleation and launch occurs at discrete spatial locations along individual step edges, and that the appearance of coherent, propagating wavefronts are extremely sensitive to the shapes of local strain fields (manifested in bend contours) and vacuumcrystal interfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, the analysis of picosecond contrast modulation reveals the phase velocities, frequencies and symmetries of the modes, with the spatial and layer-thickness dependence of the oscillations being resolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect that these observations, and the method used, will open the way to the ultraprecise manipulation and control of coherent energy propagation at the atomic scale, with the possibility of exploring the spatiotemporal limits of quantized thermal energy57.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

comprise Supplementary Video 3, while the processed images comprise Supplementary Video 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The spacetime surface plot in Fig 4a of the main text was generated by first rotating each image such that the axis of propagation is oriented directly vertical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 651-pixel (Y) by 100-pixel (X) box was selected for the region of interest and median filtered (4-pixel by 4-pixel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, the profile for each time delay was created by determining the mean of the 100-horizontal pixels for each of the vertical single-pixel-wide sections and then subtracting the vertical 651-pixel time-zero reference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the motion appears as diagonal streaks in the surface plot, with the velocity captured in the slope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequency traces were created by taking a discrete Fourier transform of a de-trended time trace for various pixels (one at a time).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The displayed results represent the average of the Fourier transforms determined over the 20-pixel vertical range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In generating panels (bg) and (jo) in Supplementary Fig 1, a series of processing steps were performed, with the goal being to produce an additional means for visualizing the propagating contrast waves without the aid of the video format and within which the dynamics are readily apparent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the difference images were created by generating an average reference image and subtracting it from each frame in the series.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, the difference image was modified for contrast and brightness to enhance the features of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, an HSV image was created by placing the original (at some time delay, t) in the hue channel and the difference image (at t) in the saturation and value channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the colour balance was modified to emphasize the dynamic contrast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each image within a data set was processed identically.'
