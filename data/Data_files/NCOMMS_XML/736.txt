NQO1 inhibits proteasome-mediated degradation of HIF-1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Overexpression of NQO1 is associated with poor prognosis in human cancers including breast, colon, cervix, lung and pancreas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pro-tumorigenic capacities of NQO1 have not been fully elucidated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show a previously undescribed function for NQO1 in stabilizing HIF-1, a master transcription factor of oxygen homeostasis that has been implicated in the survival, proliferation and malignant progression of cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that NQO1 directly binds to the oxygen-dependent domain of HIF-1 and inhibits the proteasome-mediated degradation of HIF-1 by preventing PHDs from interacting with HIF-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NQO1 knockdown in human colorectal and breast cancer cell lines suppresses HIF-1 signalling and tumour growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this pro-tumorigenic function for NQO1, high NQO1 expression levels correlate with increased HIF-1 expression and poor colorectal cancer patient survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results collectively reveal a function of NQO1 in the oxygen-sensing mechanism that regulates HIF-1 stability in cancers.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1, DT-diaphorase) is a cytosolic reductase which is upregulated in many human cancers1, including colorectal cancer2, lung cancer3, gastric cardiac carcinoma4, melanoma5, cholangiocarcinoma5, pancreatic cancer5, uterine cervical cancer5 and breast cancer6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In breast, colorectal and cervical cancers, the high-level expression of NQO1 is closely associated with the late clinical stage, poor differentiation and lymph node metastasis5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, breast and cervical cancer patients with high-level NQO1 expression have shown lower disease-free survival and 5-year overall survival rates compared with those with low-level NQO1 expression5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the clear implications of NQO1 expression in the clinicopathological features and prognosis of these cancers, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pro-tumorigenic actions of NQO1 have not been fully elucidated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Upregulation of NQO1 has been shown to protect cells against various cytotoxic quinones and oxidative stress; it catalyses the reduction and detoxification of quinone substrates, thereby protecting cells from diverse carcinogens7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considerable efforts have been made to exploit the reductase activity of NQO1 to enhance the efficacy of certain bioreductive anticancer drugs9, such as, mitomycin C10, Geldanamycin11, E0912 and RH112, 17AAG13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypoxia and high oxidative stress are among the hallmark features of the tumour microenvironment, yet the molecular effects of NQO1 on cell survival and bioreductive anticancer drugs within the hypoxic tumour microenvironment are largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are critical transcription factors that regulate adaptive cellular responses to low O2 concentrations in metazoans14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HIFs have been reported to be overexpressed in various cancer cells under hypoxia commonly found in tumour microenvironments16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HIFs have been shown to regulate the expression of a number of genes involved in angiogenesis, tumour growth, metastasis, metabolic reprogramming, chemoresistance and radioresistance16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'HIFs are heterodimeric transcription factors that consist of three oxygen-regulated  subunits, HIF-1, HIF-2 and HIF-3, and a constitutively expressed hydrocarbon receptor/nuclear translocator  subunit, HIF-119,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HIF-1 and HIF-2 are structurally similar in their DNA binding and dimerization domains, but differ in their transactivation domains, thereby they have unique target genes22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HIF-3 is also similar in structure to the other two -subunits but its function is less understood21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Formation of the HIF-1 and HIF-1 heterodimer is required for the function of HIF-1, wherein HIF-1 serves as the major regulatory subunit responsible for its transcriptional function14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression of HIF-1 is rapidly induced by hypoxia; when hypoxic cells are reoxygenated, the protein rapidly degrades (half-life of  less_than 10 min)14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In well-oxygenated cells, the oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain of HIF-1 is hydroxylated by three prolyl hydroxylases (PHD 13), which utilize O2 and -ketoglutarate as substrates23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tumour suppressor, von Hippel-Lindau (pVHL) protein binds to hydroxylated HIF-1 and recruits an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that includes Elongin-B, Elongin-C and Cullin2, thereby promoting ubiquitination and 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of HIF-125,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'O2/PHD/VHL-independent mechanisms and other post-translational modifications have also been reported to be involved in regulating HIF-1 under normoxia and hypoxia27,28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, recent studies showed that the receptor of activated protein kinase C 1 (RACK1) competes with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) for binding to HIF-1 and promotes the ubiquitination/degradation of HIF-1 by recruiting the E3 ubiquitin complex under normoxia30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, HSP70 and CHIP (carboxyl terminus of the HSP70 interacting protein) promote the degradation of HIF-1 during prolonged hypoxia31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cullin5, Bcl2 (B-cell lymphoma 2), Runx2 (Runt-related transcription factor 2) and factor inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1) are involved in the regulation of transactivation, stability and expression of HIF-129,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Post-translational modifications of HIF-1 (for example, acetylation, phosphorylation, nitrosylation and SUMOylation) have also been reported, but their effects on the stability of HIF-1 remain controversial27,28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to its oxidoreductase activity, NQO1 has been shown to stabilize many proteins, including p53 and p33ING1b, by inhibiting their proteasomal degradation33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that NQO1 directly binds and stabilizes HIF-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that NQO1 binds to the ODD domain of HIF-1 and inhibits its polyubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation through competing with PHDs, regulatory proteins involved in its degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, high-level expression of NQO1 correlates with an increased expression of HIF-1 and poor survival in colorectal cancer patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, this study reveals a role for NQO1 in the oxygen-sensing pathway that regulates HIF-1 stability in cancers.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

0.5, 1, 2, 5 or 20% O2, and we found that the knockdown of NQO1 significantly attenuates HIF-1 expression under mild hypoxia (Supplementary Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next investigated the NQO1 gain-of-function in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells that are deficient in NQO1 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2b, overexpression of NQO1-myc-His6 (MDA-MB-231/pNQO1) dramatically increased the HIF-1 expression in both 20 and 0.5% O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further confirm that HIF-1 expression is regulated by NQO1, we transiently expressed various amount of pshNQO1 and pNQO1-myc-His6 in RKO and MDA-MB-231, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, HIF-1 expression correlates with the levels of NQO1 expression (Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten human colorectal cancer cell lines and other types of cancer cell lines including HeLa (cervix), A549 (lung), PC3 (prostate) and U87-MG (brain) exhibited similar NQO1-mediated HIF-1 induction in both normoxia and hypoxia (Supplementary Fig 4c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To exclude the possibility of off-site effects of NQO1 shRNA, NQO1 expression was restored by overexpressing shRNA-resistant NQO1 in RKO/pshNQO1 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2e, reintroduction of NQO1 expression fully rescued the HIF-1 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts null for NQO1 (NQO1/) displayed markedly reduced levels of HIF-1 expression (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next sought to determine if NQO1 oxidoreductase enzymatic activity is necessary for HIF-1 induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Introduction of point mutation at the known catalytic active site (C609T) that inactivates reductase activity had no effect on HIF-1 expression as compared with wild-type NQO1 indicating that NQO1 reductase enzymatic activity is not required for its HIF-1 inducing function (Supplementary Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results clearly suggest that NQO1 has a crucial role in HIF-1 expression independent of its reductase function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: NQO1 enhances HIF-1 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) RKO cells (a) and MDA-MB-231 cells (b) were exposed to 0.5% O2 for 8 h and harvested at the indicated times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whole-cell lysates were analysed by immunoblotting for HIF-1, HIF-1, NQO1 and -actin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SE, short exposure;

As shown in Fig 5g, inhibition of PHD activity by DMOG treatment abolished the reduction of HIF-1 expression caused by NQO1-deficiency clearly arguing for the functional involvement of PHDs in NQO1-mediated regulation of HIF-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further confirm the functional contribution of PHDs, we transiently knocked down PHD1, PHD2 or PHD3 by siRNAs in control RKO and pshNQO1 RKO cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 5h, HIF-1 expression levels in RKO/pshNQO1 cells remained comparable to control RKO cells when PHDs expression was suppressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, HIF-1 hydroxylation levels were significantly elevated in NQO1 knockdown RKO cells (RKO/pshNQO1), but knocking down PHDs effectively reduced HIF-1 hydroxylation and rescued HIF-1 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although NQO1 appears to compete with all three PHDs to stabilize HIF-1, consistent with previous studies, PHD2 is the predominant isoform involved in the hydroxylation of HIF-1 and NQO1 may stabilize HIF-1 mainly by blocking PHD2 binding to the ODD domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further employed ODD-luciferase reporter system to validate the functional contribution of NQO1 to inhibition of PHD-mediated hydroxylation and degradation of HIF-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even under hypoxia, NQO1 knockdown significantly induced the degradation of HIF-1, which was partially rescued by siRNA-mediated suppression of PHDs (Supplementary Fig 7c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these results provide evidence that NQO1 stabilizes HIF-1 through competing with PHDs for binding to the ODD domain of HIF-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'NQO1 increases HIF-1 transcriptional activities', 'We next assessed if NQO1-mediated HIF-1 stabilization functionally leads to transcriptional activation of its target genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under hypoxia, knocking down NQO1 in RKO cells (RKO/pshNQO1) dramatically attenuated hypoxic induction of HIF-1 target genes, PDK1, PGK1 and LDHA (Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, ectopic expression of NQO1 in NQO1-deficient MDA-MB-231 cells further increased the expression of these target genes (Fig 6b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm this transcriptional activity, we transfected cells with a hypoxia reporter plasmid (p5 × HRE-luc) and a transcription control, pCMV--galactosidase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that, under hypoxia, HRE transcriptional activities were significantly suppressed when NQO1 expression was reduced by shRNA (RKO/pshNQO1) whereas NQO1-overexpressing cells exhibited elevated HRE-luc activities compared with NQO1-deficient MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Fig 8a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, we measured another HIF-1 target gene, VEGF in the conditioned media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay assays showed a decreased concentration of secreted VEGF from NQO1-knockdown RKO cells and increased levels of VEGF from NQO1-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig 6c), which was consistently associated with angiogenic activities evaluated by in vitro tube formation capacities of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (Supplementary Fig 8b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results indicate that NQO1-mediated HIF-1 expression promotes HIF-1 transcriptional activities and NQO1 inhibition significantly attenuates target gene expression, suggesting that NQO1 is a critical component for full transcriptional activation of the HIF-1 signalling pathway under hypoxia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6:

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The present study demonstrated for the first time that NQO1 directly binds to HIF-1, thereby it stabilizes HIF-1 protein and enhances the tumorigenic activity of HIF-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NQO1 is a ubiquitously expressed FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide)-dependent flavoprotein that provides essential cytoprotective anti-oxidant functions through catalysing a two-electron reduction of potentially toxic quinones7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NQO1 polymorphisms, particularly C609T that causes rapid ubiquitination and degradation of the NQO1 protein, have been implicated with a higher risk of several human cancers46,47, but, paradoxically, upregulation of NQO1 has been also shown to correlate with poor prognosis of colorectal, breast and cervical cancers5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we revealed previously unsuspected pro-tumorigenic roles for NQO1 that essentially increase the expression of the HIF-1 protein, a central transcriptional factor of the hypoxic response of cancer cells to the hypoxic tumour microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further provide evidence suggesting that NQO1 stabilizes the HIF-1 protein by physically interacting with the ODD domain of HIF-1 that prevents PHDs from binding to HIF-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that HIF-1 has a prominent role in hypoxic adaptation and tumorigenic progression in most human cancers16,17,18, our study provides a possible mechanistic explanation for the involvement of NQO1 overexpression with poor prognosis in clinical outcomes of cancer patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In order to better understand the potential clinical implication of NQO1 for the prognosis of human cancer, we revisited publically available data sets for colorectal cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As reported previously by others38, the NQO1 level in colorectal cancer specimens was significantly higher than that in NQO1 expression in the normal colorectal tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed that the cancer tissues expressing high NQO1 level also express higher-level of HIF-1 protein than tumours expressing relatively low NQO1 (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2, we identified a function of NQO1 in which HIF-1 stability was markedly enhanced under hypoxia following ectopic introduction of NQO1 into NQO1-deficient MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, RKO colorectal cancer cells with suppressed NQO1 expression showed markedly accelerated degradation of HIF-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further observed that HIF-1 mRNA transcription is independent of NQO1 (Suppelmentary Fig 5), and that the degradation of HIF-1 protein is prevented by NQO1 via direct physical interaction between NQO1 and HIF-1 proteins in the cytosol (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, it has been reported that NQO1 stabilized several proteins including CEBP, p53, p73 and p33ING1b by blocking their proteasomal degradation33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of HIF-1 by PHDs has been a well-acknowledged central oxygen-sensing pathway that regulates the HIF-1 protein stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings that NQO1 directly forms a complex with the ODD domain of HIF-1 competing with PHDs for binding, thereby protecting HIF-1 from ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation (Fig 5) add another layer of regulation to the cellular oxygen homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a previous report, PHD2 was the key regulator setting low steady-state levels of HIF-148.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accord with this report, we also observed that low expression of NQO1 decreased steady-state levels of HIF-1 (Fig 2), and that inhibition of PHD2 by siRNA decreased hydroxylation of HIF-1 in NQO1-deficient cell lines (Fig 5h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, our study cannot entirely rule out the possibility that NQO1 may enhance the HIF-1 expression also through regulating the degradation of other proteins that affects the HIF-1 protein stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, recent studies have demonstrated that HSP90 increased the stability of HIF-1 proteins, whereas HSP70, Cullin5 and RACK1 decreased the stability of HIF-1 protein30,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, a previous study has shown that HIF-1 is degraded by HSP70 via a PHDs-independent mechanism during prolonged hypoxia31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, expression of these proteins was not affected by NQO1 (Supplementary Fig 10a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although HIF-1 signalling has been associated with increased mortality of most human cancers through multiple aspects of the pro-tumorigenic process including angiogenesis, tumour growth, metastasis, chemoresistance and radioresistance16,17,18, recent studies reported that HIF-1 could act as a tumour suppressor in certain cancers such as VHL-null renal cell carcinoma where HIF-2 functions as a dominant oncogenic driver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, increasing evidence suggests that functional contributions of HIF-1 and HIF-2 to tumour progression are context dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we also observed enhanced expression of HIF-2 by NQO1 under hypoxia (Supplementary Fig 11a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it would be a great importance to warrant further investigation to better understanding of the roles of NQO1 in the context of complex relationship between HIF-1 and HIF-2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite the fact that NQO1 has been reported to be highly expressed in numerous human cancers and our tumour xenograft experiments clearly argue that NQO1 is pro-tumorigenic (Fig 7a), contradictory results on its biological roles in tumorigenesis have been reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As mentioned above, previous studies have demonstrated that NQO1 plays a critical role in cellular defense mechanisms against free radical damage, oxidative stress, inflammatory responses and carcinogenesis33,49,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NQO1-null mice exhibited increased susceptibility to chemical-induced skin carcinogenesis51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, NQO1 has been shown to stabilize tumour suppressor, p53 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, it has been reported that NQO1 suppresses NF-B-p300 interaction to regulate inflammatory mediators associated with prostate tumorigenesis52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies suggested that NQO1 could act to suppress tumorigenesis in certain conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these anti-tumorigenic effects of NQO1 appear to be due to protective functions of its oxidoreductase activities, non-catalytic roles, such as stabilization of p53, may be involved in its tumour suppressive roles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More studies will be required to explore a dual function of NQO1 in different cancers and more importantly, how HIFs contribute to this dual function of NQO1 in tumorigenic progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously, Dang et al.51 demonstrated that HIF-1 knockout had no effect on the growth of RKO xenografts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this is inconsistent with our observations that HIF-1 knockdown attenuated RKO xenograft growth compared with control and NQO1 overexpressed tumours, histological evaluation of these tumours showed reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis in HIF-1-deficient xenografts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results agree with observations of reduced tumour burden upon HIF-1 knockdown or knockout in several other colon cancer cell lines, though further studies are needed to determine possible compensatory mechanisms upon complete HIF-1 knockout and whether they are specific to RKO cells or other colon cancer cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with Dang et al.51 we observed no difference in microvessel density upon HIF-1 knockdown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, NQO1 overexpression displayed increased vasculature compatible with our observations of enhanced VEGF production in vitro upon NQO1 overexpression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, our findings indicate that NQO1 enhances HIF-1 activity by stabilizing the HIF-1 protein (Fig 7g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, hypoxic accumulation of HIF-1 was further amplified in NQO1 expressing cancer cells that may accelerate the tumour growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our insight into PHDs-mediated oxygen sensing machinery in cancer leads to a discovery of a regulator of HIF-1 stabilization that may open up an avenue for anti-cancer therapeutic strategies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
