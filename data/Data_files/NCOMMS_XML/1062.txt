Zinc is a potent and specific inhibitor of IFN-3 signalling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Lambda interferons (IFNL, IFN-) are pro-inflammatory cytokines important in acute and chronic viral infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs12979860 and rs8099917 within the IFNL gene locus predict hepatitis C virus (HCV) clearance, as well as inflammation and fibrosis progression in viral and non-viral liver disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The underlying mechanism, however, is not defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that the rs12979860 CC genotype correlates with increased hepatic metallothionein expression through increased systemic zinc levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zinc interferes with IFN-3 binding to IFNL receptor 1 (IFNLR1), resulting in decreased antiviral activity and increased viral replication (HCV, influenza) in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HCV patients with high zinc levels have low hepatocyte antiviral and inflammatory gene expression and high viral loads, confirming the inhibitory role of zinc in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide the first evidence that zinc can act as a potent and specific inhibitor of IFN-3 signalling and highlight its potential as a target of therapeutic intervention for IFN-3-mediated chronic disease.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The past decade of research has demonstrated that different tissues evoke distinct and tightly regulated antiviral responses based on multiple environmental and host factors: proximity and concentration of antigen, cytokine responsiveness mediated by receptor expression, resident immune cells and genetic background, to name a few.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interferon lambdas (IFN-s, type III interferons), comprising IFN-1, 2, 3 and 4 have only recently been recognized as antiviral and pro-inflammatory cytokines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although IFN-s are beneficial in response to acute infection1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, evidence indicates that IFN-s may drive chronic inflammation and end-organ damage such as hepatic cirrhosis9,10,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Due to the restricted expression of the IFN- receptor (IFNLR1), tissues high in epithelial cell content that are consistently challenged by pathogens, including the lungs, gut and liver, are selectively responsive to IFN-s14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In blood, primary pathogen responders, macrophages and dendritic cells, are responsive to IFN-s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The receptor complex for type III interferons is unique, consisting of the IL-10 receptor  subunit (IL-10R) and IFN-R1; however, downstream signalling is similar to type I interferons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon activation, the receptor mediates phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2, which heterodimerize, and with the addition of IRF9, form the interferon stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike type I interferons, IFN-s may require unique accessory signalling pathways (for example, MAPKs) and intermediates (for example, JAK2) for optimal signal transduction, which may explain the prolonged ISG expression mediated by IFN-s, compared to IFN- (refs 15, 16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The importance of IFN-s became evident after simultaneous genome-wide association studies that identified a cluster of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IFN- gene locus predicting hepatitis C virus (HCV) clearance spontaneously or in response to IFN- and ribavirin treatment in patients with genotype 1 HCV infection1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IFNL genomic locus has since been studied in greater detail, revealing a novel SNP (rs368234815) in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs12979860 that generates IFN-4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IFN-4 expression has only been shown in hepatocytes and in individuals possessing the frame shift mutation G at rs368234815, instead of the TT allele, which results in an early stop codon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individuals possessing the favourable IFN- responder genotype (rs12979860 CC, rs368234815 TT and rs8099917 TT) maintain lower basal ISG expression in the liver, possibly due to lack of a functional IFN-4, and as a result are more responsive to IFN- treatment19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another SNP within the IFN-4 protein coding region that converts a proline to a serine residue (rs117648444) was found to further improve rapid virological response21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IFN-4 carrying the serine residue showed decreased ISG induction potential, favouring reduced hepatic ISG pre-activation and subsequently improved HCV clearance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A functional understanding of how the IFN- polymorphisms affect the antiviral response and inflammation has not yet been conclusively determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences in IFN-3 expression have however been noted by several groups2,3,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IFN-3 affects not only hepatic tissue, as described for IFN-4, but also infiltrating immune cells, important mediators of HCV clearance and chronic inflammatory disease in the liver23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have recently shown the IFNL rs12979860 SNP is a strong predictor of hepatic inflammation and thus progressive end-organ damage in viral (that is, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HCV infection) and non-viral chronic liver diseases (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis)23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although protective in acute infection, IFN-s may promote ongoing inflammation and end-organ damage in chronic disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This type of immune dysfunction has been well characterized in HIV patients, where chronic IFN- production contributes to numerous HIV-related co-morbidities24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We previously demonstrated that multiple members of the MT1 metallothionein gene family are highly expressed in the liver of individuals possessing the favourable IFNL rs8099917 TT responder genotype, the opposite trend to antiviral ISGs, which are low20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metallothioneins are small, cysteine-rich proteins capable of binding metal ions, the most common of which is zinc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the four major isoforms, the MT1 subfamily and MT2A are ubiquitously expressed, whereas MT3 and MT4 are specific to neuronal and squamous epithelium respectively25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metallothioneins bind upwards of 15% of intracellular zinc and demonstrate diverse functions including metal homoeostasis, heavy metal detoxification and protection against oxidative stress26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, IFN- and inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6 and TNF, have all been shown to induce metallothioneins, suggesting they may have a role in immunity27,28,29,30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we identify zinc as the most potent inducer of metallothionein expression in vitro, and a strong inhibitor of IFN-3, but not IFN-1 or IFN- signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we implicate zinc as a major driver of metallothionein expression in vivo and, more importantly, as an IFNL genotype-dependent regulator of ISGs and inflammatory cytokine expression in the livers of patients with chronic HCV infection.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Metallothionein expression is strongly induced by zinc', 'Metallothioneins MT1F, MT1G, MT1H, MT1M and MT1X are upregulated in the livers from patients with IFN- rs8099917 TT responder genotypes in contrast to ISGs which are low20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To better understand the regulation of the metallothioneins in the liver, we examined metallothionein induction in response to three diverse stimuli: viral infection with influenza virus (H1N1), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), HBV, or HCV, cytokine treatment (IFN-, IFN-3 and IL-6) and metal exposure (iron, copper and zinc).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Huh-7 cells infected with HSV-1 (multiplicity of infection, (MOI)=1) or H1N1 influenza virus (MOI=0.1) demonstrated a general downregulation of metallothionein expression (Fig 1a, left panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, cytopathic effect (CPE) and resulting cell death induced by both viruses was high and may have limited metallothionein induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, HepG2 cells transfected with the HBV pUC19-HBV/E replacement replicon32 showed no CPE and only minor metallothionein induction (MT1X P less_than 0.05, Welchs t-test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only virus we assayed that significantly upregulated all metallothioneins examined, was JFH-1, a genotype 2a strain of HCV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metallothionein expression was measured following HCV infection of Huh-7 cells (minimum 2 passages, 1 week), resulting in sustained viral replication with minimal CPE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Metallothionein transcription is driven by diverse stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) To examine metallothionein induction, Huh-7 cells were either virally infected, or treated with cytokines or heavy metals for 8 h. Influenza and HSV downregulated metallothionein expression whereas HBV had little effect and HCV significantly upregulated all metallothioneins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the cytokines examined modulated MT1F and MT1G, and only IFN- was able to induce MT1X and MT2A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the metal treatments, 50 M ZnSO4 most potently upregulated all the metallothioneins, followed by CuSO4, while FeSO4 had little effect (Welchs t-test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Huh-7 cells treated with zinc in low serum media showed a stronger induction of metallothioneins, confirming the zinc quenching role of albumin (Welchs t-test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement, metallothionein expression was dose-responsively reduced with BSA treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Quantification of intracellular zinc by Zinpyr-1 staining confirmed that zinc and albumin dose-dependently increase and decrease intracellular zinc, respectively (Welchs t-test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are representative of three independent

metallothionein expression in an in vitro model of HCV infection, publicly available microarray data from primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) infected with HCV (Geo Dataset GSE54648) were used33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple metallothioneins were significantly upregulated in PHHs with the rs12979860 CC genotype, compared to CT/TT genotypes, in both infected hepatocytes and those adjacent to infected cells (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Unlike previous reports27,34, cytokine induction of metallothioneins in Huh-7 cells was mostly absent: treatment with IFN- for 8 h significantly upregulated MT1X and MT2A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, IFN-3 and IL-6 had little effect compared to mock controls (Fig 1a, middle panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, exposure to metal salts for 8 h induced the strongest upregulation of metallothioneins (Fig 1a, right panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with 50 M ZnSO4 potently induced all the metallothioneins, with 100 M CuSO4 evoking a weaker response, and 100 M FeSO4 having no effect on metallothionein expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our data are in accordance with published data demonstrating that metallothioneins are primarily induced directly by zinc and indirectly by oxidative stress (intracellular zinc release)26,35 and cytokine treatment (zinc influx)27,28,36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To better understand the regulation of metallothionein genes in response to zinc, we treated Huh-7 cells with ZnSO4 to induce metallothionein expression and bovine serum albumin (BSA) to diminish metallothionein expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Albumin is a major carrier of zinc in the blood, and has recently been shown to potently reduce the biological effects of zinc in vitro38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To limit the zinc-quenching ability of albumin, we lowered the albumin content of the cell culture media to 1%, and found that ZnSO4 was far more potently able to induce expression of MT1F and MT1G in particular (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, when cells were treated with 5 M ZnSO4 in increasing concentrations of albumin, a potent reduction in metallothionein expression was measured, emphasizing albumins ability to sequester zinc and limit metallothionein expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To confirm these data, we measured intracellular zinc content in these cells and found that zinc and albumin dose-dependently increased or decreased intracellular zinc, respectively (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intracellular zinc content was increased almost twofold with the addition of 50 M ZnSO4 (P less_than 0.01, Welchs t-test), and subsequently reduced by over 40% with the addition of 50 mg ml1 albumin (P less_than 0.01, Welchs t-test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, by plotting intracellular zinc against metallothionein expression, we showed that MT1F and MT1G are far more responsive to intracellular zinc than MT2A, as demonstrated by significantly higher exponential growth rates (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'IFN-induced metallothionein expression is mediated by zinc', 'To examine the relationship between IFN, zinc and subsequent metallothionein expression, Huh-7 cells were grown in media containing 1% serum and treated with either 50 U ml1 IFN- or 100 ng ml1 IFN-3, in combination with 0, 5 and 50 M ZnSO4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IFN--mediated MT1F/MT1G and IFN-3-mediated MT1F induction occurred only in the presence of 5 M ZnSO4, suggesting that zinc is required for interferon-mediated metallothionein expression (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The addition of 50 M zinc likely induced maximal metallothionein expression through zinc alone, preventing additional interferon-mediated metallothionein upregulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike the other metallothioneins, MT2A expression was induced in the absence of zinc, indicating that it may be directly regulated by interferons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Interferon induces zinc influx and metallothionein expression in Huh-7 cells.

by interferons only in the presence of 5 M ZnSO4, suggesting that their expression is mediated by zinc influx following interferon stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, MT2A was upregulated by IFN- even in the absence of zinc, suggesting differential regulation by interferon (Welchs t-test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) To confirm interferon-mediated zinc influx, cells were treated with IFN- or IFN-3 and 5 M ZnSO4 and intracellular/media zinc was measured using the zinc fluorophore Zinpyr-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both interferon treatments resulted in a zinc influx from the media into the cells, providing a mechanistic explanation for metallothionein upregulation following interferon treatment (one-way ANOVA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are representative of three independent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  *P

Zinpyr-1 was used to detect changes in intracellular and extracellular zinc in Huh-7 cell culture media treated with 5 M ZnSO4 and IFN- or IFN-3 over 1 h.

with an increase in intracellular zinc at 60 min that was only observed in interferon-treated cells (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data suggest that interferon-mediated upregulation of metallothioneins in vitro is dependent on zinc influx and not the classical STAT1/2 signalling pathway, particularly for members of the MT1 subfamily.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm this hypothesis, we performed siRNA-mediated STAT2 knockdown, and demonstrated that while IFN-3-induced ISG expression is drastically reduced, MT1F expression is not (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Zinc inhibits the ISG response to IFN-3 but not IFN-', 'Zinc uptake following IFN- or IFN-3 treatment suggests that intracellular zinc may influence interferon-mediated signal transduction and subsequent antiviral activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the effect of hepatic zinc on the cellular response to interferons, we modulated intracellular zinc in Huh-7 cells with ZnSO4 and BSA and examined downstream STAT1 activation, a signalling intermediate shared by IFN- and IFN-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, zinc treatment dose-dependently reduced IFN-3 (100 ng ml1) induced STAT1 phosphorylation, but had no effect on IFN- (50 U ml1) downstream signalling (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To reverse the inhibitory activity of zinc, Huh-7 cells were treated with 5 M ZnSO4 in combination with albumin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IFN-3-mediated STAT1 phosphorylation was recovered with albumin treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IFN- STAT1 phosphorylation however remained relatively unchanged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect was duplicated in the hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2, the colonic enterocyte cell lines Caco-2 and HCT116, and fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting the inhibitory effect of zinc on IFN-3 but not IFN- signalling is a general phenomenon independent of the tissue or cell line studied (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure that our results were not due to the effect of

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'This study identifies for the first time that zinc is a potent, specific inhibitor of IFN-3 signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also demonstrate in vitro that zinc is a potent driver of metallothionein expression and is linked to type I/III interferon response by influx.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zinc inhibited IFN-3 signalling in vitro by interfering with IFN-3:IFN-R1 signalling at the receptor, but demonstrated little effect on the IFN- response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a strong negative association between hepatic metallothionein and ISG/chemokine expression in patients with chronic HCV, suggesting that zinc mediates induction of metallothioneins in vivo, while inhibiting IFN-3-mediated ISG expression (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, serum zinc was higher in HCV-infected patients possessing the rs12979860 CC genotype, suggesting it may drive down pre-treatment ISG expression to facilitate a strong immune response (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By creating a master list of genes that show a significant inverse correlation with all quantified MT1 genes, we created a list of potential zinc-regulated genes with roles relating to the immune response, cell motility and adhesion.

that rapidly relocates from the blood into the liver, infected tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cell populations following infection and cytokine stimulation58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, it has been difficult to distinguish the source of metallothionein induction in vivo, as zinc relocation is an integral part of systemic immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that metallothionein induction was most responsive to zinc treatment, but was also upregulated in response to HCV infection in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acute HCV infection induces a significant amount of oxidative stress within infected hepatocytes59, which is a key driver of metallothionein expression due to the release of intracellular zinc stores26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HCV induced inflammatory cytokine expression however, likely plays a small role in metallothionein induction following infection, as we demonstrated only mild metallothionein expression following interferon/IL-6 treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, chronic HCV infection in vivo has been shown to reduce plasma zinc as well as hepatic metallothionein expression, suggesting chronic infection/inflammatory cytokine exposure has a markedly different effect on zinc distribution than the acute response60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In our experiments, interferon stimulation induced a modest increase in expression of MT1 subfamily genes that was zinc-influx dependent as has been previously shown28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we demonstrated zinc inhibition of IFN-3 signalling (Fig 3), the concentration used (5 M ZnSO4) was not sufficient to fully inhibit the interaction between IFN-3 and IFN-R1, but was sufficient to demonstrate zinc influx in response to interferons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike the MT1 subfamily, MT2A was upregulated by IFN- even in the absence of zinc, suggesting that it is a classical STAT1:STAT2 dependent ISG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the UCSC genome browser61, analysis of experimentally validated transcription factor binding to MT1 subfamily versus MT2A promoter regions substantiates this hypothesis (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inflammatory transcription factor binding within the promoters of MT1 subfamily members is limited and likely mediated primarily by zinc, while MT2A demonstrates an accumulation of STAT1, IRF1, STAT3, NFB and AP-1 binding sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The role of zinc in the interferon response has been widely studied, but remains poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In persons with zinc deficiency, zinc supplementation improves not only the type I and II interferon production/response62,63, but also immune cell survival, maturation and function64,65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because up to 10% of the human proteome is capable of binding zinc66, narrowing down zinc-specific mechanisms of immune activation/repression has been difficult, and is indeed multifactorial67.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated an improvement in the IFN- response in the presence of 5 M ZnSO4, resulting in a moderate increase in MX1, viperin and CXCL10 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zinc-mediated IFN- dimers have been purified by crystallography47, and have been demonstrated in our zinc binding experiments (Fig 6b), however the resulting effect on antiviral activity remains unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our novel finding that zinc can specifically inhibit IFN-3 signalling, suggests interference upstream of STAT1 phosphorylation, which most likely occurs at the receptor binding interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pre-treatment with zinc (Fig 6a) demonstrated no major effect on IFN-3-induced STAT1 phosphorylation when cells were subsequently washed and zinc was not included with the cytokine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that intracellular zinc does not play a significant role in blocking IFN-3 signalling, and rules out an interaction between zinc and STAT1, or other intracellular IFN-signalling intermediates as a possible mechanism of inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Potent inhibition of IFN-3 signalling occurred only when zinc was included with IFN-3, indicating that it likely interferes with the interferon:receptor interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, zinc was unable to prevent IFN-1 signalling (Supplementary Fig 6), which binds to a similar IFN-R1 region as IFN-3 (refs 49, 50), and suggests that zinc binding to IFN-3 may specifically inhibit receptor interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We subsequently confirmed zinc binding to IFN-3 as well as inhibition of receptor binding by both co-IP and proximity ligation assay (Fig 6), strongly supporting this hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the data however, it is difficult to completely exclude an interaction of zinc with IFN-R1 that affects only the interaction with IFN-3, as both IFN-3 and IFN-1 have different tertiary structures and thus may interact differently with IFN-R1 residues49,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies are required to clarify the mechanistic model of zinc inhibition, and whether it is indeed an interaction between zinc and IFN-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Circular dichroism spectroscopy to determine if zinc can alter IFN-3 tertiary structure or mutational analysis of IFN-3/IFN-R1 to identify the specific residues through which zinc interferes with IFN-3 signalling can be considered to elucidate this complex mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The inverse relationship observed between ISG expression and metallothioneins/serum zinc suggests IFN-s are the major mediators of ISG expression in HCV-infected liver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, this has been shown in experimental models of acute HCV infection in chimpanzees and PHHs39,68.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, elevated serum zinc and hepatic metallothionein expression in patients with the rs12979860 CC genotype provides a mechanism to explain their reduced expression of hepatic ISGs prior to treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low baseline ISG expression in the liver of patients with HCV is beneficial as it provides a basis for a potent antiviral response in the context of IFN- based therapy69, but this may not be the case for other viral infections controlled by IFN-3, and requires further study7,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanism of elevated serum zinc in patients with the IFN- rs12979860 CC genotype may be mediated by increased circulating IFN-3, which we have shown can drive intestinal zinc uptake in vitro (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that elevated serum IFN-3 in these individuals may increase serum zinc, which can become reduced following chronic HCV infection60, thereby facilitating a stronger hepatic immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our group and others have demonstrated a strong association between IFN- polymorphisms and chronic inflammation in chronic viral and non-viral liver disease, suggesting that zinc supplementation may provide a useful, well tolerated adjunct to modulate inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The strong regulatory role of zinc on ISG expression led us to believe that it may mediate similar immune repression on a genome-wide scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By identifying only genes that showed significant inverse correlation with all metallothioneins, we achieved a more stringent identification of 867 genes that are most likely to be regulated by intracellular zinc (Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because this list only includes genes that correlate with all five metallothioneins, we likely excluded a number of zinc-regulated genes, including a number of ISGs, cytokines and chemokines we identified in Figs 4 and 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the gene list was created to elucidate biological processes that are most likely regulated by zinc, and confirm that metallothionein expression reflects tissue zinc in our model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concentrated within this gene set were biological processes related not only to innate immunity, but monocyte/DC/NK/T cell chemo-attraction and adhesion (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zinc inhibition of the intracellular inflammatory response has been shown previously70,71, but our data suggest a further inhibition of immune cell recruitment and activation at sites of inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In concordance, we demonstrated a strong zinc-mediated inhibition of IFN-3-induced CXCL10 mRNA and protein expression in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This adds another layer of complexity to zinc biology, as zinc has classically been shown to improve immune cell function64, but our data suggest it may also inhibit recruitment to inflamed tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we have demonstrated for the first time that IFN-3 signalling is directly inhibited by zinc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elevated hepatic zinc, as suggested by increased metallothionein expression, mediates a reduction in ISG expression in patients with the rs12979860 CC genotype, thus facilitating viral clearance following treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, using the co-expressed MT1 gene family as a marker for hepatic zinc, we have demonstrated that zinc inhibits numerous facets of the hepatic immune response that may be mediated by IFN-3, including leukocyte chemotaxis and adhesion.
