Structural hot spots for the solubility of globular proteins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Natural selection shapes protein solubility to physiological requirements and recombinant applications that require higher protein concentrations are often problematic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This raises the question whether the solubility of natural protein sequences can be improved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We here show an anti-correlation between the number of aggregation prone regions (APRs) in a protein sequence and its solubility, suggesting that mutational suppression of APRs provides a simple strategy to increase protein solubility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that mutations at specific positions within a protein structure can act as APR suppressors without affecting protein stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These hot spots for protein solubility are both structure and sequence dependent but can be computationally predicted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate this by reducing the aggregation of human -galactosidase and protective antigen of Bacillus anthracis through mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that many proteins possess hot spots allowing to adapt protein solubility independently of structure and function.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'To function proteins have to fold into their native structure while avoiding misfolding and aggregates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the spread in cellular abundance of proteins in a typical proteome spans about nine to ten orders of magnitude1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As protein aggregation is a concentration-dependent process the challenge posed to protein folding therefore varies enormously between low- and high-abundant proteins2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent evidence indicates the aggregation propensity of proteins is tuned to their cellular abundance3,4 and that cellular protein levels correlate with protein solubility5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests protein solubility is on average only marginally superior to physiological expression levels and that many proteins are living on the edge6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This has important implications for the production and use of recombinant proteins in biotechnology and therapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recombinant protein applications require protein concentrations several orders of magnitude above natural abundance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result several potentially valuable therapeutic proteins remain beyond reach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This also raises fundamental questions on the evolutionary mechanisms allowing adapting protein solubility to changing requirements in protein abundance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, reducing the aggregation propensity of globular proteins is not a straightforward task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Globular structure requires a hydrophobic core to lock secondary structure elements into a well defined three-dimensional fold, which in turn generates aggregation prone amino acid sequences7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein structure and protein aggregation are therefore entangled properties, rendering it very difficult to remove protein aggregation without affecting protein stability and structure9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The question therefore remains how natural selection manages to co-evolve protein function and solubility without affecting the native structure of proteins and by extension, what we can learn from this to improve the properties of industrial and therapeutic recombinant proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Protein aggregation is a process resulting in the accumulation of misfolded proteins into insoluble agglomerates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although hydrophobicity is often an important driver for phase separation of misfolded proteins, structural aggregation itself is geared by more specific interactions between identical linear aggregation prone sequence regions (APRs) within the primary sequence that assemble by intermolecular -strand interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The determining role of APRs in protein aggregation has been demonstrated for several amyloid-disease proteins by grafting experiments: insertion of APRs from various proteins in a non-aggregating scaffold domain results in similar aggregation propensity and morphology than the original protein from which the APR was derived10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On average a globular protein domain contains 24 APRs and 20% of the total protein sequence of any given proteome is part of APRs13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was demonstrated on a large set of Escherichia coli proteins that the intrinsic aggregation propensity of folded proteins correlates with their solubility15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We show the solubility of proteins can directly be related to the number of APRs within a protein sequence and that modulating the number of APRs by mutation significantly affects protein solubility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we perform an analysis of the relationship between protein structure and the aggregation propensity of its primary sequence over a representative set of 584 high quality crystal structures (R-factor  less_than 0.19 and resolution less_than 1.5 Å) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16), representing all common protein folds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that although most residues within APRs are in a structural gridlock coupling aggregation and thermodynamic stability, specific positions in a protein structure can be mutated to lower the aggregation propensity of the primary sequence without significantly affecting protein stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These context-dependent hotspots for solubility therefore allow to significantly improve protein solubility in a step-wise manner by point mutations that suppress individual APRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings further clarify our understanding of the selective pressures relating protein structure, function and solubility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It confirms that although APRs cannot be avoided altogether in globular proteins, protein aggregation is under selective pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our structural analysis demonstrates this selective pressure is not saturated but dictated by physiological requirements in protein abundance and as a result most proteins have potential for increased solubility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We illustrate these principles with two examples in which we introduced mutations in these structural hotspots thereby increasing resistance to protein aggregation without affecting structure or function: -galactosidase, a protein currently used in replacement therapy for Fabrys disease and the anthrax protective antigen, a key component for recombinant anthrax vaccines.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Protein abundance correlates with aggregation prone regions', 'We used TANGO to predict all APRs in the E. coli proteome and matched these (1) to E. coli protein solubility (3,173 proteins) as measured by Niwa et al.17 using in vitro translation and (2) to cellular abundance (597 proteins) data obtained by Vogel et al.18 using mass spectrometry (Supplementary Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find a good correlation (cor=0.96) between the number of APRs and the protein solubility averaged by APR count.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 1a), consistent with the notion that the burden of additional APRs lowers the solubility of proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a large variation per category (Supplementary Fig 1B), indicating the effect of APRs is modulated strongly by cellular and structural context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure the correlation is robust, we performed a bootstrap analysis, in which we recalculated the same correlation based on 1,000 randomly selected samples, each consisting of 80% of the original data points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bootstrapped correlations are consistently high (Supplementary Fig 1C), supporting the robustness of the observation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, we find a good correlation (cor=0.77) between the number of APRs in a protein sequence and cellular abundance (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, there is quite some variation per category (Supplementary Fig 1D), but the correlation is robust in 1,000-fold bootstrap analysis (Supplementary Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was previously shown that protein solubility in vitro and cellular protein abundance in vivo correlate, indicating that protein solubility is tuned to their cellular abundance5,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results therefore suggest that altering the number of APRs would have a strong effect on protein solubility and abundance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the correlation between intrinsic aggregation propensity and protein abundance improves when a higher TANGO cutoff is employed (cor=0.97), although with a reduced number of datapoints in the plot (Supplementary Fig 1F), Nevertheless, this suggests that the stronger APRs are relevant for protein abundance in vivo, while all regions contribute to solubility in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: APRs and gatekeepers in natural polypeptide sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The scatterplot of the average experimentally determined solubility5,17 of E. coli proteins grouped by the number of APRs in their sequence displays an anti-correlation, showing that on average protein solubility decreases with increasing number of aggregation prone sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) A similar plot to A, but now for protein abundance in E. coli in vivo 5,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the anti-correlation is weaker, the trend suggests that cellular abundance is also limited by the number of APRs in its sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Schematic representation depicting the TANGO profile of a typical naturally occurring polypeptide stretch of 100 amino acids, containing two APRs (red) each flanked by an N-terminal as well as a C-terminal gatekeeper (green), as well as one suppressed APR (blue) controlled by a single suppressing gatekeeper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) A density plot of the TANGO scores in the set of 634 structurally diverse proteins (red), showing a strong bias towards lower scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the

scoring regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Density plot showing the number of APRs occurring per 100 amino acids in 634 structurally diverse proteins (red line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The blue line shows the number of suppressed APRs, which are not detected by TANGO in the WT sequence, but show up after mutation of a single Asp, Glu, Lys, Arg or Pro residue to Ala.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If mutation of such a residue reveals an APR that is undetectable in the WT sequence, we call that residue a suppressing gatekeeper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inset shows the frequency of the amino acid type of suppressing gatekeepers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) Density plot of the contribution of gatekeeper residues to the overall thermodynamic stability of the native state of the protein as calculated by FoldX (red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same plot for the suppressing gatekeepers in the same proteins (blue) is very similar.Full size image', 'Protein sequences possess cryptic APRs', 'The existence of APRs is a consequence of globular structure and especially of the requirement of hydrophobic cores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time it hampers protein folding and limits protein solubility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not surprisingly it was found that APRs are subjected to negative selection19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most efficient strategy to eliminate APRs consists in mutating a central hydrophobic residue in the APR to a charged residue or a Pro, as these so-called aggregation gatekeepers disfavour the -structure adopted by hydrophobic sequences in aggregates20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in practice in most cases it is impossible to place charged residues at central positions within the APR without obliterating the native structure given that APRs are often part of the hydrophobic core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The next best solution to reduce aggregation is to place gatekeepers at the flanks of APRs (Fig 1c) as these positions are relatively more solvent exposed allowing to accommodate charges with an acceptable cost to the thermodynamic stability of the protein21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this does generally not allow to completely suppress protein aggregation, the almost systematic placement of charges at the flanks of APRs clearly minimizes aggregation as can be observed from the exponential distribution of APR strength in the human proteome (Fig 1d) with the majority of APRs displaying low-to-moderate aggregation tendencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The green curve in the plot shows that this distribution in the absence of the gatekeeper residues is shifted towards much stronger aggregation propensities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This general situation does not imply that it is necessarily always impossible to silence an APR by placement of a central gatekeeper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact the selective pressure against aggregation suggests that proteins should possess a significant amount of suppressed APRs (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the existence of suppressed APRs we analysed a non-redundant set (sequence identity below 30%) of 584 proteins for which high quality crystal structures were available (R-factor better than 0.19, resolution better than 1.5 Å), which were previously selected by the WHATIF consortium22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we used the TANGO software13 to identify all APRs and GKs in these proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However when a gatekeeper residue is most effective, it will result in a sequence that no longer scores as aggregation prone and hence, these suppressing gatekeepers (sGKs) are not identified during the standard analysis because the APR will not be detected (it is suppressed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When such a residue is mutated to an amino acid that does not oppose aggregation, the aggregation score for the comprising region will dramatically increase, thus revealing the suppressed APR (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of course, unequivocally identifying suppressed APRs in this manner is impossible as we cannot make the difference between a previously existent APR that has been suppressed or a non-aggregating sequence that evolved one mutation away towards aggregation for other functional reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What this analysis can provide, however, is an idea of the number of cryptic APRs in a protein sequence and thus the number of positions within a sequence that are hotspots for susceptibility to aggregation upon mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To identify sGKs we truncated all Arg, Lys, Glu, Asp and Pro residues outside of already identified APRs individually to Ala and employed TANGO to identify those residues whose truncation to Ala leads to the detection of a novel APR in the mutated sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The APR discovered in this way we call cryptic APR and the residue that keeps its aggregation propensity low in the wild-type (WT) sequence suppressing GK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that the choice for mutating to Ala is guided by the structural considerations under study, that is, the interdependence of protein aggregation and stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conservative mutation is a good reporter both for aggregation (its aggregation propensity is a good approximation for the average of all amino acids) and for the thermodynamic contribution of that residue to the structure (mutation to Ala removes interactions without introducing new ones).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This analysis revealed that on average for every two regular APRs, proteins contain another cryptic APR and that 40% of proteins in this set have no sAPR, whereas this is less than 5% for real APRs (Fig 1e) suggesting that indeed it is structurally more difficult to silence an APR by sGK than to cap the flanks of APRs with GK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequency of each of the five amino acid types of gatekeepers is roughly equal (Fig 1e, inset) and in contrast to regular APRs, whose intrinsic aggregation propensity is strongly biased to the lowest TANGO scores, the cryptic APRs have TANGO scores across the entire spectrum (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data suggest that any gatekeeper residue can be employed to silence the intrinsic aggregation propensity of an APR, and the limitation to its placement will come predominantly from compatibility with the folded structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to evaluate this, we employed the FoldX algorithm23 to quantify the contribution of individuals GKs and sGKs to protein stability, which yielded similar distributions largely centred around zero (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the FoldX analysis suggests that 40% of GKs and sGKs come at a thermodynamic cost to the stability of the native structure, suggesting that the net gain for minimizing aggregation often outweigh the price paid in terms of thermodynamic stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'sGK mutations are enriched in disease mutants', 'To further evaluate the importance of sGKs we analysed the frequency of loss of sGKs through mutation in the Varibench set of 19,335 disease mutations and 21,170 human non synonymous coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This revealed that the loss of a sGK is twice as likely in the disease set than in the polymorphism set (Fig 2a, inset), suggesting that this type of mutation is likely to be deleterious, consistent with the notion that sGKs fulfil an important role in repressing cryptic APRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we analysed PaxDB24, an integrated database for the natural abundance of human proteins, comparing the abundances of proteins that contain disease-associated and neutral mutations that affect sGKs (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analysis shows these distributions differ significantly (MannWhitney U-test P value of 5.43 × 1011), suggesting that mutation of a sGK in a highly abundant protein is more likely to be disease-associated than in a lowly abundant protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This underlines the importance of this novel class of residues in polypeptide sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Potential for introducing artificial gatekeepers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Comparison of the frequency of mutations that remove suppressing gakekeepers (sGKs) in pathogenic mutations and polymorphisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall frequency is shown in the inset, whereas the main plot shows how the frequency of these mutations varies according to the cellular abundance of the WT proteins, showing that removal of a sGK is more likely to be neutral in proteins that occur at a low cellular concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) A systematic mutational scan of all residues of 4,730 APRs in 634 structurally diverse proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each residue was mutated to Pro, Arg, Lys, Asp or Glu and its effect on intrinsic aggregation propensity and protein stability (G) estimated using TANGO and FoldX, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heat map analysis (red to yellow gradient indicating increasing density) of the change in intrinsic aggregation propensity versus protein stability (G) shows that the main density of mutations occurs at a high cost to thermodynamic stability and with moderate reductions of intrinsic aggregation and that only a minority of mutants significantly reduce aggregation without affecting thermodynamic stability (green box).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Density plot of the number of artificial

gatekeepers or suppressing gatekeepers does not mean that all APRs are necessarily optimized to saturation point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This idea is compatible with the observation that protein solubility is generally optimized to its physiological abundance but generally not more4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The question therefore remains to what degree the aggregation of natural protein sequences is still amenable to improvement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To investigate this, we systematically mutated every residue that is part of an APR in the same set of 634 proteins individually to Pro, Arg, Lys, Asp and Glu and recorded the predicted change in aggregation propensity (TANGO) and protein stability (G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2b shows a density distribution of the resulting 75,720 mutations as a heat map from yellow (frequent) to red (rare), revealing as expected that for most positions in the protein sequence mutations improving the aggregation propensity of the sequence do so at a major cost for thermodynamic stability (values of 5 kcal mol1are unlikely to occur in an experimental setting and result from strong Van der Waals clash penalties in FoldX).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, some density can be observed in the region of the plot corresponding to a strong reduction of intrinsic aggregation at a low cost to thermodynamic stability ( less_than 1 kcal mol1), suggesting that additional gatekeepers at selected positions is structurally possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As is shown in Fig 2c, in about half the protein domains at least one such gatekeeper could be placed in silico, suggesting there is significant potential for protein improvement at specific sites within protein structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To validate these principles, we experimentally investigated the effect of introducing artificial gatekeeper mutations in two example proteins: the human protein -galactosidase and protective antigen (PA) from Bacillus anthracis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Rational design of aggregation-resistant -galactosidase', 'Human -galactosidase (-Gal) is a lysosomal hydrolase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -Gal deficiency results in Fabry disease (FD) (OMIM 301500), a metabolic X-linked inherited lysosomal storage disorder25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -Galactosidase enzyme replacement therapy is currently used to treat FD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure of -galactosidase consists of a homodimer, in which each monomer contains a (/) domain (Fig 3a, central part, yellow and green parts) harbouring the active site and an antiparallel -domain (Fig 3a, orange and blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The APRs of -Gal (indicated with 1, 2 and 3 and coloured in red in Fig 3b, upper left), cluster in the -domain and the interface between the domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From visual inspection of the structure, region 3 in particular is likely to be at risk of nucleating aggregation, given its edge position in the -sheet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of the computational gatekeeper scan of each of the APRs of -Gal are shown as a MASS-plot (mutant aggregation and stability spectrum), that is, a scatter plot (Fig 3c) of the change in thermodynamic stability (G values calculated by FoldX in kcal mol1) versus change in the intrinsic aggregation propensity (values calculated by TANGO, range between 0 and 100 per amino acid residue) associated to each APR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These plots allow to easily identify ideal mutations with large negative values on both axes, that is, mutations that reduce the intrinsic aggregation propensity while not decreasing the thermodynamic stability of an APR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confirming our bioinformatics analysis above, designable positions in -Gal exist but are sparse and context-dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, for APR1, no improving mutations could be identified, owing mainly to its complete burial inside the tightly packed domain interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  APRs 2 and 3 display one favourable mutation each (A348R and A368P, respectively), with an additional mutation in APR3 (A368R) stabilizing the region without lowering intrinsic aggregation (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Structure and aggregation propensity of

stabilize the -domain of the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though these do not reduce APRs, the additional thermodynamic stability will minimize the detrimental effect of introducing artificial gatekeepers at other sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An exhaustive in silico mutation scan throughout the -domain yielded a set of mutations increasing thermodynamic stability (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most stabilizing mutation (S405L, GFoldX=3.34 kcal mol1) tightens the interaction of the edge -strand (the site of APR3) with the rest of the domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We experimentally verified the effect of all mutations, comparing them with WT -Gal and D165V and A288D, FD mutants previously found to be particularly aggregation prone27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutants were transiently overexpressed in HeLa cells and -Gal solubility was measured in lysates by western blotting of size exclusion chromatography (SEC) elution fractions (material and methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT protein elutes mainly as a dimer but also shows faint bands in the SEC fractions eluting at volumes corresponding to large molecular sizes (Fig 4a) (exclusion limit of this column is 600 kDa), consistent with partial misfolding and aggregation of WT -Gal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the disease associated mutations D165V and A288D display significant increase of these high molecular weight fractions at the expense of the dimer fraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The individual mutations selected to reduce aggregation show a modest decrease in the high molecular weight fractions when compared with WT -Gal, that is most pronounced for the A348R mutant (Fig 4a and Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of the solubility confirmed that while aggregating mutants (D165V and A288D) were highly insoluble ( less_than 10% of total protein), our single-point mutants reached 8090% solubility compared with 70% for WT (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also determined the enzymatic activity of lysates of HEK293 cells transiently expressing -Gal by following the conversion of the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl--D-galactopyranoside (4-MU--Gal) over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-point mutants showed similar enzymatic activity in comparison to WT (Fig 4c), suggesting these mutations did not affect the active site of the enzyme and did not interfere with its enzymatic function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the effects of the single mutants are rather modest but show a decrease of aggregation and an improved solubility while leaving enzymatic activity unharmed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that the observed improvements are overall modest is explained by the fact that -Gal possesses three APRs: improving one by a single mutation leaves it susceptible to aggregation by the other regions.

improvements are possible for all three APRs, we focused on APR1 (Fig 6a,b, N573IYTVLD579).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MASS plot identified position Thr576 as a suitable design hot spot, allowing for mutation to Glu, Lys and Arg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT and three mutant proteins were recombinantly expressed in E. coli and purified (see methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hydrodynamic radius of the proteins was measured using dynamic light scattering (DLS) before and after heat stress (Fig 7a), revealing a clear increase in the size of WT, consistent with aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutants showed a mild (T576R) to strong (T576E and T576K) resistance to size increase upon heat stress suggesting lower aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To corroborate this observation we analysed the T576E mutation in more detail by synthesizing the corresponding WT and mutant APR1 (NATNIYTVLDKIK and NATNIYEVLDKIK) as peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of secondary structure of these peptides by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (Fig 7b) reveals the WT peptide displays an amide I band near 1,620 cm1, consistent with aggregation, while the mutant peptide displays a markedly different spectrum with a peak near 1,680 cm1 consistent with a -turn structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional in silico mutation screen using FoldX revealed the stability of the T576E mutant could be improved by 1.2 kcal mol1 by a compensatory mutation S559L.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding double mutant protein was purified and subjected to heat stress followed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (Fig 7c), revealing a clearly increased heat resistance compared with the WT and a clear improvement over the single mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Far and near UV circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD) (Fig 7d) and near UV confirmed conservation of the structure between T576E/S559L and WT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differential Scanning Calorimetry (Fig 7e) of WT and T576E/S559L revealed only a slight increase in melting temperature Tm of the T576E/S559L mutant (47.8±0.13 °C) compared with the WT (46.4±0.13 °C) by 1.4 °C (t-test P=0.002), but the narrower transition for the mutant is consistent with a more cooperative unfolding transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moveover, whereas WT shows characteristic signals of aggregation in the plot from 50 °C upwards, the T576E/S559L mutant starts aggregating only at a higher temperature, suggesting we have removed the APR responsible for aggregation during storage at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further corroborate this observation, we performed a temperature ramped assay, in which we simultaneously measured changes in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (ITF) and right-angle light scattering (RALS)34,35, allowing the combined monitoring of unfolding (Tm, Supplementary Fig 5A) and aggregation (Tagg, Supplementary Fig 5B) temperatures in function of a temperature gradient of 0.3 °C min1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Tm values obtained by this method are similar to those observed by DSC (46.76±0.24 °C and 47.23±0.09 °C for WT and T576E/S559L mutant, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The aggregation onset temperatures differ by 2.4 °C from 47.42±0.01 °C for WT to 49.86±0.01 °C for the T576E/S559L mutant, again in good agreement with the DSC data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plotting aggregation versus degree of unfolding, it appears the aggregation onset for WT occurs at 53% of the unfolding transition, whereas for the mutant aggregation only initiates at 84% of the unfolding transition (Supplementary Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with our design, in which we reduced the aggregation propensity of the strongest and most exposed APR by the T576E mutation, delaying aggregation until more advanced denaturation when the remaining APRs eventually become solvent exposed and initiate aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also performed similar combined ITF and RALS measurements under isothermal conditions at 40 °C, where both WT and mutant are still on the native baseline in the temperature ramp experiment but close to the unfolding transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the first 2 h of this experiment, both mutant and wild type equilibrated to a partially denatured conformation at 38% of the unfolding transtion (Supplementary Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected for an aggregation reaction, we observed a lag phase during which the light scattering remains near the baseline, followed by a rapid increase of scattering intensity (Fig 7f and Supplementary Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During this experiment the aggregation of WT initiates between 2 h, whereas the T576E/S559L mutant shows only marginal aggregation over 10 h, demonstrating an increased stress resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Structure and

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Protein aggregation is one of the main limiting factors for the use of proteins at concentrations far above those for which evolutionary selection has shaped them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the global correlation between cellular abundance and protein solubility strongly suggests proteins are operating near their solubility limit7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It follows that use of a protein at higher-than-native concentrations requires adaptation of its primary sequence, but it is not immediately apparent how much scope for improvement natural sequences harbour and how many mutations are required for notable improvements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the fact that protein abundances are more conserved than mRNA levels could point towards a solubility deadlock for many protein sequences36, potentially restricting the scope for artificial protein improvement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On the other hand, we now understand the basic mechanisms of aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, several reports were made of mutationally reducing protein aggregation through either rational design or directed evolution37,38,39,40,41,42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most successful of these mutations involve the introduction of charged residues, which could be due to the increase of the colloidal stability by augmenting the net charge of the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, these residues are also reminiscent of aggregation gatekeepers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This class of residues was discovered some time ago to flank nearly all naturally occurring APRs44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These gatekeepers are usually charged amino acids and Pro, although some reports also include His and Gly45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gatekeepers kinetically control aggregation sufficiently to favour folding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their placement at the flanks of APRs results from the fact that APRs are usually part of an element of secondary structure in the hydrophobic core of the protein, where charged or structure breaking residues cannot be accommodated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gatekeepers are therefore enriched at the first possible polypeptide position emerging from the hydrophobic core of the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our current analysis suggests these earlier analyses may have overlooked one of the most effective forms of aggregation gatekeepers, namely those where placement in the centre of an APR is possible, resulting in its complete suppression, thus rendering it invisible to prediction algorithms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We termed these residues suppressing gatekeepers and a survey of natural polypeptide sequences identified about 1 of these sGKs in every 100 amino acids on average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that sGK are more frequently mutated in disease-associated mutations than in polymorphisms, suggesting they have strong impact on protein solubility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, protein folding and structure put many restrictions on the mutations that can be introduced in a polypeptide, and functional sites provide yet another level of complexity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were therefore intrigued to find that at least in silico the potential for introducing additional suppressing gatekeeper residues is not exhausted in natural sequences, potentially providing a rational way to engineer more soluble protein sequences through reduced aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crux is finding the few sites where sGKs can be introduced without violating structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We followed this up for two examples: human -galactosidase and protective antigen from B. anthracis and found that we could reduce aggregation by exploring a very small number of mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, we found back charged amino acids, making it difficult to distinguish effects resulting from increased colloidal stability from those resulting from the elimination of an aggregation prone region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the importance of the latter has been demonstrated in a range of experiments, the effect of the artificial introduction of suppressing gatekeepers is probably an integration of both effects in a single mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Since for the two examples analysed here we managed to introduce residues reducing protein aggregation while conserving both protein structure and function one might wonder why these solutions have not been explored naturally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of course, the concentration at which these proteins naturally occur may be below their critical concentration for aggregation or they may benefit from chaperone interactions to such an extent that aggregation is not a feature on which selection has to act.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Still, it is interesting to note that of all the mutations in -Gal and rPA that we analysed here, only one (A368P) is a naturally accessible variation, considering single codon changes of the nucleotide sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would imply that even if these proteins would be under selective pressure to increase their solubility, at least this particular set of solutions is not immediately accessible.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
