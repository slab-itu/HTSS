The Lingula genome provides insights into brachiopod evolution and the origin of phosphate biomineralization  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Brachiopods are marine invertebrates with calcium phosphate or carbonate shells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Abundant in the fossil record, Darwin first referred to lingulid brachiopods as living fossils, because their shell morphology has changed little since the Silurian1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on molecular phylogeny, brachiopods comprise three subphyla, Linguliformea, Craniiformea and Rhynchonelliformea2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Linguliformea, including the extant genus, Lingula, is recognized as the most primitive group, with a fossil record dating back to the early Cambrian and coinciding with the innovation of animal biomineralization3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their shells are composed of calcium phosphate and collagen fibres, characters shared only by evolutionarily distant vertebrates1,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Morphologically, brachiopods and bivalves superficially resemble each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, lingulid brachiopods exhibit several unique features that distinguish them from molluscs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include hingeless shells that grow along the dorsalventral axis, chitinous chaetae, ciliated lophophores and a tail-like pedicle1,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the Permian extinction, bivalves have greatly increased their diversity, but the basic body plan of brachiopods has been constrained6, which is still a mystery of metazoan evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It has been proposed that Lingula might have used calcium phosphate, because the phosphorus concentration in seawater was high in the Cambrian7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, some Cambrian arthropods, tommottids and various other problematica also used calcium phosphate for their exoskeletons, whereas other extant invertebrates such as corals, molluscs and echinoderms use calcium carbonate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies of mollusc mantle transcriptomes and shell proteomes suggest that gene sets responsible for formation of calcium carbonate-based biominerals such as calcite or aragonite have evolved rapidly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, mineral homology among molluscs could simply represent parallel evolution8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to mollusc shells and other invertebrate calcified tissues, Lingula shells comprises calcium phosphate, laminated, flexible and rich in organic materials1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite their palaeontological importance, the evolutionary origin of Lingula shells is still unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'More interestingly, although Lingula is a protostome, its embryogenesis exhibits radial cleavage and enterocoelic coelom formation, typical of basal deuterostomes9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite such unique features, the phylogeny of brachiopods is under debate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before the 1980s, brachiopods were classified as deuterostomes, based on their mode of development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then they were grouped within protostomes following an analysis of 18S ribosomal RNAs10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This classification was further supported by an analysis of Hox genes in brachiopods and priapulids11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the phylogenetic position of brachiopods is still controversial, in spite of intensive palaeontological12 and molecular phylogenetic studies (Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, whether brachiopods are monophyletic or polyphyletic2,13 and whether Brachiopoda is close to Phoronida, Nemertea, Mollusca, Annelida or other lophotrochozoan phyla, remains to be resolved14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we present the first brachiopod genome of the lingulid, L. anatina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our whole-genome phylogenetic analyses support a close relationship between Lingula and molluscs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, we find that contrary to its reputation as a living fossil, the Lingula genome has been actively evolving, with a disorganized Hox cluster and recently expanded gene families.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we show that although Lingula shares shell formation-related genes and mechanisms with molluscs, such as chitin synthase (CHS) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling, it uses several domain combinations to produce lineage-specific shell matrix collagens, alanine-rich fibres and novel shell matrix proteins (SMPs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that gene family expansion, domain shuffling and co-option of genes appear to comprise the genomic basis of Lingulas unique biomineralization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with embryonic and adult tissue transcriptomes, as well as a shell proteome, our comparative genomic analyses provide insights into the evolutionary history of this lophotrochozoan and the origin of phosphate biomineralization.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Genome sequencing and assembly', 'We sequenced the 425-Mb genome of L. anatina (Fig 1ai) with 226-fold coverage using four next-generation sequencers (that is, Roche 454 GS FLX+, Illumina MiSeq and HiSeq 2500, and PacBio RS II).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effort yielded an assembly with a scaffold N50 size of 294 kb, comparable to those of other lophotrochozoan genomes17,18,19 (Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Figs 13 and Supplementary Tables 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Lingula genome exhibits comparatively high heterozygosity (1.6%) and a low level of repetitive sequences (22.2%) (Supplementary Table 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with a large quantity of transcriptome data from adult tissues and embryonic stages (Supplementary Fig 4 and Supplementary Table 4), we estimated that Lingula contains 34,105 protein-coding gene models, 91% of which are supported by transcriptomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean size of the Lingula genes is 6.7 kb with an average of 6.6 introns per gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These numbers are closer to those of the sea snail, Lottia gigantea, than to the leech, Helobdella robusta, or the polychaete, Capitella teleta17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A BLAST top-hits search against the NCBI non-redundant (nr) database shows that 28% of Lingula genes are most similar to mollusc genes, but only 12% to annelids, whereas 21% of the genes show no similarity to any known sequence, suggesting that these are unique to the brachiopod lineage (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A genome browser, genome and transcriptome assemblies, and related annotation files

position of brachiopods, we carried out phylogenetic analyses (Supplementary Note 2, Supplementary Figs 68 and Supplementary Table 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis based on 150 one-to-one orthologues with 46,845 amino-acid positions from 15 metazoan genomes supports the assertion that Lingula is closer to Mollusca than to Annelida (Fig 1j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparative analyses of lineage-specific domain losses among Lingula, molluscs and annelids also show that Lingula is closely related to molluscs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are nearly 20 annelid lineage-specific domain losses, which include chordin, haem-binding protein and Death-associated protein domains (Supplementary Fig 9 and Supplementary Table 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, microsyntenic analyses showed that Lingula and Lottia share conservation of a large number of microsyntenic blocks (Supplementary Fig 10 and Supplementary Tables 79), supporting the close phylogenetic relationship between brachiopods and molluscs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, intron structures also show similarities between Lingula and molluscs, but not annelids (Supplementary Fig 11 and Supplementary Table 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it may be concluded that Brachiopoda is closer to Mollusca than Annelida, although the phylogenetic relationships of Brachiopoda to Phoronida and Nemertea remain to be resolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The evolving Lingula genome', 'An abundance of Lingula fossils from the Silurian, with morphology very similar to that of extant species, inspired Darwin with the idea of living fossils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, shells of fossilized and living lingulids show considerable diversity in chemical structure20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, soft tissue fossils from the Chengjiang fauna reveal morphological changes among lingulid brachiopods22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those findings suggest that lingulid brachiopods have been rapidly evolving.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, protein-coding genes of the coelacanth, another living fossil, are reported to be evolving significantly more slowly than those of other tetrapods23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we found that Lingula genes associated with basic metabolism, such as ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis and RNA processing, show the slowest evolutionary rate among lophotrochozoans (Fig 1j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we also found a high degree of changes in the genomic structure and gene families (Supplementary Note 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Lingula genome contains a disorganized Hox cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is divided into two regions, and Lox2 and Lox4 are missing (Supplementary Fig 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of gene families shared by amphioxus Branchiostoma floridae24, Capitella and Lottia show that Lingula has 3,525 unique gene families (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further analyses show that the Lingula genome contains 7,263 gains and 8,441 losses of gene families.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The turnover rate of gene families in Lingula is the highest among bilaterians (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Evolution of the Lingula genome is revealed by comparative genomics of lophotrochozoan gene families.

evolution of Lingula gene families, we further examined the age distribution of duplicated paralogous genes by estimating their non-synonymous substitution rates (Ks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the youngest duplicated genes (Ks less_than 0.1), we found that Lingula genes duplicate at a rate approximately two to four times faster than those of other lophotrochozoans (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A large portion of these young duplicated genes are undergoing negative selection, suggesting a functional constraint on them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that genes related to extracellular matrix are experiencing positive selection (Supplementary Fig 13), indicating an adaptive need to acquire new functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the Lingula genome has a unique evolutionary history.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decoupling of molecular and morphological evolution has been also reported in the buthid scorpion, Mesobuthus martensii25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that the morphological constraint upon Lingula shells is not due to slow genetic changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these genomic features, Lingula contains genes for transcription factors (Supplementary Table 11) and signalling molecules (Supplementary Table 12) comparable to those of molluscs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Expansion of gene families and CHSs', 'We found lineage-specific expansions of protein domains (Supplementary Table 13) and gene families (Supplementary Table 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five of the 20 most expanded families have possible functions in shell formation, including 31 copies of CHS genes and 30 copies of carbohydrate sulfotransferase genes (Supplementary Fig 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chitin, a long-chain polymer of N-acetylglucosamine, is a characteristic component of arthropod exoskeletons and mollusc shells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular phylogeny shows that nine Lingula CHS genes are included in the lophotrochozoan clade (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we found that CHS genes of lophotrochozoans contain a myosin head domain (MHD) (Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been proposed that an MHD might have fused to the CHS genes during evolution of lophotrochozoans26, the only group in which these occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that there is a greater expansion of MHD-containing CHS genes in molluscs than in Lingula or annelids (Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In molluscs, an MHD-containing CHS gene is expressed specifically in cells that are in close contact with the larval shell27 and that are probably involved in shell formation28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its high expression level during larval shell formation and in adult mantle further suggests a role in mollusc shell formation19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Expansion and expression of Lingula chitin

also play a role in Lingula shell formation (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, CHS genes are highly expressed in the gut and digestive caecum, indicating that a chitinous peritrophic matrix may also be present in the Lingula midgut (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expansion of CHS genes in the Lingula genome and their different expression profiles suggest that chitins participate in brachiopod biomineralization and digestion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Comparative genomics of biomineralization-related genes', 'Animals make hard tissues for protection, support and feeding, mostly in the form of calcified minerals containing carbonate or phosphate4,29 (Supplementary Note 4 and Supplementary Tables 1731).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the shells of Lingula and molluscs differ in composition, given that the mantle is the place of shell formation both in brachiopods and molluscs30, we first characterized the molecular nature of the Lingula mantle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that 2,724 genes are specifically expressed in mantle, including those for signal receptors, adhesion molecules and metabolic processes (Supplementary Fig 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the Lingula mantle is responsible for extracellular matrix secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we performed comparative transcriptome analyses between Lingula and the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas19 by calculating Spearmans () and Pearsons (r) coefficients (Supplementary Fig 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analyses show that the Lingula mantle is related to the Crassostrea mantle, indicating a functional similarity between these two organs (Fig 4a, MT versus Man; Supplementary Fig 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further found that the expression profiles of genes involved in ribosomal machinery are most similar, while those of genes related to chromosome and cell cycle regulation are diverse (Supplementary Fig 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes related to membrane trafficking are expressed in highly similar ways in Lingula and Crassostrea mantles, suggesting that the functional similarity comes mainly from genes involved in secretory machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is worth noting that the mantle similarity between Lingula and Crassostrea revealed by our comparative transcriptomics may be the result of sharing common secretory cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether these two organs share the same evolutionary origin requires more careful examination, although some genes associated with mollusc shell formation, such as calmodulin, calponin and mucin, are also highly expressed in the Lingula mantle (Supplementary Table 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Comparative transcriptomics and genomics reveal different origins of biomineralization-related genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Spearmans

biomineralization, we conducted comparative genomics and hierarchical cluster analyses, to examine biomineralization-associated genes among vertebrates31, molluscs19 and Lingula.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that Lingula and vertebrates share the use of calcium phosphate, we first examined 175 genes associated with bone formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the number of Lingula homologues to vertebrate bone formation genes is similar to those in other marine invertebrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is no specific similarity between Lingula and humans (Fig 4b and Supplementary Table 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The innovation of the acidic, secretory, calcium-binding phosphoprotein gene family is essential for vertebrate bone formation31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we failed to find orthologues of secretory, calcium-binding phosphoprotein genes in the Lingula genome, although it contains an orthologue of the secreted protein, acidic, cysteine-rich gene (Supplementary Fig 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These analyses show that many of the genes involved in bone formation are derived from genome duplication events in the vertebrate lineage31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcriptome analysis of Lingula genes that are associated with bone formation in vertebrates shows that most of these genes are expressed ubiquitously during embryogenesis and in adult tissues, suggesting that they have multiple roles, not limited to biomineralization (Supplementary Tables 21 and 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On the other hand, a comparison of 90 genes that are associated with shell formation in molluscs indicates that most of them are shared by bilaterians, whereas mollusc shells contain several lineage-specific proteins (Supplementary Fig 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, transcriptome analysis of Lingula adult tissues shows that expression of the shared genes is not limited to the mantle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that many mollusc shell formation genes have been co-opted independently in mollusc lineages, while they carry out different functions in other bilaterians (Supplementary Table 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, genes shared between Lingula and molluscs, such as calcium-dependent protein kinase and CHS, exhibit high expression in larvae and mantle, indicating that they may also be involved in Lingula shell formation (Supplementary Table 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Conserved molecular mechanisms in biomineralization', 'Given that genes associated with biomineralization have diverse functions and have been co-opted in different species, we next tested whether there is a conserved upstream mechanism for this process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focused on one of the ancient metazoan signalling pathways, BMPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have demonstrated that BMP signalling plays key roles in biomineralization in both molluscs32 and vertebrates33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore the possible role of BMP signalling during embryogenesis, we first annotated BMP ligands and receptor-regulated Smad.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lingula has orthologues for one Bmp2/4, one Bmp5-8 and one Smad/1/5/9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our embryonic transcriptome showed that Bmp5-8 and Smad1/5/9 are expressed maternally, whereas Bmp2/4 is expressed after the early blastula stage (Supplementary Fig 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To visualize activation sites of BMP signals, we employed immunostaining of nuclear phosphorylated Smad1/5/9, an activated mediator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Lingula, embryonic shells are formed on mantle lobes beginning at the one-pair cirri larval stage12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we discovered that BMP signalling is activated at the anterior margin of the mantle lobe during Lingula larval shell formation (Fig 5 and Supplementary Fig 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that there may be a conserved mechanism for initiating biomineralization in brachiopods and molluscs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further functional analyses will provide more rigorous testing of this hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: BMP signalling may be involved in larval shell formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ah) Confocal images of Lingula larvae from one-pair cirri

(Supplementary Figs 22 and 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These SMP genes are highly expressed in the mantle (Supplementary Fig 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using comparative genomics, we showed that the composition of Lingula SMPs share the highest similarities with those of amphioxus and molluscs (Supplementary Fig 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through an examination of amino acid composition, one of the main characteristics of Lingula shells compared with other articulate brachiopods or molluscs is that their SMPs contain a large amount of glycine and alanine1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provided here the first molecular evidence that glycine-rich SMPs are collagens (Supplementary Table 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we also found that many novel SMPs are alanine-rich and have low molecular weights (that is, amino-acid length 100200) (Supplementary Fig 23 and Supplementary Table 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pfam analysis of Lingula SMPs shows that the most abundant domains are cadherin and collagen, whereas the most abundant proteins contain von Willebrand factor type A and epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains (Supplementary Fig 23 and Supplementary Table 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The domain composition suggests that the shell matrix is derived from the extracellular matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further examined the expression profile of these SMPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that 26 SMPs are expressed ubiquitously in all adult tissues, indicating that they have functions other than shell formation (Supplementary Fig 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, 20 SMPs exhibited specific expression in the mantle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include collagen, chitinase, glutathione peroxidase, hephaestin, hemicentin and peroxidasin (Supplementary Fig 24 and Supplementary Table 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of these genes function as extracellular enzymes and ion-binding sites in humans, suggesting that they are probably co-opted in Lingula for shell formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it has been reported that secreted acidic proteins play an important role during the calcification process in mollusc shells30 and coral skeletons34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We failed to find secreted acidic proteins among Lingula SMPs (Supplementary Tables 25 and 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we found that there are novel alanine-rich SMPs with a three-helix bundle structure that may confer elastic properties on

proteomic analyses failed to detect fibrillar collagens with COLFI domains in Lingula SMPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, further domain combination analyses show that Lingula shell-associated collagens fall into a new group with an EGF domain, which is different from collagens of vertebrate bone (Fig 6a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, some fibrillar collagens probably originated by tandem

have been adapted among brachiopods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only the Linguliformea makes shells with calcium phosphate1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have shown that Lingula used its own gene set for calcium phosphate biominerals, which is different from those used by vertebrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that mineralized vertebrate bone first appeared (450 MYA, late Ordovician)31 much later than lingulid shells (520 MYA, early Cambrian)22, it is perhaps not surprising that vertebrate bone and Lingula shell have different genetic origins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although downstream biomineralization-related genes are diverse, we speculate that the metazoan ancestor might use a core set of ancient signalling proteins, such as BMPs and their downstream mediators, to initiate the biomineralization process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found many calcium-binding and extracellular matrix proteins in Lingula shell and mantle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those proteins have also been reported to participate in bone and shell formation (Supplementary Table 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that metazoan biomineralization probably originated from a calcium-regulated extracellular matrix system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we also discovered that Hox4, tyrosinase, CHS, perlucin, chitinase, peroxidasin, mucin and von Willebrand factor type A protein are common shell formation-associated components shared by Lingula and molluscs, suggesting that this fundamental gene set was used by their common ancestor (Supplementary Table 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are several Lingula SMPs encoding enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase, hephaestin and hemicentin, which have no reported function in shell or bone formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, interestingly, hephaestin and hemicentin are found in the coral skeletal organic matrix34,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that these extracellular ion-binding proteins in the biomineral matrix may either have been lost in vertebrate bone and mollusc shell, or that they arose independently in Lingula and corals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In light of the close phylogenetic relationship between Lingula and molluscs, we hypothesized evolutionary scenarios for the primitive mode of biomineralization in common ancestors of brachiopods and molluscs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparing chemical and molecular features, we present three possible primitive modes (that is, Ca-phosphate primitive, Ca-carbonate primitive and chitin scaffold hypotheses; Supplementary Fig 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given different chemistry and genetic components of their shells, we argue that the calcification process might be a derived feature in brachiopods and molluscs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, chitin localized in epithelial cells may be the primitive character, predating biomineralization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A chitinous scaffold may provide the organic framework for interactions between extracellular matrix and mineral ions28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, we propose a possible mechanism for Lingula shell formation (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the interaction of myosin head-containing CHSs and actin filaments may translate the cytoskeleton organization into an extracellular chitin scaffold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chitinase in the shell matrix then possibly remodels the chitin scaffold to facilitate the interaction of chitin and chitin-binding proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calcium-binding proteins probably regulate the calcium concentration in the shell matrix and initiate calcium phosphate deposition, together with other structural proteins, such as EGF domain-containing fibrillar collagens and alanine-rich proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: Genes related to biomineralization expressed during Lingula shell formation.A schematic illustration of

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have decoded the first brachiopod genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the Lingula genome has been evolving, instead of remaining static, as one would expect in a genuine living fossil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining transcriptomic and proteomic data, we also show that Lingula has a unique system for calcium phosphate-based biomineralization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps one of the mysteries in animal evolution is the use of calcium phosphate and fibrillar collagens in the formation of biominerals by the evolutionarily distant lingulid brachiopods and vertebrates1,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All data presented in this study indicate that Lingula and bony vertebrates have adapted different mechanisms for hard tissue formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vertebrates probably evolved calcium phosphate-based biomineralization independently, by duplication and neofunctionalization of related genes, while extensive expansion of mineralization-related gene families occurred in the Lingula genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Indeed, many examples of parallel evolution have been reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, studies on collagen evolution among vertebrates and basal chordates show that three different fibrillar collagen clades occurred independently, a co-option in which collagen was used for biomineral formation of chordates40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, studies of biomineralization genes in sea urchins and molluscs show that there are extensive differences in their expressed gene sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As molluscs, brachiopods, echinoderms and vertebrates contain different sets of biomineralization genes, biomineral proteins must have arisen independently among metazoans on several occasions8,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of Lingula biomineralization show similar patterns to those in molluscs8 and corals34, where co-option, domain shuffling and novel genes are the fundamental mechanisms for metazoan biomineralization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, although we present data, suggesting that Brachiopoda is closer to Mollusca than to Annelida, the phylogenetic position of brachiopods related to other lophotrochozoans remains to be elucidated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decoded Lingula genome provides information essential for such future studies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
