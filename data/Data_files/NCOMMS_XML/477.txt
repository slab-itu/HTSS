Coherence and multimode correlations from vacuum fluctuations in a microwave superconducting cavity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The existence of vacuum fluctuations is one of the most important predictions of modern quantum field theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the vacuum state, fluctuations occurring at different frequencies are uncorrelated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if a parameter in the Lagrangian of the field is modulated by an external pump, vacuum fluctuations stimulate spontaneous downconversion processes, creating squeezing between modes symmetric with respect to half of the frequency of the pump.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that by double parametric pumping of a superconducting microwave cavity, it is possible to generate another type of correlation, namely coherence between photons in separate frequency modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coherence correlations are tunable by the phases of the pumps and are established by a quantum fluctuation that stimulates the simultaneous creation of two photon pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis indicates that the origin of this vacuum-induced coherence is the absence of which-way information in the frequency space.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A direct consequence of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is that quantum fields, even in the vacuum state, are teeming with fluctuations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modern quantum field theory predicts that these fluctuations are not only a useful mathematical representation but also they can produce observable effects, encompassing vastly different physical scalesfrom atoms to black holes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these are the Purcell effect1, the Lamb shift of the atomic states2, the Schwinger effect3, the Hawking radiation4 and the Casimir effect5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recently, in parallel to the interest in fundamental physics6, a novel approach has emergedthe idea of engineering the quantum vacuum to create novel devices and protocols for quantum technologies7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parametrically modulated superconducting circuits have attracted significant interest8,9,10, motivated also by the demand for parametric amplifiers where the added noise is pushed to the quantum limit11,12,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these systems, it has been demonstrated that vacuum fluctuations present at the input port trigger the creation of real microwave photons16,17,18,19,20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of these experiments provide beautiful analogies with the motion of a mirror in free space20,21,23,24, also referred to as dynamical Casimir effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the development of quantum computing with continuous variables (CV) in microwave circuits25, these results demonstrate that a key operation is now available experimentally: two-mode squeezing26,27 of the modes a and b, leading to a non-zero correlation ab0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there exists another fundamental type of correlation between microwave fields, yielding ab0, which is instrumental in CV quantum computing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a measure of coherence of the fields in the two modes, and it appears ubiquitously in the modelling of beam-splitter and interference phenomena.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the perspective of quantum vacuum engineering, achieving this correlation is problematic: vacuum fluctuations at different times and frequencies are completely uncorrelated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is such a precise feature, that vacuum fluctuations can even serve as perfect random number generators28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even when the fluctuations trigger, the downconversion of a higher-energy photon into two photons in modes a and b, as in the case of a single-pump dynamical Casimir effect, the correlation ab remains zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we demonstrate that two-mode coherence correlations can be obtained from the dynamical Casimir effect by employing another fundamental quantum mechanical principle, namely the absence of which-way information29,30, which is applied here in the frequency space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we study the parametric modulation of the quantum vacuum under the action of two pumps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that a nonzero coherent correlation  is established between two frequency modes  and , through downconversion processes in the two pumps triggered by the same vacuum fluctuation in a third-frequency mode .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This correlation is non-zero provided that it is not possible to specify from which pump the downconverted photons at mode  originate from.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, due to this coherence effect, a highly populated bright mode and, orthogonal to it, a zero-population dark mode can be defined in the subspace of the two frequency modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dark states appear as a result of destructive quantum interference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically, in atomic physics, optics and more recently in superconducting microwave systems, dark states appear in Rabi-driven multilevel quantum systems31,32,33,34,35,36, or, in the case of resonators, through sideband driving37,38, both of which require Hamiltonians of the type ab+h.c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  to simply transfer population from one level to another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, here our Hamiltonian is of parametric type aa+h.c., which creates populations from the vacuum instead of transferring quanta between modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show that this parametric coherence effect is a phase-sensitive phenomenon and, therefore, it can be controlled by the relative phase of the applied pumps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our result opens a way for realizing highly complex multi-mode entangled states displaying both coherence and squeezing correlations with CV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In terms of the modes ,  and , the state we created is a CV tripartite state39,40 of bisymmetric type41,42, which at low powers, in the subspace with at most two photons, becomes a W-type state43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tripartite bisymmetric states are a resource for protocols such as one-to-two telecloning44,45, while W states can be used for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach can be generalized in a straightforward way to multiple modes and pumps, opening the way to the implementation of algorithms such as bosonic sampling48 and the realization of CV cluster states for one-way quantum computing49,50 in the microwave regime.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
