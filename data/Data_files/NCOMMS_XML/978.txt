Leukocyte integrin Mac-1 regulates thrombosis via interaction with platelet GPIb  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Inflammation and thrombosis occur together in many diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The leukocyte integrin Mac-1 (also known as integrin M2, or CD11b/CD18) is crucial for leukocyte recruitment to the endothelium, and Mac-1 engagement of platelet GPIb is required for injury responses in diverse disease models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the role of Mac-1 in thrombosis is undefined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that mice with Mac-1 deficiency (Mac-1/) or mutation of the Mac-1-binding site for GPIb have delayed thrombosis after carotid artery and cremaster microvascular injury without affecting parameters of haemostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adoptive wild-type leukocyte transfer rescues the thrombosis defect in Mac-1/ mice, and Mac-1-dependent regulation of the transcription factor Foxp1 contributes to thrombosis as evidenced by delayed thrombosis in mice with monocyte-/macrophage-specific overexpression of Foxp1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibody and small-molecule targeting of Mac-1:GPIb inhibits thrombosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data identify a new pathway of thrombosis involving leukocyte Mac-1 and platelet GPIb, and suggest that targeting this interaction has anti-thrombotic therapeutic potential with reduced bleeding risk.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Thrombotic cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction and stroke, are the leading cause of death in developed countries1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current anti-thrombotic drugs, including antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants, are associated with significant bleeding risk and increased mortality2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is emerging experimental evidence distinguishing the molecular and cellular mechanisms of haemostasis and thrombosis5,6, thereby providing potential therapeutic targets with reduced bleeding risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One such area of research focus is ligandreceptor interactions, including CD40L and its binding to platelet GPIIb/IIIa (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7), Gas6 and its tyrosine kinase receptors (mer, tyro3 and axl)8, ephrins and their eph kinase receptors9, and myeloid-related protein-8/14 (MRP-8/14 or S100A8/A9) and its platelet CD36 receptor10, that act within the plateletplatelet contact zone or synapse after the initial aggregation event and ultimately promote thrombus growth and stability11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A second area of research focus that distinguishes molecular and cellular mechanisms of haemostasis and thrombosis involves heterotypic cellcell interactions between leukocytes and platelets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plateletleukocyte interactions induce bidirectional signals that amplify pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic cellular responses12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more complete understanding of the molecular basis of leukocyteplatelet complex formation may provide key insight into candidate anti-thrombotic targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Adhesive interactions between vascular cells play important roles in orchestrating the inflammatory response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recruitment of circulating leukocytes to vascular endothelium requires multistep adhesive and signalling events, including selectin-mediated attachment and rolling, leukocyte activation, and integrin-mediated firm adhesion and diapedesis that result in the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the blood vessel wall13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Firm attachment is mediated by members of the 2-integrin family, LFA-1 (L2, CD11a/CD18), Mac-1 (M2, CD11b/CD18) and p150,95 (x2, CD11c/CD18), and CD11d/CD18 (D2), which bind to endothelial counter ligands (for example, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; ICAM-1), endothelial-associated extracellular matrix proteins (for example, fibrinogen) or glycosaminoglycans14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Leukocyte recruitment and infiltration also occur at sites of vascular injury where the lining endothelial cells have been denuded, and platelets and fibrin have been deposited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar sequential adhesion model of leukocyte attachment to and transmigration across surface-adherent platelets has been proposed16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial tethering and rolling of leukocytes on platelet P-selectin17 are followed by their firm adhesion and transplatelet migration, processes that are dependent on M2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Integrins are heterodimeric proteins composed of one - and one -subunit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A subset of integrin -subunits, including M, contains an inserted domain (I-domain) of 200 amino acids that is implicated in ligand binding18 and is strikingly similar to the A domains of von Willebrand factor (vWF)19, one of which, A1, mediates the interaction of vWF with its platelet receptor, the glycoprotein (GP) IbIXV complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the similarity of the vWF A1 domain and the MI-domain, we hypothesized that GPIb might also be able to bind M2 and reported that GPIb is indeed a constitutively expressed counterreceptor for M2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The MI-domain contributes broadly to the recognition of ligands by M2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18) and specifically to the binding of GPIb (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This region has also been implicated in the binding of many ligands, including ICAM-1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21), C3bi (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22) and fibrinogen21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We localized the binding site for GPIb within the MI-domain segment M(P201K217) using a strategy based on the differences in the binding of GPIb to the MI- and LI-domains that involved several independent approaches, including screening of mutant cells, synthetic peptides, site-directed mutagenesis and gain-in-function analyses23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibody targeting of M(P201K217) blocked M2-dependent adhesion to GPIb, but not several other ligands and inhibited leukocyte accumulation, cellular proliferation and neointimal thickening after arterial injury24, and broadly regulated the biological response to tissue injury in models of vasculitis25, glomerulonephritis26 and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Since leukocyteplatelet interactions bidirectionally induce signals that amplify pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic cellular responses12, we hypothesized that leukocyte Mac-1 engagement of platelet GPIb is critical for thrombus formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study utilizing genetic, antibody, and small-molecule approaches, we provide evidence that Mac-1:GPIb directly modulates thrombosis without influence on tail bleeding time or other haemostatic parameters.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

proteolysis, phagocytosis, oxidative burst and signalling14,37,38,39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elegant structural studies by several groups have begun to elucidate the molecular basis for such broad ligand recognition by Mac-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A subset of integrin -subunits, including M of Mac-1, contains an inserted domain (I-domain) of 200 amino acids that is implicated in ligand binding.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this study, we have identified a new pathway of thrombosis involving leukocyte Mac-1 and platelet GPIb, and interfering with this pathway does not affect parameters of haemostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conclusion is supported by the following data: (1) mice with deficiency of Mac-1 (Mac-1/) or mutation of the Mac-1-binding site for GPIb (muMac-1) have delayed thrombus formation after injury to large and small arteries; (2) platelet count, platelet activation, plasma coagulation activity and bleeding time were similar in WT and Mac-1/ mice; (3) adoptive leukocyte transfer rescued defective thrombus formation in Mac-1/ mice; (4) Mac-1-GPIb induces outside-in Mac-1 signalling (that is, phosphorylation of PKC and downregulation of Foxp1), and Mac-1-dependent regulation of the transcription factor Foxp1, which regulates TF expression, contributed to the thrombosis defect as evidenced by prolonged thrombotic occlusion time in macFoxp1tg mice; and (5) antibody and small-molecule targeting of Mac-1:GPIb inhibited thrombus formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Plateletleukocyte interactions bidirectionally induce signals that amplify pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic cellular responses12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the key implications of our findings is the central importance of leukocyte Mac-1 and platelet GPIb for leukocyteplatelet interactions in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other reported interactions contributing to Mac-1-independent leukocyteplatelet conjugate formation include thrombospondins bridging between GP IV receptors on platelets and monocytes53, and P-selectin on activated platelets binding with leukocyte P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (refs 54, 55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, stable accumulation of leukocytes to adherent platelets ex vivo under experimental conditions of arterial shear or to the endothelialdenuded vessel lined with platelets in vivo, requires leukocyte Mac-1 and platelet GPIb (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other potential Mac-1 ligands present on the platelet membrane include fibrinogen (bound to IIb3)56,57, ICAM-2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  58) and JAM-3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a leukocyteplatelet interaction mediated by fibrinogen bridging between Mac-1 and IIb3 has been largely discounted by Ostrovsky et al.59 who found that neither RGDS peptides nor the replacement of normal platelets with thrombasthenic platelets (that is, lacking IIb3) affected the accumulation of the leukocytes on platelets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Mac-1 binds ICAM-1, this receptor is not found on platelets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Platelets express a related receptor, ICAM-2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  58), but Diacovo et al.16 have shown that ICAM-2 blockade has no effect on the firm adhesion of neutrophils on monolayers of activated platelets under flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Santoso et al.50 have reported that Mac-1 may also bind to platelet JAM-3, cooperating with GPIb to mediate neutrophilplatelet adhesive contacts in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we have reported previously that anti-M2, which is capable of blocking platelet-dependent leukocyte recruitment both ex vivo and in vivo, had minimal inhibitory effect on Mac-1-dependent adhesion to JAM-3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Genetic (muMac-1 mice) and antibody approaches were utilized to investigate the importance of Mac-1 binding to GPIb, but not to other Mac-1 ligands in thrombosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative specificity of anti-M2 inhibitory action towards GPIb (that is, non-inhibitory towards ICAM-1, fibrinogen, JAM-3 and C3bi) suggests a minor contribution of other ligands for Mac-1 in the context of thrombosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous work from our laboratories has demonstrated that leukocyte engagement of platelet GPIb via Mac-1 induces platelet outside-in signalling and platelet activation31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We now provide new evidence that engagement of platelet GPIb via Mac-1 induces outside-in Mac-1 signalling that leads to phosphorylation of PKC delta and downregulation of Foxp1 in monocytic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, blockade of the initial cellcell conjugation mediated by Mac-1:GPIb may prevent bidirectional signalling that amplify thrombus formation, and account for the effectiveness of Mac-1:GPIb inhibition in reducing thrombus formation in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Having established that adoptive transfer of WT neutrophils or PBMCs partially corrects the thrombosis defect in Mac-1/ mice, one needs to consider the possibility that there may be distinct mechanisms driving neutrophil versus mononuclear leukocytes in thrombus formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While TF may be important in mononuclear cell-dependent thrombosis, it is controversial whether neutrophils express TF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neutrophils are known to regulate thrombosis through the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which stimulate thrombus formation and coagulation and are abundant in thrombi in animal models of deep vein thrombosis60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecular basis of NET generation (known as NETosis) is a complex process requiring reactive oxygen species production61 and neutrophil proteases (that is, neutrophil elastase, myeloperoxidase and peptidylargine deiminase-4)62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Highly relevant to the present study, Neeli et al.63 have provided evidence that the Mac-1 itself may be involved in the initiation of changes in the neutrophil cytoskeleton that facilitate the breakdown of nuclear and plasma membranes for the releases of NETs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The present observations suggest a possible target for therapeutic intervention in cardiovascular and thrombotic diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the specificity of antibody or small-molecule inhibitory action towards Mac-1:GPIb suggests that it might be possible to inhibit pro-thrombotic leukocyteplatelet interactions without affecting other Mac-1 functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study identifies glucosamine as one such small-molecule antagonist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The failure of other molecules of similar size and composition to glucosamine to block MI-domain:GPIb interaction augers well for the possibility of detailed structureactivity analyses to identify more potent small-molecule antagonists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our modelling study (Fig 9) suggests that several closely related binding modes would allow glucosamine to bind in close proximity to T213/R216 and interfere with GPIb binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultimately, solving the crystal structure of glucosamine or other small molecules identified in our screen or of an anti-M2 bound to the MI-domain may lead to a new class of anti-thrombotic therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a more fundamental level, the results of this study suggest that thrombosis and haemorrhage may be uncoupled at the level of the Mac-1:GPIb interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the specificity of antibody or small-molecule inhibitory action towards Mac-1:GPIb suggests that it might be possible to inhibit pro-thrombotic leukocyteplatelet interactions without affecting other Mac-1 functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deficiency of Mac-1 did not interfere with tail bleeding time, platelet activation and plasma coagulation activity (that is, aPTT and thrombin generation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identification of a new platelet-dependent pathway of thrombosis that does not affect haemostatic parameters, such as bleeding time and platelet adhesion and spreading, has possible clinical implications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thrombotic cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction and stroke, are the leading cause of death in developed countries1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total US healthcare expenditures in 2009 for coronary heart disease and stroke were a staggering $165.4 billion and $68.9 billion, respectively1 with pharmacologic therapies estimated to exceed $20 billion worldwide1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants are used in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome and in primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease and stroke64,65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current drugs are subject to significant bleeding risk, which is associated with increased mortality2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While new antiplatelet (for example, prasugrel, ticagrelor and vorapaxar) and anticoagulant (for example, apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban) agents have been approved on the basis of superior efficacy or other clinical advantages (for example, fixed dosing without the need for monitoring), these therapeutic advances are associated with a 2530% increase in the rate of bleeding or transfusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is emerging experimental evidence distinguishing the molecular and cellular mechanisms of haemostasis and thrombosis5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interaction between leukocyte Mac-1 and platelet GPIb is now positioned as a novel and targetable mediator of thrombosis, but not haemostasis (that is, reduced bleeding risk).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
