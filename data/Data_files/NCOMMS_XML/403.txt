In vivo imaging of clock gene expression in multiple tissues of freely moving mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Clock genes are expressed throughout the body, although how they oscillate in unrestrained animals is not known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show an in vivo imaging technique that enables long-term simultaneous imaging of multiple tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use dual-focal 3D tracking and signal-intensity calibration to follow gene expression in a target area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measure circadian rhythms of clock genes in the olfactory bulb, right and left ears and cortices, and the skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the kinetic relationship between gene expression and physiological responses to experimental cues is monitored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under stable conditions gene expression is in phase in all tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In response to a long-duration light pulse, the olfactory bulb shifts faster than other tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Cry1/ Cry2/ arrhythmic mice circadian oscillation is absent in all tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our system successfully tracks circadian rhythms in clock genes in multiple tissues in unrestrained mice.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Circadian rhythms in physiology and behaviour in mammals are regulated by a master clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clock genes have critical roles in expressing cellular circadian rhythms, primarily based on a cell autonomous molecular feedback loop1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clock gene expression is not limited to the SCN, with expression observed in a variety of tissues1,2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the expression pattern of clock genes outside the SCN is not well understood, partly owing to a lack of techniques for simultaneous monitoring of circadian clock gene rhythms in specific tissues, and to detect output functions in the absence of physical restraints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The bioluminescent reporter enzyme firefly luciferase (luc) and its substrate D-luciferin (luciferin) have been used to generate optical imaging signals with high sensitivity in living animals6, and have been adapted successfully to whole-body imaging of clock genes in anaesthetized mice using a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, anaesthesia is reported to alter the clock gene expression9,10,11,12,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Saini et al.16 measured the rhythmic bmal1 expression only in the liver of a freely moving mouse with a CCD camera located outside the body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Monitoring of clock gene expression in vivo has also been attempted using a bioluminescent reporter, either with an optical fibre in the SCN17, or using a photon detector located outside the body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the latter case, bioluminescence emitted from tissue-specific reporters was collected efficiently using a conical wall that channels photons toward a photomultiplier tube (PMT), and the emitting tissue was identified using a tissue-specific reporter16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although promising, these approaches have limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, monitoring clock gene expression using an implanted optical fibre only enables focusing on the target area in a limited space, and insertion of an optical fibre may damage the area surrounding the target18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of bioluminescent detection using a PMT external to the body, tissue-specific bioluminescence may need to be quantified if the target is relatively large and is located in deep areas inside the body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, three-dimensional (3D)-calibration of signal strength is necessary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we show a method to quantitatively monitor clock gene expression simultaneously in multiple regions of freely moving mice over long durations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The challenge was to calibrate the bioluminescence intensity in moving targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome the technical challenge of intensity changes with time-of-day and distance from the recording apparatus, we developed a dual-focal 3D tracing (DuFT) technology and a signal-intensity calibration technique (SICT) and combined these two systems into a software application for analysing gene expression, which we call Mouse Tracker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These techniques enable us to monitor the circadian rhythm of clock gene expression concurrently in multiple tissues with unrestrained mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results indicate that the olfactory bulb (OB) shifts faster than other tissues (right and left ears and cortices, and skin) in response to a long-duration light pulse.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The in vivo imaging system used in this study consists of two novel techniques, DuFT and SICT (Fig 1a,b and Supplementary Fig 1ag).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bioluminescent signals representing Per1 expression were produced following intraperitoneal administration of luciferin through an application system (Fig 1b and Supplementary Fig 1d,e) into freely moving Per1-luc mice (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following sections describe the principles and detailed methods of each technology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: In vivo imaging system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Inside the EM-CCD camera box (A) and imaging box (B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The upper photo shows two high-sensitive EM-CCD cameras (ccd) with an angle adjuster (ad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lower photo shows two fluorescent lights and the recording stage (rs) in the ventilated imaging box.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) DuFT recording system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recording cage (rc) on the recording stage, two LED lights and luciferin application system (la) are shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Per1-luc mouse with scintillators attached to the head and skin exposed to the LED light in freely moving condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluorescence signal from the scintillators and bioluminescent signals from the target area are acquired by EM-CCD cameras in the raw data (upper) and pseudo-colour data (lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The arrowhead shows three scintillators around the skin target and those around the OB targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dotted line shows the shape of the mouse body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Luciferin (40 mg ml1) was supplied by an iPRECIO pump (15 l h1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were captured at 0.5 s per frame.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Determination of the 3D coordinates of a scintillator {S (Sx, Sy, Sz)} in the recording cage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 3D transformation matrix from the 2D coordinates (x-axis limitation; 0 less_than x less_than 512, y-axis limitation; 0 less_than y less_than 512) on a pair of images {left; L (Lx, Ly) and right; R (Rx, Ry)} was used to make a straight line passing through points L and S or R and S. The 3D coordinates of the scintillator {S (Sx, Sy, Sz)} are calculated by intersecting these two lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) In vivo imaging system overview.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are saved in the computer at each 0.5 or 1 h.

numbered by descending pattern-matching score.Full size image', 'DuFT for detecting the 3D positions of scintillators', 'To serve as position markers, scintillators attached to the skin of the back (hereafter referred as skin) and the head were used to detect the regions of interest (ROIs), namely OB, ears and cerebral cortices (hereafter referred as cortex; Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To detect the 3D positions of a scintillator in freely moving animals in the recording cage (Supplementary Fig 1f), we developed tracking software based on stereo photography19,20,21 and pattern-matching22 principles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two cameras captured a pair of images (left; L (Lx, Ly) and right R (Rx, Ry)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the 2D coordinates of the scintillators in each cameras image, two straight lines passing through a scintillator were calculated using transformation matrices (Ml and Mr; Fig 1d) (see the Methods section for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 3D coordinates of the scintillator (S (Sx, Sy, Sz)) were determined by calculating the intersection of these two lines (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In situations when the signal of the scintillator is lost due to the angle of the two EM-CCD cameras, the signal can be reacquired automatically when the mouse moves into a more appropriate position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intensity of the LED-light-induced fluorescent signals (Supplementary Fig 2ac) from the scintillators was set (Supplementary Fig 1g) to be roughly equivalent to the bioluminescent signals from the skin of the freely moving mice (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Signal-intensity calibration technique', 'We developed a number of algorithms to locate the scintillators using a model image for pattern matching to identify the associated ROIs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the skin, scintillators were attached on a patch of shaved skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ROI was assumed to be at the centre of the baseline of the triangle formed by the three scintillators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OB ROI was assumed to be at the centroid of the triangle formed by the three scintillators (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the head, an image of one of the three scintillators placed on the head was used as a model for pattern matching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify left and right ears/cortices (Supplementary Fig 3), we further developed a method using a model head image for pattern matching (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adding the model head image for pattern matching resulted in decreased mismatching of the scintillator image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selection of the model head image for pattern matching (model image in Supplementary Fig 4 is for OB and model image in Fig 2b is for OB, left ear, right ear, left cortex, right cortex) is based on the number of target areas to be measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Determination of ROI positions in six areas of freely moving mice.First, the frames with OB, skin, ear, cortex and three scintillators on each image are

details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3D coordinates of ROIs are illustrated in the skin and head of the mouse.Full size image', 'The intensity of the bioluminescent signal varies with the position of the animal within the recording cage due to variations in distance from the camera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To calibrate the bioluminescent signal obtained from individual ROIs, we calibrated signal intensity using the 3D coordinates of the target area on the mouse by referring to a calibration table (Supplementary Fig 5af; see the Methods section for details) which specifies the ratio of the calibration value at each point in the imaging space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The bioluminescence from the target area was calculated from the mean ROI pixel intensity (mean pixel value; shown with a yellow circle in Fig 1f)

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The present study describes a new technology that enables the simultaneous, continuous, real-time monitoring in 3D space of gene expression in multiple sites over a period of several days in freely moving animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, tracking techniques for small, unmarked animals using pattern-matching techniques with one camera have been used for behavioural analysis in 2 dimensions29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Applying pattern-matching techniques to 3D imaging in the present study enabled the successful identification and tracking of the focal point of the imaging space in the recording cage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tracking the position of markers on an animal in 3D enabled the identification of the direction of movement of the targets, and the simultaneous quantification of gene expression in multiple areas over a long duration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spatial resolution of the present system is 1.63 mm, meaning that two distinct spots  greater than 1.63 mm apart are discriminated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The influence of lights scattering from an adjacent target area or from each of the triangle spots is negligible, as demonstrated by a dark area clearly demarcating the two target points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The influence of scattered light has been examined31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The light intensity diminishes sharply with distance from an illuminating spot to background levels in several pixels (2030 m3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The observed bioluminescent intensity changes depend on the time-of-day, the position of the target in the 3D space of the observation chamber and the angle of the CCD camera relative to the ROI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DuFT method identifies the 3D position of a target based on the principles of stereo photography and the SICT algorithm calibrates the signal intensity in reference to a calibration table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These techniques enabled us to monitor the circadian rhythms of clock gene expression in multiple areas of an animals body and their responses to intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli in unconstrained mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bioluminescence of the Per1 reporter used in our system was sufficient for detection with an EM-CCD camera using only a 0.5-s exposure, confirming that it is possible to perform real-time analysis of the relationship between gene expression and behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, only the areas on or near the body surface were selected as targets to monitor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the future, utilization of strong tissue-specific reporters may enable the monitoring of multiple targets inside the body regardless of their location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previously, in vivo monitoring of clock gene expression in freely moving animals has been challenging16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The advantage of the present method over previous studies is threefold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First is the capability of quantifying the gene expression with 3D calibration, which was lacking in the previous studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second is the multi-region monitoring capability, enabling the analysis of relationships among tissues or cell-specific changes/responses in gene expression, as was done here (Figs 4b,c, 5b,c and 6b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third advantage is the capability to quantitatively monitor behaviour in 3D space, which enables the analysis of gene expression in correlation with specific behaviours, such as drinking and eating, with the gene expression in a particular location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the present in vivo monitoring system represents a novel analytical tool for examining the relation between circadian rhythms in clock gene expression and physiological outputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The primary limitation of the present system is the luciferin delivery system, which limits the recording duration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Luciferin delivery requires connecting animals to a delivery pump (iPRECIO) with a feed line or implanting an osmotic pump.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, to estimate the transcription rate from bioluminescent intensity, the intracellular luciferin concentration needs to be sufficient to support the luciferinluciferase reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We delivered luciferin at a rate that produced a constant plasma concentration  greater than 0.2 g l1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, further improvements in the substrate delivery systems would facilitate studies of this kind.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using the present system, we observed robust circadian rhythmicity in Per1 expression at six different areas on the body of freely moving mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The circadian rhythm was not an artefact, as the system confirmed aperiodism of clock gene expression in adult Cry1//Cry2/-Per1-luc mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, these six areas measured showed similar circadian peaks in Per1 expression at around CT 12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies using slice cultures in vitro reported Per1 gene expression rhythms that are different in different tissues32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discrepancy between the present study and the previous studies is not known, but points to the possibility of effects related to the slice preparations34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, circadian oscillations in the peripheral tissues are reported to be affected by low temperatures35,36, slices prepared under cold conditions may change the phase of circadian oscillations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With respect to the circadian phase, our results on the first few days in DD are indeed consistent with the Per1 mRNA expression rhythms in vivo under LD condition by in situ hybridization or by quantitative polymerase chain reaction studies23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As is well-known, in situ hybridization and quantitative polymerase chain reaction studies require an intermittent tissue sampling at intervals of hours, which limits time resolution and includes individual differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this respect, the present system, tracking a single animal continuously over time, is much more powerful than the classical methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition, we succeeded in visualizing the kinetics of differential phase-shifts of circadian rhythms in six different tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observation of a small secondary peak between the first and second day in five tissues suggests that a phase-delaying light pulse produced an internal transient desynchronization among the peripheral tissues, a phenomena that is commonly observed in jet-lag, shift-work-related disease, hypoinsulinemia and diabetes4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we anticipate that advances using remote tracking devices, detecting low-intensity signals, eliminating noise and making improvements in automated algorithms will be forthcoming and will be widely applied to many areas of biomedical research, as well as finding applications beyond medicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our technology is by no means limited to circadian-related disease and research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, any other applications will need to investigate the sensitivity and spatial resolution if the tissue environment or source depth differs from what has been used in the present work.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

determined by the user, by observing the circle displayed on the video.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our experiments, an ROI diameter of 9 pixels worked well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distances between the three scintillator points are computed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the ROI of the OB cannot be identified, the frame is discarded and no further calculations are performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To locate other ROIs, such as the left and right ears and cortices, we developed an alternative method using a model image of the mouse head for pattern matching (Fig 2b and Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A representative image of the mouse head is captured and stored in a file.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This image is used as a search model for pattern matching in all frames of the video with rotated versions of the model (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that rotation of the head model significantly increases search time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More than one model head image can be specified to increase the chance of successful matches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse ear ROIs (20 pixels) and cortex ROIs (8 pixels) are defined relative to the top-left corner of the model head image (Fig 2b), specified in the INI file.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the mouse model head image is found within a video frame, the OB can also be located by searching for the three small scintillators on the head within the region in which the model head image was found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This decreases the chance of mismatches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three instances of the model scintillators within the source target image are searched as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'If an ROI can be successfully located in both the left and right images, the 3D coordinates of the ROI can be computed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the 3D ROI coordinates indicate an unreasonable position (that is, outside the observation cage), due to pattern mismatching, then the frame is discarded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Otherwise, the pixel values within the ROI circle of specified diameter (OB 9 pixels; Skin12 pixels; ear 20 pixels; cortex 8 pixels) in the left and right images are averaged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 3D coordinates are used to calibrate the raw pixel averages with a pre-computed calibration table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Average calibrated bioluminescent intensity from the left and right images was saved in a .csv file.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'After analysis by Mouse Tracker, the data in the .csv file was analysed in a post-processing step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the size of the triangle exceeds thresholds (the triangle area with three points between minimum 100200 pixels and maximum 700900 pixels in the OB; minimum 500600 pixels and maximum 1,0001,200 pixels in the skin), the frame is discarded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distances between the three scintillator points is also checked.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining data was checked for the distance between the head and skin regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the distance exceeds a maximum threshold (default 80 mm), the frame is rejected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the frame is rejected if the distance is less than a threshold (default 20 mm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, gene expression in the ROI is quantified (mean pixel value) for each recording session (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although many frames are discarded with this method, a sufficient number of good frames were found to enable the recording of the rhythmic expression of target genes (Supplementary Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the frames in which the mouse was not moving much (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The major sources of error in estimation of 3D position are twofold; the error of positioning in the measurement box and the error of pattern matching for the marker (triangle shape).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of these errors, spatial resolution was calculated to be 1.63 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To calculate the 3D-positioning error, we assessed the 3D-positioning of the target area within the recording cage using the apparatus shown in Fig 1a and based on the 605 marker points shown in Supplementary Fig 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the 2D coordinates of the scintillators in each cameras image, two straight lines passing through a scintillator were calculated and the 3D coordinates of the scintillator were determined by calculating the intersection of these two lines (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most cases, the two lines will not intersect exactly due to small inaccuracies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated the error determining intersection points by the 3D transformation matrices with DuFT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Phase-shifting responses to light pulses', 'Per1-luc transgenic mice were maintained for at least 1 week after surgery in a LD cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recording of Per1-luc expression started after transferring to DD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were exposed to an 8-h light pulse at a specified CT (CT 12) on day 5 in DD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recording was discontinued during the 8-h light exposure and resumed thereafter (Supplementary Fig 10a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activity onset time was designated as CT 12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For long recording, we obtained images for 10 min, at 0.5 s per frame for Per1-luc within each 30 min interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Locomotor activity rhythm was monitored using an on-line PC (CLOCKLAB, Actimetrics) and spontaneous locomotor activity was recorded using an infrared sensor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Daily activity onset was visually estimated from standard double-plot actograms of locomotor activity behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phase-shift in locomotor activity rhythm in response to the 8-h light pulse was determined for several days preceding and following the day of the light pulse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A line was manually positioned through times of activity onset over several days (Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primary peak time of Per1-luc expression was determined as the time of highest intensity of Per1-luc expression around a continuous high-intensity area during each circadian cycle (Fig 6b and Supplementary Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Circadian rhythmicity analysis of Per1 expression in vivo', 'Circadian rhythmicity of quantified Per1 expression was analysed using the Cosinor program (Cosiner.exe, version 2.3; Circadian Rhythm Laboratory).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This program uses a least-squares regression method to fit a cosine wave to a time series and identify the best-fit cosine wave with period information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Supplementary Table 1, a period was determined by performing cosinor analysis between 23.5 h and 24.0 h with 0.1 h step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach consists of minimizing the sum of squared deviations between the data and the fitted cosine curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The larger this residual sum of squares is, the greater the uncertainty of the estimated parameters is.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Best fitting is the percentage of variance divided by the total variance (and multiplied by 100).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The significance of the rhythm is calculated using the zero amplitude test, in which the null hypothesis is that amplitude is zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rejection of this null hypothesis signifies that the fitted curve (implying rhythmicity) approximates the data more closely than does a straight line of zero slope (implying constancy).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data
