FoxA and LIPG endothelial lipase control the uptake of extracellular lipids for breast cancer growth  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The mechanisms that allow breast cancer (BCa) cells to metabolically sustain rapid growth are poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that BCa cells are dependent on a mechanism to supply precursors for intracellular lipid production derived from extracellular sources and that the endothelial lipase (LIPG) fulfils this function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LIPG expression allows the import of lipid precursors, thereby contributing to BCa proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LIPG stands out as an essential component of the lipid metabolic adaptations that BCa cells, and not normal tissue, must undergo to support high proliferation rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LIPG is ubiquitously and highly expressed under the control of FoxA1 or FoxA2 in all BCa subtypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The downregulation of either LIPG or FoxA in transformed cells results in decreased proliferation and impaired synthesis of intracellular lipids.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cancer cells undergo metabolic reprogramming in order to produce biosynthetic precursors, such as ATP, lipids, nucleotides and amino acids, which are required to sustain the energy and substrate demands for rapid growth and proliferation1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the various metabolic deregulations in cancer, lipid metabolism emerges as a critical pathway for the maintenance of cell survival, growth and migration3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus research devoted to understanding the mechanisms of lipid metabolism adaptation in breast cancer (BCa) is highly relevant if we are to devise novel strategies to improve the control of this disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The FoxA protein sub-family belongs to the forkhead box (Fox) transcription factor family and comprises FoxA1, FoxA2 and FoxA3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FoxA transcription factors are critical regulators of tissue development, tissue function and metabolism4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the mammary gland, FoxA1 contributes to the differentiation of luminal epithelial cells and co-regulates the hormonal response to estrogen and androgen5,6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In liver and pancreas, FoxA transcription factors are key controllers of metabolism8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the role of FoxA1 in differentiation of luminal epithelial cells and its transcriptional control of metabolic genes and pathways, we study the potential function of FoxA family of transcription factors in BCa metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we reveal that FoxA1 and the transcription factors family regulate the expression of the endothelial lipase enzyme (LIPG), a member of the lipoprotein lipase family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LIPG supports BCa cell lipid addiction and loss of its activity impairs tumour growth.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'FoxA1 and FoxA2 in BCa growth', 'The importance of FoxA1 in BCa cells differentiation and its contribution to controlling the expression of metabolic genes in several other tissues makes this transcription factor a highly attractive target to explain the metabolic alterations reported in BCa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these reason, we decided to ascertain the metabolic processes controlled by FoxA1 in BCa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first confirmed the association between high FoxA1 expression (mRNA and protein) and luminal subtype (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we used two cohorts of primary breast tumours with annotated clinical features and follow-up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MSKCC/EMC BCa data set is based on gene expression profiles from an original series of 560 cases10, whereas the Spanish BCa data set (n=439) is a tissue microarray of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded stage IIII breast tumour specimens11 (details provided in Methods Section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High FoxA1 gene expression significantly correlated with high expression of well-established luminal markers, such as GATA3 and ESR1, in primary tumours (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next we explored FoxA1 expression beyond the luminal subtype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lower FoxA1 expression was observed in non-luminal tumours (Fig 1a,b); however, a subset also expressed higher FoxA1 levels (Supplementary Fig 1b and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that FoxA2, in conjunction with FoxA1, is also involved in the regulation of several metabolic pathways, we determined the expression of this factor in BCa samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, no FoxA2 probes in the Affymetrix platform used in the MSKCC/EMC data set provided a reliable interpretation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome this limitation, we used tissue arrays of early BCa samples (Spanish BCa set).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histological examination of FoxA2-stained tissue microarray slides from the Spanish BCa set revealed the expression of this factor in six non-luminal samples, which were scored as FoxA1 (examples in Fig 1b and summarized in Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, the number of FoxA+ BCa samples detected by immunohistochemistry accounted for 81.3% of all samples in the Spanish BCa set (Supplementary Table 1), which represent a significant proportion of BCa and point to the participation of FoxA in this disease, beyond to its involvement in differentiation and control of hormonal responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: FoxA1 and FoxA2 in BCa growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a, top) FoxA1 mRNA expression in the MSKCC/EMC set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BCa samples were stratified in Luminal A, Luminal B, Her2, triple negative and unknown subgroups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unknown group represents specimens that were not classified in any group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (bottom) FoxA1 protein levels by IHC staining in Luminal, Her2 and triple negative samples in the Spanish BCa set (cohort of 439 BCa patients).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data is average±s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) FoxA1 and FoxA2 IHC staining in FFPE human specimens representative of the different BCa subtypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six independent cases are depicted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FoxA1 and FoxA2 are expressed mainly in the nuclei of tumour cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 50 m.

#@NEW_LINE#@#  FFPE, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded.Full size image', 'Next, we extended our analysis to BCa cell lines for further mechanistic studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared FoxA1 and FoxA2 mRNA expression in four estrogen receptor positive (ER+) (MCF7, T47D, BT474 and ZR75) and four estrogen receptor negative (ER) (SKBR3, MDA468, BT20 and MDA231) BCa cell lines, a cell line of melanoma origin (MDA435), and human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, two of the BCa lines tested were HER2+ (BT474 and SKBR3) (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All ER+ BCa cells (MCF7, T47D, BT474 and ZR75), the ER/HER2+ SKBR3 and both triple negative-like MDA468 and BT20 cell lines expressed FoxA1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, MDA231 triple negative-like cells expressed high levels of FoxA2 but not FoxA1, and the non-tumour HMECs did not express these factors (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No BCa cells co-expressed these two proteins (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that the expression of FoxA transcription factors is a common feature of breast tumours, as well as of BCa cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This notion implies that FoxA factors play a major role in BCa growth, independently of luminal fate specification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To examine the molecular basis of the contribution of FoxA1 and FoxA2 to BCa growth, we engineered constitutive GFP-luciferase-expressing MCF7 and MDA231 cells with a doxycycline-inducible short-hairpin RNA (sh-RNA) vector targeting either FoxA1 or FoxA2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Doxycycline addition to the cell culture media decreased FoxA expression in both cell lines compared with control cells (ShControl (Dox+) and Sh FoxA1 or Sh FoxA2 (Dox))(Fig 1d), with the concomitant expression of tRFP (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, there was no gain of expression of FoxA2 in FoxA1-depleted cells or vice versa (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, cancer cell proliferation was impaired in vitro upon depletion of either FoxA1 or FoxA2 in MCF7 and MDA231 cells, respectively (Supplementary Fig 1d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, when Balb/c nude mice implanted with xenograft tumours from the above described cellular populations were treated with doxycycline and the short hairpins were induced, striking differences in tumour growth were observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FoxA1-depleted MCF7 and FoxA2-depleted MDA231 tumour growth was blunted (Fig 1e and additional controls in Supplementary Fig 1f.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental details in the Supplementary Methods Section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these observations confirm that FoxA1 or FoxA2 expression is required for BCa growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous studies indicate that FoxA1 and FoxA2 transcriptionally regulate common genes in the liver and pancreas that are central to development and metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore hypothesized that crossed expression of FoxA factors could rescue tumour growth by restoring the expression of essential metabolic genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we engineered doxycycline-driven shFoxA1 MCF7 cells to express exogenous FoxA2 and doxycycline-driven shFoxA2 MDA231 cells to express exogenous FoxA1 (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, when these BCa modified cells were implanted in Balb/c nude mice and FoxA depletion was induced with doxycycline, the sustained expression of another FoxA factor (FoxA2 in MCF7 and FoxA1 in MDA231 cells) was sufficient for tumours to continuously grow (Fig 1e and additional controls in Supplementary Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis confirmed FoxA expression in the distinct tumour populations ex-vivo (Supplementary Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results showed that retention of minimal levels of FoxA1 or FoxA2 expression is necessary for BCa cell growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'FoxA1- and FoxA2-regulated transcripts for BCa growth', 'Next, we focused on the identification of genes under the control of FoxA1 and FoxA2 with the capacity to support tumour growth in xenograft tumours from implanted MCF7 and MDA231 cells, with a specific focus on metabolic functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we isolated cells derived from non-depleted (Dox) FoxA1 or FoxA2 MCF7 and MDA231 tumours (control groups, GFP+/tRFP), FoxA1- and FoxA2-depleted MCF7 and MDA231 tumours (GFP+/tRFP+), and the corresponding FoxA family-rescued tumours (GFP+/tRFP+), respectively (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumours surgically removed from the mouse were disaggregated and GFP (cancer cell-specific), and tRFP expression (FoxA1- and FoxA2-depleted cell-specific) was used to isolate human cancer cells from mouse tumour stroma cells (Fig 2a) in order to purify RNA for subsequent transcriptomic analysis (GSE61164 and Transcriptomic Analysis in Methods Section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the genes under the control of FoxA1 and FoxA2 in the six cellular populations, we identified LIPG and BCL2 as positively regulated while CDH11 was negatively regulated (summarized in Fig 2b; details in Supplementary Table 2 and methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied stringent criteria to our analyses to prevent false positive hits (2.5-fold change and false discovery rate  less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BCL2 expression is associated with anti-apoptotic functions in cancer12, whereas cadherin CDH11 induces apoptosis13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LIPG is an endothelial lipase with phospholipase activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is involved in lipoprotein metabolism, and its levels have been associated with testis cancer14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to date, LIPG has not been linked to tumour growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Robust changes in the mRNA expression of LIPG, but not BCL2 or CDH11, were confirmed by qRT-PCR (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we confirmed that FoxA factors regulate LIPG and its promoter activity (Fig 2ce).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: A genomic

tumours was specific to BCa tumour cells and not to other stroma cellular entities (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, we tested LIPG expression in normal breast epithelia and interrogated 20 samples from mammoplasty reductions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Normal breast epithelial cells showed a lower expression of LIPG than cells from tumour specimens (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained for LIPG protein levels in a panel from BCa lines compared with HMEC cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the cellular populations tested, the eight BCa cell lines expressing FoxA1 or FoxA2 had very high levels of LIPG protein compared with the melanoma MDA435 cell line and the human epithelial cell (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this observation, 83.8% of BCa samples in the Spanish tumour cohort were LIPG+ (Fig 3d and Supplementary Table 3), and LIPG expression correlated with FoxA expression (Spearman correlation; r=0.477, P=0.000001; Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further analysis showed that LIPG expression levels in primary tumours do not have the capacity to stratify patients for differential risk of overall or disease-free survival (Supplementary Fig 2a) and are not dependent on estrogen signalling (Supplementary Fig 2b), thus reinforcing the notion that LIPG is essential for BCa growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: LIPG contributes to BCa growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

DG (32:1); PE (32:2); PE (40:5); LPC (O-18:0); LPC (16:0); and LPC (20:1) (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of these lipid families are pivotal in cancer malignancy19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results suggest that LIPG shapes lipid metabolism in BCa cells to support cellular growth requirements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, FoxA depletion in both MCF7 and MDA231 cells led to a lipid metabolic reprograming similar to LIPG depletion (Supplementary Fig 4ce).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: LIPG regulates the uptake of lipids in BCa cells inducing a lipid metabolic reprograming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic representation of LIPG action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Heat map representation of the downregulated (blue) lipids identified by MS/MS in the cell homogenates of MCF7 or MDA231 LIPG-depleted cells compared with shControl cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depicted lipids have a fold change  greater than 1.5 and P value less_than 0.05 using the Welchs t-test n=5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Downregulated lipid species (previously identified in b) that are common to LIPG-depleted MCF7 and LIPG-depleted MDA231 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ShControl cells (red box), and shLIPG (blue box).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P values are  less_than 0.05 and calculated using Welchs t-test, n=5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whiskers extend to a maximum of 1.5 × IQR beyond the box.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Heat map representation of the upregulated (red) lipids identified by MS/MS in the media of MCF7 or MDA231 LIPG-depleted cells compared with the corresponding shControl cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Characterized lipids have a fold change  greater than 1.5 and P value less_than 0.05 using the Welchs t-test n=5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Upregulated lipid species in the media (previously identified in d) that are common to LIPG-depleted MCF7 and LIPG-depleted MDA231 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ShControl cells (red box), and shLIPG cells (blue box).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P values are  less_than 0.05 and calculated using Welchs t-test, n=5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whiskers extend to a maximum of 1.5 × IQR beyond the box.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) Heat map representation of the MS/MS downregulated (blue) lipids in the cell media of MCF7/MDA231 LIPG-depleted or shControl cells (as described in d) compared with fresh medium (without cell incubation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depicted lipid species have a log2 fold change greater than 1.5 and P value less_than 0.05 using the Welchs t-test n=5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (g) MDA231 and MCF7 cell growth for 48 h in complete medium: medium containing 10% FBS 10%);

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Here we reveal that FoxA factors provide a central metabolic growth function by specifically regulating LIPG expression, thereby allowing the acquisition of indispensable extracellular lipids for BCa tumour proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FoxA family of transcription factors are expressed in the vast majority of BCa and FoxA1 is expressed across various BCa subtypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover we show that, in some cases, its absence is associated with the expression of FoxA2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, in addition of FoxA1 contribution to luminal commitment24,25,26,27 the factor may drive BCa growth by specifically regulating LIPG levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The catalytic activity of LIPG generates extracellular lipid precursors that are imported to fulfill the intracellular production of lipid species (Fig 5f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LIPG downregulation blocks BCa cell growth, thereby indicating that the import of extracellular lipid precursors is important for the proliferation of these cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a striking observation given that it is generally believed that de novo fatty acid synthesis is the main driver of tumour growth22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, our experimental data with LIPG-depleted BCa cells revealed a massive decrease of most intracellular glycerolipid intermediates in the synthesis of TG (PC, PE, PG and DG) and their derivatives (LPC and LPE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, certain lipid species (LPC) in the media were not decreased in LIPG-depleted cells as much as in control cells, thus indicating that extracellular lipids are the substrates for intracellular lipid production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we demonstrate the relevance of extracellular LPC (18:0) for BCa cell proliferation in a lipoprotein-depleted medium, a process dependent on LIPG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, a high-fat diet was shown to rescue the absence of a critical intracellular lipase, Monoacylglycerol lipase, for cancer pathogenesis given cancer cells ability to uptake lipids from the extracellular compartment was functional19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, we showed that this rescue mechanism is not functional in BCa cells in the absence of FoxA2 or LIPG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this notion, it is worth noting that extracellular LIPG activity releases fatty acids from high-density lipoprotein phospholipids and these acids are further employed for intracellular lipid production in the human hepatic cell line HepG2 (refs 28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, BCa cells are dependent on a mechanism to supply precursors derived from extracellular sources for intracellular lipid production, and LIPG fulfills this function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, LIPG stands out as an important component of the lipid metabolic adaptations that BCa cells, and not normal tissue, must undergo to support high proliferation rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results also suggest that de novo lipid synthesis is necessary but not sufficient to support lipid production for BCa tumour growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, recent clinical studies demonstrate the association between lipids and lipoproteins in circulation and risk of BCa in women with extensive mammographic density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation implies that interventions aimed to reduce them may have effect on BCa risk30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All together, these observations make LIPG activity an Achilles heel of luminal and, more importantly, of triple negative/basal-like breast tumours, for which limited therapeutic options are currently available.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

cells were mixed in growth-reduced factor matrigel (BD Bioscience, cat no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  354230) in a concentration of 2,000 cells per 25 l of matrigel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each drop was dispensed in the center of the well from adherent 48-well plate and incubated for 15 min at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After matrigel is solidified, 250 l of oncosphere assay media (see above) was added to each well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Every other day, media was changed, and organotypic 3D structures were grown for a total of 15 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total number of organoids was counted using a custom macro created by the Advance Digital Microscopy Core Facility at IRB Barcelona.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The images shown are the result of the 42 pictures stitched (which recreates the whole drop) using a
