MAIT cells are activated during human viral infections  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are abundant in humans and recognize bacterial ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that MAIT cells are also activated during human viral infections in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MAIT cells activation was observed during infection with dengue virus, hepatitis C virus and influenza virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This activationdriving cytokine release and Granzyme B upregulationis TCR-independent but dependent on IL-18 in synergy with IL-12, IL-15 and/or interferon-/.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-18 levels and MAIT cell activation correlate with disease severity in acute dengue infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, HCV treatment with interferon- leads to specific MAIT cell activation in vivo in parallel with an enhanced therapeutic response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, TCR-independent activation of MAIT cells leads to a reduction of HCV replication in vitro mediated by IFN-.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together these data demonstrate MAIT cells are activated following viral infections, and suggest a potential role in both host defence and immunopathology.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are an abundant and distinctive T cell subset first identified by Porcelli et al.1 in 1993 in humans on the basis of the invariant V-alpha chain (V7.2-J33) and later described in mice2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MAIT cells comprise 510% of T-cells within the periphery and are found enriched in both the gut and in the liverwhere in humans they may represent between 12% and 50% of T-cells3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both mouse and man, MAIT cells are restricted to a bacterial riboflavin synthesis pathway-derived ligand presented by the conserved MHC-class I like molecule MR1 (refs 7, 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo challenge models using riboflavin synthesizing bacteria, such as Klebsiella species and mycobacteria, have confirmed an anti-bacterial role for MAIT cells9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MR1 tetramers loaded with the ligand rRL-6-CH2OH have allowed the specific detection of human and murine MAIT cells11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In recent years, a number of groups have elucidated the distinct phenotypic and functional profile of MAIT cells, characterized by the high expression of the C-type lectin CD161 (KLRB1 or NKR-P1A), and the capacity to secrete multiple cytokines, including IL-17, interferon (IFN)- and TNF-12,13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distinctive phenotype of MAIT cells appears to be driven by two key transcription factors, RORt and PLZF3,6,13,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RORt expression is linked to development of type 17 function and expression of surface receptors such as IL23R and CCR6 (refs 5, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with mucosal defence and anti-bacterial functions and also consistent with the bacterial specificity of the receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PLZF is critical for development of invariant natural killer T cell (iNKT) cells and may be responsible for a distinct set of innate phenotypic features, including marked upregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine receptors IL-18R and IL-12R19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This dual transcriptional drive suggests that MAIT cells may possess multiple parallel functionalities or modes of activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given the specificity of the T-cell receptor (TCR), it appears that activation of MAIT cells in vivo is driven by responsiveness to bacteria (and some yeasts)21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given their innate phenotype, broad range of effector functions, and tissue distribution, we addressed the question of whether they may also have evolved to respond to viral infections in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If so, this would markedly widen the role of MAIT cells in human infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we addressed MAIT cell activation in response to a set of major human viral pathogens both in vivo and in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo, MAIT cells are activated in response to dengue virus (DENV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and influenza virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro, DENV, HCV and influenza virus readily trigger MAIT cell populations in an IL-18 dependent manner, in concert with other virally-driven pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-/.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of MAIT cells in acute dengue correlated both with disease outcome and with IL-18 signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, in vivo activation of MAIT cells during HCV therapy correlated with specific addition of IFN- during therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data strongly implicate a role for MAIT cells in response to major virus infections of man and provide a mechanism for their virus-responsive nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, this significantly expands the pathogen response repertoire of this abundant human T-cell subset.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'MAIT cell activation during acute viral infections in vivo', 'Whether human MAIT cells respond during acute viral infections remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this we analysed MAIT cell activation in DENV and influenza virus infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, MAIT cells were defined as CD161++V7.2+ CD8+CD4CD3+ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DENV infection presents with a rapid onset of a febrile illness, which lasts around a week.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the virus has been cleared and fever drops, patients follow two distinct courses: an uncomplicated resolution (dengue fever; DF) or a severe course associated with organ dysfunction and haemorrhage (dengue haemorrhagic fever; DHF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The determinants driving outcome are still poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, an aberrant immune response, around the day of defervescence, is thought to have an important role in the pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analysed MAIT cells in a longitudinal study of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a cohort of patients with DHF or DF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blood samples were collected at different time points during the acute phase of infection and dates were named in relation to the day fever subsided (day of defervescence, day 0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples taken 10 or more days after the day of defervescence (day  greater than 10) were considered convalescent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a small but significant reduction in MAIT cell frequencies between the acute phase (day 0) and the convalescent phase (day  greater than 10) of infection (Fig 1a,b), but no differences in MAIT cell frequency between DHF and DF patients (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: MAIT cell activation during acute viral infections in vivo.PBMCs from healthy controls (HC, n=510), patients suffering from severe dengue (DHF, n=210), dengue (DF, n=410) or acute, hospitalized patients infected with influenza A virus (n=79) were analysed by flow cytometry by gating on live CD3+CD8+CD161++V7.2+ (MAIT) cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,d,g) Representative flow cytometry plots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b,e,h) Comparison between acute (day 0) and convalescent phase (day  greater than 10) of infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c,f,i) Comparison between DHF and DF patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (jm) Acute, hospitalized patients infected with influenza virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b,c,j,k) MAIT cell frequency as a proportion of the CD8+ T cell population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e,f) Percentage of CD38 expression by MAIT cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (h,i,l,m) Percentage of Granzyme B expression by MAIT cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical significance was determined with a Wilcoxon matched-paired test (b,e,h) or MannWhitney test (j,k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bars represent means±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ns greater than 0.05, *P 0.05, **P0.01, ***P0.001, ****P0.0001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  conv, convalescent;

IL-18, in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Figs 2 and 3)25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We extended this finding by exploring responses to a range of TLR ligands in PBMCs and found endosomal TLR3 was also a potent activator (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with TLR8, TLR3 induced MAIT cell activation via IL-18 and IL-12 and not MR112,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TLR sensing by APCs can occur in the absence of viral replication26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the requirement of viral replication for MAIT cell activation, we used ultraviolet-irradiation of the viruses, which prevents transcription or replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultraviolet-irradiated DENV was no longer able to activate MAIT cells (Supplementary Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, ultraviolet-irradiated HCV and influenza virus were still able to activate MAIT cells, although less efficiently compared to untreated virus (Supplementary Fig 5b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, DENV productively infects APCs, whereas productive influenza virus and HCV infection is limited in both primary and stem cell-derived human APCs (Supplementary Fig 5df)28,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the level of DENV infection

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'MAIT cells are an abundant human T-cell population with a semi-invariant TCR determining bacterial specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has previously been considered that MAIT cells were not responsive to viral infection37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in this study we provide data to show MAIT cells are also readily and specifically activated by pathogenic viruses in vivo and in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we define mechanisms that allow this virally-driven activation, and show they are distinct in the different viral settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The in vivo data shows that there is evidence of MAIT cell activation in response to DENV, HCV and influenza virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these the most striking is the data from acute DENV infection as it is clear that such activation is profound and rapid in this severe clinical setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, those patients who went on to develop DHF exhibited significantly higher levels of activation as judged by CD38 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests the MAIT cell response could contribute to the pathophysiology of this condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correlation between levels of IL-18, levels of IL-18R and MAIT cell activation suggests an important role for IL-18 in this activation process, consistent with the in vitro mechanisms demonstrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In DENV, HCV and influenza virus infection we found clear evidence of activation of the MAIT cells, as judged by upregulation of Granzyme B (which is tightly regulated in MAIT cells22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we noted a decrease in circulating MAIT cell frequencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanism for this is not clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may result from translocation of some cells from blood to tissues, or it could result from activation-induced cell death as has been suggested for HIV infection38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The data presented are correlativehowever probing a non-redundant role in animal models is not straightforward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mice the MAIT cell population is a very small minority compared to the frequencies of iNKT cells, which have overlapping functions and innate cytokine responsiveness39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In humans, the situation is reversed, with MAIT cell frequencies exceeding those of iNKT cells by 12 logs13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Existing data indicate a functional antiviral role for iNKT cells in control of virus infections in tissues such as lung, in mouse models: given similar molecular mechanisms of activation apply, and similar effector functions are induced, it seems reasonable to extrapolate from this that MAIT cell activity would have a parallel role in human infection40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emerging models with increased MAIT cell frequencies in mice may help address this question using new in vivo approaches41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'MR1 tetramers unequivocally identify MAIT cells, but these reagents are not yet widely available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study we used CD161++V7.2+ as a surrogate marker for MAIT cells, which is a commonly used staining approach and includes the majority of tetramer-positive MAIT cells6,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further defined MAIT cells as CD8+CD4CD3+ T cells, and for in vitro experiments PBMCs from healthy individuals were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD8 is expressed by the majority of MAIT cells, and CD4 only by a small proportion of MAIT cells42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach has been used in recent transcriptional studies and allows ready comparison with related CD161-expressing subsets16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies using MR1 tetramers are needed to further establish the distribution of MAIT cell phenotype in virally infected humans in more detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we did not have access to the tetramer, the observed loss of MAIT cells in virally infected patients may be potentially explained by down-regulation of CD161, as previously suggested12,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Fernandez et al.44 showed that in HIV-1 infected patients, MR1 tetramers do not bind CD161V7.2+ T cells, and the loss of MAIT cells in the periphery may be due to recruitment to the site of infection or activation-induced cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, our data are not restricted to CD161++V7.2+ cells but also includes responses from the minority CD161++V7.2 cells, which we have previously described as sharing phenotypic and functional properties with MAIT cells and which likely also include some recently described V7.2 MR1-restricted T cell populations45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The mechanisms we have explored reveal a central role for IL-18 in virus-induced activation12,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the critical co-stimulation was not restricted to a single cytokine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of HCV we repeatedly observed an important role for IL-15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-15 levels in these experimental conditions were very low, but upregulation of IL-15R was seen and importantly antibody-blockade of IL-15 revealed a clear role for this cytokine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we observed a role for type I IFNs in the activation of MAIT cells in response to HCV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was clear in both addition and blockade experiments and is consistent with data from natural killer cells, where such cytokine-mediated activation is described47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The cytokine activation of MAIT cells was mediated by APCs with a role for viral sensing and replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of DENV, viral replication was required for MAIT cell activation and this was positively correlated with the level of productive infection in the APC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we observed a reduction of MAIT cell activation in response to UV-irradiated HCV and IAV, replication does not have a key role in this context, since HCV and influenza poorly replicate in macrophages28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As APC have continual and extensive endocytic activity, viral recognition can occur through endocytosis of viral particles as well as through direct infection26,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using TLR agonists, we found that both surface and endocytic TLRs can trigger MAIT cells, in particular viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using murine bone marrow-derived DCs, Le Bourhis et al.37 has previously shown that MAIT cells are not responsive to viral infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discrepancy is likely due to the use of murine, rather than human cells, which may reflect differential abilities in secreting, as well as, responding to cytokines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'IFN--mediated activation of MAIT cells is clinically and functionally relevant, as demonstrated in vivo in the well-controlled BOSON clinical trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to directly acting antiviral drugs (SOF in combination with RBV), IFN- was included in one arm only and associated with MAIT cell activation and an enhanced therapy response36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that MAIT cells act as local amplifiers of IFN--mediated therapies, contributing to an antiviral effect through secretion of further local antiviral cytokines or potentially via clearance of infected cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specific activation by type I IFNs appears to be important evidence in favour of an evolution of MAIT cells in response to viral signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although type I IFN signalling is not exclusive to virus infections, a wealth of data links IFN pathways with antiviral defence, and we propose that MAIT cells form an important part of this network in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, IFN- signalling alone was insufficient to fully activate MAIT cells, indicating a potentially fail-safe mechanism to prevent harmful over-activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The secondary consequences of MAIT cell activation could be of significance for both protection and immunopathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of MAIT cells in tissues could provide both direct and indirect antiviral effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HCV, for example, is known to be highly sensitive to T-cell-derived IFN-49,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we found that activation of MAIT cells by HCV-induced responses that limited HCV replication in vitro, in an IFN- dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the local activation of MAIT cells can be plausibly correlated with a direct antiviral function in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Loss of MAIT cell frequencies (as we have observed in blood) may contribute to impairment of both viral and bacterial control, whereas excess cytokine secretion by MAIT cells may lead to immunopathologic outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, high levels of MAIT cell activation could contribute to the cytokine storm associated with DHF and severe cases of influenza virus51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation-induced loss of MAIT cells is potentially relevant in the context of influenza virus infection, which is epidemiologically associated with secondary bacterial pneumonia due to Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumonia53,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both of these organisms possess the MAIT cell ligand7,37, and it is plausible that depletion of MAIT cells in situ could lead to transient impairment of local control of these pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the transcription factor PLZF, which likely drives the innate phenotype and functionality of MAIT cells, may also contribute to the induction of activation-induced cell death, through upregulation of specific intracellular caspases55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, human MAIT cells are activated in response to virus infections (as illustrated by a simplified model depicted in Supplementary Fig 11), through overlapping mechanisms dependent on the virus and likely the environment and cell types affected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data extend the likely functions of these abundant human lymphocytes well beyond their traditional confines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modulation of this cell subset (and related CD161+ T-cell subsets16,56,57,58) could provide a novel opportunity to promote antiviral defence or limit immunopathology.'
