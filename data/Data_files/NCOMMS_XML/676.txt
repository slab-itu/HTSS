T-cell stimuli independently sum to regulate an inherited clonal division fate  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In the presence of antigen and costimulation, T cells undergo a characteristic response of expansion, cessation and contraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have revealed that population-level reproducibility is a consequence of multiple clones exhibiting considerable disparity in burst size, highlighting the requirement for single-cell information in understanding T-cell fate regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that individual T-cell clones resulting from controlled stimulation in vitro are strongly lineage imprinted with highly correlated expansion fates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Progeny from clonal families cease dividing in the same or adjacent generations, with inter-clonal variation producing burst-size diversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effects of costimulatory signals on individual clones sum together with stochastic independence; therefore, the net effect across multiple clones produces consistent, but heterogeneous population responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data demonstrate that substantial clonal heterogeneity arises through differences in experience of clonal progenitors, either through stochastic antigen interaction or by differences in initial receptor sensitivities.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'T-cell immunity against infection requires the activation and expansion of a small number of pathogen-specific cells to form a larger pool of protective lymphocytes1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The net behaviour of these rare pathogen-specific clones dictates the characteristics of the population response and, for a given infection, results in a highly reproducible response magnitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this consistency in population responses, in vivo measurements of clonal burst size and phenotype have revealed substantial heterogeneity between clones2,3,4,5,6,7, highlighting the requirement for single-cell information in understanding T-cell fate regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these studies, a critical question arises: how is clonal diversity within the T-cell response generated?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, to what extent is variation in clonal outcomes intrinsically inherited from the initial cell and how much arises through deterministic and stochastic processes, both intrinsic and extrinsic, experienced by individual daughter cells after the initial activating events8?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we direct this question to examine the considerable variation in proliferative capacity of individual T cells following stimulation2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Population-level studies have demonstrated that T cells with identical T-cell receptors (TCRs) respond heterogeneously9,10,11 and, even under controlled in vitro conditions9, divide a variable number of times before stopping and reverting to a quiescent state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following previous studies9,12,13, we defined the generation in which an activated lymphocyte returns to quiescence to be its division destiny (DD) and asked how heterogeneity in DD is generated at a family level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1 presents two alternative clonal level possibilities: first, the population distribution of DD (Fig 1a) could arise through strongly clonally correlated DD fates; and, second, the heterogeneity might emerge from highly discordant family DD histories (Fig 1b top and bottom panels, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identifying strong clonal concordance would indicate that DD is a lineage primed, inherited property.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, clonal discordance in DD fate, in which cells stop over multiple generations, could result from deterministic programming through an asymmetric cell division14,15 or by stochastic regulation16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Published data cannot distinguish between these possibilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: How is T-cell division destiny (DD) regulated at a clonal level?Hypothetical data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) When apparently identical T cells are stimulated, they proliferate to different extents, resulting in the population of progeny cells returning to quiescence (that is, DD) across multiple generations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Two distinct clonal family DD behaviours are consistent with the data in a; a highly concordant clonal DD that would arise if DD was inherited (top panel) or a highly discordant family DD (bottom panel), which could occur through stochastic or deterministic regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each row represents a single clone, with circles showing progeny cells reaching DD per generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clonal range=maximumminimum generation number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Signals affecting T-cell DD have been shown to add together at the population level9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) If signal effects are independent, clonal family tree addition offers a possible explanation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of concordant trees results in a tree that is also concordant (top panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of discordant family trees is more complex, as we must allow combinatorial interlacements of tree subsections to represent all possible contributing interactions in time and place (bottom panel, Supplementary Fig 1 and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the distinct family trees in d, lower panel, the numbers of DD cells per generation (red circles) are the same, which is a general property (see Methods).Full size image', 'Any clonal level answer to the question of relative concordance in DD must also be reconciled with a further striking population level observation: T-cell DD is regulated by the type and the strength of the signals received, and many signal combinations result in both the means and variances of population DD distributions summing linearly, illustrated in Fig 1c (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation suggests independence of the effects of signals driving DD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus the solution to the familial genesis of DD variation posed in Fig 1a,b must also address how variable outcomes at single cell level result from fates of clonal family trees (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we sought to identify the source of DD variation, and identify how signal integration that is additive at the population level results from, and is consistent with, clonal family behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address these questions we develop and utilize a novel multiplex clonal division-tracking assay based on the combinatorial use of multiple division tracking dyes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this technique we reveal that CD8+ T-cell clones are imprinted with highly correlated division fates during the early immune response, such that progeny cells from clonal families cease dividing in the same or adjacent generations, with inter-clonal variation producing burst-size diversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report a new mathematical framework enabling us to deduce that the summation of T-cell stimuli effects on division number at the clonal level are stochastic and independent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This clonal addition of signals results in reproducible population-level responses, with substantial clonal heterogeneity arising through differences in stochastic antigen interaction and initial receptor sensitivity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A novel multiplex assay to measure clonal division', 'To investigate clonal regulation of T-cell DD, we developed a method to determine familial proliferation features of a large number of founder cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To simultaneously track proliferation of multiple clonal families in a single culture well, we labelled lymphocytes with quantitatively distinct combinations and concentrations of the division tracking dyes 5-(and 6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE), CellTrace Violet (CTV) and Cell Proliferation Dye eFluor670 (CPD) (Fig 2a,b)18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way we created up to 10 fluorescently distinct populations in a single co-culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To measure clonal regulation of division fate using this multiplex tracking dye method, we adopted the minimal in vitro stimulation system that was established previously to determine variation in DD at a population level (as in Fig 1a)9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OT-I CD8+ T cells, which recognize SIINFEKL (N4) peptide presented on H2Kb, and deficient for the pro-apoptotic protein Bim (OT-I/Bcl2l11/) were purified, labelled with the division tracking dye multiplex and stimulated by peptide self-presentation in the presence of anti-mouse IL-2 blocking antibody (clone S4B6; Fig 2ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bim-deficiency enhanced cell survival without altering DD and addition of anti-mouse IL-2 blocking antibody limited the autocrine IL-2 present in the culture, allowing T cells to reach DD within the range of division tracking dyes9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 26 h (just prior to the first division) cells were sorted so that a single stimulated but undivided cell, identified by high forward scatter (FSC) fluorescence and undiluted division tracking dye, from each fluorescently distinct population was sorted per well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were returned to culture, without peptide but with S4B6, until analysis by flow cytometry at 54, 62 and 72 h post stimulation (Fig 2d,e), capturing times when most cells were reaching DD without considerable cell death having occurred9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clonal family division fate from each labelling configuration was identified using the fluorescent gating scheme outlined in Fig 2f.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small cell size was used to indicate return to quiescence, as previously defined by correlation with a cell cycle reporter of G0 (refs 9, 12, 20; Fig 2f, also Supplementary Fig 2, and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: A novel high-throughput clonal assay to measure T-cell division fate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) OT-I/Bcl2l11/ CD8+ T cells were purified and (b) labelled sequentially with different combinations and concentrations of CFSE, CTV and CPD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) T cells from the 10 different labelling configurations indicated were mixed together and stimulated with N4 peptide±CD28 (2 g ml1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between 500 and 2,000 cells from each of all 12 labelling configurations were also cultured separately to use as compensation and gating controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Just prior to first division (26 h) a single cell per labelling configuration from each stimulation condition was sorted into new wells and cultured±hIL-2 (1 U ml1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus there were four stimulation conditions in total: N4-only, N4+CD28, N4+IL-2, N4+CD28+IL-2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) 7,500 beads and propidium iodide (PI) were added per well before analysis to estimate sample recovery and detect dead cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were carefully transferred to tubes and the complete sample was collected by flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proliferation of clonal progeny cells was measured at 54, 62 and 72 h post stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) Gates for data analysis were created using control populations at each time-point then applied to the clonal samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FSC/SSC profile was used to gate beads and lymphocyte populations and then PI exclusion used to identify live cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Live cells were separated out into differentially labelled populations by classifying cells as CPD+ or CPD then plotting CFSE versus CTV to distinguish the division number of cells from different labelling populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FSC/SSC was then used to classify cells as small, thus having reached their DD (see Supplementary Fig 2 and Methods for further details on small cell gating).Full size

each of eight labelled groups, stimulated and harvested at 72 h post stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As described in Fig 2, the data in Fig 3a enabled the identification of generation-gates for each dye-combination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3b shows two single co-cultured wells harvested at the same time, with the population-determined gates overlaid, allowing the determination of the generation of each individual cell in each clonal family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data illustrate how the multiplexing system permits distinct families to be isolated and followed in the co-culture, empowering analysis of familial concordance under these, and altered, culture conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Clonal T-cell family proliferation is synchronized.OT-I/Bcl2l11/ CD8+ T cells were

'T-cell proliferation is synchronous', 'The data shown in Fig 3c was analysed for features of clonal proliferation synchronicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From an input of 224 clones across three time points, we detected at least one progeny cell from 171 clones (76% of the input).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 42% of these clones, all progeny cells were measured, which is comparable to the recovery from time-lapse microscopy of non-adherent cells12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion of cells per generation from the pooled clonal progeny and population control were comparable (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Clonal T-cell division progression was notably concordant (Fig 3c, Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 54 h a considerable proportion of the clones were still dividing (blue), with more quiescent progeny cells (red) being found at 62 and 72 h. Irrespective of time point or quiescence status, the progeny of an individual clone exhibited strongly synchronous proliferation, with the progeny of 85% of clones being detected in the same generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all remaining clones, progeny were detected in adjacent generations (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was also observed under conditions when peptide persisted in the culture (Supplementary Fig 5), and was consistent with previous observations of a high degree of synchrony in T- and B-cell sibling and cousin division times12,20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all mixed phenotype clones, the dividing progeny were found in the same or previous generation compared with the quiescent cells (Fig 3c, Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggested that the discordance observed arose through slight variations in division timing or potential within an otherwise synchronized clone, consistent with Fig 1b, upper panel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Division fate is concordant in response to different stimuli', 'For this T-cell system, it has been shown that population level DD is strongly influenced by a range of signals that act alone or in concert to extend the number of mitotic cycles cells undergo9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To add to the N4+CD28+IL-2 data presented in Fig 3, we set up conditions to examine concordance with N4 alone, N4+CD28, and N4+IL-2, added as hIL-2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine clonal DD for each condition, we pooled data from 54, 62 and 72 h for families where all detected progeny were quiescent (Fig 4a, Supplementary Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To summarize the concordance of a clonal family we measured the difference in generation number between the greatest and least DD of any descendant of a clone, a quantity we called the range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4b and Supplementary Fig 6b plots the distribution of range for each culture condition, illustrating that for the vast majority of families perfect concordance is observed.

correlation in DD fate was necessary to explain the data in Fig 4b, taking into account that the experimental method does not sample all cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To that end, we developed a stochastic model of family DD construction based on statistics from the data in conjunction with a single tunable parameter that describes the correlation in DD decision of cells within a family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each condition, data was pooled across families and the number of cells, nk, observed to have undergone DD in each generation k recorded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these data, the proportion of cells, pk, that did not undergo DD in generation k was determined taking cohort correction into account', '', 'If cells within a family made independent DD decisions, a binomial number of them, with probability pk would be observed to progress without experiencing DD to generation k+1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To capture within-family correlated DD fate, the long-established correlated generalization of the binomial distribution, the beta-binomial distribution, was employed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This distribution is parameterized by the probability of progression, pk, and a value 0,1 that captures the correlation in the fate of each pair of cells within a family in the same generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If =0, then all clonal cells make independent DD decisions to progress to the next generation with probability pk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If =1, then all clonal cells in each generation share a single DD decision to progress to the next generation with probability pk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As  ranges from 0 to

#@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given , defined by a stimulation condition, and a correlation , the induced probability distribution on full pre-sampled DD trees was determined (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each cell from a full clonal family is sampled independently with a probability determined either by the per-condition average proportion of beads recovered per well (Fig 4c) or the average per well volume measured (Supplementary Fig 6c), from which we computed the sampled-tree range distribution (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For a variety of values of , including the per-condition maximum likelihood estimate, the resulting distribution of range was determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With 95% confidence intervals based on the number of families that are experimentally recovered (see Methods),

recapitulate the data and, in particular, the range data is not consistent with a family-independent DD mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Signal integration effects on clonal division fate', 'The above analysis indicates that clonal DD is a strongly inherited, concordant property within a family lineage under a range of culture conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given this conclusion, we turned our attention to the question of how signal addition at the single cell level operates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results from signal addition studies at the population level provide a hypothesis9 as the reported summation had an additive effect on both the mean and variance of the population DD distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the implications of these observations are considered at the family level, this finding suggests that signal integration at the clonal level might be stochastically independent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, each signal is responsible for heterogeneous levels of expansion and the T-cell clones independently integrate each signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this prediction, we further interrogated the data presented in Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Stimuli effects on clonal division fate add independently', 'To enable quantitative comparison between the expansion effects of distinct stimuli in combination, we developed a new theory for the addition of family trees, presented in detail in Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most significant consequence of our mathematical analysis is that in order to determine the generations in which cells become quiescent in a concatenated tree, it is sufficient to know how many cells become quiescent in each generation in the trees to be added (Fig 1d, Supplementary Fig 1 and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This feature allows us to address questions of signal integration using data from the multiplex clonal proliferation assay, which does not provide entire family tree structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, determination of the generations in which cells are quiescent in the final tree does not depend on how the participating trees are interlaced in the addition procedure (Supplementary Fig 1 and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the mathematics is suitable for describing simultaneous application of mitogenic stimuli, as the DD outcome is invariant to the order of their impact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For each stimulation condition, we first summarized the DD information of each clonal family with two expansion statistics, the maximum DD (maxDD), that is, the greatest generation observed in a quiescent family, and the cohort normalized mean DD (mDD) (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The empirical cumulative distributions of these statistics are plotted in the left panels of Fig 5a and b, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crucially, in the framework of tree concatenation both maxDD and mDD are linear operators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, if signal integration were independent, then the distribution of the maxDD or mDD determined from data generated by two stimuli would necessarily coincide with the convolution of the distributions generated by each stimulus alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, if the influence of CD28 and IL-2 on DD were independent, with no more than one of them correlated to the N4 effect, then the distribution of the sum of the maxDD or mDD statistics of (N4+CD28) and (N4+IL-2), which is the convolution of those two distributions, would correspond with the distribution created from the sum of (N4) and (N4+CD28+IL-2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in the right panels of Fig 5a and b, respectively, these convoluted distributions align remarkably well (see also, Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to test the statistical hypothesis that the convolutions are independent it was necessary to create a non-standard test based on previous results (explained in Methods), giving P values of 0.399 and 0.237 for maxDD and mDD, respectively, and thus the hypothesis of independent additivity of CD28 and IL-2 is not rejected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Stimuli effects on DD sum independently at the level of the clonal family tree.OT-I/Bcl2l11/ CD8+ T cells

traces a large component of DD fate programming to the initial founder cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus we speculated that variation in clonal fates might be traced to measurable differences in levels of cellular components associated with signal perception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, for signal integration to be independent at the clonal level, we reasoned that receptor levels for different signals would be uncorrelated in activated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If this were not correct, we expect correlated receptor levels would lead to dependence of signal strength between costimuli, which

difference in expression between IL-2Rhi and IL-2Rlo cells likely reflects intrinsic differences in cellular TCR stimulation strength due to stochastic antigen encounter, consistent with the observation that TCR stimulation strength regulates DD9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The observation that mDD in this system was not affected by IL-2R level, but was altered by the ligand IL-2, implies that

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cellular replication is a simple, effective mechanism for generating a large number of antigen-specific clones from rare precursor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During an acute response in vivo a CD8+ T cell can divide up to 1520 times27,28,29 and give rise to numerous classes of effector and memory cell types, all with identical antigen receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo single-family tracking studies have revealed significant heterogeneity in the family size of identical cells and a strong concordance in familial differentiation fate2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other studies have ascribed variation in fates to early division bifurcations, and numerous extrinsic signals known to influence the pattern of T-cell regulation14,15,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the relative contribution of extrinsic and intrinsic differences to the fate of otherwise identical cells following stimulation is currently of great interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We sought to gain insight into this question by investigating the genesis of heterogeneity following stimulation of apparently identical T cells placed under controlled stimulatory conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do so we have introduced a novel multiplex clonal division-tracking assay based on the combinatorial use of division tracking dyes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method allowed us to detect cell division fate of clonal families of identical TCR transgenic T cells for up to 67 generations using the single-cell technology of flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We applied this method to examine the clonal influence on variation in DD, the generation at which a stimulated cell returns to a quiescent state, a feature known to be highly variable within a population of stimulated cells9,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results were unequivocal: our experiments revealed progeny cells from clonal families ceased dividing in the same or adjacent generations with high probability, identifying inter-clonal variation as the principle source of DD diversity under these conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conclusion for T cells aligns with earlier results from B-cell filming that revealed similarly strong concordance in family DD after stimulation by the toll-like receptor agonist CpG DNA12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together these data lead us to a general hypothesis: that stimulation of a resting T or B cell initiates an intrinsic sequence of symmetric divisions with an automated return to quiescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our investigation of DD highlights strong familial concordance raising the question of how branches or discordance might occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many studies have shown that T-cell fate is influenced by extrinsic signals30,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative contribution of for example, ligands found on an antigen presenting cell (APC) fostering an asymmetry in an early division14,33, or variation in exposure to APC and different antigen experiences as the cells divide will also percolate through to branching changes in family responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on where alternative signals are experienced, whole families with alternative branching could be created.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our assay is well suited to investigate the contribution of controlled delivery of extrinsic systems especially where direct filming would be technically difficult, as is the case when stimulation is provided by antigen presenting cells or a stromal cell source is necessary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For T cells, DD is sensitive to costimulatory and cytokine signals, and our multiplex dye method allowed us to assess the manner of signal addition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do so we developed a new mathematical framework to study the addition, or concatenation, of family trees, as well as developing a novel statistical test to challenge the hypothesis of independent signal integration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Application of these techniques established that the clonal level effects on generation number of summation of T-cell stimuli are consistent with them being stochastic and independent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the simplicity of our system, this conclusion allowed us to trace the source of the stochastic heterogeneity in DD to differences in programming of the initial naive cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These findings turned our attention to identifying cellular features and molecular determinants that might account for the differences in DD imprinting in each founder cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here the results for CD28 were informative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OT-I/Bcl2l11/ CD8+ T cells express a broad log-normally distributed range of CD28 on the identical population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This variation has significant consequences as the expansion achieved corresponds to the strength of signal integrated and the resulting DD of the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cytokine IL-2 is an important contributor to T-cell responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our culture system eliminated autocrine IL-2 contributions that would likely serve to increase the variation in each family tree as local concentrations develop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our analysis of the receptor indicated a broad distribution following this high affinity stimulation level, but receptor numbers were not limiting for the transmission of the IL-2 signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Published studies show that weaker stimulation leads to lesser expression of the receptor11,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For sufficiently weak stimulation, we expect a point will be reached where the IL-2 produced and the receptor level expressed promote variation in DD among similar cells due to changes in local conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examining this possibility requires further in vitro studies, followed by in vivo experiments to determine its functional significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Many additional receptors transmit signals that influence the final extent of expansion and division progression including CD27, IL12, IL-4, IL-2 and IL-6 (refs 9, 10, 34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Independent stochastic expression of receptor numbers for each of these ligands would result in a multifactorial complex population, where the experience and fate of every cell would be different even when placed in identical stimulation conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the stochastic drivers of receptor heterogeneity are reproducible, we speculate that the inherent variegation of the initial population, and the mix of different fate allocations, will prove to be consistent and robust.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combinatorial differences in DD fate would result from them and, as differentiation to effector states and memory states has been linked to division progression36,37, this in turn would impact the genesis of different cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What, if any, direct influence that these receptor levels have on differentiation programmes warrants further investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A combination of the multiplex assay for division tracing described with index sorting would suffice for that purpose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our discovery of striking concordance in a controlled in vitro setting raises the question, how much of the CD8+ T-cell response during an in vivo infection is driven by an automatous response with multiple concordant family outcomes, and how much is directed by extrinsic influences?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although at this point no direct in vivo observations exist to resolve this question we can interrogate the features of existing clonal and population in vivo data to test whether it would be consistent with the strongly concordant, inherited DD we have observed in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By assuming a family-based DD, our previous in vivo population experiments allowed estimation of the generations in which families reached DD9 from which we determined the relative contribution of clonal families to the response magnitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing this to findings from published in vivo clonal studies2,3 we found a quantitatively similar pattern, with a small number of clones generating the bulk of the responding cells (Supplementary Fig 10a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the family sizes from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 we could also estimate the DD distribution and found the inter-clonal DD was spread over 1015 generations, consistent with model fitting to population response data (Supplementary Fig 10b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in vivo findings are consistent with a clonally regulated DD, though further studies more directly measuring division fate as well as monitoring simultaneous differentiation changes to effector and memory states associated with clonal cell division are required to complete and formally test our understanding of clonal fate regulation under these complex conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Taken together these findings provide fundamental insight into T-cell fate regulation at the level of the individual clone, and we anticipate they will help lead to predictive models of clonal cell fate regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the growing importance of anti-cancer therapies that expand and reinvigorate highly clonal in vitro and in vivo T-cell responses38,39, this better understanding of the fundamental nature and source of the variation in burst-size will facilitate rational optimization of T-cell response manipulation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
