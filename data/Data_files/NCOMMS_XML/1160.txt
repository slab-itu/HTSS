SRSF1-dependent nuclear export inhibition of C9ORF72 repeat transcripts prevents neurodegeneration and associated motor deficits  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Hexanucleotide repeat expansions in the C9ORF72 gene are the commonest known genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of repeat transcripts and dipeptide repeat proteins trigger multiple mechanisms of neurotoxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How repeat transcripts get exported from the nucleus is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that depletion of the nuclear export adaptor SRSF1 prevents neurodegeneration and locomotor deficits in a Drosophila model of C9ORF72-related disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This intervention suppresses cell death of patient-derived motor neuron and astrocytic-mediated neurotoxicity in co-culture assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further demonstrate that either depleting SRSF1 or preventing its interaction with NXF1 specifically inhibits the nuclear export of pathological C9ORF72 transcripts, the production of dipeptide-repeat proteins and alleviates neurotoxicity in Drosophila, patient-derived neurons and neuronal cell models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, we show that repeat RNA-sequestration of SRSF1 triggers the NXF1-dependent nuclear export of C9ORF72 transcripts retaining expanded hexanucleotide repeats and reveal a novel promising therapeutic target for neuroprotection.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are fatal adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases, which respectively cause progressive death of motor neurons with escalating failure of the neuromuscular system and characteristic alterations of cognitive function and personality features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neuroprotective treatment options are currently extremely limited and the anti-glutamatergic agent riluzole prolongs survival in ALS patients by only approximately 3 months.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most commonly identified genetic cause of ALS and FTD involves polymorphic repeat expansions, composed of hundreds to thousands of the GGGGCC hexanucleotide-repeat sequence (hereafter abbreviated G4C2) in the first intron of the C9ORF72 gene, with autosomal dominant inheritance and incomplete penetrance1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The repeat DNA sequences are bi-directionally transcribed leading to the characteristic formation of G4C2-sense and C4G2-antisense RNA foci both in ALS and FTD cases5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression levels and splicing of transcripts involved in multiple cellular pathways are affected in ALS models and human post-mortem tissues leading to dysregulation of RNA metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, apoptosis, altered mechanisms of autophagy, protein clearance, axonal transport and motor neuron-astrocyte cross-talk (for reviews, see references1,3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, widespread alterations of alternative splicing ( greater than 8,000) and alternative polyadenylation site usage ( greater than 1,000) were recently identified in biosamples of cerebellum from C9ORF72-ALS patients5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have also reported that alteration of splicing consistency correlates with faster disease progression in C9ORF72-ALS cases independently of the DNA repeat expansion length7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The pathophysiology mediated by C9ORF72 repeat expansions potentially involves three extensively-studied mechanisms which may all contribute to neuronal injury and disease progression: (i) RNA toxic gain-of-function by sequestration of RNA-binding factors8,9,10,11,12; (ii) protein toxic gain-of-function due to repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation that occurs in all sense and antisense reading frames to produce five dipeptide-repeat proteins (DPRs)6,13,14,15,16; (iii) haploinsufficiency due to decreased expression of the C9ORF72 protein2,17,18 which has recently been shown to play a key role in the Rab GTPase-dependent regulation of autophagy19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We refer to references22,23,24,25,26 for recent reviews on the mechanisms of C9ORF72-mediated neurotoxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The splicing of the first intron of C9ORF72 does not appear to be affected by the presence of the hexanucleotide repeat expansions as the proportion of unspliced transcripts measured by the exon1intron1 junction remains similar in control and patient-derived neurons or post-mortem brain tissues27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A small proportion of C9ORF72 repeat transcripts retaining pathological repeat expansions in intron-1 escape nuclear retention mechanisms and were detected in the cytoplasm of patient-derived lymphoblasts28 where they can subsequently be translated into DPRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, nucleocytoplasmic transport defects of proteins and RNA were recently highlighted in Drosophila, yeast and human neuronal models of C9ORF72-related ALS29,30,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, a loss-of-function screen in Drosophila identified ALYREF (Aly/REF export factor) and NXF1 (nuclear export factor 1), two components of the mRNA nuclear export machinery, as modifiers of the neurotoxicity mediated by C9ORF72 repeat expansions30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mechanism(s) driving the specific nuclear export of pathological intron-retaining C9ORF72 repeat transcripts remain to be elucidated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We and others have reported direct binding and sequestration of the nuclear export adaptor proteins ALYREF33 and SRSF1 (serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1)34 onto G4C2-repeat transcripts11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our previous research showed that nuclear export adaptors, which directly interact with RNA and the nuclear export receptor NXF1, remodel NXF1 in an open conformation in concert with subunits of the TREX (Transcription-Export) complex to increase its affinity for mature mRNAs and trigger the process of mRNA nuclear export35,36,37,38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remodelling of NXF1 offers a control mechanism to retain unprocessed transcripts in the nucleus37,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdowns of ALYREF in Caenorhabditis elegans41 and Drosophila melanogaster42 are dispensable to the global nuclear export of mRNA and development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, only a partial block of nuclear export is induced upon ALYREF depletion in human cells43, suggesting the existence of other proteins with redundant export function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, multiple conserved human nuclear export adaptors were found to interact with the RNA-binding domain of NXF1 (refs 34, 37, 44, 45) and can simultaneously interact with the same mRNA molecules44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study further showed that whilst each of the seven SR-rich splicing factors SRSF1-7 bind thousands of transcripts, the nuclear export of only a small proportion of transcripts ( less_than 0.52% mRNAs) is affected upon individual knockdown of the SRSF1-7 proteins, clearly highlighting redundancy and/or cooperation in the NXF1-dependent nuclear export adaptor function46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We refer to references47,48 for recent reviews on TREX and the nuclear export of mRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we hypothesized that: (i) Excessive binding of nuclear export adaptor(s) onto C9ORF72 repeat transcripts might force interactions with NXF1 and override the nuclear retention mechanisms; (ii) depletion of sequestered export factors that may inappropriately license the nuclear export of intron-retaining repeat transcripts might in turn confer neuroprotection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used an established Drosophila model of C9ORF72-related disease which exhibits both neurodegeneration and locomotor deficits16 to identify potential nuclear export adaptor(s) involved in the nuclear export of C9ORF72 repeat transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also used a combination of neuronal N2A cells and ALS patient-derived neurons and astrocytes to validate our in vivo findings and dissect the molecular mechanisms driving the nuclear export of repeat transcripts and their associated neurotoxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we demonstrate that sequestration of SRSF1 onto C9ORF72 repeat transcripts triggers their NXF1-related nuclear export independently of splicing which leads to the subsequent RAN translation of neurotoxic levels of DPRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we show that the partial depletion of SRSF1 does not alter expression level, intron-1 splicing or nuclear export of the wild-type C9ORF72 transcripts while it specifically prevents C9ORF72-mediated neurodegeneration and in vivo associated motor deficits.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Microsatellite expansions of 36 nucleotides in coding and non-coding regions of genes cause neurodegeneration through complex mechanisms involving protein loss-of-function and protein/RNA toxic gain-of-function mechanisms57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The production of toxic polymeric repeat proteins by RAN translation has now been characterized in multiple neurodegenerative disorders caused by microsatellite expansions including spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8)58, myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1)58, Fragile X-associated tremor and ataxia syndrome (FXTAS)59, C9ORF72-ALS6,13,14,15,16,27 and Huntington disease (HD)60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mechanisms involved in the nuclear export of these disease-related repeat transcripts are currently unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We previously suggested that the sequestration of nuclear export adaptors onto C9ORF72 repeat transcripts might trigger the abnormal nuclear export of C9ORF72 repeat transcripts and the subsequent RAN translation of DPRs in the cytoplasm12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we identified for the first time the molecular mechanism driving the nuclear export of pathological C9ORF72 repeat transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigated whether the partial depletion of two evolutionarily conserved nuclear export adaptors which avidly interact with the hexanucleotide repeat transcripts12, ALYREF and SRSF1, would mitigate DPR-mediated neurotoxicity in an established Drosophila model of C9ORF72-ALS16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discovered that the partial depletion of SRSF1 prevents in vivo neurodegeneration and suppresses the associated locomotor deficits while the depletion of ALYREF only had marginal effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The depletion of SRSF1 in C9ORF72-ALS patient-derived motor neurons also conferred neuroprotection of motor neurons in co-culture with C9ORF72-ALS astrocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we also showed that this intervention does not affect the morphology or the growth of control and C9ORF72-ALS patient-derived motor neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the depletion of SRSF1 in patient-derived C9ORF72-ALS astrocytes significantly suppressed motor neuron death in a co-culture system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanisms for suppression of astrocyte-mediated neurotoxicity remain however to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They might involve a modification of the RNA or protein composition in the extra-cellular exosomes released by astrocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using neuronal N2A cells, we demonstrated that the nuclear export of C9ORF72 repeat transcripts and subsequent RAN translation depends on the interaction of SRSF1 with the nuclear export receptor NXF1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depleting SRSF1 or inhibiting its endogenous RNA-repeat sequestration and interaction with NXF1 lead to a marked inhibition of the nuclear export of C9ORF72 repeat transcripts and RAN translation of sense and antisense DPRs to prevent C9ORF72 repeat-mediated neurotoxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also showed that the SRSF1-dependent inhibition of the nuclear export of C9ORF72 repeat transcripts leads to altered production of DPRs in Drosophila and patient-derived motor neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We noted some variability in the efficiency of the SRSF1 depletion in patient-derived motor neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might be due to variation between expression levels of DPRs and/or genetic background of patients-derived cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the depletion of SRSF1 in control or C9ORF72-ALS patient-derived neurons does not affect the expression levels or the nuclear export of intron-1-spliced transcripts required for the translation of the wild-type C9ORF72 protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This also indicates that the nuclear export of non-repeat C9ORF72 transcripts does not depend on the nuclear export adaptor SRSF1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In sharp contrast to control neurons, the presence of the hexanucleotide repeat expansion in intron-1 of C9ORF72 transcripts led to SRSF1-dependent mRNA nuclear export, while depletion of SRSF1 specifically inhibits the nuclear export but not the levels or splicing of C9ORF72 transcripts retaining expanded hexanucleotide repeats in intron-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking these data together, we show that sequestration of SRSF1 onto C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeats is able to license the NXF1-dependent nuclear export of pathological C9ORF72 repeat transcripts without functional coupling of the nuclear export process to pre-mRNA splicing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This explains in turn why the depletion of SRSF1 has no effect on the level, intron-1-splicing or nuclear export of wild-type C9ORF72 transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we have elucidated for the first time the molecular mechanism driving the nuclear export of pathological C9ORF72 repeat transcripts which allows for RAN translation of dipeptide repeat proteins in the cytoplasm (Fig 9a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The depletion of SRSF1 specifically inhibits the nuclear export of the pathologically expanded C9ORF72 transcripts without interfering with biogenesis/processing of the wild-type C9ORF72 transcripts (Fig 9b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression of the engineered SRSF1-m4 protein, which retains specific ability to be sequestered on repeat transcripts but fails to effectively interact with NXF1, also inhibits the nuclear export of repeat transcripts and the production of DPRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 9c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both these interventions represent promising prospects for the development of an effective neuroprotective strategy in C9ORF72-related ALS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effects of antagonizing SRSF1 in the vertebrate brain remain to be elucidated in wild-type mice as well as in murine C9ORF72-ALS models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, it was recently shown that whilst SRSF1 directly binds thousands of transcripts, the depletion of SRSF1 in isolation affects the nuclear export of only 225 transcripts ( less_than 1% transcribed coding genes) due to the presence of 6 additional SRSF factors (SRSF2-7) which act as redundant NXF1-dependent nuclear export adaptors46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cellular pathways causing C9ORF72 repeat-mediated neurodegeneration and the precise mechanism(s) of neuroprotection conferred by the targeting of SRSF1 remain to be elucidated in future studies.

antisense C9ORF72 transcripts retaining expanded hexanucleotide repeats in intron1 specifically depend on the sequestration of SRSF1 and its interaction with the nuclear export receptor NXF1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the nuclear export of intron1-spliced C9ORF72 transcripts required for the production of the C9ORF72 protein does not involve the interaction of SRSF1 with NXF1 however the nuclear export adaptor(s) (NEA) remain to be identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) The depletion of SRSF1 specifically inhibits the nuclear export of C9ORF72 transcripts retaining expanded hexanucleotide repeats in intron1, likely due to a reduction in the sequestration of endogenous SRSF1 onto the C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeats and failure to abnormally remodel NXF1 in a high RNA-binding mode, while it does not affect the expression levels and splicing/retention of intron1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the depletion of SRSF1 does not affect the expression levels, the splicing of intron1 or the nuclear export of wild-type intron1-spliced C9ORF72 transcripts required for the production of the C9ORF72 protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Over-expression of the SRSF1-m4 protein, which fails to interact efficiently with NXF1, competes endogenous SRSF1 for sequestration onto hexanucleotide repeats preventing in turn interactions with NXF1 and nuclear export of C9ORF72 repeat transcripts.Full size image', 'Inhibiting the nuclear export of repeat transcripts might also confer neuroprotection in other microsatellite expansion disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it will remain essential to determine pathophysiological contributions between polymeric repeat protein production and RNA-mediated toxicity by nuclear retention of transcripts and/or sequestration of RNA-processing factors on repeat transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While expression of repeat proteins can kill cells in vitro, it is difficult to evaluate the levels of RAN-translation in patients and the thresholds required for triggering neurotoxicity which will differ depending on the nature of the repeat expansions, the disease in question and the cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is however growing evidence for a pathogenic role of RAN-translation and the data presented here fully support this.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, FXTAS was initially thought to be caused by intranuclear retention of transcripts and sequestration of splicing factors61,62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the discovery of RAN translation in the same model challenged this view59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, in C9ORF72-ALS, a 10-fold increase in the number of intranuclear RNA foci does not significantly alter survival or global RNA processing, while expression of DPRs caused neurodegeneration27 in full agreement with the data presented here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Partial depletion of individual nuclear export adaptors does not appear to be detrimental to the functioning of higher eukaryotic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, they might constitute viable therapeutic targets for inhibiting the nuclear export of repeat transcripts and the production of toxic repeat proteins, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases where RAN-translation appears to have a prominent pathological role.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
