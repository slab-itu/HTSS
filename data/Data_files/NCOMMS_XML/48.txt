Critical role for syndecan-4 in dendritic cell migration during development of allergic airway inflammation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Asthma is an inappropriate T-helper 2 (Th2) cell-mediated immune response to harmless allergens and is characterized by airway inflammation, airway hyperreactivity (AHR) and increased serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initiation of a Th2-skewed immune response is dependent on signals delivered by dendritic cells (DCs), which capture and process the antigen, migrate to lymphoid organs and activate naive CD4 T cells via the T-cell receptor and accessory molecules2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interaction of accessory molecules, in particular of T-cell costimulatory receptors with their ligands on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as DCs, is required for optimal T-cell activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has also been reported that accessory molecules initially described as adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) or syndecans (SDCs) may be involved in costimulatory signalling3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SDCs are transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans interacting with growth factors and cytokines and a variety of extracellular matrix molecules via their heparan sulfate chains5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While SDC4 is ubiquitously expressed at low levels, an activation-dependent upregulation of SDC4 has been reported for macrophages, DCs and CD4+ T cells6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SDC4 expression is often involved in migration and adhesion of various cells including DCs9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous animal studies have shown a pivotal role for SDC4 in protecting against kidney injury12, limiting endotoxin shock7 and promoting wound healing13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, an inhibition of SDC4 by a specific antibody protected mice from cartilage damage in a murine model of osteoarthritis14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the depletion of SDC4+ T cells markedly suppressed contact hypersensitivity (CHS) responses in hapten-sensitized mice4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since SDC4 participates in DC migration11 and acts as an accessory molecule during T-cell activation4, the aim of the current study was to examine an involvement of SDC4 in the development of a Th2-driven allergic immune response using SDC4-deficient mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we blocked SDC4 signalling in antigen-sensitized mice by a specific anti-SDC4 antibody not only during priming but also after an asthma-like phenotype was already established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The findings reported here clearly demonstrate a role of SDC4 in the development of allergic asthma and indicate that this molecule might be a therapeutic target for the treatment of allergic inflammatory diseases.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Loss of SDC4 signalling leads to reduced allergic asthma', 'First, the role of SDC4 in allergic asthma was investigated by comparing SDC4/ versus wild-type (WT) mice in a murine asthma model15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histological analysis of haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained lung sections showed less inflammatory infiltrates in the airways of OVA-immunized SDC4/ mice compared with WT animals (Fig 1a) and was confirmed by an investigator-independent software based on morphometric image analysis of lung sections (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the total cell number in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid revealed a significantly decreased number of eosinophilic granulocytes in OVA-immunized SDC4/ mice compared with WT animals (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the allergen-specific IgE serum levels in OVA-immunized mice were significantly lower in SDC4/ mice (Fig 1d), as well as IgG1 serum levels were reduced (IgG1 titer;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Recent findings about the role of SDC4 in DC motility and during activated T-cell-driven diseases raised the question whether SDC4 is involved in the development of an allergic immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using SDC4/ mice and an antibody that inhibits SDC4 signalling, we could demonstrate in our established murine asthma model that absence or blocking of SDC4 signalling before the first antigen sensitization significantly reduced eosinophilic airway inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, SDC4 signalling was critical for AHR development and IgE production in both, OVA-sensitized SDC4/ and anti-SDC4 Ab-treated mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we observed a SDC4-dependent reduction of Th2 cytokine levels in mediastinal lymph nodes but not in OVA-restimulated splenocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest a more localized effect of SDC4, for example, by a reduced number of APCs within the inflamed tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown before that modulation of an asthma phenotype may result in reduced cytokine production in local lymph nodes or lung, whereas the systemic cytokine response remained unchanged23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference between the remarkably reduced inflammation/lung resistance and the moderately decreased Th2 cytokine levels in lymph nodes after anti-SDC4 Ab application might be due to the fact that, at the time of killing the Ab-mediated reduction of Th2 cell activity in the lymph nodes is already decreased, while the effect on lung inflammation and lung function persisted longer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Application of anti-SDC4 Ab shortly before killing led to a comparable decrease in lung inflammation and Th2 cytokine production in lymph nodes as shown in the therapeutic approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the decreased activation of T cells in the airways might also lead to the observed diminished IgE levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the data clearly indicate a crucial role for SDC4 in the development of an allergic asthma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In contrast, the family member SDC1 seems to attenuate allergic lung inflammation as SDC1/ mice exhibited an exaggerated airway inflammation in a previous study25, whereas no information is known about an involvement of SDC2 or SDC3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The initiation of an allergic immune response is dependent on signals delivered from APCs, which capture and process the antigen and migrate to lymphoid organs to present the antigen to naive CD4 T cells2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since most antigen transport into the lung is DC mediated18, we compared WT DCs with DCs lacking SDC4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a diminished number of CD11c+ OVA-Alexa 647+ CFDA+ cells in the mediastinal lymph nodes after adoptive transfer of DCs derived from the bone marrow from SDC4/ into WT recipients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The impaired migration of DCs and the missing antigen transport could be one reason for the observed reduced asthma development in SDC4/ mice, as the limited number of antigen-loaded DCs might result in a decreased T-cell activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, inhibition of the accumulation of antigen-presenting DCs in the draining lymph nodes has previously been shown to reduce allergic airway inflammation26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the expression of SDC4 on DCs seems to be crucial for migration since OVA-pulsed WT DCs did migrate to the mediastinal lymph nodes in SDC4/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An essential role for directional migration of DCs from the peripheral tissue to the draining lymph nodes was described for the chemokine receptor CCR7 and its ligands CCL19 and CCL21 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the expression of costimulatory molecules such as CD80 or CD86 and adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 or CD11b were comparable in WT and SDC4/ mice, we found that a disturbed SDC4 signalling resulted in a diminished CCR7 expression on DCs and in a reduced directional DC migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, we and others have demonstrated that some chemokines, for example, CCL21, can bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycans that may lead to changes in the sensitivity to the chemokine28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of SDC4 on DCs may interfere with this chemokine sequestration and might explain the impaired migration of SDC4-deficient DCs to the draining lymph nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, it has been described that in fibroblasts lacking SDC4, migration is perturbed due to a constitutive activation of Rac and subsequent unspecific adhesion to fibronectin30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is of note that Rho and Rac also control the organization of DCs cytoskeleton and their capacity to migrate and activate T cells31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A refractive activation of small RhoGTPases following CCL21 stimulation in mature SDC4/ DCs might hint to a defective CCR7 signal transduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To study whether SDC4 may also be qualified as a target for therapeutic interventions, we induced an asthma phenotype first and treated mice with an anti-SDC4 antibody thereafter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This antibody inhibits SDC4 multimerization and SDC4 signalling14 but will not necessarily affect the expression of the molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we observed not only a decreased asthma phenotype after anti-SDC4 treatment, but also the effect on OVA-specific IgE serum levels and Th2 cytokine production was even more distinct in this therapeutic approach than SDC4 inhibition prior to antigen sensitization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be due to a different response to the inhibition of SDC4 function related to the time of application considering steady-state DCs versus recruited DCs migrating into already inflamed lung tissue33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, this might also indicate a role of SDC4 for the function of other cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, activation-dependent upregulation of SDC4 was found in both, DCs and T cells6,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown that depletion of SDC4+ T cells suppressed CHS, an activated T-cell-driven disease4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These SDC4+ cells were mainly effector memory T cells comparable to the lung CD4+SDC4+ T cells we detected in our asthma model, although SDC4 expression is not limited to Th2 cells but detectable on all activated T cells (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further found a reduced CD4+ T-cell proliferation and Th2 cytokine production in antigen-stimulated cell cultures using isolated CD4+ T cells from mediastinal lymph nodes of anti-SDC4-treated BALB/c mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these effects were not caused by a suppression of effector T-cell function through a primary interaction of the antibody with T cells, but were rather a result of the disturbed DC migration leading to a reduced number of activated antigen-specific T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the CHS suppression by SDC4+ T-cell depletion4, in our study the anti-SCD4 Ab did neither deplete SDC4+ T cells nor DCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we could not detect any direct effects of anti-SDC4 Ab on T-cell proliferation or cytokine production after OVA stimulation of DCs co-cultured with T cells containing a transgenic receptor to recognize OVA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there might be a microenvironment effect in vivo, which we did not address with our current approach, for example, suboptimal T-cell activation conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the role of T cells cannot be excluded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'SDC4 is not only expressed on DCs and T cells but also on other cell types, for example, B cells or eosinophils9,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas a large fraction of B cells in the mediastinal lymph nodes express SDC4 in our asthma model (Fig 7a), there was only a very small number of eosinophils in the lung that express SDC4 ( less_than 4%, Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although anti-SDC Ab treatment had neither a direct effect on B-cell activation nor on antibody production, we found a reduced CCL19-directed migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to which extent this decreased B-cell migration into the lymph nodes might contribute to our observed anti-SDC4 Ab effect is not clear yet and has to be further elucidated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we cannot exclude that other cell types might be mediating the asthma-reducing effects of SDC4 blockade because of the ubiquitously expression pattern of this molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, our results suggest that the primary mode of action of the impaired SDC4 signalling leading to a reduced asthma phenotype is the disturbed DC migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This applies also for the anti-SDC4 effect during an ongoing immune response, since it is known that DCs play a crucial role in both the initiation and maintenance of allergic airway inflammation34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Antigen-loaded APCs seem to be an interesting target for a treatment against allergic immune responses, because they control both the inflammatory and the allergen-specific humoral response35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, inhibition at an early stage of the immune cascade would also suppress the development of memory T and B cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the use of antibodies such as anti-SDC4 to modulate the allergic immune response should require a number of rigorous criteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The target molecule should be cell specific, expressed at best only in the induction and effector phases of the allergic immune response and in a defined window35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, SDC4 appears not to be an optimal target since it is ubiquitously expressed6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A systemic continuous suppression of SDC4 will likely negatively affect other SDC4-mediated physiological effects with potentially severe undesired consequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the antibody used inhibits only SDC4 signalling; other functions such as cytokine sequestration
