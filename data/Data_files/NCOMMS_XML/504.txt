Novel gene function revealed by mouse mutagenesis screens for models of age-related disease  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Determining the genetic bases of age-related disease remains a major challenge requiring a spectrum of approaches from human and clinical genetics to the utilization of model organism studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report a large-scale genetic screen in mice employing a phenotype-driven discovery platform to identify mutations resulting in age-related disease, both late-onset and progressive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have utilized N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis to generate pedigrees of mutagenized mice that were subject to recurrent screens for mutant phenotypes as the mice aged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, we identify 105 distinct mutant lines from 157 pedigrees analysed, out of which 27 are late-onset phenotypes across a range of physiological systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using whole-genome sequencing we uncover the underlying genes for 44 of these mutant phenotypes, including 12 late-onset phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These genes reveal a number of novel pathways involved with age-related disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We illustrate our findings by the recovery and characterization of a novel mouse model of age-related hearing loss.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The increasing incidence and burden of diseases of ageing highlights the need to identify the genetic determinants of age-related disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A wide variety of diseases are associated with ageing including neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, cancer, kidney disease and cardiovascular disease (reviewed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the genetic basis for many of these diseases remains poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A proven methodology to identify novel genes and pathways associated with disease, which has been employed successfully across a wide range of physiological systems, is N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) -based phenotype-driven screening2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The principle involves inducing random point mutations throughout the murine genome with ENU and then screening offspring for phenotypes of interest4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mapping and subsequent candidate gene, or more recently whole genome5,6, sequencing then uncovers the causative mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phenotype-driven screens have been successful in identifying novel genes and alleles across a wide range of phenotypic areas4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some cases an additional challenge is required to reveal a phenotype, whereby the effect of the challenge and underlying mutation combine to result in a phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The success of this strategy is exemplified by gene function revealed by immunological challenges7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Age is an important challenge for incorporation in phenotype-driven screens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many factors combine to contribute to an ageing physiology, including mitochondrial dysfunction9 and cellular senescence10, which may interact with genetic variants to result in age-related phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe our initial findings from a screen designed to reveal mutations that result in age-related disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have adopted a phenotype-driven, forward genetic approach utilizing ENU mutagenesis accompanied by recurrent phenotype screens of aged mutant mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has allowed us to identify phenotypes occurring late in life resulting from specific ENU-induced mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such mutants identify genes and pathways that contribute to age-related disease and allows us to characterize the interactions of these pathways with an ageing physiology that result specifically in an age-related phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that this is a successful approach for identifying mouse mutants with late-onset phenotypes, and importantly find that these mutant models reveal a significant number of novel genes and pathways involved with such diseases.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Pedigree production', 'We established a large-scale mouse screen for recessive mutations causing age-related disease incorporating an ENU mutagenesis4 and phenotype-driven approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We screened G3 mice in large pedigrees of up to 100 mice4 (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, male C57BL/6J mice were mutagenized with ENU and mated to C3H.Pde6b+ mice11 to generate G1 founder males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  G1 males were subsequently bred to C3H.Pde6b+ mice to generate G2 offspring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, large G3 pedigrees of at around 100 individuals were produced by two rounds of mating of the founder G1 male to 8 G2 female offspring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large pedigrees ensured sufficient homozygous G3 individuals were available to map a phenotype directly from the G3 cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each G3 pedigree was generated as two cohorts, 23 months apart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Across an entire G3 pedigree comprising some 100 mice, we might expect to identify on average 12 affected individuals homozygous for an individual recessive mutation inherited from the G1 founder male.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mixed genetic background assisted the mapping of mutations underlying the affected individuals identified in the G3 pedigrees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Wild-type C3H strains exhibit retinal degeneration, due to a recessive mutation in the Pde6b gene (Pde6brd1), and hence we employed the line, C3H.Pde6b+ (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11), congenic for the BALB/c region encompassing Pde6b and which does not exhibit retinal degeneration enabling screening for visual abnormalities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C57BL/6J also carries a recessive mutation in the Cdh23 gene resulting in age-related hearing loss (Cdh23ahl) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, in our protocol G2 female mice were genotyped for the Cdh23ahl allele and only offspring from G2 females wild-type for Cdh23 were used for auditory assessment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Phenotyping pipeline and mutant detection', 'We developed and implemented a high-throughput phenotyping pipeline to examine the G3 mice generated in the ageing screen (Table 1 and summarized in Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This incorporated many of the established standard operating procedures that have been utilized in the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC, www.impc.org) phenotyping pipeline13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IMPC has implemented IMPReSS (www.mousephenotype.org/impress), a database of standardized phenotyping pipelines that encompasses a large number of disease systems and ensures data reproducibility and integrity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The design of the pipeline considered carefully the timing and order of the phenotyping tests to ensure that we minimized the impact of individual tests on other phenotype outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each G3 pedigree the production of dual cohorts provided an opportunity to explore in more detail phenotypes detected in the first cohort and to add complementary phenotype tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scale of the screen precluded a complete pathological examination of tissues from all G3 mice produced, but this was carried out on selected mice to assist in the confirmation or determination of a phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have analysed 157 pedigrees to date, out of which 134 are complete and 23 are currently active (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average pedigree size was 102 mice and a total of 13,601 G3 animals have been generated and phenotyped from the 157 pedigrees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 The Harwell Ageing screen phenotyping pipeline.Full size table', 'Table 2 Summary of output from the ENU screen including number of pedigrees analysed along with mutant discovery and mutations cloned.Full size table', 'Phenotype detection and MouseBook', 'We devised a high-throughput automated phenotype-detection strategy, alongside a resource to visualize the phenotyping data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We defined a mutant line as one where multiple affected G3 mice (3) in a pedigree display very similar phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All raw data from the phenotyping platforms was initially captured into local laboratory information management systems according to the data standards defined in the IMPReSS database.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following quality control procedures, a step-wise strategy was devised to detect outliers from temporal data in ENU pedigrees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, we used a reference range approach that established percentile values for the entire data set that provides high and low critical values, approximately equating to Â±2 s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parameter values outside of these critical values for three or more animals in a pedigree led to a phenodeviancy call.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, phenodeviant mice were annotated with the appropriate phenotype (MP term) as specified by IMPReSS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All raw data and automatically annotated phenotype data are available via the publically accessible data portal MouseBook (http://www.mousebook.org/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To assess the false positive rate (FPR) of the reference range method, we calculated the FPR of wild-type C57BL/6NTac animal data from the IMPC project as a test data set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IMPC uses similar phenotype procedures to the ageing project.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then modelled the ageing pedigrees by sampling random IMPC baseline animals to produce a simulated pedigree and employed the reference range method on each procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wild-type animals should not be called as outliers therefore any positive calls from the method are classed as false positive calls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using simulated pedigrees, we detected between 0.58 and 1.22% phenodeviance, suggesting a low average FPR of 0.71% across the procedures examined (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Categorical data, such as X-ray abnormalities, were scored as potential mutants when observed in multiple affected G3 mice (3) in a pedigree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also, on occasion, considered mice as phenodeviant when outliers were  less_than 2 s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  from the mean but where deviations were sustained over multiple time points or, alternatively, additional phenotyping data confirmed a phenotype was present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each putative mutant was confirmed by one or all of the following; appropriate statistical analyses of primary phenotyping data, comparison of data from other relevant phenotypic tests, inheritance testing and mapping data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mutant lines', 'In total, 105 distinct mutant lines were identified in 72 out of 157 pedigrees completed or currently undergoing analysis (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean number of affected G3 mice for each line was 6.1, with a range from 2 to 17 (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1b demonstrates the distribution of the number of mutations detected per pedigree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some pedigrees had multiple segregating mutations, which may reflect the size of the pedigrees and the inherent chance of detecting multiple affected mice for distinct genetic lesions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1:

of the pedigrees (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Visible anomalies such as coat colour variations, dysmorphologies and extreme behavioural abnormalities were often detected during initial husbandry practices early in the pipeline before scheduled screens took place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between 3 and 6 months the first round of tests uncovered a large number of additional phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, of the 105 mutant lines identified, 27 were only detected after 6 months (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mapping and mutation detection', 'Individual mutations were mapped utilizing the Illumina Medium Density SNP mapping panel, which is informative at over 900 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for the C3H.Pde6b+ and C57BL/6J strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genotypes of affected animals were compared with those of unaffected individuals from the same pedigree, generally resulting in a map location of around 20âMb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following mapping, we carried out whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of the G1 founder male, or, on occasion, an affected G3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A local database was developed to manage the WGS data from G1 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All WGS data was analysed through a standard next-generation sequencing (NGS) pipeline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MouseBook portal holds the complete range of ENU mutations identified in G1 mice (noncoding and coding mutations) and within noncoding regulatory regions (such as lincRNAs, miRNAs and promoter regions) annotated from WGS analysis pipeline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This archive includes all ENU mutations identified during NGS, including all incidental mutations that have not been associated with a phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This data set enabled rapid identification of all mutations segregating within the sequenced pedigrees and this information, combined with the map location of the phenotype, allowed us to determine the causative ENU-induced genetic lesion with high confidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For the 105 lines identified we have currently mapped 81.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WGS of 28 G1 and 8 G3 mice identified the gene lesion underlying the observed phenotype in 44 mutant lines (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For individual pedigrees that contained multiple segregating phenotypes (Fig 1b) we were able to identify several causative mutations from a single-G1 sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some obvious candidate genes are undergoing individual gene sequencing and some phenotypes were not of sufficient impact to warrant WGS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For three of the mapped mutations analysed (all early phenotypes) we failed to uncover a coding lesion, and these may represent functional changes in noncoding DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One coding lesion was identified as an intracisternal A-particle insertion that appears to have occurred spontaneously on the C3H.Pde6b+ background pedigree MPC-59, disrupting the Mcr1 gene and resulting in a yellow coat colour (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Out of the 27 ageing phenotypes, 23 have been mapped and for 12 late-onset mutant lines we have identified and confirmed the underlying mutation (Table 3).

high-level ontological analysis of the distribution of phenotypes across disease areas investigated by our phenotyping pipeline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total number of phenotypes observed across different phenotypic areas is shown in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where a single line exhibited more than one phenotype resulting from the pleiotropic effects of the underlying mutation we have listed all the phenotypes detected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the majority of phenotypic areas we have identified late-onset phenotypes, but for some categories we have uncovered no late-onset models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, dysmorphology mutants are overt abnormalities normally associated with developmental defects, and hence are unlikely to develop late in life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: The distribution of early and late phenotypes across a variety of disease and biological categories.A histogram of the distribution of early and late phenotypes across different phenotypic categories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Late phenotypes are defined as those phenotypes where affected mice were identified at 7 months or later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that we catalogue the number of individual phenotypes in each disease or biological category, and that individual mutant lines may demonstrate multiple phenotypes.Full size image', 'Table 3 summarizes the genes that have been identified for late-onset phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each case, we have either uncovered a gene for which there was no prior functional information, or alternatively, we have assigned novel functionality to a gene with known functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these mutants there is only a single medium or high-confidence coding mutation in the minimal mapping region and for laminin alpha 5 (Lama5) and tryptophanyl tRNA synthetase 2, mitochondrial (Wars2) (pedigrees MPC-205 and MPC-151, respectively) we have carried out complementation studies using a knockout (KO) allele to confirm these mutations as the causative allele (Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most cases, we also have identified functional alterations associated with the mutation that could account for the observed phenotype but, as these studies are ongoing, in several cases the causal link between mutation and phenotype are yet to be proven conclusively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several examples in diverse biological areas serve to illustrate this powerful discovery platform for models of age-related disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We identified a missense mutation (E884G) in the Lama5 gene that results in a progressive nephrotic syndrome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  G3 mice were identified at 6 months of age with elevated plasma urea and creatinine levels, and with reduced plasma albumin (homozygotes, n=6, versus wild-type, n=33, Urea: 32.9Â±19.9

associated with polycystic kidney disease15, but this is the first report of its involvement in a chronic renal phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent sequencing data has identified Lama5 mutations in focal segmental glomerular sclerosis patients16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this novel mutant provides supporting evidence for a role for LAMA5 in nephrotic syndromes and will enable the investigation of the pathogenic processes involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our studies also revealed a mutation in the aggrecan (Acan) gene in pedigree MPC-227, causing an A1946V substitution in the C-type-lectin domain, which results in late-onset joint deterioration and obesity, both novel phenotypic associations with this locus (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By 12 months of age mutant mice have an altered body composition with a significantly higher percentage fat mass (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the late-onset obesity, throughout life homozygous AcanA1946V mice have significantly lower absolute lean mass (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So, while metabolically obese, mutant mice are not heavier overall than littermates (Supplementary Fig 2c).

recapitulated the early-onset osteoarthritis observed in patients with mutations in this gene19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the quantitative differences in fat mass, histopathology revealed qualitative differences in fat tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adipocytes from white adipose tissue in AcanA1946V mice are enlarged and there is evidence of inflammatory cell inflammation (Supplementary Fig 2f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, the brown adipose tissue shows reduced accumulation of fat in the mutant mice (Supplementary Fig 2h,i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aggrecan expression has been identified in several cell types within adipose tissue, including preadipocytes and pericytes, and can influence adipogenesis21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Slc4a10 is a novel late-onset hearing loss gene', 'We have uncovered several novel genes associated with progressive and/or late-onset hearing loss, including solute carrier family 4, sodium bicarbonate transporter, member 10 (Slc4a10), Wars2, protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type, Q (Ptprq) and zinc finger, FYVE domain containing 26 (Zfyve26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we elaborate the phenotype and characterization of the Slc4a10 late-onset

found to have mildly elevated hearing thresholds at 9 months of age thus indicating an impaired hearing function (Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent screening of this pedigree at 12 months of age found these six mice had a further increase in their hearing thresholds suggesting a progressive phenotype (Supplementary Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After further breeding no hearing

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have established a large-scale ENU G3 recessive screen for age-related disease phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The aim has been to provide a wider understanding of the genetic pathways that contribute to disease in an ageing context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, we have demonstrated that ENU phenotype-driven screens have the capacity to uncover a significant number of phenotypes that display late-onset disease and which are caused by mutations in novel genes, hitherto not associated with known functions in age-related disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total we have examined over 150 G3 pedigrees, identifying 105 distinct mutant lines, including 27 lines with late-onset phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A significant number of pedigrees revealed multiple phenotypes in our screening pipeline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is not surprising given the large size of the pedigrees and the relatively comprehensive phenotype screens that we have undertaken.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, most importantly, we find that around one quarter of all mutant phenotypes are detectable from 7 months onwards, indicating that a significant number of mutations leading to alterations in gene function are only manifest in an ageing context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This high hit rate indicates that the ongoing analysis of further pedigrees will be a productive route for the recovery of considerable numbers of additional age-related disease loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Employing a high-level ontological analysis, it is clear that we have identified late-onset phenotypes, which span a wide disease spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We would expect that the random nature of ENU mutagenesis provides an unbiased route to the identification of late-onset disease loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data support the conclusion that this approach represents a powerful approach for revealing late-onset phenotypes in any disease domain, as much as it has already been shown to be a productive approach for the identification of early-onset phenotypes3,4,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have employed WGS to identify the mutations underlying individual phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach revealed the sequence alteration in 44 out of 47 mutant phenotypes investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 44 mutations identified comprised missense, splice site, nonsense mutations and an intracisternal A-particle insertion, in each case likely to compromise gene function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A wide range of ENU mutagenesis programmes have reported a very high frequency of coding changes, particularly missense, that underlie mutant phenotypes and our results are in agreement with these findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For three mutant phenotypes investigated there are no coding or splice-site mutations that could account for the observed phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is unclear whether or not the functional change is located in noncoding sequences, but the availability of whole-genome sequence allows us to document all the sequence variants in the mapped region and potentially to test individual variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Out of 27 late-onset phenotypes we have so far identified the underlying lesion in 12, and additional mutations remain to be confirmed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report in Table 3 the novel gene functionality that has been revealed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate the power of phenotype-driven ENU mutagenesis screens, which make no a priori assumptions about gene function or the pathways involved in disease, to uncover novelty, in this case the underlying basis of age-related disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In several cases, the identification of novel genes and pathways are likely to open up new lines of enquiry into the physiological and pathological bases of late-onset phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As an example of the novel gene function associated with ageing phenotypes, we report the characterization of the trombone late-onset hearing loss mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trombone mice display a late-onset progressive hearing loss, which is due to a loss-of-function mutation in the sodium-coupled bicarbonate transporter (NCBT), Slc4a10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before this investigation, Slc4a10 has not been reported to be associated with auditory dysfunction in the mouse or in human studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a study has shown that Slc4a10 KO mice have smaller brain ventricles and an increased threshold to experimentally induced seizures compared with wild-type animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also report that Slc4a10 is important for regulating neuronal intracellular pH and excitability, and suggest that because Slc4a10 is involved in solute transport within the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus it is likely to contribute to secretion of cerebrospinal fluid26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Slc4a7, another NCBT closely related to Slc4a10, has been linked to auditory dysfunction and retinal impairment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slc4a7 also acts to maintain intracellular pH playing a vital role in the efficient disposal of acid (H+) generated by neuronal and sensory receptor activity, which is an essential requisite of sensory transduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice lacking Slc4a7 develop auditory impairment and blindness due to degeneration of sensory receptors in the inner ear and eye, respectively27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Auditory impairment in these mice is present from one month of age, and is concomitant with loss of hair cells and morphological changes in the SV and SL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the very similar phenotype, the expression pattern of Slc4a7 is the same as Slc4a10, with expression in the type II and type V cochlear fibrocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was hypothesized that impaired ion transport by the SL fibrocytes in Slc4a7 KO mice may lead to hair cell degeneration and consequently auditory impairment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Currently very little is known regarding the pathological changes occurring within the human auditory system that result in age-related hearing loss, also known as presbycusis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, seminal work by Schuknecht has led to several pathological subtypes of presbycusis to be proposed; these include: sensory, involving hair cell loss; strial, involving degeneration of the SV and reduction in EP; and neural, involving loss of SGNs28,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hearing impairment observed in trombone mice is concomitant with a progressive loss of OHCs, but the underlying mechanism likely involves a chronically reduced EP that precedes OHC loss and hearing impairment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, our findings suggest that trombone is likely a model of strial presbycusis, and that Slc4a10 is a candidate gene for human age-related hearing loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, trombone will serve as a model to learn more about the functional requirement of bicarbonate transporters in the lateral wall and as a model to test the efficacy of gene-delivery techniques to target the cochlear lateral wall and ameliorate hearing loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Ageing screens as described here have the potential to provide models that will underpin improved preclinical studies of therapeutic interventions, particularly as the disease occurs in the context of an ageing physiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many mouse models currently used to develop therapies for age-related and chronic diseases have early-onset phenotypes that are often acute.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, potential therapies are assessed against the background of a rapid and aggressive disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, pharmacodynamics may change with ageing; for example immunosenescence will influence the effect of immunization in the aged31, while mitochondrial dysfunction can result in adverse drug reactions32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus the models of age-related disease we are identifying will not only aid our understanding of disease pathogenesis but also provide more refined preclinical models with a greater window of opportunity for therapeutic intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we have established a large-scale phenotype-driven screen for genes associated with age-related disease and successfully identified mutants resulting in such pathologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These novel mutants will not only aid our understanding of pathogenic processes occurring during ageing but act as robust preclinical models of disease.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
