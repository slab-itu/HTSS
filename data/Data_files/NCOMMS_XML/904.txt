Genetic correlation between amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and schizophrenia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have previously shown higher-than-expected rates of schizophrenia in relatives of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), suggesting an aetiological relationship between the diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we investigate the genetic relationship between ALS and schizophrenia using genome-wide association study data from over 100,000 unique individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using linkage disequilibrium score regression, we estimate the genetic correlation between ALS and schizophrenia to be 14.3% (7.0521.6; P=1 × 104) with schizophrenia polygenic risk scores explaining up to 0.12% of the variance in ALS (P=8.4 × 107).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A modest increase in comorbidity of ALS and schizophrenia is expected given these findings (odds ratio 1.081.26) but this would require very large studies to observe epidemiologically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify five potential novel ALS-associated loci using conditional false discovery rate analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that shared neurobiological mechanisms between these two disorders will engender novel hypotheses in future preclinical and clinical studies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a late-onset neurodegenerative condition characterized by progressive loss of upper and lower motor neurons, leading to death from respiratory failure in 70% of patients within 3 years of symptom onset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although ALS is often described as a primarily motor-system disease, extramotor involvement occurs in up to 50% of cases, with prominent executive and behavioural impairment, and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (FTD) in up to 14% of cases1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A neuropsychiatric prodrome has been described in some people with ALSFTD, and higher rates of schizophrenia and suicide have been reported in first and second degree relatives of those with ALS, particularly in kindreds associated with the C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These clinical and epidemiological observations suggest that ALS and schizophrenia may share heritability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'ALS and schizophrenia both have high heritability estimates (0.65 and 0.64, respectively)3,4; however the underlying genetic architectures of these heritable components appear to differ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of large genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets has implicated over 100 independent risk loci for schizophrenia5 and estimated that a substantial proportion (23%) of the variance in underlying liability for schizophrenia is due to additive polygenic risk (many risk-increasing alleles of low individual effect combining to cause disease) conferred by common genetic variants6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This proportion, the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability, is lower in ALS (8.2%), in which fewer than ten risk loci have been identified by GWAS7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, both diseases have polygenic components, but the extent to which they overlap has not been investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recently, methods to investigate overlap between polygenic traits using GWAS data have been developed8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These methods assess either pleiotropy (identical genetic variants influencing both traits) or genetic correlation (identical alleles influencing both traits).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic correlation is related to heritability; for both measures, binary traits such as ALS and schizophrenia are typically modelled as extremes of an underlying continuous scale of liability to develop the trait.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If two binary traits are genetically correlated, their liabilities covary, and this covariance is determined by both traits having identical risk alleles at overlapping risk loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies of pleiotropy and genetic correlation have provided insights into the overlapping genetics of numerous traits and disorders, although none to date has implicated shared polygenic risk between neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we apply several techniques to identify and dissect the polygenic overlap between ALS and schizophrenia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide evidence for genetic correlation between the two disorders which is unlikely to be driven by diagnostic misclassification and we demonstrate a lack of polygenic overlap between ALS and other neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions, which could be due to limited power given the smaller cohort sizes for these studies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Genetic correlation between ALS and schizophrenia', 'To investigate the polygenic overlap between ALS and schizophrenia, we used individual-level and summary data from GWAS for ALS7 (36,052 individuals) and schizophrenia5 (79,845 individuals).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At least 5,582 control individuals were common to both datasets, but for some cohorts included in the schizophrenia dataset this could not be ascertained so this number is likely to be higher.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For ALS, we used summary data from both mixed linear model association testing11 and meta-analysis of cohort-level logistic regression12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first used linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression with ALS and schizophrenia summary statistics; this technique models, for polygenic traits, a linear relationship between a SNPs LD score (the amount of genetic variation that it captures) and its GWAS test statistic13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This distinguishes confounding from polygenicity in GWAS inflation and the regression coefficient can be used to estimate the SNP-based heritability (hS2) for single traits13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the bivariate case, the regression coefficient estimates genetic covariance (g) for pairs of traits, from which genetic correlation (rg) is estimated8; these estimates are unaffected by sample overlap between traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using constrained intercept LD score regression with mixed linear model ALS summary statistics, we estimated the liability-scale SNP-based heritability of ALS to be 8.2% (95% confidence interval=7.29.1; mean 2=1.13; all ranges reported below indicate 95% confidence intervals), replicating previous estimates based on alternative methods7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Estimates based on ALS meta-analysis summary statistics and free-intercept LD score regression with mixed linear model summary statistics were lower (Supplementary Table 1), resulting in higher genetic correlation estimates (Supplementary Table 2); for this reason, we conservatively use constrained intercept genetic correlation estimates for ALS mixed linear model summary statistics throughout the remainder of this paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heritability estimates for permuted ALS data were null (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "LD score regression estimated the genetic correlation between ALS and schizophrenia to be 14.3% (7.0521.6; P=1 × 104).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results were similar for a smaller schizophrenia cohort of European ancestry (21,856 individuals)14, indicating that the inclusion of individuals of Asian ancestry in the schizophrenia cohort did not bias this result (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to schizophrenia, we estimated genetic correlation with ALS using GWAS summary statistics for bipolar disorder15, major depressive disorder16, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder17, autism spectrum disorder17, Alzheimer's disease (Supplementary Note 1)18, multiple sclerosis19 and adult height20, finding no significant genetic correlation between ALS and any secondary trait other than schizophrenia (Fig 1;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'There is evolving clinical, epidemiological and biological evidence for an association between ALS and psychotic illness, particularly schizophrenia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic evidence of overlap to date has been based primarily on individual genes showing Mendelian inheritance, in particular the C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion, which is associated with ALS and FTD, and with psychosis in relatives of ALS patients2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we have replicated SNP-based heritability estimates for ALS and schizophrenia using GWAS summary statistics, and have for the first time demonstrated significant overlap between the polygenic components of both diseases, estimating the genetic correlation to be 14.3%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have carefully controlled for confounding bias, including population stratification and shared control samples, and have shown through analysis of polygenic risk scores that the overlapping polygenic risk applies to SNPs that are modestly associated with both diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that our genetic correlation estimate relates to the polygenic components of ALS (hS2=8.2%) and schizophrenia (hS2=23%) and these estimates do not represent all heritability for both diseases, the accuracy of using schizophrenia-based PRS to predict ALS status in any patient is expected to be low (Nagelkerkes R2=0.12% for PT=0.2), although statistically significant (P=8.4 × 107).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the positive genetic correlation of 14.3% indicates that the direction of effect of risk-increasing and protective alleles is consistently aligned between ALS and schizophrenia, suggesting convergent biological mechanisms between the two diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although phenotypically heterogeneous, both ALS and schizophrenia are clinically recognizable as syndromes23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The common biological mechanisms underlying the association between the two conditions are not well understood, but are likely associated with disruption of cortical networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Schizophrenia is a polygenic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a combination of positive symptoms (hallucinations and delusions), negative symptoms (diminished motivation, blunted affect, reduction in spontaneous speech and poor social functioning) and impairment over a broad range of cognitive abilities25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ALS is a late onset complex genetic disease characterized by a predominantly motor phenotype with recently recognized extra-motor features in 50% of patients, including cognitive impairment1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been suggested that the functional effects of risk genes in schizophrenia converge by modulating synaptic plasticity, and influencing the development and stabilization of cortical microcircuitry5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, our identification of CNTN6 (contactin 6, also known as NB-3, a neural adhesion protein important in axon development)26 as a novel pleiotropy-informed ALS-associated locus supports neural network dysregulation as a potential convergent mechanism of disease in ALS and schizophrenia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'No significantly enriched biological pathway or ontological term was identified within genome-wide cFDR values using MAGENTA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low inflation in ALS GWAS statistics, coupled with a rare variant genetic architecture7, render enrichment-based biological pathway analyses with current sample sizes challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, nine further loci were associated with ALS risk at cFDR  less_than 0.01.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these, MOBP, C9orf72, TBK1, SARM1 and UNC13A have been described previously in ALS and were associated by cFDR analysis in this study owing to their strong association with ALS through GWAS7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining four loci (TNIP1, PPP2R2D, NCKAP5L and ZNF295-AS1) are novel associations and may represent pleiotropic disease loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TNIP1 encodes TNFAIP3 interacting protein 1 and is involved in autoimmunity and tissue homoeostasis27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein product of PPP2R2D is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2 and has a role in PI3K-Akt signalling and mitosis28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NCKAP5L is a homologue of NCKAP5, encoding NAP5, a proline-rich protein that has previously been implicated in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZNF295-AS1 is a noncoding RNA31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further investigation into the biological roles of these genes may yield novel insight into the pathophysiology of certain subtypes of ALS and schizophrenia, and as whole-genome and exome datasets become available in the future for appropriately large ALS casecontrol cohorts, testing for burden of rare genetic variation across these genes will be particularly instructive, especially given the role that rare variants appear to play in the pathophysiology of ALS7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our data suggest that other neuropsychiatric conditions (bipolar disorder, autism and major depression) do not share polygenic risk with ALS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding contrasts with our recent observations from family aggregation studies and may be unexpected given the extensive genetic correlation between neuropsychiatric conditions6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could relate to statistical power conferred by secondary phenotype cohort sizes, and future studies with larger sample sizes will shed further light on the relationship between ALS and neuropsychiatric disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also possible that the current study underestimates genetic correlations due to the substantial role that rare variants play in the genetic architecture of ALS7 and future fine-grained studies examining heritability and genetic correlation in low-minor allele frequency and low-LD regions may identify a broader relationship between ALS and neuropsychiatric diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A potential criticism of this study is that the polygenic overlap between ALS and schizophrenia could be driven by misdiagnosis, particularly in cases of ALSFTD, which can present in later life as a psychotic illness and could be misdiagnosed as schizophrenia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is unlikely, as strict diagnostic criteria are required for inclusion of samples in the schizophrenia GWAS dataset5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, since core schizophrenia symptoms are usually diagnosed during late adolescence, a misdiagnosis of FTD-onset ALSFTD as schizophrenia is unlikely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we found no evidence for misdiagnosis of ALS as schizophrenia (BUHMBOX P=0.94) and we estimated that a misdiagnosis of 4.86% of ALS cases would be required to spuriously observe a genetic correlation of 14.3%, which is not likely to occur in clinical practice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are therefore confident that this genetic correlation estimate reflects a genuine polygenic overlap between the two diseases and is not a feature of cohort ascertainment, but the possibility of some misdiagnosis in either cohort cannot be entirely excluded based on available data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A positive genetic correlation between ALS and schizophrenia predicts an excess of patients presenting with both diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most neurologists and psychiatrists, however, will not readily acknowledge that these conditions co-occur frequently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our genetic correlation estimate confers an odds ratio of 1.17 (1.081.26) for harbouring above-threshold liability for ALS given schizophrenia (or vice versa) and a lifetime risk of 1:34,336 for both phenotypes together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a very large incident cohort of 16,448 ALS patients (7,31066,670), with detailed phenotype information, would be required to have sufficient power to detect an excess of schizophrenia within an ALS cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coupled with reduced life expectancy in patients with schizophrenia32, this may explain the relative dearth of epidemiological studies to date providing clinical evidence of excess comorbidity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, it has also been proposed that prolonged use of antipsychotic medication may protect against developing all of the clinical features of ALS33, which would reduce the rate of observed comorbidity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering our novel evidence for a genetic relationship between ALS and schizophrenia, this underscores the intriguing possibility that therapeutic strategies for each condition may be useful in the other, and our findings provide rationale to consider the biology of ALS and schizophrenia as related in future drug development studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the glutamate-modulating ALS therapy riluzole has shown efficacy as an adjunct to risperidone, an antipsychotic medication, in reducing the negative symptoms of schizophrenia34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we have estimated the genetic correlation between ALS and schizophrenia to be 14.3% (7.0521.6), providing molecular genetic support for our epidemiological observation of psychiatric endophenotypes within ALS kindreds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, this is the first study to show genetic correlation derived from polygenic overlap between neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of both apparent monogenic C9orf72-driven overlap2 and polygenic overlap in the aetiology of ALS and schizophrenia suggests the presence of common biological processes, which may relate to disruption of cortical circuitry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As both ALS and schizophrenia are heterogeneous conditions, further genomic, biological and clinical studies are likely to yield novel insights into the pathological processes for both diseases and will provide clinical sub-stratification parameters that could drive novel drug development for both neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions.'

on these residualized schizophrenia GWAS P-values were calculated for mixed linear model association statistics calculated at 6,843,670 SNPs genotyped in 10,147 ALS cases and 22,094 controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pleiotropic genomic loci were considered statistically significant if cFDR less_than 0.01 (following Andreassen et al.9) and were clumped with all neighbouring SNPs based on LD (r2 greater than 0.1) in the complete ALS dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Associated cFDR genomic regions were then mapped to the locations of known RefSeq transcripts in human genome build GRCh37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome-wide cFDR values were also tested for enrichment in 9,711 gene sets included in the MAGENTA software package (version 2.4, July 2011) and derived from databases such as Gene Ontology (GO, http://geneontology.org/), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG, http://www.kegg.jp/), Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER, http://www.pantherdb.org/) and INGENUITY (http://www.ingenuity.com/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SNPs were mapped to genes including 20 kb up- and downstream regions to include regulatory elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enrichment cutoff applied in our analysis was based on the 95th percentile of gene scores for all genes in the genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The null distribution of gene scores for each gene set was based on 10,000 randomly sampled gene sets with equal size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MAGENTA uses a MannWhitney rank-sum test to assess gene-set enrichment39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'All data used in this study are
