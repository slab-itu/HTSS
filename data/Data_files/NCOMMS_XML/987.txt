Terahertz and mid-infrared plasmons in three-dimensional nanoporous graphene  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Two-dimensional (2D) graphene emerged as an outstanding material for plasmonic and photonic applications due to its charge-density tunability, high electron mobility, optical transparency and mechanical flexibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, novel fabrication processes have realised a three-dimensional (3D) nanoporous configuration of high-quality monolayer graphene which provides a third dimension to this material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, we investigate the optical behaviour of nanoporous graphene by means of terahertz and infrared spectroscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reveal the presence of intrinsic 2D Dirac plasmons in 3D nanoporous graphene disclosing strong plasmonic absorptions tunable from terahertz to mid-infrared via controllable doping level and porosity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the far-field the spectral width of these absorptions is large enough to cover most of the mid-Infrared fingerprint region with a single plasmon excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enhanced surface area of nanoporous structures combined with their broad band plasmon absorption could pave the way for novel and competitive nanoporous-graphene based plasmonic-sensors.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Plasmons, the collective oscillations of electrons in metals and doped semiconductors, show notable properties including a strong interaction with the electromagnetic field, reduced wavelength in comparison with that of exciting light and a huge electric field enhancement several orders of magnitude larger than the incident light field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those properties are at the basis of surface-enhanced Raman and Infrared spectroscopies which are now routinely used in many bio-sensing applications1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in looking for tunable and active devices, plasmonics has seen a major breakthrough since the discovery of graphene4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, due to the unique properties of this material, combining massless Dirac fermions, charge-density tunability, high electronic mobility, optical transparency and mechanical flexibility, graphene plasmons are a promising ingredient for smart devices, with applications across many fields, such as opto-electronics, photo-detectors and bio-sensing6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the low dimensionality of graphene induces an extreme compression of plasmons7, especially at mid-infrared (MIR) and terahertz (THz) frequencies, which allows their nanoscale confinement, as it has been theoretically predicted and further experimentally demonstrated8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With these motivations, many graphene micro- and nano-structures have been proposed and realized in the last few years, combining different shapes and sizes5,10,11, multi-layer systems, different substrates and hybrid devices, including active configurations for plasmonic control through optical12 and electrical pulses4,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recently a novel fabrication process allowed researchers to obtain a 3D nanoporous configuration of high-quality monolayer graphene13,14,15,16,17, composed by a 3D network of interconnected graphene monolayer with bicontinuous porosity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This nanoporous structure provides an extremely enhanced effective surface area and a third dimension to graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While nanoporous graphene (NPG) is object of ongoing studies to explore its applications for energy collecting electrodes14,15, high-efficiency steam generation by solar illumination16 and Li-air batteries17, very little is known about its electronic and optical properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first investigation of the optical behaviour of nanoporous graphene by means of THz and MIR spectroscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show the presence of intrinsic 2D Dirac plasmons in 3D NPG disclosing their behaviour with controllable doping level and tunable porosity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By taking into account the enhanced surface area of these nanoporous structures18 in combination with their tunable plasmons, this work paves the way for innovative graphene-based plasmonic-sensors.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Optical Measurements', 'Several samples of 3D NPG were grown by nanoporous Ni-based chemical vapour deposition (CVD) method13,19 (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The as-grown samples (showing an intrinsical n-type conductivity and an average Fermi energy EF70 meV) have a thickness spanning from 10 to 30 m and their pore size can be engineered from about 200 nm to nearly 1 m. The samples here investigated were well characterized through photoemission (PES), Raman spectroscopy, and transport measurements13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These measurements revealed that the 3D architecture of NPG preserves the 2D graphene character such as massless Dirac fermions and high electron mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A measure of the pore average size was obtained with the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Fermi energy can be further increased by doping nanoporous graphene with Nitrogen atoms (substitution of around 4% Carbon atoms), obtaining N-doped NPG (N-NPG), with values of EF up to 340 meV (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The optical transmittance T() was measured from the THz range (30 cm1) to the Near Infrared (7,000 cm1) at room-temperature with a Michelson Bruker 66v Interferometer kept under vacuum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to their micrometric thickness the samples of NPG are free-standing so they have been directly mounted onto a metal frame located in the focal plane of a Michelson interferometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A typical extinction spectrum E()=1T() of a NPG sample having an average porous size p=200±50 nm and a thickness t=10±1 m, is reported in Fig 1c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-layer graphene exhibits in the near-IR and visible range a constant universal absorption value of 2.3%, and therefore a transmittance T=97.7%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This high-frequency absorption is related to Dirac intercone transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NPG samples instead, due to their finite (micrometric) thickness show, in the same spectral range, a nearly constant transmittance as low as a few percent or lower corresponding to an extinction E99% (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the measured extinction we finally obtain the real part of the optical conductivity () by means of a KramersKronig consistent fit (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This quantity, shown in Fig 1d, is normalized to its high frequency value HF evaluated around 7,000 cm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three main features are well evident in Fig 1d: above 3,000 cm1, () increases saturating at higher frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This absorption, like in single-layer graphene, can be associated with intercone electronic transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The small narrow peak around 1,600 cm1 roughly coincides with the graphene G phonon which becomes infrared active probably due to disorder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the following we do not discuss this spectroscopic feature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At low frequency, where for a single layer non patterned graphene having a finite Fermi energy one would expect a Drude absorption, NPG instead exhibits a peak at a finite frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This peak, which has been also observed in single-layer disordered graphene20, will be attributed (see below) to localized surface plasmons in the underlying graphene layers, where the localization and extra wavevector are provided by the nano-scale porosity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is evidence of graphene plasmons in a 3D porous nanostructure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Nanoporous graphene structure and optical results.SEM

interband transition are separated by a broad minimum as the Dirac intercone electronic transitions are forbidden for photon energies below the Fermi energy (Pauli-blocking).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus to separate the plasmon absorption from the interband transition, and tracing the plasmon characteristic frequency versus the Fermi energy and the pore size, we fit the optical conductivity through the sum of two components: a Lorentz oscillator, which describes the low-frequency peak, plus the conventional graphene interband term21,22:', '', 'here pl and pl are the plasmon frequency and linewidth, respectively, while T and EF are the temperature and the Fermi energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  B(C) defines the intensity of the plasmon absorption (interband transition).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To the terms of equation (1) one should add a flat background (with values A0.30.4), depending on the sample, already observed in single layer and few layers graphene, whose origin is probably related to charged impurities and extrinsic scattering centers20,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the phonon spectral weight is very small, we do not add the phonon (Lorentzian) contribution to equation (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The fit of the optical conductivity experimental data to equation (1) data are shown in Fig 1d through a blue solid curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For any reasonable fitting parameter choice, the interband transition and in particular its edge, cannot be well described by the previous model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, as described by equation (1), the interband transition has a step-like behaviour at 2EF, whose slope increases for decreasing temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the NPG sample shown in Fig 1 the thermal smearing of the interband threshold at 300 K is nearly 1,000 cm1 against an experimental broadening of about 3,000 cm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that both disorder and a spatial inhomogeneity of Fermi Energy should be taken into account in order to describe the experimental data as suggested also for single layer graphene23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, spatial variations in the optical conductivity couldnt be resolved with far-field methods down to 35 m spot size (Supplementary Note 1) and might arise at the micron- or sub-micron scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, in order to fit more properly the experimental optical conductivity, we convolve the second term in equation (1) with a Fermi energy distribution function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming for simplicity a flat distribution between two extremal values, EF1 and EF2, the convolution yields an analytical expression for () (Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting fit, which describes much better the optical data, is shown through a green solid curve in Fig 1d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Let us observe that the modelling of the interband contribution is robust against the choice of the Fermi enery distribution function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, other distributions like the gaussian, provide a similar result although the convolution with the second term in equation (1) cannot be analytically calculated (see Supplementary Fig 2 for the comparison between the flat and gaussian convolution fit).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The convolution model thus provides information on both absorption mechanisms (plasmon and interband), allowing one to retrieve the relevant parameters defining the plasmon behaviour: the plasmon frequency pl and the average Fermi energy EF=(EF1+EF2)/2 (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This last quantity as extracted from the fitting is in good agreement with that directly measured on samples of the same batch.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In micro- and nano- ordered structures based on conventional metals and 2D electron gas systems3,5,24,25,26,27,28,29, the plasmon frequency depends on both the charge-carrier density and the geometrical parameters of the structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a disordered system one still expects a dependence on these parameters, although disorder may affect both the plasmon frequency, linewidth and intensity30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this section we study the optical conductivity of nanoporous graphene samples as a function of charge-density, that is, of the Fermi energy, for a fixed pore size, which allows one to investigate the effect of doping for a given geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We span a Fermi energy interval from 70 meV, for as-grown NPG samples, to 340 meV in intentionally Nitrogen doped systems (N-NPG)31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the whole 3D graphene structure does not appreciably change as a consequence of Nitrogen doping, the optical properties of pure and N-NPG samples can be usefully compared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In Fig 2 (from a to d) we show the SEM images of samples having the same average porosity (p=200±50 nm) and thickness (t=10±1 m), versus an increasing Fermi energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding optical conductivity normalized to its high-frequency value is plotted in the right panels (from e to h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Fermi energy values were obtained from fitting to the experimental optical conductivity (see above) and correspond well to the values provided by independent measurements on samples from the same batch13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The whole fit, the plasmon, and the interband components are represented by blue-dashed, blue-dotted and green-dotted lines, respectively (see Supplementary Table 1 for values of fitting parameters).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When EF increases towards higher energies (from e to h), the plasmon peak is blue shifted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is expected when the carrier density increases due to a stiffening of the plasmonic restoring force4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Optical properties of nanoporous graphene at fixed pore size for different Fermi energies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ad) SEM images of nanoporous graphene samples with the same average pore size p=200±50 nm, and an increasing Fermi energy (from ad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scale bar corresponds to 500 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (eh) Optical conductivity curves with relative value of Fermi energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The whole fitting, the plasmon and the interband components (see text) are represented by blue-dashed, blue-dotted and green-dotted lines, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SEM, scanning electron microscope.Full size image', 'The plasmon frequency pl versus EF as obtained from fitting of data in Fig 2, is reported in Fig 3 (red squares).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The error bars have been estimated through a statistical analysis on several samples having, nominally, the same properties (see Supplementary Note 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pl clearly increases with EF passing from nearly 60 cm1 for EF70 meV to about 800 cm1 for the highest doped N-NPG sample with EF340 meV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The value of pl also increases from 200 to 2,500 cm1 with increasing EF, and is much larger than the mean values found in 2D graphene4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Let us notice, that the mobility of Dirac carriers in the same NPG samples have been recently measured in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33 providing quite good values ranging from 5,000 to 7,500 cm2 V1 S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, although we cannot completely rule-out a possible increase of losses in NPG plasmons with respect to single-layer graphene, we mainly ascribe their broad linewidth pl to the statistical distribution of Fermi energy and pore size in the 3D structure (Supplementary Note 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: The plasmon frequency versus the Fermi energy.Data (red square markers) are compared with a fit based on Dirac two-dimensional (2D) plasmon frequency equation (equation (2), black dashed line) (see text and Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shaded blue area represents the effect of parameter variation on the fit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The good match among experimental data and fit permits one to assign the plasmon mode in NPG and N-NPG samples to 2D Dirac carriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The black (coloured) open circles represent data from refs 4, 34 for ribbons and disks, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disk diameter d and ribbons width W are reported in data labels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The agreement among literature and experimental data reinforces the assignment of plasmons in 3D NPG in terms of Dirac 2D charge carriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NPG, nanoporous graphene;

As evident from Fig 3 the theoretical 2D plasmon frequency is in very good agreement to experimental data, indicating that the plasmonic behaviour of 3D graphene can be well described in terms of Dirac 2D plasmons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To further support this finding, we have compared our data to experimental observations available in recent literature, which accounts for plasmons in graphene structures ranging in a variety of sizes (from 50 nm to 4 m), shapes (disks and ribbons) and interfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular we superimpose on our data in Fig 3, the results on single-layer graphene nano-disk (black open circles) as measured in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34, and those on single-layer graphene micro-ribbons (coloured open circles) as measured in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to have an effective comparison, literature data have been renormalized, using equation (2), to account for different size and dielectric environment (see Methods section for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The good comparison among experimental data, theoretical fit and literature reports suggests that, although we are dealing with a disordered 3D structure, the plasmon excitation in NPG and N-NPG preserves a 2D Dirac character.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates further that plasmonic modes in NPG and N-NPG graphene represent the natural extension in 3D of Dirac plasmons in single-layer/few-layers graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We also investigated the optical conductivity of nanoporous graphene samples as a function of the pore size for a constant Fermi energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allows one to extract the dependence of the plasmon frequency on the pore size at a fixed charge density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In Fig 4, we show both the SEM images (from a to c) and the optical conductivity (always normalized to its high-frequency value, from d to f), in three different NPG samples having, nominally, the same average Fermi energy EF70 meV and an average pore size of 900±100, 650±90 and 200±50 nm, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As evident in SEM images, pore sizes are randomly distributed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the statistical pore spatial distribution mirrors in spectra independent of light polarization (Supplementary Note 5), from Fig 4 it is possible to recognize a systematic optical-absorption pore size dependence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, while the interband transition falls in the same frequency range for all samples, the plasmon peak blue-shifts for decreasing pore size as expected by plasmonic thumb-rules30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the fitting procedure (equation (1) and Methods section), we were able to extract the plasmon frequency pl whose behaviour versus 1/p (p is the average pore size), is plotted in Fig 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase of pl from 80 to 300 cm1 shows an appreciable dependence on the pore size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental error bars have been estimated through a statistical analysis on several samples having, nominally, the same properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The behaviour of pl versus 1/p can be calculated by using the same analytic model summarized in the previous section (equation (2)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we calculate pl as a function of 1/p for EF=70 meV and L=10.5±0.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculation (black dashed line) well describes the experimental data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The error bars on the theoretical data (represented by a blue shaded area around the dashed black line), take into account the uncertainties on the parameters entering the calculation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The good agreement between data and theory further allows us to attribute this spectral feature to plasmon excitation of Dirac carriers in NPG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Optical properties of NPG at fixed Fermi energy for different pore size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) SEM images of nanoporous graphene samples with the same average Fermi energy EF70 meV, and decreasing pore size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar corresponds to 1 m.
