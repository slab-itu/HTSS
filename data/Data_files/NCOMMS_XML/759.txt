Prophylactic orthosteric inhibition of leukocyte integrin CD11b/CD18 prevents long-term fibrotic kidney failure in cynomolgus monkeys  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Ischaemic acute kidney injury (AKI), an inflammatory disease process, often progresses to chronic kidney disease (CKD), with no available effective prophylaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in part due to lack of clinically relevant CKD models in non-human primates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate that inhibition of the archetypal innate immune receptor CD11b/CD18 prevents progression of AKI to CKD in cynomolgus monkeys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Severe ischaemia-reperfusion injury of the right kidney, with subsequent periods of the left ureter ligation, causes irreversible right kidney failure 3, 6 or 9 months after AKI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, prophylactic inactivation of CD11b/CD18, using the orthosteric CD11b/CD18 inhibitor mAb107, improves microvascular perfusion and histopathology, reduces intrarenal pro-inflammatory mediators and salvages kidney function long term.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies reveal an important early role of CD11b+ leukocytes in post-ischaemic kidney fibrosis and failure, and suggest a potential early therapeutic intervention to mitigate progression of ischaemic AKI to CKD in humans.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Acute kidney injury (AKI), often caused by ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R)1, is a common and growing burden for the healthcare system worldwide2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AKI is a strong predictor of chronic fibrosis and end-stage renal disease in humans, especially following severe (dialysis-requiring) injury to native or transplanted kidneys3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether AKI per se or the associated comorbidities is the cause of the progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains controversial5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, despite important advances in understanding the pathogenesis of AKI, no effective prophylaxis currently exists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Acute kidney ischaemia induces release of inflammatory mediators that activate resident mononuclear phagocytes (macrophages and dendritic cells), the majority ( greater than 90%) of which express integrin CD11b7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After reperfusion, inflammation becomes self-sustaining with recruitment of CD11b+ blood leukocytes, which produce further cytotoxic (free radical species, lipid mediators and proteases) and proinflammatory mediators (cytokines, chemokines and complement8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the acute injury is mild, it may be followed by a reparative phase, with restoration of normal tissue homeostasis, but progressive scarring often follows severe injury9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mononuclear phagocyte subsets are involved in both the reparative and fibrosis phases of injury10 and often switch roles in repair and fibrosis11, complicating target selection and timing of therapeutic interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Translational studies targeting an array of proinflammatory mediators have identified several apparently efficacious agents primarily in rodent models of AKI; however, these failed to improve recovery or halt progression to CKD in humans12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contributory factors probably include the lack of reliable models in non-human primates, given the known differences in immune responses between rodents and humans14, the relatively short follow up period, which may not reflect the long-term changes in the injured kidneys15, and the multiplicity of proinflammatory mediators and their complex roles in tissue injury and repair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we developed a rigorous CKD model in healthy outbred cynomolgus monkeys and used it to evaluate the role of CD11b-expressing immune cells in progression of I/R AKI to CKD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD11b pairs with CD18 to form a heterodimeric integrin receptor expressed on resident and circulating phagocytes, fibrocytes, natural killer (NK) cells and some mast cells, CD8+ and  T cells10,16,17,18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD11b/CD18 binds more than 30 ligands including iC3b, fibrinogen, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and double-stranded RNA, and mediates phagocytosis, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, adhesion-dependent release of proinflammatory mediators, and phagocyteplatelet-, phagocyteendothelial cell- and phagocyteepithelial cell adhesion16,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD11b/CD18 also acts as a signalling partner for TLR4 and Fc receptors IIa and III22,23, which have been shown to be pathogenic in AKI models24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have generated a mouse mAb107 that inhibits binding of CD11b/CD18 to multiple ligands26 and subsequently showed that it is a ligand mimetic that binds the ligand-binding site in the CD11b A domain, but does not inadvertently activate the receptor27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter unique feature contrasts with current orthosteric anti-integrin drugs that act as partial agonists, a property linked to adverse outcomes in patients28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We now show that inactivation of CD11b/CD18 by prophylactic administration of mAb107 at the onset of I/R AKI ameliorated progression to fibrotic CKD and explore the underlying mechanisms.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A non-human primate model of CKD', 'We modified an earlier model of ischaemic AKI in non-human primates29, to assess the long-term impact of severe AKI on progressive kidney fibrosis and failure (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a pilot study of two cynomolgus monkeys, we induced unilateral warm ischaemic AKI by a 2 h in situ vascular occlusion of the right kidney, with ligation of the contralateral left ureter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This protocol led to acute rise in serum creatinine (Cr), necessitating release of the left ureter ligature 2 days later to avoid animal death from uremia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histopathology of the right kidneys harvested 3 months after AKI showed widespread tubular atrophy and tubulointerstitial fibrosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present studies, the right kidney function was also measured at 3, 6 or 9 months after AKI by religating the left ureter 2 days before euthanizing the animal, to test residual right kidney function (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1:

was tested in a pair of healthy cynomolgus monkeys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One animal (A1, 4.2 kg) received intravenous mAb107 at 6 mg kg1, with half the dose given 2 min before ischaemia and the other half immediately before reperfusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The control animal (C1, 3.0 kg) received an equal dose of an IgG1-matched non-reactive mouse mAbX63 (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville,

day after I/R (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Release of the left ureteral ligature normalized Cr in both animals by day 5 (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One day after AKI, serum levels of mAb107 and mAbX63 were 105.6 and 73.8 g ml1, respectively, and progressively declined, becoming undetectable by day 13 (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mAb107 did not deplete circulating red or white blood cell subsets or

detected by binding of the activation-sensitive mAb24 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32 and Fig 2m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flow cytometric analysis of PMN obtained 1 day after AKI showed a remarkable reduction in binding of APC-mAb24 to PMN from the mAb107-treated versus control animal (Fig 2n).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding of mAb107 to PMN isolated from the treated monkey was confirmed by the selective binding of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled goat anti-mouse Ig to these cells (Fig 2o).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, early administration of mAb107 prevents the activating conformational switch of monkey CD11b/CD18

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Preclinical studies have rarely examined the effects of prophylactic therapeutic interventions on long-term kidney function and structure following AKI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present study, conducted in a reproducible CKD model in non-human primates, clearly shows that early inactivation of CD11b/CD18 by mAb107 interrupts the otherwise irreversible course of progressive kidney failure triggered by severe I/R AKI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This protective effect is observed even at 3, 6 or 9 months after severe AKI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although mAb107 is a mouse IgG1, there was no evidence of enhanced leukocyte adhesion or CD11b/CD18 activation in treated monkeys, as judged by normal numbers of circulating leukocytes and lack of mAb24 binding to PMNs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be related to the fact that FcR-mediated leukocyte adhesion requires a functional CD11b/CD18 (refs 17, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present study also shows that severe AKI per se can progress to CKD in otherwise healthy non-human primates, seemingly resolving the existing controversy as to whether progression is caused by coexisting morbidities rather than by AKI per se5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Ischaemic injury targets renal tubular epithelial cells, peritubular capillary endothelium and resident mononuclear phagocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting lethal or sublethal cell damage triggers a local inflammatory response that involves a multitude of damage-associated molecular patterns, chemokines, cytokines, complement and coagulation factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Attenuated vascular relaxation, swelling of ischaemic endothelial cells, capillary leak and adhesion of trapped leukocytes to each other, to the endothelium and to platelets inside capillaries prolong microvascular no-reflow even after vascular occlusion is released, which further aggravates ischaemic injury30,31,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prolonged no-reflow is also known to increase risk of primary kidney allograft dysfunction35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Prophylactic treatment with mAb107 resulted in three early changes in the renal response to otherwise irreversible I/R AKI, which probably underlie its marked effect in mitigating progressive kidney fibrosis and failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, an immediate response to mAb107 treatment, visible by the naked eye (Fig 2a and Supplementary Movies), was improved microvascular perfusion after vascular clamp release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The underlying mechanism is likely to be related to inhibition of CD11b-mediated leukocyte adhesion-dependent damage to peritubular capillary endothelium, as well as inhibition of formation of intracapillary PMNplatelet and PMNPMN aggregates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A second early response to mAb107 is stabilization of CD11b/CD18 in the inactive conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In studies of attempted blocking of other integrins, the inadvertent switch of the integrin to the active proadhesive state by ligand-mimetic small molecules or by allosteric monoclonal antibody inhibitors has been linked to serious adverse outcomes in treated patients36 and to failure of oral forms of the small molecule orthosteric inhibitors in clinical trials28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous short-term studies in rodent models of I/R AKI using monoclonal antibodies directed against CD18, ICAM-1 (a CD11b ligand) or CD11b yielded conflicting results31,37,38,39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be due in part to lack of specificity of anti-CD18 monoclonal antibodies (CD18 is shared by three other 2 integrins beside CD11b), activation of integrin signalling by the allosteric monoclonal antibody inhibitors and/or by the capacity of some anti-CD18 or anti-CD11b antibodies to synergize with other proinflammatory receptors41,42, potentially enhancing injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, simultaneous inhibition of multiple CD11b ligands rather than a single one (for example, ICAM-1) might have been necessary for an effective protective response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A third early response to mAb107 therapy was a dramatic reduction in the pro-inflammatory proteins RANTES, IL-18, C3, IL-6 and IFN- in the ischaemic kidney biopsy, in association with significantly reduced numbers of CD45+ and CD11b+ leukocytes, and detectable improvement in renal histopathology in the right kidney biopsies, which was not reflected, however, in the simultaneous measurements of BUN/Cr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Levels of RANTES, IL-18, C3, IL-6 and IFN- remained low in the same right kidneys harvested from treated animals several months after the initial injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RANTES, IL-18, complement, IL-6 and IFN- are produced by ischaemic parenchymal kidney cells and/or infiltrating NK cells and neutrophils43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse knockout of RANTES45, IL-18 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  46), complement47, IL-6 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  44) or depletion of NK cells (an important IFN- source) partially protected kidney function 17 days post-I/R AKI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simultaneous early reduction of all five molecules by the mAb107 indicates that intrinsic and/or the infiltrating leukocytes play a major role in their production/secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether this reduction results from inhibition of CD11b-mediated phagocytosis26, and/or Fc IIa/III and TLR4 signalling24,25, requires further investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Levels of IL-1, TNF-, IL-8 and MCP-1 in treated right kidneys 12 days after I/R AKI were variable and did not correlate with long-term right kidney functional or structural improvement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the variable outcomes seen in rodent models of AKI, where double knockout of IL-1R and TNF-R1 did not protect against ischaemic AKI in mice48 or was somewhat protective in double knockout of IL-8 and MCP-1 in short-term studies49,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interestingly, levels of IL-2, which is mainly produced by activated CD4+ T cells and dendritic cells51, were increased in mAb107-treated right kidneys 12 days after injury, but returned to near baseline in the harvested right kidneys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-2 plays an important role in expansion and/or function of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells52, which are known to attenuate I/R AKI in rodents53,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To what extent the early rise in IL-2 in the right kidneys contributes to alleviation of progressive fibrosis later on remains to be clarified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice deficient in TGF-1 are more prone to I/R AKI55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we did not observe changes in active TGF-1 protein in kidneys or sera from treated or control animals, either shortly after injury or several months later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The present data suggest that early targeting of CD11b/CD18 using the novel orthosteric inhibitor mAb107 may provide effective prophylaxis by mitigating progression of AKI to CKD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future experiments will be necessary to determine the optimal therapeutic window for delivering mAb107 in our CKD model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, prophylactic use of mAb107 as administered in the current protocol may already exert a therapeutic benefit in a number of clinical settings associated with development of AKI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These may include high-risk cardiac surgery (for example, elective coronary artery bypass grafting) or kidney transplantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ischaemic AKI is a common complication of cardiac surgery, especially in high-risk patients with renal hypoperfusion56, and carries an increased risk of progression to CKD and long-term mortality57,58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ischaemic AKI after kidney transplantation is also a major cause of delayed graft function49, which increases the risk of long-term allograft failure59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the latter setting, therapeutic infusion of mAb107 in kidney donor and recipient may be beneficial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, adding mAb107 to the perfusion fluid during machine preservation60 may reduce postimplantation ischaemic injury in renal transplant patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present findings also suggest that mAb107 given as an adjunct to thrombolytic therapy or percutaneous coronary intervention may also be useful in prophylactic treatment of I/R injury to other organs such as the heart61.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Monoclonal antibody preparation', 'mAb107 was generated in mice immunized with human A domain from integrin CD11b/CD18 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alignment of human and cynomolgus A domains showed 86% amino acid identity, but 100% identity in the A residues contacting mAb107 that were previously defined in the crystal structure of the CD11b A/107 Fab complex27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purification of monoclonal antibody for in vivo use was done as described by Horenstein et al.62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, monoclonal antibody-containing supernatants harvested from hybridoma cultures were clarified and concentrated by circulating it through a hollow fibre membrane cartridge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The monoclonal antibody was purified by successive steps on Protein A affinity chromatography, hydroxyapatite charge exchange chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Endotoxin was removed using Detoxi-Gel (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and its level in the final product measured with Limulus Amebocyte Lysate gel-clot test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monoclonal antibody concentration was determined by ultraviolet absorbance and purity assessed following SDSPAGE and Coomassie staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Animal procurement and procedures', 'Pathogen-free cynomolgus (macaque) male monkeys were bought from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA), weighed 2.64 kg and were 23 years old.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were housed in wire-mesh cages in air-conditioned, humidity- and temperature-controlled rooms with a 12 h lightdark cycle until use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals were fed LabDiet 5038 and tap water ad libitum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Massachusetts General Hospital.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anticoagulated blood was obtained from the saphenous vein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In preparation for surgery, monkeys were fasted overnight and sedated with intramuscular ketamine (3.05.0 mg kg1) plus Dexdomitor (0.030.06 mg kg1) and intubated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atropine was given intramuscularly at 0.05 mg kg1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anaesthesia was maintained by administration of Isoflurane 13% inhalant, with intermittent administration of intravenous ketamine as needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vital signs and body temperature were continuously monitored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An intravenous infusion of normal saline containing 40 mg cefazoline was started using a 24 angiocatheter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unilateral right kidney ischaemia was induced by a 2 h hilar cross-clamping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contralateral left ureter was ligated after release of the vascular clamp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five animals were treated with mAb107 (412 mg kg1), two with the irrelevant isotype match mAbX63 and three with normal saline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The monoclonal antibody doses used were predicted to achieve blood levels of the mAb107 712-fold greater than the half-maximal phagocytosis-inhibitory concentration (Ki15 g ml1)26 and were based on an estimated circulating blood volume of 65 ml kg1 of body weight for cynomolgus monkeys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three to 9 months post injury, the left ureter was surgically exposed and religated 2 days before planned euthanasia and the right kidney function was measured 1 and 2 days after the left ureter ligation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Open right kidney wedge biopsies were performed 1 and 2 days, and 1 month after reperfusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The right kidney was exposed following a midline abdominal incision and a 2 × 4 mm incision was made with the M75 blade, extending 11/2 mm into the cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After assuring haemostasis, the wound was closed, the animal awakened, stable vital signs assured and then animal was returned to the housing area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kidney sections were either snap frozen in liquid nitrogen or placed in 4% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals were euthanized at the indicated times by intravenous administration of euthasol, 0.33 mg kg1 (1 ml contains 390 mg of pentobarbital and 50 mg phenytoin).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both harvested kidneys were photographed and submitted for analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Measurement of non-reflow', 'A videotape of the surgical procedure was used to measure the time taken for the ischaemic dark purple-coloured right kidney to change colour back to red after release of the right vascular clamp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Quantification of peripheral blood leukocytes', 'Haematocrit, total white blood cells, neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes and platelets were quantified in heparinized blood using HemaTrue hematology Analyzer (Heska, Loveland, Colorado, USA) as described by the manufacturer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Biochemical determinations', 'Blood samples were allowed to clot and centrifuged at high speed for 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Serum was stored at 80 °C until use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BUN and Cr were measured in duplicates in 96-well plates using a colorimetric method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Serum levels of the mouse monoclonal antibodies were measured using eBioscience mouse IgG total ELISA kit (Affymetrix, San Diego, CA) as described by the manufacturer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Proinflammatory mediators in kidney and serum', 'Collected kidney biopsy samples (25 mg each) were placed into 2 ml screw-top eppendorf tubes containing ice-cold 0.2 ml PBS and protease cocktail inhibitor (Roche Life Science, Indianapolis, IN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, a 5 mm stainless-steel bead was added to each tube and placed into a TissueLyser II machine (Qiagen, Waltham, MA) with an oscillation frequency of 30 Hz for 2 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The levels of three chemokines (RANTES/CCL5, IL-8/CXCL8 and MCP-1/CCL2), seven cytokines (IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-18, TNF-, IFN- and TGF-1) and one complement protein (C3) in 0.050 ml lysed kidney extract or serum were assessed using magnetic bead kits run on a Luminex 200 system (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Serum and kidney samples were tested undiluted, except samples undergoing C3 analysis, which were diluted 1:40,000 in assay buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Integrin activation and monoclonal antibody binding studies', 'PMN were purified from EDTA-anticoagulated monkey blood by fractionation over lympholyte-poly solution (CEDARLANE, Burlington, ON) as

salt solution-BSA++) were treated with f-met-leu-phe (5 × 107 M final concentration) for 10 min at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlabelled Fab107 (75 g ml1) was added to one-half of the replicate tubes for an additional 30 min at 37 °C, followed by addition of mouse mAb24 IgG (20 g ml1) to all tubes and incubation for an extra 30 min at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were washed once, stained with anti-mouse Fc-specific fluorophore-labelled antibody (for 30 min at 0 °C), washed again, fixed with 1% formaldehyde in PBS and analysed using a FACS-Calibur or LSRFortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FlowJo software was used to calculate mean fluorescence intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For detection of in vivo binding of mouse monoclonal antibody to monkey PMN, 1.4 g of fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti-mouse Fc-specific monoclonal antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) was added to purified PMN and the mixture incubated for 20 min on
