Multi-omic data integration enables discovery of hidden biological regularities  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Rapid growth in size and complexity of biological data sets has led to the Big Data to Knowledge challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We develop advanced data integration methods for multi-level analysis of genomic, transcriptomic, ribosomal profiling, proteomic and fluxomic data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we show that pairwise integration of primary omics data reveals regularities that tie cellular processes together in Escherichia coli: the number of protein molecules made per mRNA transcript and the number of ribosomes required per translated protein molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we show that genome-scale models, based on genomic and bibliomic data, enable quantitative synchronization of disparate data types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Integrating omics data with models enabled the discovery of two novel regularities: condition invariant in vivo turnover rates of enzymes and the correlation of protein structural motifs and translational pausing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These regularities can be formally represented in a computable format allowing for coherent interpretation and prediction of fitness and selection that underlies cellular physiology.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Progress of the biological sciences in the era of big data will depend on how we address the following question: How do we connect multiple disparate data types1 to obtain a meaningful understanding of the biological functions of an organism2?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to large-scale improvements in omics technologies, we can now quantitatively track changes in biological processes in unprecedented detail3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although such measurements span a diverse range of cellular activities, developing an understanding of how these data types quantitatively relate to one another and to the phenotypic characteristics of the organism remains elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This issue is central to the so-called Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) grand challenge, which aims to integrate multiple disparate data types into a biologically meaningful, multi-level structure1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interpretation of disparate data requires understanding how the primary measurements of different omics data are quantitatively coupled to one another5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We approach this task by identifying regularities (relationships between biological data types that remain relatively constant across conditions) between pairwise omics data types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although some regularities can readily be discovered through direct pairwise omics data comparisons, we find that other regularities emerge only through more intricate analysis leveraged by mechanistically based network reconstructions6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such reconstructions can be used as a context for poly-omic data integration and analysis6,7, and, when combined with constraint-based modelling approaches8,9, provide important links between omics data and phenotypic characteristics of the organism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As we will show, this approach leads to a comprehensive synchronization of poly-omic data with computed growth states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The approach directly addresses the BD2K grand challenge and is made conceptually accessible by tracing the information flow through the familiar central dogma, to establish relationships between measurements and cell physiology (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: A multi-scale multi-omics framework detects significant biological regularities in E. coli.Tracing the central dogma of biology (left column), we can link specific data types (middle column) to explain each of these biological processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, novel biological regularities that relate these processes are discovered through: (i) primary omics data (top box, right column) and (ii) integration with GEMs (bottom box, right column).Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Pairwise ratios of data types are highly correlated', 'First, we examine the information flow from transcription to translation, to protein production, by identifying correlations across primary omics data types, such as RNAseq10, ribosome profiling11,12,13 and proteomics14, collected for Escherichia coli batch growth on glucose, fumarate, pyruvate and acetate (Fig 1, primary data box).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found relatively poor correlations of messenger RNA to protein across conditions (r2 less_than 0.4), consistent with previous studies15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stronger correlations (r2 greater than 0.8) emerge when analysing the ratio of protein per mRNA (PM) on a per-gene basis (the difference between peptide abundance and relative mRNA read counts per gene for multiple growth conditions; Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Computing the median coefficient of variation shows that changes in PM across conditions are relatively invariant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we find the number of ribosomes required (ribosome occupancy of mRNA) per protein translated is also relatively invariant across all four conditions (r2 greater than 0.7; Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Translation rate is linked to protein secondary structure', 'Second, we examined pairwise relationships between other omics data types, such as ribosome profiling, proteomics and fluxomics, by integrating these data types into next-generation genome-scale models (Fig 1, integration with genome-scale models of metabolism (GEMs) box).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GEMs are based on the annotated sequence and analysis of the bibliome for functionally annotated gene products6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most recent generations of genome-scale models incorporate protein structural information17,18 and allow for the computation of the synthesis of the entire proteome of a cell in addition to the balanced use of its metabolic network19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These models can integrate multiple layers of biological organization to balance the use of all cellular components, to achieve a cellular state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can thus extend our understanding of how information flows from translation to protein folding and catalysis, and its role in producing whole-cell functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We examined how information flows during protein translation, which includes protein folding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies indicate a possible link between translation speed and proper folding12,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of translational pausing has typically been approached from a sequence-based viewpoint20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we approach this analysis from a different perspective, by correlating the occurrence of translational pausing on a transcript to the location of nearby protein secondary (2°) structure motifs (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The establishment of this correlation is based on the following: (1) ribosome profiling11,12,13, which provides ample information on the queuing of ribosomes along mRNA transcripts; and (2) a recent network reconstruction that contains comprehensive protein structural information linked to the translated protein at the proteome scale18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Regularities in translational pausing and structural motifs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Cartoon depiction of co-translational folding

properties in E. coli grown under MOPS Rich and MOPS Minimal media, taken from Li et.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  al.11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pausing is enriched at positions downstream of protein secondary structures (top: -sheets, bottom: -helices, p-value less_than 6.67 × 103).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These correlations are consistent across conditions (for example, minimal and rich nutrient conditions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

existence, 35% SD-like codons for -helices, 18% SD-like codons for -sheets, compared with 9% global average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) A cartoon depiction of the relationship between structure, translation and sequence.Full size image', 'Several striking regularities in translational pausing and protein structure are consistently observed across multiple growth conditions in E. coli, which suggest the co-translational folding of intermediate secondary structure motifs inside the ribosome exit tunnel (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that pause sites are enriched (p-value less_than 0.01 using a hypergeometric test) downstream of specific secondary structure motifs, such as -helices and -sheets (Fig 2b and Supplementary Fig 2), yet are not significantly enriched at the termini of domains (Supplementary Fig 3 and also see Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On average, pausing becomes most substantial six to eight amino acids downstream of -helices and -sheets, which, in the majority of cases, fall either on disordered regions of the protein or on helical residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such instances consistently account for  greater than 3540% of pause sites across different conditions (Fig 2c and Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings strongly corroborate a growing theory that partially folded intermediate protein structures begin to immediately fold inside the ribosome exit tunnel, following polypeptide-chain synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several previous studies have shown that partially folded protein structures, such as small domains, can be detected within the exit tunnel21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, Nilsson et al.24 demonstrated the co-translational folding of a small zinc finger-like domain deep within the ribosome exit tunnel using arrest-peptide-mediated force measurements in conjunction with cryo-electron tomography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Do sequence-specific motifs drive co-translational pausing to ensure proper protein folding?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that ShineDalgarno (SD)-like sequences account for 2022% of ribosome density at pause sites (Fig 2c and see Identification of SD-like codons in Methods), which is consistent with recent studies25, and four times less frequent than what is found previous studies20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the pausing instances linked to SD-like sequences, we find that, on average, nearly half of these pausing regions also fall in the nearby vicinity (five to ten codons) of helices or sheets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The link between pausing, SD-like sequence and protein secondary structure becomes clear when comparing the average occurrence of SD-like sequences genome-wide (9%) with their occurrence directly downstream of -helices (35%) and -sheets (18%, Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these sequence and structure motifs account for the majority of pause sites (60%) or nearly half of the total ribosome occupancy (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that co-translational pausing occurs for distinct secondary structural elements and supports the potential role of sequence-specific factors to drive pausing for ensuring proper protein folding (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Genome-wide estimation of enzyme turnover rates', 'How does information flow between an individual enzymes catalytic activity and the activity of an entire network?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the effective turnover rate of enzymes, reaction flux per enzyme can be directly computed using experimental values for both flux (the rate of reactions) and enzyme abundance26 on a small scale (mainly for central carbon metabolism).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess enzyme turnover on a genome scale, we computed the ratio of an enzymes abundance (measured from proteomics data) and its corresponding flux derived from network-based analyses using the iOL1650-ME model (Supplementary Note 2 and Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the iOL1650-ME model directly relates enzyme synthesis and metabolic flux, we were able to develop a method, which uses the model to extrapolate the most probable flux state from proteomics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These ratios quantitatively couple experimentally derived flux estimates and protein abundances to make a quantitative connection between data types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Iterative workflow for generating turnover rate values from different nutrient conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) An iterative procedure uses a model to find a flux state, which most closely matches experimental proteomic data, and uses it to obtain an estimated parameter set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) The iterative workflow is run using proteomic data from four different experimental conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To eliminate bias from the initial parameters used in the iterative workflow, the starting parameter vectors are sampled from a uniform distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) For each condition, a consensus parameter set is

which represent coupling coefficients between the fluxome and the proteome (Supplementary Note 3), were analysed across four nutrient conditions, to understand the effect that carbon uptake has on metabolic enzyme turnover rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that these parameters show considerable regularity in relating flux to protein abundance, which suggests that in vivo turnover rate for most enzymes does not strongly depend on growth in diverse batch culture settings (Supplementary Note 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For high-flux metabolic reactions, the estimated turnover rates were consistent across all four conditions (a total of 284 turnover rate values; Fig 4a), with high correlation between any two conditions (Fig 4b and Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The computed turnover rates were averaged across experimental conditions to give the largest set of flux-per-enzyme parameters estimated computationally to date under in vivo conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that these estimated turnover rates do not have a direct relationship with fundamental enzyme kinetic parameters obtained in vitro but can be viewed as an in vivo data-driven estimate of the enzyme turnover rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Effective enzyme turnover rates (keff) as regularities emerging from coupling quantitative in vivo proteomic data with genome scale modelling.

tested the predictive capacity of a model containing parameter values derived from multiple conditions described above, to compute optimal cellular composition under new environmental conditions where proteomics data was not available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In simulations with our parametrized model, we perturbed a reference growth state through the addition of nutrients to the medium: batch growth on glucose was supplemented with adenine, glycine, tryptophan or threonine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these predicted phenotypic states, we identified enzymes that were predicted to be differentially used in the supplemented condition (Fig 5b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate these predictions, we collected omics data sets under these four perturbed conditions, to compare gene expression changes with the

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The unprecedented growth in the type, size and complexity of biological data sets over the past couple of decades has led to a pressing grand challenge in biology referred to as BD2K.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we address this critical need through the development of advanced data integration methods to enable multi-level analysis of genomic, transcriptomic, ribosomal profiling, proteomic and fluxomic data across multiple experimental conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can show that pairwise integration of primary omics data reveal unknown biological regularities that quantitatively tie key cellular processes together, and that genome-scale models enable the quantitative synchronization of disparate omics data types, leading to the discovery of additional system-based novel regularities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, when directly compared, RNA and protein values have long been known to be poorly correlated16,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the integration of ribosome profiling and structural data demonstrates how the secondary structures in proteins correlate with sites of translational pausing, supporting the theory of co-translational folding and the rhythm of translation29,30 (Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variation in translation observed from multiple omics types sheds light on how the protein-per-RNA ratio is correlated for each gene across conditions, but poorly correlated across genes31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By designing algorithms to integrate omic data with genome-scale networks, the ability to predict differential gene expression (Fig 5c) emerges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the most basic level, a genome-scale model of metabolism informs the user of all possible metabolic reactions and their respective stoichiometries8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The previous unparameterized ME model of E. coli19 added an additional reconstruction of gene and protein expression networks, and their associated metabolic costs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we integrate omics data directly by using a parameterization algorithm to improve estimates of expression costs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can demonstrate the increased accuracy of the parameterized ME model compared with the previous unparameterized ME model and M-model (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Taken together, we have shown that fundamental contextualization of multi-omic data leads to (i) insights into underlying biological mechanisms during protein translation and (ii) predictive computations based on cellular-econometric cost-benefit ratios associated with cellular functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, both multi-omic data analysis and genome-scale models will play an important role in establishing big data analysis frameworks to explain and predict cellular physiology.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

each condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Part D cross-condition parameter comparison', 'The intersection of these keff parameters under each condition was determined between all four conditions (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 284 parameters for reaction/catalyst pairs, which were in all conditions, were averaged to get a consensus set of keff parameters, which were used for ME computations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the pairs in common between each of the conditions were compared to give Pearsons correlations, shown in the table in Fig 4a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Predicting differential gene expression with iOL1650-ME', 'Simulations were performed using the same procedure as in the iOL1650-ME manuscript19 for batch growth on D-glucose with both keff parameter sets A and A+B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each supplementation simulation, the uptake reaction for that particular metabolite was set to be unbounded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of the adenine supplementation, the reactions HXAND, XAND and URIC were blocked (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes that changed by more than a factor of 16 (a log2 change of more than 4) were predicted to be differentially expressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gives a stringent criterion, which identifies genes that are predicted to change by a significant-enough magnitude to manifest experimentally (by comparison, a log2 change of 2 is often used with microrray gene expression data to filter out changes in expression, which, although statistically significant, are not of a high-enough magnitude to really be considered relevant).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Predictions of gene differential expression were considered correct if cufflinks obtained a false discovery rate of  less_than 0.05 for that gene in the mRNA sequencing data and the gene expression changed in the same direction (either both increase or both decrease) in both the predictions and mRNA sequencing data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypergeometric enrichment p-values were calculated using the scipy statistics package using the survival function + ½ × probability mass function of the distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'RNA sequencing data generated in
