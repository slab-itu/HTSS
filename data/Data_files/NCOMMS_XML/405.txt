Rare disruptive mutations and their contribution to the heritable risk of colorectal cancer  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Colorectal cancer (CRC) displays a complex pattern of inheritance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is postulated that much of the missing heritability of CRC is enshrined in high-impact rare alleles, which are mechanistically and clinically important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we assay the impact of rare germline mutations on CRC, analysing high-coverage exome sequencing data on 1,006 early-onset familial CRC cases and 1,609 healthy controls, with additional sequencing and array data on up to 5,552 cases and 6,792 controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify highly penetrant rare mutations in 16% of familial CRC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the majority of these reside in known genes, we identify POT1, POLE2 and MRE11 as candidate CRC genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not identify any coding low-frequency alleles (15%) with moderate effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study clarifies the genetic architecture of CRC and probably discounts the existence of further major high-penetrance susceptibility genes, which individually account for  greater than 1% of the familial risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results inform future study design and provide a resource for contextualizing the impact of new CRC genes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Colorectal cancer (CRC), a major cause of cancer-related mortality, displays a complex pattern of inheritance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genetic architecture of CRC susceptibility encompasses a broad spectrum of risk, from rare, highly penetrant germline mutations associated with well-characterized syndromes to common polymorphisms, each individually conferring small risks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, much of the familial risk remains unexplained but is widely postulated to be enshrined in unidentified, rare, high-impact variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This class of susceptibility is mechanistically important and highly relevant to the clinical management of both familial and sporadic CRC1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our recent application of next-generation sequencing to familial cases led to the discovery of mutations in POLE and POLD1 that predispose to CRC, thus providing evidence for the existence of hitherto-unidentified, rare, high/moderate-penetrance susceptibility alleles2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore implemented whole-exome sequencing (WES) to quantify the contribution of rare disruptive variants to the heritable risk of CRC and identify new susceptibility genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The high baseline rate of rare, neutral germline variants makes the identification of rare CRC predisposition alleles problematic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore designed a study for the extreme phenotype of early-onset CRC, as heritability is substantially greater when diagnosed young and/or is familial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2007, we established the UK National Study of Colorectal Cancer Genetics (NSCCG) as a bio-repository for studying susceptibility to CRC3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From 23,693 CRC cases (diagnosed  less_than 70 years) with European Ancestry recruited between 2007 and 2013, we identified 1,143 with early-onset CRC (55 years) documented to have at least one first-degree relative with CRC, a highly enriched subset representing  less_than 2% of all CRC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One thousand and twenty-eight of the 1,143 Discovery series of cases were subjected to WES.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, we analysed WES data on 1,644 UK population controls from the 1958 Birth Cohort (1958BC) with no history of malignancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify high-penetrant rare mutations in 16% of familial CRC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the majority of these reside in known genes, we identify POT1, POLE2 and MRE11 as candidate CRC genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study clarifies the genetic architecture of CRC and probably discounts the existence of further major high-penetrance susceptibility genes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Here we have searched for high-impact mutations within the exome, a highly enriched subset of the genome in which it has been argued that disease-causing mutations are most likely to reside.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By focusing on the exome, we have limited our ability to identify pathogenic mutations outside of transcribed regions and targeted capture is insufficiently sensitive to detected copy number variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, data catalogued by CLINVAR on the known CRC genes suggests copy number variations (150 kb) are likely to account for  less_than 10% of pathogenic mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accepting these caveats, our findings invite several conclusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can confidently ascribe 15% of familial CRC cases to rare variants in established CRC predisposition genes with a maximum estimate of 31%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also have found evidence for novel CRC predisposition genes, which merit further functional and/or replication analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biological function of the candidate CRC genes we identified (MRE11, POLE2 and POT1) further underscore the centrality of DNA replication/instability as a cause of heritable CRC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is however unlikely that further major high-penetrance genes with a similar profile to the mismatch repair or APC genes exist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we did not identify any coding low-frequency alleles (15%) with moderate effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Over the range of allele frequencies and effect sizes compatible with the established 2.2-fold sibling relative risk of CRC19, our study had over 80% power to identify a new predisposition gene accounting for  greater than 1% of the familial risk (Supplementary Fig3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study thus clarifies the genetic architecture of CRC and probably discounts the existence of further major high-penetrance susceptibility genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For alleles having a more modest impact on overall CRC burden, sample sizes of 10,000 cases are likely to be required for gene discovery initiatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identification of missense driven CRC genes will be hampered by our inability to accurately classify such mutations, acting to dilute the association signal and reducing effective population size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our analysis highlights a major requirement in cancer gene discovery studies, to improve on the ability to accurately assign pathogenicity to sequence changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the meantime, additional evidence such as functional data and/or screens of further cases will be required to prioritize candidate pathogenic coding variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our ability to identify common risk variants, coupled with the prediction from statistical modelling of genome-wide association study (GWAS) data that 17% of the heritable CRC risk can be ascribed to common variants20, provides a rationale for continued implementation of GWAS to identify new risk loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is notable that the mutations in the known genes are associated with more profound family history of CRC than in those in whom a genetic diagnosis cannot be made (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, from the clinical perspective, gene testing should not detract from the value of a detailed family history to inform screening requirements in patients and families.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, from our analysis it is clear that the identification of additional significant CRC gene associations will require very large-scale sequencing in conjunction with careful statistical analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, such efforts should not detract from the analysis of small but highly informative CRC families ascertained on the basis of highly selected phenotypes and which are likely to continue to prove highly effective in gene discovery.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
