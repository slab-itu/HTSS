TNIK inhibition abrogates colorectal cancer stemness  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Canonical Wnt/-catenin signalling is essential for maintaining intestinal stem cells, and its constitutive activation has been implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We and others have previously identified Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK) as an essential regulatory component of the T-cell factor-4 and -catenin transcriptional complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, Tnik-deficient mice are resistant to azoxymethane-induced colon tumorigenesis, and Tnik//Apcmin/+ mutant mice develop significantly fewer intestinal tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the first orally available small-molecule TNIK inhibitor, NCB-0846, having anti-Wnt activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  X-ray co-crystal structure analysis reveals that NCB-0846 binds to TNIK in an inactive conformation, and this binding mode seems to be essential for Wnt inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NCB-0846 suppresses Wnt-driven intestinal tumorigenesis in Apcmin/+ mice and the sphere- and tumour-forming activities of colorectal cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TNIK is required for the tumour-initiating function of colorectal cancer stem cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its inhibition is a promising therapeutic approach.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The great majority of colorectal cancers carry somatic mutations in one of two genes involved in the canonical Wnt/-catenin signalling pathway: the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and -catenin (CTNNB1) genes1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high frequency of Wnt signalling gene alterations ( greater than 90%) was reconfirmed by a recent large-scale sequencing project of TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas)5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wnt signalling is essential for maintaining the undifferentiated status and self-renewal capability of intestinal stem cells6, and constitutive activation of Wnt signalling due to such genetic alterations most likely gives rise to tumour-initiating or cancer stem cells (CSCs)7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, two representative colorectal CSC markers, CD44 and leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5), are the known target gene products of Wnt signalling10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A CSC develops into a microscopic adenoma, and eventually into invasive carcinoma, following sequential accumulation of other genetic alterations1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Loss of APC is the earliest genetic event during colorectal carcinogenesis13, but established colorectal cancer cells still retain dependency on Wnt signalling9,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerous attempts have therefore been made to develop therapeutics targeting the Wnt/-catenin pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In colorectal cancer, however, due to the genetic inactivation of APC, only the molecules downstream of APC can be considered as therapeutic targets15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TNIK was identified independently by two research groups16,17 through comprehensive mass-spectrometry analyses of proteins associated with the T-cell factor-4 (TCF4) and -catenin transcriptional complex16,18, the most downstream effector of Wnt signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TNIK was essential for full activation of Wnt signalling, and colorectal cancer cells were highly dependent on TNIK for growth17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of these results, TNIK has been considered a promising drug target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the development of a novel small-molecule TNIK inhibitor having anti-Wnt and anti-cancer stem cell activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TNIK has various functions other than regulation of Wnt signalling19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore initiated this study by developing Tnik-deficient mice to confirm the safety and feasibility of TNIK targeting.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Several therapeutic strategies for targeting various molecular components of the Wnt signalling pathway, including porcupine (LGK974 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39)), frizzled receptors (OMP-18R5 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  40) and OMP-54F28 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  41)), tankyrases (XAV939 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  42) and JW55 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  43)), and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) (ICG-001 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  44) and PRI-724 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  45)), have been developed (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of these are being evaluated in early-phase clinical trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At present, these anti-Wnt therapeutics appear to be clinically safe (except for some bone effects41), and no long-feared adverse effects in the gastrointestinal tract have yet been observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TNIK regulates Wnt signalling in the most downstream part of the pathway, and its pharmacological inhibition has been expected to block the signal even in colorectal cancer cells with mutation in the APC or CTNNB1 gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we obtained preclinical proof of concept (POC) for this therapeutic approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We developed a novel small-molecule compound (named NCB-0846) with high inhibitory activity against TNIK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NCB-0846 blocked Wnt signalling (Fig 2) and showed marked anti-tumour (Fig 3) and anti-CSC (Fig 5) activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these activities were not observed for 4-phenyl-2-phenylaminopyridine-based TNIK inhibitors reported by Ho et al.28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We revealed a structural basis for this difference (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human TNIK consists of serinethreonine kinase and scaffold domains21,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scaffold domain is involved in intra/intermolecular proteinprotein interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TNIK interacts directly with TCF4 and -catenin, and regulates Wnt signalling17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that inhibition of kinase activity via simple occupation of the ATP-binding pocket by a small chemical molecule might be insufficient to fully abrogate the functions of TNIK, considering the observed differences in the active/inactive conformations of the kinase domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The observed reduction of tumour multiplicity in Tnik-deficient mice (Fig 1) indicates that TNIK is involved in the initiation of tumorigenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the so-called gatekeeper function of the APC tumour suppressor, which inhibits the initiation of (or entry into) carcinogenesis1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained similar results with NCB-0846, but the latter was found to reduce the size of tumours further (Fig 3g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference may be explained by a compensatory increase ( greater than 2.5-fold) of Mink expression in Tnik-deficient mice (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we must also consider the off-target effects of NCB-0846.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we carefully included a diastereomer (NCB-0970) as a control in every experiment, the blocking of other signalling pathways cannot be completely excluded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NCB-0846 inhibited FLT3, JAK3, PDGFR, TRKA, CDK2/CycA2 and HGK as well as TNIK (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of these signalling proteins is potentially oncogenic, and the anti-tumour activities of NCB-0846 might be mediated not only by Wnt inhibition, but also by inhibition of some other pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will be necessary to profile the entire signalling pathways affected by NCB-0846.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Development of a TNIK inhibitor with higher selectivity might be needed to address this issue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structural information reported here (Fig 4) would help identify such a compound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We conclude that TNIK is required for the tumour-initiating function of colorectal CSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, TNIK is a multifunctional protein19,20, and its function is not limited to regulation of Wnt signalling or colorectal carcinogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, amplification of TNIK has been reported in 7% (8/106) of gastric cancer patients47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gastric cancer cells with such gene amplification showed higher sensitivity to one of our earlier compounds (NCB-0001) than those without amplification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CSC often shows the EMT phenotype, and NCB-0846 inhibited the expression of mesenchymal marker proteins (Fig 5a, right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another earlier compound (NCB-0005 or KY-05009) was shown to inhibit EMT of lung cancer cells induced by transforming growth factor (TGF)-1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EMT has been implicated in cancer metastasis49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conformational TNIK inhibitors may have a wide variety of clinical applications.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
