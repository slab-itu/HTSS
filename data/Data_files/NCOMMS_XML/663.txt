Integrative epigenome-wide analysis demonstrates that DNA methylation may mediate genetic risk in inflammatory bowel disease  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Epigenetic alterations may provide important insights into gene-environment interaction in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we observe epigenome-wide DNA methylation differences in 240 newly-diagnosed IBD cases and 190 controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include 439 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and 5 differentially methylated regions (DMRs), which we study in detail using whole genome bisulphite sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We replicate the top DMP (RPS6KA2) and DMRs (VMP1, ITGB2 and TXK) in an independent cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using paired genetic and epigenetic data, we delineate methylation quantitative trait loci; VMP1/microRNA-21 methylation associates with two polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with a known IBD susceptibility variant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Separated cell data shows that IBD-associated hypermethylation within the TXK promoter region negatively correlates with gene expression in whole-blood and CD8+ T cells, but not other cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, site-specific DNA methylation changes in IBD relate to underlying genotype and associate with cell-specific alteration in gene expression.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has a strong genetic contribution; a trans-ancestry meta-analysis of genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) has demonstrated 200 loci associated with IBD1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this tremendous progress in delineating the genetic architecture of IBD, genetics explains only a small proportion of disease heritability (13.1% Crohns disease (CD) and 8.2% ulcerative colitis (UC) of disease variance)1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several environmental factors are known to influence the development and course of disease; particularly smoking, diet and the gut microbiota2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has led some investigators to investigate epigenetics as a potential interface between genetics, environmental modifiers and disease3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have provided insights into other complex diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis4, type 2 diabetes mellitus5 and obesity6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'DNA methylation EWAS aim to determine the distribution of methyl groups at thousands of specific positions across the genome (CpG sites, cytosine-guanine dinucleotide) with the aim of identifying arrangements that are more common to certain disease traits compared to controls7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biological significance of DNA methylation is the association of DNA hypo- or hyper-methylation occurring within regulatory regions of genes (for example, promoters or transcription start sites) and gene repression8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Epigenetic studies have important confounding factors, most significantly, the cell-specific nature of epigenetic signatures9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the context of IBD several preliminary studies have used the Illumina 27k platform10,11,12 and subsequently the HumanMethylation450 platform to assess genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in blood and mucosal biopsy material in IBD13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our own study in treatment-naive children with CD, highly significant differences in DNA methylation were noted to occur in genes implicated in disease pathogenesis16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The findings were replicable in a modest number of samples and a two DNA methylation probe biomarker was found to accurately discriminate IBD cases and controls, indicating a strong translational potential16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the present study, we use a comprehensive integrative approach to study multilevel DNA methylation, genomic and gene expression data and to relate changes seen in whole blood to the methylation profile in separated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the primary analysis, we use the Illumina 450 K platform to identify differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and regions (DMRs) in whole-blood DNA samples from 240 newly diagnosed IBD cases (121 CD and 119 UC) and 191 controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Technical validation and detailed characterization of DMRs is performed in a small cohort of 6 cases (3 CD and 3 UC) and 3 controls using whole-genome bisulphite sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Independent validation of methylation results is performed using bisulphite pyrosequencing in a further cohort of 240 patients with established IBD and 98 controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differentially methylated sites discovered in whole blood are investigated in immunomagnetically separated leucocytes (CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, CD14+ monocytes) in a subset of the main cohort (n=60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All patients and controls profiled using the Illumina 450K platform (n=431) are genotyped using the Illumina CoreExome-24 array that includes 547,644 genetic variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a subset of patients with separated cell data (n=68), we perform gene expression analysis using the Illumina HT12 microarray.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'IBD-associated site-specific differences in DNA methylation', 'An epigenome-wide association comparison was made between IBD cases (both CD and UC) and controls (symptomatic and healthy controls,

for multiple testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The estimated cell proportions derived from the Houseman cell mixture deconvolution are presented in Supplementary Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were 439 DMPs in IBD cases compared with controls achieving corrected P less_than 0.05 (Table 1, Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed 54 significantly enriched GO terms, a large proportion of which relate to immune function (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were 412 DMPs when comparing CD to controls (Supplementary Table 3) and 203 when comparing UC to controls (Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As has previously been reported15, no significant differentially methylated sites were detected in a comparison of CD and UC following correction for multiple testing (Supplementary Table 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a significant overlap between DMPs seen in IBD, CD and UC compared with controls (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This parallels the latest genomic data where susceptibility loci initially thought to be associated with CD or UC are now known to be shared between both diseases19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were no DMPs when comparing symptomatic controls and healthy volunteers (Supplementary Table 6), allowing grouping of symptomatic and healthy controls into a single large cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Top table of

that IBD-specific differences in methylation may be driven by underlying genetic variants, and provide a potential mechanism by which genetic polymorphisms may contribute to disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'This study has demonstrated site-specific methylation changes in IBD compared with controls that were strongly significant following stringent correction for multiple testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In lieu

(pre-miR21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a promising avenue for further research given the pro-inflammatory status of microRNA-21 and its previous implication in colitis and IBD pathogenesis32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another notable IBD-associated DMR is ITGB2 (integrin subunit beta 2), the gene of which has a role in leukocyte adhesion, activation and trafficking34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is particularly interesting given the recent focus on strategies to therapeutically target leukocyte adhesion, namely vedolizumab, which targets a different integrin subunit (47)35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aberrant DNA hypermethylation at the ITGB2 locus has previous been demonstrated in IBD in mucosal14 and peripheral blood leucocyte15 samples as well as in other diseases36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other DMRs are also of great interest: WDR8 or WRAP73 (WD (trp-asp) repeat protein family, antisense to Trp73) which is involved in several cellular and gene regulatory processes37 and TXK is discussed in below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Whilst DMRs have been considered as the hallmarks of differential methylation, DMPs should also not be overlooked.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The top DMP was RPS6KA2, a ribosomal kinase in the serine/threonine kinase family38 that regulates a diverse set of cellular processes including cell growth, cell motility, proliferation and cell cycle progression39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RPS6KA is involved in several stages of translational control and is a mediator in the PI3K/Akt/mTor pathway39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mTOR is involved in autophagy, which importantly is dysregulated in CD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that IBD-associated aberrant RPS6KA2 methylation occurs within the gene body at a region with dense CpG content, and that no difference was seen in RPS6KA2 gene expression, the functional relevance of this finding may be difficult to delineate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RPS6KA2 is found within an IBD-associated GWAS locus (rs1819333, P=6.76 × 1021, odds ratio=1.08)22, and it is possible that a genetic polymorphism may be contributing to this strong finding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RPS6KA2 methylation has previously been associated with cigarette smoking20, while it appears that smoking status does not account for the disease-associated methylation difference in this data set, is interesting given that smoking is a known environmental modifier of IBD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein encoded by SBNO2, Strawberry notch homologue 2, another DMP, is known to have an anti-inflammatory effect by acting as part of the interleukin-10 downstream pathway40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, SBNO2 is found within an IBD-associated GWAS locus41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other highly interesting DMPs implicated in well-known IBD pathogenic pathways include interleukin-23 subunit A (IL23A), another IBD GWAS-susceptibility locus, and tumour necrosis factor superfamily member 10 (TNFSF10/TRAIL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The impact of cellular heterogeneity on DNA methylation data is a commonly cited limitation of EWAS studies conducted using whole tissues42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical algorithms that can provide estimated cell proportions and allow adjustment for cellular heterogeneity are now widely performed throughout the EWAS literature17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are comparatively fewer epigenetic studies with separated cell data, particularly disease-relevant cells and this is a significant strength of the present study43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed characterization of matched genetic, DNA methylation and expression data in separated leukocytes has highlighted several cell-specific findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the top DMP in whole blood, RPS6KA2, was differentially methylated in CD14+ monocytes but not CD4+ or CD8+ lymphocytes, potentially providing insight into the cell type of origin of methylation signals seen in whole tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results must be interpreted with some caution due to the different proportions of cells in IBD compared with non-IBD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell specificity may become even more relevant when analysing the relationship between methylation and gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A major finding of this study is IBD-associated hypermethylation of the TXK TSS occurring specifically within CD8+ cells, with an appropriate negative correlation with decreased gene expression in CD8+ T cells of the same individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of TXK, a member of the Tec family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, in Th1 T cells is obligatory for the production of interferon gamma44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD8+ T cells have an established role in IBD pathogenesis28,45,46 with recent data suggesting that CD8+ T cell exhaustion may be a critical prognostic factor in immune-mediated diseases47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While this observational study design does not allow functional interrogation of the origin of the DNA methylation profile seen here in IBD, it is interesting to speculate on the origin of such signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strong correlation between clinical inflammatory markers and the top DMPs and DMRs perhaps indicate that the observed methylation changes are a consequence of inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is notable that these signals endure in the replication cohort that consists of patients with established disease sampled following treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A small study of mucosal DNA methylation in children with UC suggests that the methylome reverted back towards that of healthy controls following treatment14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to this hypothesis is the strong association between germ-line variation and methylation of two of the five DMRs (VMP1/microRNA-21 and ITGB2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This exciting novel finding associates methylation in the VMP1/microRNA-21 region with two nearby SNPs, which act as methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These meQTLs (rs10853015, rs8078424) are in linkage disequilibrium with a known IBD-susceptibility GWAS locus (rs1292053).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA methylation may be a mechanism by which genetic variants outside of protein coding regions may contribute to the disease phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In rheumatoid arthritis, Liu et al.4 used mediation analyses to demonstrate that methylation was the causal mechanism by which genotype conferred disease risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most associations occurred in the major histocompatibility complex region, known to harbour many genetic variants with complex and extended linkage disequilibrium structures48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study we were able to establish several of the principals of causal inference but not independence of genotype and phenotype following adjustment for methylation, a finding reflected in the complex disease literature5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strong association between top ranking IBD-associated DMP/DMR and nearby genetic variants nevertheless represents a major finding and goes some way to explain the significant site-specific methylation differences in IBD cases and controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'DNA methylation data offer immediate translational potential as biomarkers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SEPT09 blood-based DNA methylation biomarker has been used in diagnosis and screening for colorectal cancer49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously demonstrated two methylation probes can accurately differentiate CD and controls and have prospectively validated the same two probe markers using the present data set16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we have used lasso27, an established machine learning technique that can help avoid over-fitting in large data sets where the number of variables vastly exceed the number of samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final 30-probe model is easily scalable into a high-throughput pyrosequencing panel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a non-invasive peripheral blood biomarker could be used to stratify patients to further intrusive investigations (e.g., colonoscopy).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Existing clinically available biomarkers such as faecal calprotectin50 already provide similar utility but are unable to distinguish the two forms of IBD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A different 19-probe methylation-based panel can discriminate CD and UC, potentially facilitating clinical decision-making where the medical and surgical management of the two diseases differ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently no prognostic biomarkers can reliably differentiate patients requiring early aggressive treatment from those who would experience a quiescent disease course.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There has been some anticipation that emerging -omic data may provide such a biomarker28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have identified a DNA methylation signature that associates with high-, intermediate- and low-risk of specific deleterious outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consensus clustering has recognized limitations51 and it is noteworthy that the methylation subclasses are not independently predictive of outcome and are likely to be driven by underlying differences in cell count or other clinical parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The primary whole-blood analysis was well powered to detect differential methylation between IBD cases and controls and key findings were replicated in a similarly sized replication cohort using an orthogonal technique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The allied separated cell DNA methylation, gene expression and genetic data sets provided complimentary data and allowed further investigation of key findings from the primary analyses but were not sufficiently powered to provide meaningful conclusions in their own right.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cross sectional study design limits the ability to define cause and effect, in particular, the contribution of genotype and inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The functional implications of methylation changes identified here may be investigated using recently developed CRIPSR technology52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples from patients with different complex inflammatory diseases would help define the specificity of described methylation changes to IBD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the impact of cellular heterogeneity on whole-tissue methylation is well known, existing17 and new53 algorithms used to estimate cell count are now widely used to adjust for differential cell distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whilst generally accepted, cell fraction predictions are estimates and when included as independent covariables in linear modelling may result in inflated P values and potentially false-positive DMPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have taken the additional step of performing cell sorting of target tissue to provide insights into cell type of origin of whole-tissue signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, three cell types have been isolated but it would also be informative to generate data on specific T-cell subpopulations (for example, T-reg cells, naive CD4+ cells), other common blood cell types (for example , neutrophils) as well as gut mucosa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This is the most detailed characterization of the circulating IBD methylome to date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Highly statistically significant and replicable DNA methylation differences have been demonstrated at sites pertinent to disease pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA methylation may be a factor of underlying germ line variation and may represent a mechanism by which genetic polymorphisms contribute to disease variance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell sorting of disease-relevant immune cells has highlighted subtle cell-specific relationships between DNA methylation and gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The immediate agenda for epigenetic research in IBD includes further well powered EWAS in diverse populations, delineating the methylome at the mucosal level particularly in specific gut cell types, and prospective diagnostic and prognostic biomarker studies to facilitate early clinical translation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
