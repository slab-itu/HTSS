Extra-coding RNAs regulate neuronal DNA methylation dynamics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation are essential regulators of the function and information storage capacity of neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA methylation is highly dynamic in the developing and adult brain, and is actively regulated by neuronal activity and behavioural experiences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is presently unclear how methylation status at individual genes is targeted for modification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report that extra-coding RNAs (ecRNAs) interact with DNA methyltransferases and regulate neuronal DNA methylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of ecRNA species is associated with gene promoter hypomethylation, is altered by neuronal activity, and is overrepresented at genes involved in neuronal function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of the Fos ecRNA locus results in gene hypermethylation and mRNA silencing, and hippocampal expression of Fos ecRNA is required for long-term fear memory formation in rats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that ecRNAs are fundamental regulators of DNA methylation patterns in neuronal systems, and reveal a promising avenue for therapeutic targeting in neuropsychiatric disease states.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Methylation of cytosine bases in DNA is a critical regulator of the function and plasticity within the central nervous system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the developing brain, neurons exhibit unique DNA methylation patterns that are correlated with synaptogenesis and regulate the expression of neuronal genes1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the adult brain, active DNA methylation is required for memory formation and maintenance2,3,4,5, and neuronal activity and behavioural experiences lead to site-specific reorganization of DNA methylation dynamics4,6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, maintenance of DNA methylation patterns at specific genes is disrupted in numerous cognitive and neurodegenerative disorders10,11,12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite the well-appreciated role of DNA methylation in neuronal function and physiology, the mechanisms by which individual genes or sequences of DNA are targeted for active methylation or demethylation are presently unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emerging evidence from other systems suggests that site-specific regulation of DNA methylation can occur via non-coding RNA species15,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most remarkably, extra-coding RNAs (ecRNAs), previously characterized as non-polyadenylated, sense-strand RNA overlapping protein-coding genes, have been shown to bind to DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and direct gene-specific methylation patterns15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These RNAs were previously found to precede synthesis of its messenger RNA (mRNA) counterpart in S phase and to be regulated by both RNA polymerases II and III (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the extent and nature of this regulation in post-mitotic cells such as neurons has not been explored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we report that ecRNA species, which we define as sense-strand, non-polyadenylated RNAs that overlap with the gene boundaries, are generated from genes that are critical for neuronal responses to stimulation, and that neuronal activity modifies ecRNA production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome-wide, ecRNA levels are correlated with mRNA expression and promoter DNA methylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that ecRNAs directly bind DNA methyltransferases to inhibit their activity, and that blockade of ecRNA production at the Fos gene locus results in hypermethylation and gene silencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, our data reveal that ecRNA expression from the Fos gene in the hippocampus is required for the formation of long-term fear memories, suggesting a critical role for ecRNA-directed DNA methylation in neuronal function within the adult brain.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Genome-wide classification of neuronal ecRNAs', 'To characterize the prevalence and expression of ecRNAs in neuronal systems, we established a pipeline for detection of non-polyadenylated (PolyA) RNA transcripts using whole-genome, directional RNA sequencing (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total RNA was extracted from neuronal cultures prepared from embryonic rat cortex, and underwent selection for polyadenylation signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PolyA+ and PolyA libraries underwent identical sequencing and were aligned to the rat genome (Rn5 build) using Tophat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pipeline resulted in considerable enrichment of known non-polyadenylated transcripts (for example, genes encoding canonical histone proteins) in the PolyA sequencing tracks, as well as highly reproducible PolyA+ and PolyA sequencing between biological replicates (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison between PolyA+ and PolyA RNA-seq data sets revealed the presence of non-polyadenylated, ecRNA-like transcripts overlapping protein-coding genes that also generate PolyA+ transcripts (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a considerable fraction of PolyA transcripts mapped to exonic regions (possibly indicative of spliced mRNA that had not yet been polyadenylated), we also observed frequent read coverage from intronic regions and regions outside the typical gene boundaries (transcription start and end sites) specific to the PolyA library (Fig 1b, Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To characterize the genome-wide expression of ecRNA-like transcripts, we computed an ecRNA index of sense-strand PolyA reads arising from upstream, intronic and downstream loci surrounding genes (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This index revealed that ecRNA-like expression from known coding genes was ubiquitous across the genome, and was highly correlated with mRNA expression from the overlapping gene (Fig 1d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Genome-wide identification and quantification of ecRNAs

on methylated DNA fragments enriched with a recombinant methyl-binding domain (MBD) protein (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As demonstrated previously19, we observed hypomethylation of the vast majority of gene promoters and CpG islands within the genome, and hypermethylation of gene bodies across the entire genome (Fig 1g, Supplementary Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine whether ecRNA levels reflected DNA methylation patterns, we divided all genes into distinct quartiles according to their ecRNA index (Fig 1fg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis revealed genes with higher ecRNA expression generated significantly more mRNA and possessed less DNA methylation at promoters (defined as 5 kb region surrounding the transcription start site (TSS); Fig 1hj).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As this effect could potentially be driven by the presence of CpG islands at highly expressed genes, we next examined the relationship between ecRNA levels and CpG island status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, promoters containing CpG islands were hypomethylated, whereas promoters lacking CpG islands were hypermethylated (Supplementary Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the relationship between ecRNA level and promoter DNA methylation was preserved regardless of promoter CpG status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we found that DNA methylation at gene-overlapping CpG islands was strongly related to ecRNA expression (Supplementary Fig 3d), indicative of potential ecRNA regulation of DNA methylation states at both promoter and intragenic sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given that DNA methylation status in neurons is both activity and experience-dependent, we next assessed the degree to which ecRNAs were altered by neuronal activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurons were incubated with potassium chloride (KCl) or tetrodotoxin (TTX) (Fig 2), which increase and decrease neuronal activity, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We again performed genome-wide RNA sequencing to examine both PolyA+ (mRNA) and PolyA (including extra-coding) RNA species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following neuronal depolarization with KCl, we observed that PolyA+ expression from a small set of genes (Fig 2a; Supplementary Data 1) were modified by neuronal activity, including a number of immediate early genes (Fos, Arc, Egr1 and Nr4a2) that have well-established roles in neuronal and behavioural function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether non-polyadenylated transcripts arising from these activity-regulated genes were also modified by neuronal depolarization, PolyA transcripts arising from the 5, intronic, and 3 extra-genic regions were plotted and compared with PolyA+ transcripts (Fig 2b; Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depolarization-induced ecRNA transcription from each of these regions was significantly correlated with PolyA+ transcription, suggesting that ecRNAs arising from these genes are also activity-dependent (see Fig 2c,d for representative examples).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several of these results were independently verified using quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT-qPCR) with custom mRNA or ecRNA-specific primers (Fig 2e,f), confirming significant activity-dependent regulation of ecRNA transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Regulation of mRNA and ecRNA by neuronal activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) PolyA+ RNA-seq following 1 h neuronal depolarization (25 mM KCl)

genome, we performed unbiased hierarchical clustering using a percentile-normalized quantification of ecRNA index, promoter DNA methylation and gene expression (mRNA fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped reads (FPKM)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hierarchical clustering identified at least eight distinct subgroups of genes (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As highlighted above, gene clusters with the highest ecRNA levels tended to have the lowest promoter methylation, whereas clusters that did not generate ecRNAs were characterized by promoter hypermethylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene ontology analysis of the largest cluster demonstrated an enrichment of genes involved in neuronal processes, including gene ontology terms for neuronal differentiation, neuronal development and dendritic spine morphogenesis (Fig 3e, Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This subclass of genes was marked by a high ecRNA index and low promoter DNA methylation, and also overlapped with genes regulated by neuronal depolarization and genes involved in intellectual/learning disorders and neurodegenerative disease states (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the second-largest cluster was marked by low ecRNA levels and high promoter DNA methylation, and was enriched for gene ontology-terms related to immune function (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: High ecRNA expression is inversely related

mouse AD model (odds ratio=1.966; P less_than 0.0001).Full size image', 'Although the vast majority of genes followed the general inverse relationship between ecRNA levels and DNA methylation, one small cluster of genes was marked by promoter hypomethylation despite the relative absence of ecRNA expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This category generated the lowest mRNA levels, and was heavily enriched with genes that code for olfactory receptors (Fig 3c), which possess unique regulatory mechanisms that help to specify expression of a single olfactory receptor gene in olfactory sensory neurons20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, another small cluster was marked by promoter hypermethylation despite high ecRNA quantification and high mRNA expression (Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cluster was enriched for genes involved in ribosomal RNA processing, which involves robust expression of genes that are critical for function in all cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, this analysis suggests that ecRNAs may be important for regulation of DNA methylation states at certain functional classes of genes but not others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Biogenesis and activity-dependence of Fos ecRNA', 'To further dissect the biogenesis, structure and function of ecRNA in neuronal systems, we focused on the ecRNA arising from the activity-regulated Fos gene locus (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our RNA-seq and RT-qPCR results indicated that a non-polyadenylated transcript arising from the 3 (post-transcription end site (TES)) Fos gene locus was induced by neuronal depolarization with KCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we next examined the time course of Fos ecRNA and mRNA induction following neuronal stimulation using RT-qPCR with ecRNA-specific primers (Fig 4a; Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although KCl increased both Fos mRNA and ecRNA, these transcripts had unique induction profiles (Fig 4b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Critically, Fos ecRNA (but not mRNA) was significantly elevated as soon as 30 min following KCl stimulation, with maximal 3-fold induction at 45 min after stimulation (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, Fos mRNA levels were not significantly elevated until 45 min following depolarization, and attained maximal levels until 14 h after stimulation (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine whether other mechanistically distinct forms of stimulation could induce ecRNAs, neuronal cultures were treated for 1 h with the specific glutamate receptor agonists -Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA; Fig 4b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to depolarization with KCl, acute AMPA or NMDA treatment significantly elevated both Fos mRNA and 3 ecRNA, although mRNA induction was consistently higher than ecRNA induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, to determine whether Fos ecRNA levels were also sensitive to neuronal inactivation, neuronal cultures were incubated for 1 h with TTX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Fos mRNA was substantially reduced by acute TTX treatment, Fos ecRNA levels were not altered by neuronal inactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results suggest ecRNA levels in neurons can be activity-dependent and are potentially separate from mRNAs arising from the same gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Fos ecRNA is differentially responsive to neuronal activation and undergoes unique biogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

of Fos gene transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fos mRNA is upregulated as soon as 45 min after KCl treatment, and peaks at 4 h following stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AMPA and NMDA treatment (1 h) produced dose-dependent increases in Fos mRNA, whereas neuronal silencing with TTX decreased Fos mRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) In contrast, Fos ecRNA is induced within 30 min of neuronal depolarization with KCl, and peaks at 45 min following KCl treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neuronal stimulation with KCl, AMPA and NMDA induced much lower levels of ecRNA transcription (as compared with mRNA), and neuronal

less_than 0.0001.Full size image', 'The distinct ecRNA and mRNA synthesis patterns following neuronal activity indicates that ecRNAs are unlikely to be a simple byproduct of conventional mRNA production by RNA polymerases, and also suggests that these transcripts may be controlled by different mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine this possibility, we treated neuronal cultures with selective inhibitors of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) to characterize ecRNA and mRNA biogenesis (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have demonstrated that Fos mRNA, along with many other immediate early genes, is transcribed by RNAPII, which can remain poised at transcription start sites21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, RNAPIII transcribes of non-coding elements like transfer and ribosomal RNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, we found that basal levels of Fos mRNA are sensitive to inhibition of transcription by RNAPII.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 h treatment with 5, 6-dichloro-1--D-ribofuranosyl-1H-benzimidazole (DRB, a pTEFb inhibitor which blocks RNAPII-dependent transcription), dose-dependently decreased Fos mRNA (Supplementary Fig 4a), whereas treatment with an RNAPIII inhibitor (ML-60218) did not alter Fos mRNA expression (Supplementary Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, we found that basal expression of Fos ecRNA was sensitive to treatment with either inhibitor, indicating that basal ecRNA transcription may be induced by either RNAPII or RNAPIII.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To probe this relationship at another mRNA/ecRNA pair, we repeated this experiment at a second activity-responsive gene (Atf4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this locus, we found a complete dissociation between the effects of RNAPII and RNAPIII inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DRB treatment dose-dependently reduced Atf4 mRNA, but had no effect on Atf4 ecRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, RNAPIII inhibition decreased Atf4 ecRNA but did not decrease Atf4 mRNA (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Together, these results further suggest that ecRNA is not simply a non-polyadenylated byproduct of normal gene transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, steady-state transcript levels are the result of complex dynamics between transcript synthesis and degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further examine activity-dependent synthesis of Fos mRNA and ecRNA, we pre-treated neuronal cultures with RNAPII or RNAPIII-dependent transcriptional inhibitors before KCl-induced depolarization (Fig 4d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we found that while KCl-induced increases in Fos mRNA were prevented by pretreatment with DRB, RNAPII-dependent transcription inhibition was unable to block increases in Fos ecRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, ML-60218 significantly attenuated Fos ecRNA increases following KCl (but did not alter KCl-induced Fos mRNA), suggesting that at least part of the Fos ecRNA induction in response to neuronal depolarization is driven by RNAPIII transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with this, RNAPIII binding at the Fos promoter was significantly increased following KCl stimulation, as detected using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) for the RNAPIII subunit RPC32 (Supplementary Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, these findings reveal a critical dissociation between RNAPII and RNAPIII driven transcription at the Fos locus, and further confirm the independence of activity-dependent Fos ecRNA and Fos mRNA synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given the genome-wide relationship between DNA methylation and ecRNA expression, we hypothesized that Fos ecRNA increases following KCl stimulation might be associated with subsequent Fos hypomethylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this, we examined DNA methylation levels at three sites relative to the Fos gene (distal upstream enhancer, proximal promoter and gene body) using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) 24 h after KCl-induced neuronal depolarization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 4f, we observed decreases in DNA methylation at each of these locations following KCl treatment, which is consistent with the genome-wide relationship between ecRNA and DNA methylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'ecRNAs directly bind to DNMT3a and prevent methylation', 'Next, we sought to examine how ecRNAs might regulate DNA methylation status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As previous studies suggest that DNA methyltransferases bind to non-coding RNA species15,16,17, we hypothesized that Fos ecRNA controls DNA methylation at this gene by interacting with DNA methyltransferases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine this possibility, we first verified nuclear expression of the major DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1 and DNMT3a) in our neuronal cultures using IP-grade DNMT antibodies and MAP2 co-staining to identify neurons (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This staining revealed mostly nuclear localization of DNMTs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, PolyA+ RNA-seq revealed that Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a are the most abundant DNMT transcripts in cortical neuronal cultures (Dnmt1 FPKM mean=17.18; Dnmt3a FPKM mean=14.57; Dnmt3b FPKM mean=0.79).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether Fos ecRNA might interact with DNMTs, we performed an RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) with antibodies for DNMT1 and DNMT3a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As part of the RNA-IP protocol, we gently permeabilized the cellular membrane, which allowed for nuclear isolation and collection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In non-IP (input control) samples, we found that ecRNAs were significantly enriched as compared with total lysate fractions, indicative of nuclear localization (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In IP samples, RT-qPCR was used to detect the presence of ecRNAs bound to DNMTs, and revealed significant enrichment of Fos ecRNA on DNMT1 and DNMT3a, as compared with a normal immunoglobulin-G (IgG) control (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Fos mRNA was not significantly enriched in DNMT-RIP samples, demonstrating selectivity of DNMT binding to

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this study, we provide novel genome-wide evidence for an association between ecRNA species and DNA methylation states in neuronal systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that in the absence of ecRNA production, genes tend to possess methylated promoters and are silent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, genes that generate ecRNAs possess demethylated promoters and are actively transcribed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using unbiased mathematical clustering, we observed that this relationship is preserved at actively transcribed neuronal genes, including genes modulated by neuronal activity and genes implicated in developmental and neurodegenerative disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This genome-wide characterization provides a key initial step in understanding how ecRNAs might regulate epigenetic states within neurons, and also provides insight into the biological context of this phenomenon across gene classes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These results are consistent with previous observations that the epigenome is highly dynamic in the adult brain, and reveal one of the first potential mechanisms for activity- and experience-dependent alterations in cytosine methylation status at specific gene loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to providing a genome-wide characterization of activity-regulated transcriptional dynamics of both polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated RNA species in neurons, our results provide a detailed analysis of ecRNAs arising from the Fos gene locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that Fos ecRNAs interact directly with DNMTs, that DNA methylation states at Fos are altered following ecRNA increases, that Fos ecRNAs undergo distinct synthesis and regulation from Fos mRNA, and that knockdown of Fos ecRNA increases DNA methylation and represses Fos mRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we reveal that Fos ecRNA is induced by the memory-forming experiences, and is necessary for expression of contextual fear memory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings highlight a potential role for ecRNAs in cognitive function, and further illustrate the dynamic link between active non-coding RNA transcription and epigenetic regulation in neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One challenge in genome-scale identification and quantification of ecRNA species is that non-polyadenylated RNA fractions could also contain nascent unspliced pre-mRNA that has not yet been polyadenylated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although previous reports have revealed widespread co-transcriptional splicing in neurons31, it is likely that nascent mRNA transcripts contributed in some way to the intronic ecRNA quantification strategy employed here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though this issue is difficult to resolve using standard whole-genome sequencing approaches, more detailed single-molecule sequencing could be employed to capture longer transcripts and thus provide more complete disambiguation of ecRNA and pre-mRNA transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Critically, this analysis could also facilitate identification of ecRNA transcript start and end sites, as well as enriched sequence motifs that might confer ecRNAs with targeted DNA or protein recognition properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, our characterization of ecRNA from the 3 end of the Fos gene locus is in agreement with previous observations that ecRNAs are regulated distinctly from overlapping mRNA and contribute to gene-specific DNA methylation patterns15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our genome-wide gene expression and DNA methylation data, we hypothesize that ecRNA transcripts arising from other genes also possess differential biosynthesis and regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, although our results suggest that activity-dependent induction of the Fos ecRNA is controlled by RNAPIII, it remains unclear if this is the case at other ecRNA transcription sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies will be required to explore differential polymerase contributions to transcription of functionally defined non-coding RNA subclasses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Overall, our results add to an emerging appreciation for non-coding RNA species in epigenetic and transcriptional modulation32, including the ability to act as decoy molecules or scaffolds for transcriptional regulators, target specific modifiers to a unique DNA locus, and directly bind to DNA itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that ecRNAs directly interact with the DNMT catalytic domain to block the ability of DNMTs to target and silence overlapping genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One prediction of this model is that ecRNAs would need to remain co-localized with the parent gene following synthesis to provide locus-specific DNMT regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although how this occurs is presently unknown, there are at least two distinct possibilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One is that ecRNAs could possess extremely short half-lives (as has been demonstrated for enhancer RNAs (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22)), in effect restricting function to a local chromatin environment surrounding the overlapping gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a second and potentially more intriguing possibility is that ecRNAs could form a triplex structure with DNA (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33) that serves the dual purpose of stabilizing the ecRNA and providing locus-specific anchor for interference of DNMT activity15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless of the specific mechanism, characterizing the nature of this process will be important for understanding how individual cytosine nucleotides can be targeted for developmental or activity-dependent epigenetic reprogramming1,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results also suggest the possibility that differential regulation of ecRNA species may serve as a unique means for endogenous control of the neuronal epigenome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that many neuropsychiatric and neurological diseases are associated with chronic alterations in specific gene products34,35,36, we speculate that ecRNA targeting may provide an attractive therapeutic approach that could deliver gene-specific epigenetic reorganization to alleviate longstanding epigenetic pathologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, co-opting endogenous mechanisms for epigenetic control represents an entirely new layer of therapeutic possibility, and could include the de-repression of methylated genes or the silencing of actively transcribed genes37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, because cytosine methylation can be self-perpetuating38,39, ecRNA-targeted alterations in gene methylation could conceivably persist beyond the initial triggering stimulus to generate enduring transcriptional regulation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
