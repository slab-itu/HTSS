Tuning thermal conductivity in molybdenum disulfide by electrochemical intercalation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Thermal conductivity of two-dimensional (2D) materials is of interest for energy storage, nanoelectronics and optoelectronics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report that the thermal conductivity of molybdenum disulfide can be modified by electrochemical intercalation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe distinct behaviour for thin films with vertically aligned basal planes and natural bulk crystals with basal planes aligned parallel to the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thermal conductivity is measured as a function of the degree of lithiation, using time-domain thermoreflectance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The change of thermal conductivity correlates with the lithiation-induced structural and compositional disorder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further show that the ratio of the in-plane to through-plane thermal conductivity of bulk crystal is enhanced by the disorder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that stacking disorder and mixture of phases is an effective mechanism to modify the anisotropic thermal conductivity of 2D materials.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Two-dimensional (2D) layer-structured materials consist of atomic layers with strong intra-layer covalent bonding stacked together by weak van der Waals bonds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transition metal dichalcogenides, an important class of 2D materials, have attracted extensive research interest recently due to their unique electronic and chemical properties1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been extensively studied for potential applications in nanoelectronics, optoelectronics and flexible electronic devices2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the thermal conductivity of single, few-layer and bulk MoS2 has been reported recently, the effects of structural and compositional disorder on the anisotropic thermal conductivity of layered materials, which usually occurs during crystal growth, fabrication and applications (for example, in energy storage, thermoelectrics and nanoelectronics), have not yet been systematically characterized6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Guest ions can be intercalated into the van der Waals gaps in MoS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intercalation causes changes in the electronic structure, and optical and electrical properties9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intercalation can also induce structural and compositional disorder, including variations in layer spacing, interaction strengths between adjacent layers and phase transitions10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By monitoring the potential during electrochemical intercalation, we can control the amount of intercalated ions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, intercalation provides an effective way to systematically vary the structural and compositional disorder of many 2D materials, and enables investigations of how disorder affects their thermal conductivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To understand how thermal conductivity of highly anisotropic materials can be affected by disorder, here we study the thermal conductivity of both pristine and lithium ion-intercalated bulk and thin-film MoS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the bulk sample, the MoS2 basal planes are oriented parallel to the surface; whereas, in the thin-film sample, the MoS2 basal planes are vertically aligned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thermal conductivity of LixMoS2 samples with different degrees (x) of electrochemical interaction of lithium ions were measured by time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that lithium ion intercalation has drastically different effects on thermal transport in these different forms of MoS2 due to the differences in crystalline orientation and initial structural disorder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our most striking observation is that the thermal anisotropy ratio in bulk LixMoS2 crystals increases from 52 (x=0) to 110 (x=0.34) as a result of lithiation-induced stacking disorder and phase transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thermal anisotropy ratio is the ratio of in-plane to through-plane thermal conductivity, an important material parameter in thermal management.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in thermal anisotropy with increasing disorder is counter-intuitive: previous studies show that structural disorder typically decreases the thermal anisotropy ratio13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis suggest that the enhanced thermal anisotropy ratio in LixMoS2 bulk crystal is likely due to the combination of phonon-focusing effects and pronounced differences in the in-plane and through-plane length scale of the lithiation-induced disorder.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Sample preparation', 'The MoS2 thin-film samples with vertically aligned basal planes were grown by rapid sulfurization of a Mo thin film15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bulk samples of MoS2 were obtained by

present the Raman spectra of the bulk and thin-film MoS2 samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To probe the low-frequency interlayer  phonon mode, we used three reflective volume Bragg grating filters (BragGrate notch filters) in combination with a single-pass monochromator to access frequency shifts as small as 10 cm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The E1g mode (286 cm1) is observed only in the thin-film samples while the  mode (32 cm1) is only present in the bulk samples, as expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the Raman selection rules, the E1g mode is forbidden in backscattering experiment on the basal plane of bulk MoS2 (refs 16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when the incident light scatters on the surface of edge-terminated MoS2, the corresponding scattering Raman tensor undergoes a rotation transformation, leading to a non-zero differential scattering cross-section and hence the E1g mode can be observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observation of the E1g mode in thin-film samples therefore indicates that the basal planes of MoS2 are vertically aligned, consistent with the TEM and X-ray diffraction data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of the  mode (which is not forbidden by selection rules) in thin-film samples is probably due to the randomly oriented columnar grains and stacking disorder in CVD-grown samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, although both A1g at 383 cm1 and  at 408 cm1 modes are present in bulk and thin-film MoS2, the peak intensity of the out-of-plane  mode is similar to that of the in-plane  mode in the bulk sample and 3 times that of the  mode in the thin-film sample under the same measurement condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such preferred excitation of an out-of-plane mode is also consistent with the vertical-aligned crystal texture of the thin-film sample considering the polarization dependence of the Raman scattering cross-section15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We carried out electrochemical intercalation of lithium ions in both bulk and thin-film MoS2 to study how lithiation affects the thermal conductivity differently in MoS2 samples with different orientations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lithium ion intercalation of thin-film MoS2 samples was performed through

to 1T phase19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The voltage dip at the initial stage of the discharge curve for bulk MoS2 sample is caused by the mass transport limitation of lithium ions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The voltage gradually recovers when the lithium ion transport is facilitated by defects formed during intercalation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The voltage dip was not observed in the discharge process of thin-film MoS2,

ratio of Li, Mo and S atoms is calculated by measuring the element masses in the bulk LixMoS2 sample with metal coating (total mass1 mg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured x is 86 at% suggesting reasonable agreement between calculated and measured lithium contents for the lithiation process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The actual x in other bulk LixMoS2 samples is then scaled by the same factor of 0.86.

to the relatively high in-plane group velocity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We adopted the modified minimum thermal conductivity model recently proposed by Zhen et al.41 (equation S(7) in their Supplementary

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Lithium ion intercalation into van der Waals gap could change the thermal transport of MoS2 due to several distinct mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the 2D layer spacing might change as a result of lithiation10,11,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a recent theoretical work found that intercalated lithium ions enhances the binding energy through orbital hybridizations between cations (lithium ions) and anions (MoS2) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the intercalated lithium donates electrons to MoS2, which changes the oxidation states of Mo, and hence the electronic properties of MoS2 (refs 33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, intercalation drives a phase transition from the semiconductor 2H phase to the metallic 1T phase19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The increase of electrical conductivity caused by the phase transition from the semiconductor 2H to metallic 1T phase cannot explain the changes in the in-plane thermal conductivity of bulk LixMoS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study shows the in-plane electrical conductivity of the metallic phase (1T) LiMoS2 is 300 S cm1, 500 times that of the semiconducting phase (2H) MoS2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding electronic contribution to the total thermal conductivity, predicted by the WiedemannFranz law, is only 0.2 W m1 K1 in LiMoS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a small increase cannot be the predominant mechanism to account for the in-plane thermal conductivity change in bulk LixMoS2 from 45 to 80 W m1 K1 for x=0.34 to 0.86.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We applied the LeibfriedSchlomann (LS) equation to evaluate the effect of changes in lattice spacing, elastic constants and mass density on the thermal conductivity of LixMoS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LS equation only considers changes in three-phonon scattering rates and takes the form , where  is the mass of a unit cell, 3 corresponds to atomic volume, T is temperature,  is the Grüneisen parameter for the relevant direction of heat transfer, D is the Debye frequency for the relevant direction of heat transfer, and B is an amalgam of physical constants36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the Debye frequency defined as D=vDkD, where kD is the Debye cutoff vector, vD is the speed of sound, we can express the thermal conductivity , where B is a constant, Cij is the elastic constant and  is the density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering a 4% increase in atomic mass of the unit cell, 11% increase in density, 18% decrease in the effective elastic constant  and 0.5% increase in lattice spacing for LixMoS2 thin films from x=0 to 1, the LS equation predicts a 33% decrease in the through-plane thermal conductivity, if we assume that the change in Grüneisen parameter is negligible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since TDTR measurement shows that through-plane thermal conductivity of thin-film LixMoS2 decreases continuously from 3.4 to 1.7 W m1 K1 from x=0 to 1, we conclude that the softening of the lattice is a significant contribution to the reduction in thermal conductivity in LixMoS2 thin films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Similarly for the bulk samples, if we consider the changes of elastic constants, lattice spacing, density and atomic mass in a unit cell to be 11%, 0.5%, 3.3%, 3.8%, respectively from x=0 to x=0.86, the through-plane thermal conductivity is estimated to increase by 14%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under the same assumptions, the through-plane thermal conductivity of LixMoS2 should increase by 5% from x=0 to x=0.34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a small change and different trends indicate the lattice expansion and elastic constant change cannot explain the pronounced change in the through-plane thermal conductivity that we observed in bulk LixMoS2 samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interestingly, Raman spectroscopy of bulk LixMoS2 samples revealed that the A1g mode peak splits into two peaks at 402 and 408 cm1, while the E2g2 peak slightly broadens in the x=0.34 sample suggesting the co-existence of 2H and 1T phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peak splitting was related to the Davydov pairs of the optical phonon branches due to the splitting of intra-layer modes caused by the interlayer interaction when the lithium content is below x=0.34 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We do not yet have a good understanding why the split of  peak is not clearly observed in the x=0.34 sample but it may be related to the intermediate atomic structure in the not-completed phase-change process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both high- and low-frequency Raman spectra provide evidence of increasing stacking disorder and mixture of phases during lithiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As a result of co-existence of two phases and increasing stacking disorder, phonon-boundary scattering increases and thermal conductivity in both through-plane and in-plane directions decrease until the largest degree of disorder is reached at x0.34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As intercalation proceeds, the bulk MoS2 sample becomes increasingly dominated by the 1T phase (0.34 less_than x less_than 0.86) and the phonon-boundary scattering rate decreases, and hence the thermal conductivity starts to increase again.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our most striking observation is that the thermal anisotropy ratio of the bulk LixMoS2 increases from 52 (x=0) to 110 (x=0.34) with increasing disorder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This trend of thermal anisotropy ratio change with respect to the structural defects or disorder is indeed counter-intuitive and beyond any previous works.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, a recent study of graphene oxide films by Renteria et al.14 shows an increase of thermal anisotropy ratio attributed to decreasing disorder after annealing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Luckyanova et al.13 found that the thermal anisotropy ratio decreases with interface atomic mixing in superlattices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thermal anisotropy ratio of a disordered WSe2 crystal, 30, is similar to the anisotropy ratio of well-ordered WSe2 crystals37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our measurements of lithiated MoS2 bulk crystal demonstrate that lithiation-induced stacking disorder and phase transition can increase the thermal anisotropy ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Phononphonon and phonon-boundary scattering are the two possible major scattering mechanisms in bulk LixMoS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As discussed above, we estimated the change of the intrinsic lattice thermal conductivity that is limited by phononphonon interactions due to the changes in elastic constants and atomic densities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The predicted change in the intrinsic phononphonon scattering rates is small and we therefore exclude changes in phononphonon scattering as the dominant mechanism in lithiated bulk LixMoS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of our Raman spectroscopy dataand the pronounced change in the thermal conductivity of bulk samplessuggest that phonon scattering in bulk LixMoS2 is dominated by phonon-boundary scattering due to stacking disorder created by the phase transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In highly anisotropic layered materials, boundary-limited phonon mean-free paths in the in-plane and through-plane directions can differ by orders-of-magnitude due to the combination of phonon-focusing effects and divergent length scales of disorder in the in-plane versus through-plane directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When boundary scattering dominates the phonon mean-free paths, phonon-focusing produces anisotropic phonon mean-free path even in cubic crystals39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent modelling study40 demonstrates that thin films of graphite can maintain their high in-plane thermal conductivity even for film thickness as small as 10 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, in highly anisotropic crystals, boundary scattering along the c-axis has only a minimal effect on the ab-plane thermal conductivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further experimental evidence of this effect comes from a recent experimental study41 of CVD-grown graphite thin films where the phonon mean-free paths are different by more than an order of magnitude: the in-plane phonon mean-free path is 300 nm and the through-plane mean-free path is  less_than 20 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although a sophisticated phonon transport model is needed to rigorously analyse how different phonon branches are affected by boundaries and other forms of disorder, we can estimate how the boundary-limited phonon mean-free paths in the c-axis Lc and in the ab-plane Lab change with x by comparing our measured thermal conductivities with previous studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compare the measured in-plane thermal conductivities of bulk LixMoS2 with the thermal conductivity of single-layer MoS2 predicted by a first-principle based Boltzmann transport equation calculation as a function of phonon-boundary scattering42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This comparison suggests Lab decreases from  greater than 1 m to 200 nm for x=00.34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Similarly, the comparison between our measured through-plane thermal conductivity of bulk LixMoS2 and that predicted by first-principle based Boltzmann transport equation calculations suggests Lc200 nm at x=0 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lowest through-plane thermal conductivity in our bulk samples is comparable to that of turbostratic nano-crystalline MoS2 thin films deposited by magnetron sputtering36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the turbostratic thin-film samples, the length of coherent stacking is unknown but should be less than the grain size 5 nm (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The similar stacking disorder in our bulk samples LixMoS2 suggests the Lc less_than 5 nm at x=0.34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A plausible explanation for this pronounced phonon mean-free path difference is that the lithium ions diffuse more easily along the in-plane direction compared with the through-plane direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the density of disorder caused by lithium ion intercalation is less pronounced along the in-plane direction, Both Lc and Lab reach their minimum values with the maximum mixing of the two phases at x=0.34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, we noticed that the through-plane thermal conductivity of thin-film LixMoS2 sample is much lower than the in-plane thermal conductivity of the bulk LixMoS2 sample, and the trends in through-plane thermal conductivity as a function of x are different for bulk and thin-film samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with bulk MoS2, the basal planes in LixMoS2 thin films contain high density of defects, especially point defects and oxygen impurities introduced during the chemical-vapour growth process of the thin sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Defects can significantly reduce the thermal conductivity of 2D materials by enhancing phonon scattering45,46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the semiconductor 2H to metallic 1T phase transition also occurs in the thin-film sample as indicated by the plateau in the discharge curve, unlike the bulk sample, the thermal conductivity of defective thin-film LixMoS2 is more sensitive to lattice softening than stacking disorder47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of our elastic constants measurement results and estimation by LS equation, we attribute the decreasing trend of thermal conductivity in LixMoS2 thin films with increasing lithium content x to the softening of the lattice and the increased phonon-boundary scattering at the grain or phase boundaries48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We investigated the anisotropic thermal transport in bulk crystal and CVD-grown thin-film MoS2 samples with different amounts of lithium ion intercalation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated that intercalation impacts thermal transport in bulk and thin-film samples differently, depending on the crystalline quality of the 2D structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we found that lithiation tends to reduce the phonon mean-free path more along the through-plane direction in LixMoS2, rather than the in-plane direction, until the largest degree of disorder is reached at x0.34, leading to a significant increase in the thermal anisotropy ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work provides insight on the impact of structural and compositional changes (for example, disorder, layer spacing and interfaces) on 2D materials applications, where thermal management is crucial.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
