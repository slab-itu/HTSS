Wave-based liquid-interface metamaterials  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The control of matter motion at liquidgas interfaces opens an opportunity to create two-dimensional materials with remotely tunable properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In analogy with optical lattices used in ultra-cold atom physics, such materials can be created by a wave field capable of dynamically guiding matter into periodic spatial structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show experimentally that such structures can be realized at the macroscopic scale on a liquid surface by using rotating waves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wave angular momentum is transferred to floating micro-particles, guiding them along closed trajectories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These orbits form stable spatially periodic patterns, the unit cells of a two-dimensional wave-based material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such dynamic patterns, a mirror image of the concept of metamaterials, are scalable and biocompatible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They can be used in assembly applications, conversion of wave energy into mean two-dimensional flows and for organising motion of active swimmers.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Controlled manipulation of particles on a surface is important in a variety of material science and bio-engineering applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly self-assembly, or the autonomous organization of components into patterns or structures, has become a fast growing interdisciplinary research area1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The controlled arrangement of particles on a liquid surface would offer a flexible and tunable method of engineering surface properties, such as, for example, electrical or thermal conductivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recently new approaches to the manipulation of particles at a fluid surface have been proposed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They rely on the generation of surface waves to control the motion of particles at the liquidgas interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, parametrically excited waves are generated when a liquid surface is vertically vibrated beyond a certain acceleration threshold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such waves, often referred to as Faraday waves4, are modulationally unstable5 and are readily broken into ensembles of localised oscillating solitons, or oscillons6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In viscous liquids, oscillons can create spatially periodic patterns and it has been proposed that such patterns can be viewed as metamaterials8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The idea of employing Faraday wave patterns as templates for micro-scale assembly applications has recently been discussed9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current understanding of what is achievable with those waves often relies on properties of particles such as their wettability and their density10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'At lower fluid viscosity, steep oscillons form disordered wave fields which are coupled to a random motion of fluid particles at the surface12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This motion represents a macroscopic Brownian walk, where the diffusion of particles at the surface can be modified by changing the wave height and the wave length14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown that the properties of this interface are consistent with diffusion at thermal equilibrium, and as such, it can be viewed as a tunable thermal metafluid15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Another approach relies on propagating waves originating from a localized source to control the motion of fluid particles on the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case particles can be guided away from the wave source, as well as towards the source in the so-called tractor beam regime16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, as for Faraday waves, the waves are essentially nonlinear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we show that there is another way of organising particles on a liquidgas interface which is analogous to a method used in low-temperature physics to trap atoms in spatially periodic optical lattices17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose a method of remotely shaping the particle trajectories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It uses linear three-dimensional (3D) surface waves and relies solely on hydrodynamic forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main idea can be described as a combination of the concept of rotating waves, created by a superposition of two small-amplitude standing waves, and the Lagrangian drift of particles along closed paths in such waves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though rotating waves (electromagnetic or acoustic) are usually generated in cylindrical resonators18,19, we show below that periodic patterns of rotating waves can be created in a square geometry, similarly to optical lattices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On a fluid surface, such waves rotate within sub-wavelength cells and possess local angular momentum which is transferred to the matter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism produces particle trajectories in the form of a spatially periodic lattice of nested orbitals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method offers a high degree of control over the particle motion and the ability to confine particles to spatially periodic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present experimental results on the creation and control of such dynamical liquid metamaterials, develop a theoretical model of particle trajectories and characterize the transport properties of a multi-unit cell lattice.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#
