Anti-tubulin drugs conjugated to anti-ErbB antibodies selectively radiosensitize  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Tumour resistance to radiotherapy remains a barrier to improving cancer patient outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome radioresistance, certain drugs have been found to sensitize cells to ionizing radiation (IR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In theory, more potent radiosensitizing drugs should increase tumour kill and improve patient outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In practice, clinical utility of potent radiosensitizing drugs is curtailed by off-target side effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report potent anti-tubulin drugs conjugated to anti-ErbB antibodies selectively radiosensitize to tumours based on surface receptor expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While two classes of potent anti-tubulins, auristatins and maytansinoids, indiscriminately radiosensitize tumour cells, conjugating these potent anti-tubulins to anti-ErbB antibodies restrict their radiosensitizing capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of translational significance, we report that a clinically used maytansinoid ADC, ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), with IR prolongs tumour control in target expressing HER2+ tumours but not target negative tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to ErbB signal inhibition, our findings establish an alternative therapeutic paradigm for ErbB-based radiosensitization using antibodies to restrict radiosensitizer delivery.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy form the basis of curative organ sparing therapy for patients with locally advanced cancers1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemotherapy not only has intrinsic anti-tumour activity but can sometimes sensitize tumours to radiation kill.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 1990s saw multiple randomized trials unequivocally demonstrate combining cytotoxic chemotherapy (that is, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil and taxanes) with radiotherapy to improve tumour control and patient survival4,5,6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the morbidity of such intensive regimens precludes development of more potent radiosensitizing chemotherapies10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shockingly two decades later, non-targeted cytotoxic chemotherapies continue to remain the most effective approach for patients treated with concurrent chemo-radiotherapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To be clinically useful, radiosensitizing chemotherapies must improve the therapeutic index, that is, the level of tumour cell sensitization must be greater than surrounding normal tissue10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In theory, molecularly targeted radiosensitizers blocking tumour-specific pathways should increase the therapeutic index of IR by improving tumour control and decreasing side effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identification of ErbB (EGFR, HER2) playing a role in tumour radioresistance has led to attempts to sensitize tumours by inhibiting receptor signalling13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the efficacy of ErbB signal inhibition is limited because tumours have parallel signalling pathways circumventing the blockade21,22,23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibody drug conjugates (ADC) are emerging as a tumour targeted delivery strategy to restrict localization of drugs to tumours while sparing normal tissue26,27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ADC consist of a drug (warhead) covalently attached to an antibody recognizing a specific cell surface receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ADC binds to cells expressing the receptor, is then internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and finally the drug is released from the antibody by the action of endolysosomal proteases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maytansinoids and auristatins are potent anti-tubulin drugs that have been conjugated to antibodies with demonstrated clinical efficacy29,30,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we have recently discovered that monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) is a radiosensitizer, effective at the single nM level33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We hypothesized that therapeutic antibodies to ErbB receptors could direct delivery of highly potent anti-tubulin drugs in a receptor-restricted manner to selectively radiosensitize tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis in tumour model systems, we initially synthesized two ADC in which the anti-tubulin drug monomethyl auristatin E was conjugated to cetuximab or trastuzumab (C-MMAE and T-MMAE, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C-MMAE and T-MMAE bound and restricted MMAE activity and toxicity to EGFR and HER2 expressing tumour cells, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly while free MMAE radiosensitized indiscriminately, antibody conjugation resulted in targeted MMAE radiosensitization to EGFR or HER2 expressing tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To delineate the translational potential of these findings, we extended our studies to the clinically approved anti-tubulin ADC, ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that T-DM1 radiosensitized HER2 expressing tumours specifically resulting in significantly increased tumour xenograft control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of these findings, we propose antibody drug conjugate based chemo-radiotherapy paradigms designed to focus on antibody directed delivery of highly potent radiosensitizing chemotherapies as an alternative to receptor signal inhibition.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Efficacy of anti-ErbB antibodies conjugated to Cy5 and MMAE', 'To test if ADC can restrict MMAE radiosensitization to tumours, we conjugated MMAE to cetuximab (C-MMAE) and trastuzumab (T-MMAE) and labelled them with Cy5 for tracking (Supplementary Figs 1a and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cetuximab and trastuzumab were labelled at endogenous cysteines by selective reduction of the four disulfides in the hinge region and conjugation confirmed by ES-HPLC, with drug loading measured as 3.7 and 3.2 MMAE per molecule of cetuximab and trastuzumab, respectively and with 1 Cy5 (refs 34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used thiol-reactive maleimide derivatives of MMAE containing cathepsin-B cleavable valinecitrulline linkers that are present in the clinically approved ADC, brentuximab vedotin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first evaluated the functionality of C-MMAE and T-MMAE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EGFR expressing CAL-27 head and neck cancer (HNC) cells were treated with C-MMAE and imaged by direct fluorescence (Fig 1a, Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By 30 min, Cy5 fluorescence localized to the cell surface and also was internalized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then tested the specificity of C-MMAE and T-MMAE in a panel of cancer cell lines from different histologies treated with chemo-radiotherapy, HNC, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and esophageal (Fig 1b, Supplementary Fig 3a, Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C-MMAE bound to EGFR expressing CAL-27, A549 and CALU3 cells with decreasing affinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T-MMAE demonstrated high affinity to the HER2 expressing cell lines CALU3, OE19 and BT474.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confocal microscopy results were validated by measuring cell surface binding of C-MMAE and T-MMAE (Fig 1c, Supplementary Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CAL-27 cells bound to C-MMAE in a dose-dependent manner but not T-MMAE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, HER2 expressing cell lines, OE19, CALU3, and BT474 demonstrated dose-dependent binding of T-MMAE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next assessed if C-MMAE and T-MMAE retained MMAE functional activity of arresting cells in G2/M.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Morphologically, CAL-27 cells treated with either free MMAE or C-MMAE appeared identical with cells rounding up, indicative of G2/M (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OE19 and CAL-27 cells treated with free MMAE resulted in cells accumulating in G2/M, the most radiosensitive phase of the cell cycle (Fig 1e, Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In OE19 cells, T-MMAE blocked cells in G2/M in contrast to C-MMAE or antibodies alone which did not influence the cell cycle profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In CAL-27 cells, C-MMAE resulted in G2/M arrest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, our Cy5-labelled C-MMAE allowed discrimination of EGFR cell surface receptor availability that directly correlated with the potency of C-MMAE to free MMAE in EGFR expressing cell lines (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Anti-ErbB antibody MMAE conjugates bind in a receptor-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) CAL-27 (EGFR+) cells exposed to 2 nM of Cy5-labelled C-MMAE for 30 min then incubated in drug-free media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were fixed at indicated times and imaged for Cy5 fluorescence (red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclei stained with DAPI (blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 10 m.

targeted', 'Similar to the auristatins (for example, MMAE), maytansinoids (for example, mertansine) are another potent class of anti-tubulins29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, mertansine forms the warhead of the trastuzumab ADC T-DM1, and is attached to lysine residues of trastuzumab through a thiol ether linker (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T-DM1 (Kadcyla) has shown efficacy in HER2 expressing metastatic breast cancer patients29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given our findings that T-MMAE selectively radiosensitized HER2 expressing cancer cells, we decided to evaluate the more immediate clinical potential of our strategy by testing if T-DM1 radiosensitized tumours in a HER2+ selective manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we tested if the maytansinoid warhead of T-DM1 was a bona fide radiosensitizer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HCT116 or CAL-27 cells were treated overnight with mertansine and then irradiated with 2 Gy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cell lines, the surviving fraction following 2 Gy decreased further in cells treated with free mertansine compared with vehicle (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Irrespective of HER2 expression, the IC50 of mertansine was fairly consistent across cell lines 10 nM (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, T-DM1 potency directly correlated with HER2 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In HER2+ cell lines (OE19 and NCI N87 (gastric cancer)) the IC50 of T-DM1 was  less_than 1 nM but was  greater than 100 nM in HER2- cells(HCT116 and CAL-27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a translation point of view, T-DM1 was a more potent cytotoxic drug in HER2+ OE19 cells compared with clinically used radiosensitizers that are either cytotoxic (paclitaxel and cisplatin) or targeted to HER2 (trastuzumab and lapatinib) or EGFR (erlotinib) (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However in HER2- CAL-27 cells, paclitaxel was more potent than T-DM1 (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functionally, mertansine increased the accumulation of both OE19 and HCT116 cells in the radiosensitive G2/M phase of the cell cycle (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While T-DM1 also blocked OE19 cells in G2/M, the cell cycle profile of HCT16 cells treated with T-DM1 resembled vehicle-treated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we tested if T-DM1 would restrict mertansine mediated radiosensitization in a HER2-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unconjugated mertansine (20 nM) radiosensitized by increasing IR induced DNA double-strand breaks in both HER2+ and HER2 cell lines (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, 20 nM T-DM1 resulted in restricted radiosensitization of HER2+ cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with T-DM1s increased potency and ability to arrest cells in G2/M confined to HER2+ cells, trastuzumab conjugation reversed mertansines ability to increase IR induced DNA double-strand breaks, making it appear inert to irradiated non-HER2 expressing cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At these dose levels, trastuzumab did not result in any significant radiosensitization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, doses as low as 2 nM T-DM1 radiosensitized OE19 cells (HER2+) as they accumulated in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (Fig 3d,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Clinical grade anti-tubulin ADC T-DM1 radiosensitizes

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Unresectable, locally advanced cancers continue to pose a therapeutic challenge1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most effective chemo-radiotherapy strategies to date integrate non-targeted cytotoxic chemotherapies3,4,5,6,7,8,9,39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, such therapeutic intensification increases normal tissue toxicities often precluding further radiotherapy or chemotherapy dose escalation10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To mitigate treatment related side effects and allow for more potent radiosensitizing chemotherapies, tumour targeted radiosensitization approaches are required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While targeted drug therapies have advanced for certain cancer patients with specific mutations, outside of cetuximab none have demonstrated unequivocal clinical utility with radiotherapy when compared directly with non-targeted cytotoxic chemotherapies12,13,41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frustratingly, adding cetuximab to cytotoxic chemo-radiotherapy in NSCLC or HNC patients failed to improve outcomes37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While inhibiting ErbB signalling is an appealing approach to radiosensitize tumours, attempted blockage of receptor tyrosine kinase signalling results in activation of bypass pathways, that is the whack a mole problem21,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome this, we propose an alternative ErbB mediated radiosensitization paradigm based on ErbB directed ADC that is more potent and potentially superior to signal inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We initially evaluated the auristatin class (MMAE) of anti-tubulins as ADC-based radiosensitizers for three reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, it is the warhead of brentuximab vedotin, a clinically used ADC for CD30 lymphomas that is attached through a cathepsin B sensitive and self-immolative linker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, this allowed for direct measurement of tumour drug delivery (Fig 4)35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we have previously demonstrated that in addition to its cytotoxic activity, MMAE is a potent radiosensitizer33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, Cy5 labelling during ADC synthesis allowed for non-invasive imaging of ADC localization and served as a marker for antibody targeting which was validated by tumour drug delivery and activity of blocking cells in G2/M.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our synthesized ADC showed tumour accumulation of T-MMAE or C-MMAE in a receptor-restricted manner which resulted in tumour selective MMAE radiosensitization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given our findings with C-MMAE and T-MMAE, we extended our studies to the clinically approved ADC, T-DM1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with auristatins, we found that the maytansinoid class of anti-tubulins also were potent radiosensitizers as either free drug or as the trastuzumab ADC, T-DM1 (Figs 3 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Delivering ADC with IR has several advantages that can result in improved patient outcomes: (1) Combinatorial therapy attacks cancer cells by multiple mechanisms decreasing the risk of tumour resistance emerging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2) Instead of higher individual doses of a single agent to achieve effective tumour kill, combinatorial therapy allows for dose reduction of each individual modality thereby decreasing the toxicities inherently associated with each therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (3) concurrent delivery of full dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy allow for attacking not only known local disease but also potential micrometastases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (4) Ideally, chemotherapies used in conjunction with radiotherapy will be highly potent alone, synergize with IR, and be spatially targeted to tumours and not normal tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (5) The precise timing with which IR can be delivered is valuable for defining the temporal window(s) when radiosensitization should be maximal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Auristatin and maytansinoid based ADC fulfill these criteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, there are only two indications for which ADC has shown clinical value, CD30 lymphomas and HER2 metastatic breast cancer30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our studies and in particular those involving T-DM1, suggest integrating ADC in the curative setting for locally advanced solid tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HER2 overexpression occurs in a proportion of lung, esophageal, gastric and bladder cancers, which are treated with concurrent chemo-radiotherapy2,3,43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of our findings, T-DM1 provides potent and tumour selective radiosensitization that warrants speedy clinical evaluation and may help expedite the evolution of tumour radiosensitization from decades old non-targeted cytotoxins to a biomarker-driven tumour-targeted paradigm.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
