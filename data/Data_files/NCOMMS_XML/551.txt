Wnt and Neuregulin1/ErbB signalling extends 3D culture of hormone responsive mammary organoids  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The development of in vitro culture systems quantitatively and qualitatively recapitulating normal breast biology is key to the understanding of mammary gland biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current three-dimensional mammary culture systems have not demonstrated concurrent proliferation and functional differentiation ex vivo in any system for longer than 2 weeks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we identify conditions including Neuregulin1 and R-spondin 1, allowing maintenance and expansion of mammary organoids for 2.5 months in culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The organoids comprise distinct basal and luminal compartments complete with functional steroid receptors and stem/progenitor cells able to reconstitute a complete mammary gland in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternative conditions are also described that promote enrichment of basal cells organized into multiple layers surrounding a keratinous core, reminiscent of structures observed in MMTV-Wnt1 tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These conditions comprise a unique tool that should further understanding of normal mammary gland development, the molecular mechanism of hormone action and signalling events whose deregulation leads to breast tumourigenesis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A detailed knowledge of normal mammary gland development and the mechanisms driving its molecular, cellular and hormonal regulation, is fundamental to an understanding of the initiation and progression of breast cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mammary gland consists of an elaborate, tree-like network of branched ducts and lobular alveolar structures, embedded within a stromal fat pad.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bilayered ductal and alveolar structures possess an inner layer of luminal epithelial cells surrounding a central lumen, and an outer layer of basal cells, enveloped by a laminin-rich basement membrane separating the parenchymal and stromal compartments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The luminal cell layer is composed of two functionally distinct lineages defined by the expression or absence of steroid hormone receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The basal cell population consists of myoepithelial cells with contractile properties and presumptive multipotent mammary stem cells, although distinct unipotent stem cells committed to either luminal or basal lineages have also been reported1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The development of three-dimensional (3D) mammary gland in vitro culture systems has contributed greatly to the understanding of mammary gland biology, offering insights into cellcell interactions, paracrine signalling, cell proliferation, differentiation and hormonal regulation3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, research into the stem cell niche and breast carcinogenesis has been facilitated by the ability to culture complex multicellular mammary structures in 3D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus far, however, studies have yet to establish culture conditions concurrently enabling sustained proliferation, stem cell maintenance and functional differentiation in tissues ex vivo for extended periods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, a recent strategy combining Wnt-3a-mediated Wnt signalling activation and epidermal growth factor (EGF) treatment allows long-term expansion of murine mammary stem cells able to form small, disorganized round colonies in 3D culture6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, a cocktail of biological factors including insulin, EGF or fibroblast growth factor allow the short-term maintenance of polarized epithelial cells surrounding a lumen that contains distinct basal and luminal cell compartments in which cells express steroid receptors5,7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, the outer basal layer possesses a discontinuous cellular structure, while the expression of steroid receptors and cell proliferation are strongly decreased, with organoids maintained at most for 1421 days in culture5,8,9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In an effort to extend the time over which stem cell activity, functional differentiation and cellular organization can be concurrently maintained within mammary organoids, we identify novel culture conditions, including Neuregulin1 (Nrg1) and low concentrations of R-spondin 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, luminal cells retain functional steroid hormone receptor-positive and -negative cells, while basal cells contain functional stem/progenitor cells and differentiated myoepithelial cells, for 2.5 months in culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirm the role of Wnt signalling in driving organoid growth using small molecule Wnt inhibitors and a Tet-O-N89 -catenin transgenic system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, lentiviral knockdown of Nrg1 receptors validates the important role of Nrg1 signalling in mammary organoid development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, cells capable of forming mammary organoids containing each cell type are identified within the luminal oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative cell population.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Recent advances in 3D culture systems have enabled the establishment of organoids from various tissues that are remarkably similar in organization and structure to the organs that they are derived from4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we describe the first defined in vitro culture system that robustly recapitulates the murine mammary duct differentiation found in situ and allows the extended maintenance of normal primary mammary epithelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rspo/Nrg1-dependent mammary organoids contain distinct basal and luminal cell compartments, the latter comprising of both ER+ and ER subtypes and progenitor cells that enable organoid expansion for multiple passages over the course of 2.5 months, a significant advancement over previously described mammary culture conditions5,8,9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crucially, the utility of the system is further enhanced by the maintenance of hormone responsive cells that retain functional steroid receptors capable of regulating known downstream target genes, such as RankL and Wnt4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the organized 3D structures grown here also have full regenerative potential as demonstrated by their ability to successfully recreate a complete mammary ductal tree in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, organoids can be genetically manipulated in culture for further study or transplantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, the data suggest that this in vitro 3D culture system can serve as an instrumental tool for investigating mammary gland biology, in addition for potential drug-screening applications, as demonstrated here using Wnt signalling inhibitors and HGF supplementation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The reproductive history and lifetime hormone exposure of a woman is intimately linked to her breast cancer risk44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, a further understanding of normal mammary gland development, in particular the molecular mechanisms of hormone action, is critical for identifying the events that can lead to breast tumourigenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Steroid hormones have been reported to expand mammary stem cells in vivo, although the precise factors that contribute towards maintaining the stem cell niche remain poorly defined30,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a recent study has demonstrated maintenance of PR expression in culture over 14 days10, most previous culture systems have failed to maintain long-term expression of ER and PR in 3D cultures of normal mammary epithelium, leaving the investigation of mechanisms of hormonal regulation to be principally driven by the use of ER/PR+ breast cancer cell lines in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, the mammary 3D organoid culture method described provides an excellent system in which to study such regulation of normal mammary epithelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, a recent study utilizing a highly similar matrigel-based 3D in vitro system demonstrated that single luminal epithelial progenitors can generate prostate organoids in culture, and that these also retained functional hormone (androgen) receptor expression and downstream signalling46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The Wnt signalling pathway is an important regulator of ductal and lobulo-alveolar development and contributes to the self-renewal and maintenance of basal cells, including mammary stem cells6,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Wnt signalling potentiator Rspo has been implicated in many in vitro systems that maintain and expand adult tissue stem cells, including the intestine13, stomach14 and liver15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of Rspo was required in our (Neu/Rspo-low) culture system, to support the growth and differentiation of the basal cell layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, a recent study showed that mammary luminal ER/PR-negative cells selectively secrete Rspo, while Wnt4 is predominantly expressed in ER/PR-positive cells47, suggesting a model for the hormonal regulation of basal mammary stem cells, whereby these two luminal cell types provide the niche (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In further support of this, the induction of Wnt4 by progesterone in luminal ER/PR-positive cells has been suggested to drive lobular development in pregnancy via its effects on basal stem cells47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our studies argue that the highest Rspo levels induce the development of undifferentiated and basal-only structures, together with squamous metaplasia, as characteristic of MMTV-Wnt1-driven mammary tumours in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interesting observation suggests that a just right level of Wnt signalling may be necessary for normal mammary development in which differentiated luminal and basal cells are present within the same structures48, in contrast to other tissues (for example, the intestine), which require high levels of R-spondin 1 for long-term 3D in vitro culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The requirement for basal-to-luminal Nrg1/ErbB4 signalling in pregnancy has also been recently reported35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nrg1, which is reportedly secreted by basal cells, directly regulates ErbB4-positive luminal progenitors and promotes their proliferation and differentiation35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The work presented here supports and refines this analysis by demonstrating that cells that respond to Nrg1 are more likely to reside in the population of luminal ER cells that express high levels of the ErbB3 and ErbB4 Nrg1 receptors (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we observed that CD24high Sca1 luminal ER cells generate mammary organoids containing distinct epithelial compartments, suggesting that these cells can contribute to both luminal and basal cell lineages in vitro, and highlighting their potential high plasticity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this finding contrasts with the current model of mammary cell hierarchy whereby luminal progenitors remain committed to the luminal lineage in vivo1,2, in the context of transplantation, it is not uncommon for luminal ER progenitor cells to generate both basal and luminal cell lineages29,49, implying that transdifferentiation of these cells may be possible in unusual physiological settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, luminal-to-basal reversion has been documented in breast cancer where luminal tumour cells can acquire basal identity during invasion50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 8: Model of the Wnt/Nrg1 paracrine signalling network between luminal and basal mammary epithelial cells.Basal cells secrete Nrg1, resulting in Nrg1/ErbB signalling activation in luminal cells, promoting luminal progenitor

signalling in the basal stem/progenitor cell population via the Wnt receptors Fz and Lrp5/6 and the R-spondin 1 receptor Lgr5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wnt signalling activation in this compartment is likely to promote growth and differentiation of the basal cell layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fz, frizzled; Lgr5, leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5; Lrp5/6, low-density lipoprotein

potential, and crucially, using karyotype analysis previously implemented in multiple published organoid culture studies15,16,32, a normal (3941) chromosome count was observed after this period in culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, unlike comparable in vitro systems for the intestine that can maintain karyotypically normal cells in culture for over a year13, we observed that mammary organoids acquired chromosomal abnormalities after 4 months.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whilst the intestine is required to continually regenerate throughout life to maintain normal physiological function, the inherent lifespan of the mammary gland in contrast is relatively finite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with our findings, Daniel and Young51 observed that growth senescence was achieved on serial transplantation of mammary epithelial cells, in a manner directly related to the number of cell divisions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observation may therefore reflect the intrinsic biology of the breast as compared with other tissues, and merits further investigation in future studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By facilitating the simultaneous growth and maintenance of multiple mammary epithelial cell types in culture, the in vitro system described herein allows hormonal regulation and the inter-cellular signalling between basal and luminal compartments to be studied in an accessible, but normal mammary epithelial cell environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, organoids are amenable to lentiviral infection thus facilitating their genetic manipulation in culture, in addition to possessing great potential as a drug-screening tool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, this system may facilitate the establishment of cancer organoid culture conditions, given that tumour cells will have arisen within a
