Incipient ferroelectricity of water molecules confined to nano-channels of beryl  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Water is characterized by large molecular electric dipole moments and strong interactions between molecules; however, hydrogen bonds screen the dipoledipole coupling and suppress the ferroelectric order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The situation changes drastically when water is confined: in this case ordering of the molecular dipoles has been predicted, but never unambiguously detected experimentally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study we place separate H2O molecules in the structural channels of a beryl single crystal so that they are located far enough to prevent hydrogen bonding, but close enough to keep the dipoledipole interaction, resulting in incipient ferroelectricity in the water molecular subsystem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe a ferroelectric soft mode that causes CurieWeiss behaviour of the static permittivity, which saturates below 10 K due to quantum fluctuations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ferroelectricity of water molecules may play a key role in the functioning of biological systems and find applications in fuel and memory cells, light emitters and other nanoscale electronic devices.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Ferroelectric materials exhibit a spontaneous electric polarization, that is, the elementary electric dipoles remain aligned in a certain direction without external electric field; the polarization can be reversed by applying a field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to these unique properties, ferroelectric compounds find a widespread use in microelectronics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extremely large electric dipole moment makes H2O molecules the ideal building blocks for ferroelectrics because they enable long-range electrical dipoledipole interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there is no firm experimental evidence so far for dipoledipole ordering within the subsystem of water molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of an ordered state of water molecules has been the subject of debate for decades1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In liquid water, ordering does not occur since the shorter-range H-bonds overwhelm the coupling of the dipoles and prevent the alignment of dipole moments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even in the solid state, where the oxygen atoms are arranged into an ordered crystal ice lattice, the protons remain disordered within experimentally accessible timescales1,4, thus leading to zero net macroscopic electrical polarization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proton ordering in cubic and hexagonal ice XI could lower the ground state energy5,6, but such ordering was never reliably realized in the laboratory or convincingly observed in outer space2,7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'More than a dozen phases of solid water are known in addition to the conventional hexagonal crystalline ice; and there are even more exotic forms of water, such as biological water, interfacial water, surface water or confined water, that often exhibit structural, dynamical or thermodynamical behaviours not commonly observed in the bulk state4,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the dimensionality of water can be decreased by confining the molecules to nanosized voids (pores and channels) or bringing them into contact with extended interfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A local disruption of the hydrogen-bond network and their rearrangement into new spatial configurations can, in particular, strengthen the effect of intermolecular dipoledipole interactions and create conditions favourable for aligning the water dipoles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This type of confined-water ferroelectricity is believed to play a significant role in various phenomena and areas of natural sciences (for example, geology, mineralogy, meteorology, soil chemistry, biology, pharmaceutics, food industry and materials science), including the living organisms (water in cells and membrane channels, and proteins hydration shells14,15,16,17) and even in the universe (formation of planets or of prebiotic compounds7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Various possibilities for the emergence of confined-water ferroelectricity have been analysed with the help of theoretical studies and computer simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Water molecules are predicted to undergo numerous ferroelectric orderings, either when forming nanometre-thick ice layers on two-dimensional (2D) substrates or when confined in nanoscale spaces, such as carbon nanotubes (see, for example, refs 18, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these cases the suppression of dipolar interactions by the hydrogen bonds is predicted to be weakened by their reorientation to some external surface, closed or open.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As far as the experimental realization of the dipolar ordering is concerned, the situation is not so unambiguous and clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the one hand, there seem to be firm indications towards ordered (ferroelectric or antiferroelectric) arrangements of the water molecules within the one-dimensional (1D) channels of carbon nanotubes or molecular organic structures20,21, or on 2D surfaces9,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, either the fraction of the polarized dipoles is very low, of the order of 1% or even smaller22, limited to only few surface layers, or the reliability of the obtained results is put under discussion8,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One could imagine another kind of system that would favour ferroelectricity; one where the intermolecular hydrogen couplings are not reoriented by surface effects but are strongly weakened or completely absent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be realized by arranging separate water molecules into a certain matrix in such a way that the spacing r between the dipoles is sufficiently large to prevent short-range hydrogen bonds (interaction length 13 Å) but short enough to maintain long-range electric dipoledipole interaction (interaction length 10100 Å); such arrangement would favour the alignment of the dipole moments, that is, (anti)ferroelectricity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this Communication we present our study of the dielectric response of H2O molecules embedded into the matrix of the beryl crystal lattice with an intermolecular distance of 510 Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discover clear signatures of incipient ferroelectricity within the ensemble: a ferroelectric soft mode develops at terahertz frequencies resulting in the CurieWeiss dependence of the dielectric permittivity that saturates at the lowest temperatures due to quantum effects.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Material', 'The beryl crystals belong to the gemstone family with the chemical formula Be3Al2Si6O18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are naturally or artificially grown hexagonal crystals (space group P6/mcc) that appear in different colour variants depending on the doping by impurity ions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six-membered rings of SiO4 tetrahedra stacked along the hexagonal c axis form relatively large open channels, whose cross-section is modulated by bottlenecks of 2.8 Å separating cages of 5.1 Å in diameter24 (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystals grown in an aqueous environment contain water trapped in the framework of the crystal lattice in such a way that single H2O molecules reside within the cages; the molecules are trapped in the cages during the growth process, that is, when the cages are formed, and may diffuse to neighbouring vacant sites25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The H2O molecules in the beryl occur in two distinct orientations: either the two protons are aligned parallel to the c axis and the electric dipole points perpendicular to the c-direction (type I), or the dipole moment points parallel to the c axis (type II)26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two orientations of the water molecules are unambiguously verified in our crystals by observing the H2O intramolecular vibrational modes 1, 2 and 3 that couple to the polarized radiation strictly differently for the two orientations of the molecule, see Fig 3 in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The type II water molecules are relatively free to rotate around the c axis within the cavities25,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this simple case, only weak van der Waals interaction between water molecules and crystal framework remains26,31; the hexagonal symmetry imposes a six-well potential to the type I H2O molecules32 as schematically shown in Fig 1c by the dark green curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Schematic view of water molecules in nano-sized cages of the beryl crystal lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Water molecules confined in the channels within the beryl crystal lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three-dimensional and top views with the crystal plotted greyish and the water molecules coloured (oxygen red and hydrogen cyan).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 1D channels are arranged in a hexagonal fashion with 9.2 Å distance and contain cages in a distance of 4.6 Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Water molecules located within structural voids formed by lattice ions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cages (diameter 5.1 Å) are separated by narrower bottlenecks (2.8 Å).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecules of type I have their dipole moments (red arrows) perpendicular to the crystallographic c axis with the plane of H2O molecules parallel to c; they can perform hindered rotations around the c axis experiencing a six-well potential (depth A) due to the hexagonal crystal symmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Type II water molecules are turned by 90° relative to those of type I due to Coulomb interactions with alkali ions (Li and Na, shown in yellow) blocking the bottleneck; their dipole moments are directed along the c axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Dipole moments of type I molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The moments can rotate within the planes perpendicular to the c axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dipoledipole interactions (yellow wavy lines) act between the molecular dipoles within the channels where molecular doublets, triplets and so on are formed; the interactions between dipoles in adjacent channels are much weaker owing to their greater mutual distances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Photograph of the typical studied beryl crystal.Full size image', 'Let us estimate whether the water molecules, as sketched in Fig 1c, can actually develop a long-range dipolar order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dipoledipole interaction energy of two molecules can be expressed as Udd=p2r3, where p=1.85 D are the electric dipole moments33 separated by the distance r. In the case they are located in neighbouring cages within the same channel at the distance r=4.6 Å, one obtains Udd22 meV, corresponding to a temperature Udd/kB260 K (kB denotes the Boltzmann constant).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For nearest molecules in adjacent channels, r=9.2 Å and Udd3 meV (corresponding to 30 K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here the screening of the dipolar interaction by the crystal framework is neglected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentration of water in beryl crystals can be determined by chemical analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specimens used in the present study have a concentration of 0.3 H2O per formula unit, mostly of type I with the concentration of type II molecules not exceeding a few percent (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecules are statistically distributed over the cages with more than half of them in strands of two, three and even four molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of these simple estimates and considerations, ferroelectricity due to alignment of type I water molecules can be expected at temperatures comparable to room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To search for signs of ferroelectric ordering of water molecules experimentally, we have grown several high-quality beryl single crystals using hydrothermal techniques described in the Methods section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the help of broad-band dielectric spectroscopy, we looked for characteristic fingerprints of the ferroelectric phase due to ordering of rotatable type I molecules; in particular, we compared the dielectric response corresponding to the electric-field vector E of the probing radiation within the plane of molecular rotation, that is, Ec, with that for the E||c polarization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several spectrometers enabled us to record the complex dielectric permittivity =+i in the frequency range from =1 Hz up to 2.5 THz at temperatures between 0.3 and 800 K.
