Magnetic forces enable controlled drug delivery by disrupting endothelial cell-cell junctions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The vascular endothelium presents a major transport barrier to drug delivery by only allowing selective extravasation of solutes and small molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, enhancing drug transport across the endothelial barrier has to rely on leaky vessels arising from disease states such as pathological angiogenesis and inflammatory response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that the permeability of vascular endothelium can be increased using an external magnetic field to temporarily disrupt endothelial adherens junctions through internalized iron oxide nanoparticles, activating the paracellular transport pathway and facilitating the local extravasation of circulating substances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach provides a physically controlled drug delivery method harnessing the biology of endothelial adherens junction and opens a new avenue for drug delivery in a broad range of biomedical research and therapeutic applications.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The circulatory system provides an efficient route for the distribution of blood-borne substances throughout the body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the vascular endothelium, which lies at the interface between the blood and the tissue space, creates a transport barrier for pharmacologic agents by blocking the extravasation of any particulates larger than serum albumin molecules (66 kDa)1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Delivery of large drug molecules and drug carriers, including therapeutic proteins, nucleic acids and nanomaterials, occurs either only at the level of the vascular endothelium itself or when the permeability of the endothelial barrier is significantly increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, current drug delivery strategies are primarily aimed at treating solid tumours, in which large pores are opened along the endothelium of angiogenic vessels2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the success of delivering anticancer drugs is often impeded by the inherent heterogeneity in vascular permeability due to the complex interplay between the vessels and the tumour microenvironment4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In many other diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and central nervous system diseases, the vascular endothelium maintains its structural and functional integrity, preventing sufficient drug delivery into the tissue space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Circumventing endothelial barrier is, therefore, the key for achieving an adequate, uniform and targeted distribution of therapeutic agents in many critical disease treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Transport across the vascular endothelium can occur via either transcellular or paracellular route.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both are tightly regulated through a complex network of signalling pathways to maintain the homeostasis of tissue microenvironment1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These transport pathways have been utilized for developing efficient biological and biophysical delivery approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, antibodies targeting aminopeptidase P can trigger caveolae-mediated transcytosis in the lung endothelium, thus promoting cargo transport from blood into lung tissue5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infusion or superfusion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can increase vascular permeability and promote transvascular transport of macromolecules and nanoparticles into tumour tissue6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of VEGF on vascular permeability is partly attributed to its regulation of endothelial junctional proteins that control paracellular transport8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, intracarotid infusion of hyperosmotic agents or vessel dilators is used to transiently open the bloodbrain barrier by inducing endothelial cell shrinkage and vascular dilatation9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These approaches, however, lack the capability of targeting specific anatomic regions, which can lead to non-specific drug uptake and consequential adverse off-target effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, attempts have been made to use focused ultrasound and circulating microbubbles to generate localized enhancement of vascular permeability10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, several issues still remain to be addressed in this approach, including tissue heating, attenuation of ultrasound by complex anatomical structures and the rapid clearance of microbubbles by the mononuclear phagocyte system12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is, therefore, an urgent need for a more efficient target delivery approach in many disease treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Over the past few years, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have emerged as promising drug carriers in image-guided drug delivery, magnetic drug delivery, and synergistic chemotherapy and hyperthermia13,14,15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extensive studies have been performed to increase the internalization/accumulation of MNPs in vitro or in vivo with an externally applied magnetic field18,19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, as nano-sized magnets, MNPs have been utilized to deliver mechanical cues to living cells at the molecular level, which provides an unprecedented capability for controlling cell signalling pathways and intracellular events22,23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our previous studies, we have shown that magnetic force can enhance the endocytosis of MNPs by various cell types including human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) without affecting cell viability20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, in static culture, the magnetic force applied to intracellular MNPs can modulate the F-actin dynamics and organization in endothelial cells21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is known that VE-cadherin, the key component of endothelial adherens junctions that mediate the paracellular transport across the vascular endothelium, anchors to the actin cytoskeleton in integral endothelium, and this association between VE-cadherin and F-actin tightly controls endothelial barrier function26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alterations in actin filament organization induced by either actin-depolymerizing or -stabilizing substances can disrupt adherens junctions and increase vascular permeability28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this work, we investigate the intracellular magnetic force-induced structural and functional changes of the vascular endothelial barrier through in vitro studies using endothelialized microfluidic channels, and in vivo experiments with a mouse lateral tail vein model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that vascular permeability in a tissue can be increased magnetically through a two-step process using external magnetstargeting of MNPs to the vascular endothelium and disrupting the endothelial adherens junctions via intracellular magnetic forces from MNPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach provides a physically controlled drug delivery method that opens a new avenue for drug delivery in a broad range of biomedical research and therapeutic applications.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'MNPs and magnetic force', 'Both the magnetic properties of MNPs and the applied magnetic field are essential for targeted cellular internalization of MNPs and exerting adequate intracellular magnetic force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we synthesized magnetite nanocrystals (16 and 33 nm in diameter) through thermo-decomposition of iron acetylacetonate (Fig 1ac)30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both nanocrystals exhibited saturation magnetization approaching that of bulk magnetite but little remanence at zero field (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Water-dispersible MNPs were synthesized by coating the nanocrystals with phospholipid-poly(ethylene glycol) (Fig 1a, inset in Fig 1b; Supplementary Table 1)32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phospholipid coating facilitated labelling MNPs with DiI (ex/em=549/565 nm) or DiR (ex/em=710/780 nm) for their visualization in vitro and in vivo, respectively (Fig 1e; Supplementary Figs 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Properties of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (MNPs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) A schematic diagram of MNP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each MNP contains a magnetite nanocrystal and a phospholipidPEG coating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phospholipid layer provides anchoring sites for lipophilic fluorophores such as DiI or DiR for fluorescence tracing of MNP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b,c) TEM images of 16 and 33 nm diameter magnetite nanocrystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inset in b shows phospholipidPEG-coated MNPs negatively stained with phosphotungstic acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phospholipidPEG coating of MNPs appears as the white corona surrounding the dark nanocrystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 100 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Magnetization curves of MNPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Absorption and emission spectra of 16 nm MNPs labelled with DiI (16 nm/DiI) and 33 nm MNPs labelled with DiR (33 nm/DiR), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) Calculated magnetic force on individual MNPs as a function of the field strength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gradient of the magnetic flux density was assumed to be 100 T m1.Full size image', 'The applied magnetic field was created using NdFeB magnets (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spatial distribution of the magnetic field was determined by numerical simulation (Supplementary Methods; Supplementary Table 2; Supplementary Figs 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The field strength is 5,000 Oe on the surface of an NdFeB magnet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming a field gradient of 100 T m1, the magnetic force on individual MNPs is on the order of 1 fN and 900-fold higher than the gravitational force (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We then examined the magnetic force-regulated MNPs uptake and actin dynamics in static cell culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2a,b, the magnetic field markedly enhanced the uptake of MNPs by endothelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intracellular MNPs accumulated primarily in perinuclear lysosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of intracellular MNPs shows large variation among endothelial cells, owing to the heterogeneous magnetic force field used in cell culture (Fig 2c; Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of the iron content measurement, these cells contained 5.8±0.7 × 105 MNPs per cell (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the endothelial cells with MNPs were further incubated at the edge of an NdFeB block magnet, the total intracellular magnetic force parallel to the cell surface is on the order of 2 × 1010 N. After 1 h incubation, randomly distributed F-actin fibres in endothelial cells became aligned in the direction of the magnetic force (Fig 2e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that the total intracellular magnetic force is similar to the shear force experienced by the cells at a shear stress of 5 dyn cm2, assuming the surface area of an endothelial cell is 400 m2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It suggests that the MNPs and the magnets used in this study can generate an intracellular magnetic force with the same order of magnitude compared to the shear force on the vascular endothelium in capillaries and post-capillary venules at the surface of the body33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: The effect of magnetic force on endothelial cells in static culture.Endothelial cells were incubated with 16 nm MNPs without (a) or with (b) a magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Magnetic force increased uptake of MNPs (red) by endothelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intracellular MNPs co-localized with lysosomes (green).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the lysosomes were stained based on virus-delivered transgene expression, which was uneven among transfected cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blue, nuclei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Flow cytometry analysis of cellular uptake of MNPs without or with a magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Quantification of intracellular MNPs by iron content (mean±s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ; n=4; *P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Endothelial cells containing MNPs were further incubated without (e) or with (f) a magnetic field generated by an N52-grade rare-earth magnet (W × H × L=1/2 × 1/2 × 1), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) The stress fibres (green) of endothelial cells have a random orientation after internalizing MNPs (red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) After exposed to external magnetic force, stress fibres appear to align with the force (the arrow indicates the direction of magnetic force).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 20 m.Full size image', 'Endothelialized microfluidic channels', 'Endothelial cells can mechanosense the fluid shear stress exerted on the cell membrane and respond by organizing actin filaments along the flow direction34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The direction of the intracellular magnetic force relative to the shear stress is, therefore, likely to affect the organization and alignment of preformed actin filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We constructed an endothelialized microfluidic system, which not only provided a tightly controlled flow environment mimicking the physiologic hemodynamic conditions (110 dyn cm2) in blood vessels but also facilitated microscopic examination of the endothelium (Fig 3a,b)36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A confluent monolayer of endothelial cells covering the entire three-dimensional inner surface of microfluidic channels was cultured under physiologic flow conditions (Fig 3c,d; Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the vascular endothelium in vivo38, F-actin fibres in endothelial cells were located near the cellcell interface and aligned with the flow direction as well (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, adherens junctions visualized with VE-cadherin staining confirmed the continuity of cellcell interface (Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the microfluidic platform with a well-designed geometry enabled to better control the direction of magnetic force relative to the shear stress and the preformed F-actin fibres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Engineered in vitro endothelialized microfluidic channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Macroscopic view of a PDMS microdevice filled with red food colour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) CAD-based geometric pattern of the microfluidic system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The smallest channels in this pattern are 30 m in width, and the height of the channels after fabrication is also 30 m.

After that, the endothelialized channels were either directly fixed and stained for actin and VE-cadherin, or cultured overnight under flow before staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunostaining indicates that the two steps of magnetic force exposure led to disorganized endothelial actin filaments (g, red) and disrupted adherens junctions (h, green.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yellow arrows indicate the disrupted adherens junctions), while step I alone did not cause any change in actin organization (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the vascular endothelium became permeable to antibody molecules as visualized by collagen I staining (i, green).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After overnight recovery without magnetic force, the endothelial actin filaments reorganized (j, red) and the continuous adherens junctions were restored (k, green).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No collagen I staining was detectable, indicating the blockade of the endothelium to the antibody (l, green).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blue, nuclei;

Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, fz alone did not cause any detectable change in actin filaments (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In subsequent experiments, after endothelial cells in the microfluidic channel were loaded with MNPs using setting I (Fig 4d, step I), the channels were incubated with setting II, where MNPs experience forces in both the y direction (fy) and z direction (fz) that are 34 orders of magnitude of the gravitational force (Fig 4e, step II).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we found that after endothelial cells were exposed to fy for 1 h, F-actin fibres along the flow direction were reduced (Fig 4g) as compared to the control condition in which no magnetic force is applied (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the distribution of VE-cadherin became discontinuous and diffuse, indicating the disruption of adherens junctions at intercellular interfaces (Fig 4h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, after 12 h incubation with flow upon the withdrawal of magnetic force, endothelial cells reformed F-actin fibres along the flow direction and VE-cadherin returned to its original distribution, that is, continuous and condensed between adjacent cells (Fig 4j,k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that endothelial cells can simultaneously mechanosense the flow-induced shear stress and the intracellular MNP-exerted force, and the relative direction of these two forces modulates F-actin dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison between Figs 3e and 4g,j indicates that the intracellular magnetic force was large enough to induce a reversible change in actin cytoskeleton and the changes in actin filaments led to a temporary disruption to endothelial adherens junctions rather than permanent alterations to endothelial function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To examine whether the magnetic force-induced disruption of the endothelial adherens junction alters the barrier function of the endothelium, the endothelialized microfluidic channel subjected to the magnetic treatment (step I and step II described above) was infused with an antibody against collagen I immediately after exposure to magnetic field or after the endothelial channel recovered overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The microfluidic channel was coated with collagen I to support the growth of endothelial cells and thus located at the basal side of the endothelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An antibody (150 kD) is significantly larger than a serum albumin molecule (66 kD) and therefore cannot diffuse through intact endothelial cellcell junctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that collagen I was positively stained after the magnetic treatment, indicating that the endothelial layer became permeable to the antibody (Fig 4i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the anti-collagen staining was not detectable after recovery of adherens junction (Fig 4l).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that the magnetic force-induced disruption of endothelial adherens junctions caused the endothelial layer becoming permeable to large protein molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In vivo magnetic switch of vascular permeability', 'We further tested the concept of magnetic control of vascular permeability in vivo in a mouse lateral tail vein model in athymic nude mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MNPs were injected into the systemic circulation from the distal end of a mouse lateral tail vein, and the opposite lateral tail vein was placed along an NdFeB block magnet (Fig 5ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our initial studies and computational numerical simulations showed that magnetic targeting in the lateral tail vein required a higher field gradient and larger MNPs due to the increased venous blood velocity and a longer distance from the vessel to the magnet (Fig 5d,e; Supplementary Figs 1215).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Efficient magnetic targeting was achieved using 33 nm MNPs with a higher magnetic force of 5 × 1015 N at the edge of the magnet, as shown by in vivo near-infrared fluorescence imaging of MNPs in the mouse tail (Fig 5f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further quantified the amount of MNPs in the mouse tail using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), and found that the iron content in the tail (62±37 g g1 dry tissue) that subjected to applied magnetic field was significantly higher than that without (6.3±13.1 g g1 dry tissue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histological examination showed that MNPs accumulated primarily in the large veins and small venules but not in the arterioles, presumably due to the higher arterial blood flow speed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also indicated that MNPs were only located in the endothelium, but not in the interstitial tissues in the in vivo experiments (Supplementary Fig 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results confirm the effective magnetic targeting of MNPs in the mouse tail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: In vivo magnetic targeting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Set-up of the in vivo experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An athymic nude mouse was anaesthetized with isoflurane with one of its lateral tail veins aligned with the edge of a rare-earth magnet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) A schematic diagram of the mouse tail and the magnet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Simulated distributions of magnetic flux density and magnetic force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The circle represents the lateral tail vein near the magnet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Simulated concentration profiles of MNPs of different sizes on the vessel wall close to the edge of the block magnet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dashed lines mark the ends of the block magnet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluctuations in the concentration are caused by the interpolation of numerical results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Simulated concentration profile of 33 nm MNPs in the cross-section of the lateral tail vein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) Magnetic targeting of 33 nm MNPs labelled with DiR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dashed box marks the segment of the tail next to the magnet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NIR fluorescence signal (ex/em=710 nm/780 nm) was pseudocoloured as indicated with the colour bar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accumulation of MNPs increased along the blood flow direction from the distal to the proximal end of the tail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 10 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (g) MNPs in the mouse tails quantified by a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Overcoming the endothelial barrier is paramount to the treatment of many diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, it is essential to the development of new biological therapies that involve engineered proteins, nucleic acids as well as multifunctional nanoparticles as drug carriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, the main rationale for delivering these large pharmacological agents to the target tissue or cells is the enhanced permeability and retention effects pertaining to tumour tissue at an active growing phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Otherwise, for large drug molecules and drug carriers, their systemic delivery is limited to cells in the circulatory system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we developed a new strategy in which biocompatible MNPs combined with a well-designed magnetic field can provide an externally controllable mechanical cue to activate the paracellular transport pathway of vascular endothelium at the desired location20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The applied magnetic force on endothelial cells is determined by the amount of intracellular MNPs, their size and the applied magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have shown that a focused magnetic field gradient can be generated at any location in the body41,42; whether these gradients are sufficient for magnetic capture or to generate the forces described here will depend on the properties of the nanoparticles, the flow rate in the vessels and the gradient generated at that point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to ultrasound-based methods, magnetic fields are not attenuated by biological tissues, enabling better control of targeted delivery into deep tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the pharmacokinetics and interactions of MNPs with the vascular endothelium can be optimized by fine-tuning nanocrystal synthesis and surface modification, owing to a large repertoire of nanofabrication techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'There are two major aspects concerning the potential clinical application of the method developed in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first is to deliver MNPs to the targeted endothelium, of which magnetic targeting is just one of the many ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other approaches include conjugating targeting ligands or cell-penetrating peptides to MNPs and direct injection (when permitted).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second is to apply magnetic force to intracellular MNPs in vivo (in deep tissue), possibly using a clinical-grade magnetic device in which multiple magnets of different strengths can be placed on the patient at specific anatomic sites to yield the optimal magnetic field strength and distribution to enhance delivery at the desired location43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Magnetic enhancement of vascular permeability thus has the potential to be applied to any tissue or organ of interest, regardless of the pathophysiological state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Endothelial mechanotransduction of the blood flow-induced shear stress plays a critical role in modulating vascular homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dysregulation of the mechanotransduction pathways can trigger pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, especially atherosclerosis45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effects of the shear stress include modulation of the cytoskeleton, intercellular junctions and vascular permeability46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this scenario, the shear force is exerted on the membrane of endothelial cells, and the mechanosensing has been hypothesized to be initiated through cell surface mechanotransducers, such as carbohydrate-rich glycocalyx and mechanosensory complex comprising of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1, VE-cadherin and VEGF receptor 2 (refs 48, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, MNP-generated intracellular forces are more body-force like rather than surface forces, and the mechanisms underlying magnetic force-induced mechanosensing and mechanotransduction remain elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study demonstrates that the force applied through intracellular MNPs can trigger the reorganization of F-actin fibres and disrupt endothelial adherens junctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phenotypic changes induced by the transient application of intracellular forces are found to be similar to those induced by a rapid change in the shear stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microscopic examination shows that the intracellular MNPs accumulated in the lysosomes, which have certain association with actin filaments50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that the MNP-induced intracellular forces may serve as a new way to apply distributed forces inside the cell, which can be transmitted directly to the cytoskeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, MNPs combined with an externally controllable magnetic field provide a novel technique to trigger mechanoresponses of cells and can potentially offer new insights into mechanobiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Conventional drug delivery methods employ polymers or nanoparticles as drug carriers, which are limited to therapeutic agents with specific properties for conjugation, adsorption or encapsulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, our approach provides a means to remotely alter the cytoskeletal organization of endothelial cells via intracellular magnetic forces, thus enhancing focal vascular permeability and opening the gate for extravasation of all circulating agents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It, therefore, extends targeted delivery to the vast majority of injectable therapeutic agents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should also be noted that disrupting endothelial cellcell junctions may expose cell surface proteins and basement membrane that are otherwise inaccessible to the blood circulation, potentiating additional molecular markers for targeted delivery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we demonstrate that the permeability of vascular endothelium can be increased using an external magnetic field to temporarily disrupt endothelial adherens junctions through internalized iron oxide nanoparticles, thus activate the paracellular transport pathway and facilitate the local extravasation of circulating substances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnetic control method developed in this work has the potential to shift the paradigm of targeted drug delivery by delivering therapeutic agents to specific anatomic regions within the body for a broad range of disease interventions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
