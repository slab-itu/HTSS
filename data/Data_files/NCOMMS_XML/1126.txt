Stability of iron-bearing carbonates in the deep Earths interior  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The presence of carbonates in inclusions in diamonds coming from depths exceeding 670 km are obvious evidence that carbonates exist in the Earths lower mantle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, their range of stability, crystal structures and the thermodynamic conditions of the decarbonation processes remain poorly constrained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we investigate the behaviour of pure iron carbonate at pressures over 100 GPa and temperatures over 2,500 K using single-crystal X-ray diffraction and Mössbauer spectroscopy in laser-heated diamond anvil cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On heating to temperatures of the Earths geotherm at pressures to 50 GPa FeCO3 partially dissociates to form various iron oxides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At higher pressures FeCO3 forms two new structurestetrairon(III) orthocarbonate Fe43+C3O12, and diiron(II) diiron(III) tetracarbonate Fe22+Fe23+C4O13, both phases containing CO4 tetrahedra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fe4C4O13 is stable at conditions along the entire geotherm to depths of at least 2,500 km, thus demonstrating that self-oxidation-reduction reactions can preserve carbonates in the Earths lower mantle.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Plate tectonics drives subduction of carbonate-bearing oceanic plates, that are responsible for recycling carbon from the surface down to the deepest regions of our planet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, geophysical, geochemical and petrological evidence1,2,3,4 suggest that sufficiently cold and/or fast subducting slabs can penetrate the transition zone and the Earths lower mantle, possibly even reaching the coremantle boundary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subducting plates are the major source of carbon influx inside the Earth5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Observation of carbonate inclusions in super-deep diamonds of lower mantle origin is evidence for their existence at depths greater than 700 km (refs 6, 7, 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Untangling the behaviour of carbonates at extreme conditions, that is, determining their stability regions and properties, is a key to understanding the deep carbon cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'There are two major mechanisms that could affect carbonate phase stability and carbon oxidation state in the Earths interiorchemical reaction(s) with surrounding minerals or transformations (including self-oxidation-reduction) of carbonates themselves at specific pressures and temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies on the Ca, Mg, Fe-bearing carbonates have established that they all undergo several high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) phase transitions without decomposing in the pressure range up to 140 GPa and restricted temperatures9,10,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Investigations of the stability of MgCO3 in the transition zone and upper part of the lower mantle as a function of oxygen fugacity demonstrated that carbon is expected to occur as diamond and carbides in the bulk mantle (when homogenously distributed) rather than carbonates14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in subducting slabs carbonates are expected to be stable due to the more oxidizing conditions compared to the surrounding mantle15, which may preserve them to the bottom of the lower mantle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of iron is crucial to the fate of high-temperature carbonates13,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Iron can radically change the thermodynamic stability of carbonate phases, thereby preserving them from breaking down.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This behaviour may be a direct consequence of pressure-induced spin crossover17,18,19,20,21, which has been observed to occur at 43 GPa at room temperature to over 50 GPa at 1,200 K (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22) for the endmember FeCO3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of Fe-bearing carbonates in the lower mantle is supported by experimental evidence12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Iron plays a fundamental role in the redox state of the mantle23 due to its ability to exist in multiple valence states, and its abundance in the mantle is sufficient to govern the redox state of other elements, carbon in particular.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interest in the high-pressure behaviour of carbonates has been enhanced by recent reports of novel compounds containing tetrahedral CO44 groups instead of the triangular planar CO32 groups that occur at ambient pressure9,12,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theoretical predictions indicate potential analogues between CO4-bearing carbonates and silicates25, but so far experimental information about structures of high-pressure carbonates are too limited (and indeed controversial) to speculate about their crystal chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we performed an experimental investigation of the high-pressure high-temperature behaviour of synthetic iron carbonate (FeCO3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental conditions of our work cover the entire mantle and reveal two novel compounds containing tetrahedral CO4 groups, as well as the complex role of ferrous and ferric iron in stabilizing carbonates at extreme conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our single-crystal X-ray diffraction data unambiguously establish the existence of at least one carbonate with a unique structural type (not known for silicates or other tetrahedral anion-bearing compounds), and demonstrate that the conditions in the Earths lower mantle do not lead to full decomposition of Fe-based carbonates due to self-oxidation-reduction reaction(s).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The increase of carbon co-ordination number from three (CO3 triangles) to four (CO4 tetrahedra) under compression is the obvious consequence of rules known for decades33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerous theoretical studies have predicted the formation of CO4-bearing carbonates at pressures ranging from over 80 GPa to 150 GPa34,35,36,37 depending on chemical composition and computational methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different configurations, from isolated tetrahedra to pyroxene-like chains, were anticipated for compounds with carbon tetra-co-ordinated by oxygen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, theoretical analysis of possible carbonates with condensed CO4 groups suggests that there should be analogues with silicates, but expected variations of COC angles are much smaller than for SiOSi angles in silicates36,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We are not aware of dedicated theoretical studies of pure iron CO4-bearing carbonates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the predicted36 structure of Mg-carbonate containing three-membered rings C3O96 made of CO4 tetrahedra was used to index peaks in powder diffraction data of HPHT Fe- and Fe/Mg carbonates12,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same structural model has been used to interpret infrared spectra of magnesiosiderite39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, important structural details predicted by theory36 and obtained by powder X-ray diffraction experiments12,16 are not in agreement (even reported space groups are different).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, it is not obvious how reliable structural information can be extracted based on LeBail fits with large unit cells13 or from powder X-ray diffraction of complex mixtures of different phases: for example, -Fe2O3 (hematite) was one of the phases reported to co-exist with carbonates at 88 GPa (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12) while it is well documented by now26 that above 50 GPa iron(III) oxide adopts different structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The average interatomic CO distance in the CO32 ion in magnesite-structured FeCO3, MnCO3, and CoCO3 (refs 17, 40) extrapolated to 75 GPa is 1.24 Å, and is 1.26 Å9 in dolomite-III.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In iron ortho- and tetracarbonates the average CO distance is 1.35 Å, where the larger value is consistent with the increase of coordination number on transformation and quantitatively similar to borates (the typical difference in ionic radius of B3+ in triangular BO3 and BO4 tetrahedra is 0.1 Å)33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the average OO distance (2.20(2) Å) in the CO44 group in iron orthocarbonate at 74 GPa is, for example, almost the same as in magnesite-structured Fe, Mn and Co carbonates (2.15 Å) and in dolomite-III (2.17 Å) (refs 17, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation indicates that is not the size of the carbon cation, but rather the

CO4-tetrahedra, two outer and two inner that form four-membered C4O1310 truncated chains (Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both Mg-bearing24 and pure iron tetracarbonate the inner tetrahedra are significantly more distorted than the outer: the bond angle variances are 35.9 degree2 compared to 13.1 degree2 for pure iron tetracarbonate at 97(2) GPa, and 146.2 compared to 19.0 degree2 for the Mg-bearing phase at 135 GPa (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed the same tendency is observed in tetrasilicates (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28 and references therein).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Liu et al.13 provided us with the powder X-ray diffraction pattern collected at 90 GPa after heating at 2,200 K. We fit this data using the Rietveld method (as implemented in the GSAS package) using the model of hexagonal tetrairon orthocarbonate Fe4C3O12 (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The good quality of the fit (Supplementary Fig 4) unambiguously confirms that siderite II has the structure of tetrairon orthocarbonate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quality of the powder X-ray diffraction data does not allow the occupancy of cation positions to be refined so we do not know how much magnesium is incorporated in the phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the absence of reflections of any other phases (apart from the gold standard and Ne pressure transmitting medium) suggests that at least 35% of magnesium may be incorporated in the structure of orthocarbonate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data on iron-bearing carbonates subjected to high pressures and high temperatures are very limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies of ankerite9 up to about 60 GPa reveal the formation of a phase with non-planar CO32 groups as a tendency to increase the co-ordination number of carbon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Magnesium-siderite exposed to pressures and temperatures corresponding to the top of the Earths D layer (135 GPa and 2,650 K) was shown24 to transform to iron(II)-bearing dimagnesium diiron(III) tetracarbonate Mg1.6Fe2.4C4O13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It contains tetrahedrally coordinated carbon units, corner-shared in truncated C4O1310 chains, and up until the present work it was the only unambiguously proven case of carbonate with CO4 groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the case of tetrairon orthocarbonate, incorporation of magnesium may significantly expand its pressuretemperature stability field at the expense of the diiron diiron tetracarbonate phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may mean that Mg, Fe-orthocarbonate might remain stable along the geotherm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Modern estimates indicate the concentration of carbon in altered oceanic crust to be in the range of 500600 p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5 and references therein).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study concludes that between none and almost all of the carbonates in subducting slabs are subducted into the mantle5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most plausible scenario however is that a relatively small amount of carbon is recycled into the convecting mantle based on a careful re-evaluation of carbon fluxes in subduction zones, where carbon is preferentially stored in the lithospheric mantle and the crust5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experiments clearly show that along an average subducting slab temperature profile44 (Fig 1), Fe-carbonates will not melt during subduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Still, recent reports4 suggest that the majority of slab geotherms intersect a deep depression along the melting curve of carbonated oceanic crust at depths of 300700 kilometres, creating a barrier to direct carbonate recycling into the deep mantle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, a portion of the subducted carbonates can still be recycled in the convecting mantle, not taking part in hydrothermal alteration reactions, partial melting and formation of carbonatitic magmas and premature carbon degassing processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, cold subducting slabs44,45 (Fig 1) could stabilize carbonates down to mid lower mantle depths, favouring Fe-partitioning into carbonates13 due to Fe2+ high- to low-spin crossover, which starts in carbonates at much shallower depths than in other Fe2+-bearing minerals46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, the average composition of carbonates in the Earths lower mantle could be significantly enriched towards the FeCO3 component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While self-redox reactions involving iron may potentially destabilise Fe-bearing carbonates, our experiments demonstrate that at pressures above 70 GPa (corresponding to a depth of 2,000 km), iron carbonates drastically change their structures, forming CO4-bearing compounds, and may persist to temperatures above 3,000 K in the 100 GPa range (that is, exist above the mantle geotherm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, based on our experimental observations we conclude that CO4-based carbonates may be carriers of carbon in the lower mantle.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

ESPERANTO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An instrument model was refined to calibrate the diffractometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose we performed data collection on standard samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calibration of the instrument model for Fit2D software51 was done using powder standards, that is, LaB6 (NIST SRM 660a) or CeO2 (NIST SRM 674b) and for CrysAlisPro software we used a standard

of the measured phases(s) we proceeded with the automatic indexing of the peaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The best performance of the automatic indexing method can be achieved on a small set of reflections (2030) belonging only to a single crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One has to manually select those reflections that build a 3D lattice in the reciprocal space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The obtained unit cell was then

extract the reflection intensities from the experimental images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By default, after data reduction, CrysAlisPro applies frame scaling, absorption corrections and searches for the space group analysing the systematic absences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This operation requires the following integration parameters: correct data ranges, DACs opening angle, integration box size, reflection profile fitting mode (2D or 3D) and background evaluation mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the reflection profiles were split over several frames, the 3D profile fitting was used, the 2D option otherwise.
