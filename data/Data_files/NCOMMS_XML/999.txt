A tetraoxane-based antimalarial drug candidate that overcomes PfK13-C580Y dependent artemisinin resistance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'K13 gene mutations are a primary marker of artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum malaria that threatens the long-term clinical utility of artemisinin-based combination therapies, the cornerstone of modern day malaria treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe a multinational drug discovery programme that has delivered a synthetic tetraoxane-based molecule, E209, which meets key requirements of the Medicines for Malaria Venture drug candidate profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E209 has potent nanomolar inhibitory activity against multiple strains of P. falciparum and P. vivax in vitro, is efficacious against P. falciparum in in vivo rodent models, produces parasite reduction ratios equivalent to dihydroartemisinin and has pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics compatible with a single-dose cure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro studies with transgenic parasites expressing variant forms of K13 show no cross-resistance with the C580Y mutation, the primary variant observed in Southeast Asia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E209 is a superior next generation endoperoxide with combined pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features that overcome the liabilities of artemisinin derivatives.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The control and elimination of malaria requires effective treatment strategies and the universal availability of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs)1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For over a decade, research groups have sought to replace the semi-synthetic artemisinin components (Fig 1a, 1a1c) of ACTs with a fully synthetic alternative to reduce uncertainties regarding cost and supply and to improve overall pharmacological qualities, most notably short clinical half-lives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several pharmacophores have been explored3 including the tetraoxanes (Fig 1b, 3a and 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Artemisinins and synthetic peroxides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Artemisinin and semi-synthetic analogues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Comparison of tetraoxanes with trioxolane-based anti-malarials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MSD in days following a single oral dose of 30 mg kg1, Pf SCID (NOD-SCID IL-2Rcnull (NSG) mice engrafted with human erythrocytes and infected with P. falciparum strain 3D70087/N9).Full size image', 'Recent years, however, have witnessed the emergence of parasite resistance to artemisinin, first documented in western Cambodia4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Malaria patients from this region were reported to have a delayed parasite clearance following either artesunate monotherapy or an ACT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The delayed parasite clearance phenotype is not resistance as defined by the WHO6,7 and does not necessarily lead to treatment failure8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it gives rise to concerns of a reduction in the therapeutic lifespan of the most effective, currently registered anti-malarials and the only class that offers rapid parasite biomass reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, reduced artemisinin efficacy places greater selective pressure on the ACT partner drugs, increasing the risk of multidrug resistance to emerge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, recent results in Cambodia now document increasing rates of clinical treatment failure in patients treated with the first-line combination dihydroartemisinin plus piperaquine, because of the emergence of resistance to both agents9', 'Here we describe the development of a fully synthetic tetraoxane analogue, E209, which displays nanomolar efficacy against multiple strains of P. falciparum and P. vivax with a tailored combination of pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties compatible with a single-dose cure even against a backdrop of the K13-dependent resistance mechanism in operation in S.E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Asia8.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A systematic evaluation of the antimalarial tetraoxane scaffold (Supplementary Note 1), revealed the aryloxy template (Fig 1) to be the most promising in terms of multi-parameter lead-optimization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through a series of rational chemical modifications we have been able to improve both the inherent pharmacodymamics (in vitro and in vivo potency) and PKs (metabolic stability profiles in a range of species and rodent and human blood stability) of the class.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to overall high potency, our studies also demonstrate that the fast PRR for E209 observed in in vitro studies translates to a fast action in vivo in the humanized SCID mouse model where a maximum parasite clearance was achieved after a single dose of 30 mg kg1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To achieve this level of parasite clearance with the clinical gold standard endoperoxide artesunate requires four doses of artesunate (50 mg kg1 day1) in the same model25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial safety and pharmacology profiles for E209 meet the requirements of MMVs target candidate profile 1 (TCP1), a drug with a fast killing profile (PRR equivalent to or better than dihydroartemisinin) and PK qualities that would support a single-dose cure either singly or in combination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is generally accepted that the mechanism of action of endoperoxide anti-malarials involves intra-parasitic ferrous mediated reductive scission of the endoperoxide bond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species such as carbon-centered radicals, which react with multiple parasite proteins and result in parasite killing28,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of this proposed mechanism of action it was originally argued that malaria parasites would find it difficult to acquire resistance to this drug class.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, compelling clinical data from Southeast Asia has confirmed that resistance has emerged and established itself in the region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resistance phenotype has been difficult to study, as it does not show up as a shift in potency (IC50 value) in traditional drug sensitivity assays20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extensive molecular investigations have implicated mutations in the K13 gene as key to this unusual resistance phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mutations allow the parasite to survive exposure to drug at the early ring stage of red blood cell infection even at supra-pharmacological drug concentrations20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A concern is that this type of resistance mechanism would blight the long-term clinical utility of the entire endoperoxide class of antimalarial drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our interpretation of this resistance mechanism, which is supported by recent modelling studies28, is that the slow parasite clearance phenotype seen clinically is a result of the loss of drug susceptibility in ring-stage parasites coupled with the extremely short elimination half-life of the endoperoxide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A potential solution to this problem is to extend the current 3-day artemisinin treatment course to four days as suggested by Dogovski et al.31 We believe that E209 provides a more elegant solution since it circumvents or minimizes the ring-stage resistance seen with currently deployed endoperoxides with a predicted elimination half-life of 2430 h compared to current artemisinins that have half-lives of circa 12 h (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, not only will E209 plasma levels remain above the IC50 level for 4 days or more in malaria patients as required by MMVs TCP1 criteria (based on PK predictions, Supplementary Methods), but it will also retain killing potential throughout each individual stage of parasites 48 h intra-erythrocytic cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, E209 has the potential for deployment in a superior combination treatment with a partner drug devoid of existing in vivo resistance liabilities (such as the ATP4 inhibitors33,34 or DHODH inhibitors35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E209 has the potential to offer a substantial improvement on currently deployed artemisinin-based drug combinations and provide an urgently required alternative TCP1 drug for malaria treatment and elimination programmes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
