CCR2 defines in vivo development and homing of IL-23-driven GM-CSF-producing Th17 cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'IL-17-producing helper T (Th17) cells are critical for host defense against extracellular pathogens but also drive numerous autoimmune diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Th17 cells that differ in their inflammatory potential have been described including IL-10-producing Th17 cells that are weak inducers of inflammation and highly inflammatory, IL-23-driven, GM-CSF/IFN-producing Th17 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, their distinct developmental requirements, functions and trafficking mechanisms in vivo remain poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we identify a temporally regulated IL-23-dependent switch from CCR6 to CCR2 usage by developing Th17 cells that is critical for pathogenic Th17 cell-driven inflammation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This switch defines a unique in vivo cell surface signature (CCR6CCR2+) of GM-CSF/IFN-producing Th17 cells in EAE and experimental persistent extracellular bacterial infection, and in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this signature, we identify an IL-23/IL-1/IFN/TNF/T-bet/Eomesodermin-driven circuit driving GM-CSF/IFN-producing Th17 cell formation in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our data identify a unique cell surface signature, trafficking mechanism and T-cell intrinsic regulators of GM-CSF/IFN-producing Th17 cells.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'An emerging concept in inflammatory T-cell biology is the existence of a spectrum of T-helper 17 (Th17) phenotypes that vary in inflammatory potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In autoimmunity, Th17 cell subsets that differ both in their developmental requirements and function have been described1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transforming growth factor-1 (TGF1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) drive differentiation of IL-10-producing Th17 cells2,3,4, which are weak inducers of inflammation2,3,4 and can possess regulatory function2,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, differentiation and effector function of Th17 cells with pathogenic function is dependent on IL-23 (refs 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), which induces expression of the effector cytokines granulocytemacrophage-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interferon- (IFN)6,7,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is widely appreciated that IL-23-dependent Th17 cell responses orchestrate numerous CD4+ T-cell-driven pathologies including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS)6,7,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been hypothesized that these two arms of the Th17 cell response evolved to coordinate different domains of protective immunity12 wherein Th17 cells with a more limited inflammatory potential mediate maintenance of barrier tissue integrity2,5,13, whereas more inflammatory subsets of Th17 cells amplify inflammation during persistent extracellular bacterial/fungal infection14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these models of Th17 cell biology are a useful construct for conceptualizing how different Th17 cell phenotypes participate in protective/pathological immune responses, present knowledge of distinct Th17 cell phenotypes has predominantly flowed from in vitro-based systems and is therefore limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding mechanisms governing development and trafficking of Th17 cells with pathogenic function during autoimmune inflammation is of critical importance as intervention of these processes presents as a tractable target for novel therapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Migratory properties of effector Th cells are imprinted during differentiation with induction of chemokine receptors that enable their differential trafficking to inflammatory lesions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CCR6 is a homing receptor shared by Th17 and regulatory T cells (Tregs)16, hypothesized to ensure that Th17 cell responses are closely regulated by Tregs to limit superfluous, and potentially damaging, inflammation17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, emerging evidence suggests the existence of additional, more critical receptors in Th17 migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In EAE, a two-wave model for encephalitogenic Th17-cell recruitment to the central nervous system (CNS) has been proposed where, in the first wave, CCR6 facilitates entry into the uninflamed CNS, followed by subsequent waves of CCR6-independent Th17 cell trafficking into the inflamed CNS18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, more recent studies have demonstrated that CCR6 is largely dispensable for EAE pathogenesis19,20, suggesting that recruitment of encephalitogenic Th17 cells to the CNS is CCR6 independent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the molecular basis for CCR6-independent trafficking of Th17 cells is unknown and migratory receptors that differentially recruit Th17 and Tregs to inflammatory lesions have not been identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we demonstrate that CCR2, not CCR6, is a key driver of encephalitogenic Th17 cell recruitment into the CNS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, we identify GM-CSF/IFN-producing Th17 cells in EAE and persistent extracellular bacterial infection as bearing a CCR6CCR2+ phenotype in mice and in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, Th17 cells with an IL-10+ and IL-9+ cytokine profile, consistent with published descriptions of Th17 cells of more limited pathogenic potential, bear a CCR6+CCR2+ phenotype in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using these signatures, we demonstrate that an IL-23/IL-1/IFN/tumour necrosis factor- (TNF)/T-bet/Eomesodermin-driven circuit drives GM-CSF/IFN-producing Th17 cell development in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we report a unique cell surface signature and novel developmental features of GM-CSF/IFN-producing Th17 cells in vivo and resolve the outstanding question regarding the molecular control of encephalitogenic Th17 cell trafficking to the CNS in EAE.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Th17 cells express functional CCR2 during inflammation', 'To identify CCR6-independent mechanisms mediating recruitment of Th17 cells and to compare migratory potential of Th17 and Tregs, we screened for the expression of all known chemokine receptors in CCR6+ and CCR6 subsets of Tregs from B6.Foxp3GFP mice and IL-17A-eYFP+CD4+ T cells from B6.Il17aCreRosa26eYFP mice, in which Cre recombinase is driven by Il17a promoter activity to permanently mark cells that are currently producing or have previously expressed IL-17A (IL-17A+/ex) with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP)11 (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, high levels of Ccr2 messenger RNA were apparent in CCR6CD4+IL-17A+/ex cells (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CCR2 protein was minimally expressed by naive, Th1 and Treg populations from EAE-induced wild-type (WT) mice, whereas IL-17A-producing CD4+ T cells, hereafter termed Th17 cells, expressed either CCR6 and/or CCR2 (CCR6+CCR2, CCR6+CCR2+ or CCR6CCR2+) (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functionally, ex vivo transmigration assays demonstrated that Th17 cells were the most CCL2-responsive CD4+ T-cell subset from EAE mice (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the CNS during EAE, the first detectable Th17 cells (day (d)5 post immunization) were predominantly CCR6+CCR2; however, as disease progressed, CCR2-expressing Th17 cells bearing CCR6+CCR2+ or CCR6CCR2+ phenotypes substantially increased in frequency (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was mirrored in secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs), as Th17 cells on d5 in the lymph node and spleen were predominantly CCR6+CCR2, followed by the emergence of CCR6+CCR2+ and CCR6CCR2+ Th17 cells by d10 post immunization (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, among the major CD4+ T-cell subsets in EAE, functional CCR2 expression is restricted to Th17 cells that arise following emergence of CCR6+ Th17 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Th17 cell recruitment to the CNS is temporally regulated by CCR6 and CCR2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Quantitative PCR of Ccr6 and Ccr2 transcript in CCR6+ and CCR6 subsets of CD4+IL-17A+/ex (currently, or previously Th17) cells (CD3+CD4+CD44hiIL-17AeYFP+B6.Il17aCreRosa26eYFP mice) and Tregs (CD3+CD4+Foxp3GFP+B6.Foxp3GFP mice) from the spleen/draining lymph node (dLN) of 56 mice d10 post MOG/CFA immunization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data presented relative to Rplp0 (mean±s.d.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Representative flow cytometric analysis of CCR6/CCR2 staining on naive CD4+ (CD3+CD4+CD44lo), Th1 (CD3+CD4+CD44hiIL-17AIFN+), Th17 (CD3+CD4+CD44hiIL-17A+) and Tregs (CD3+CD4+Foxp3+) from the spleen of B6 mice d10 post MOG/CFA immunization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are representative of three independent experiments with n=34 mice per experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Transwell chemotaxis to CCL20 and CCL2 by indicated T-cell subsets from d10 MOG/CFA-immunized B6 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Th17 cells from B6.Ccr6/ and B6.Ccr2/ mice served as CCL20 and CCL2 controls, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are representative of two independent experiments with n=4 mice per experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Representative flow cytometric analysis of CCR6/CCR2 staining on Th17 cells (CD3+CD4+CD44hiIL-17A+) in the dLN, spleen and CNS on d5, 10 and 15 post EAE induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are representative of four independent experiments with n=46 mice per timepoint.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e,f) EAE-immunized B6 mice were administered 100 g of CCL2ala (scrambled peptide control;

however, a T-cell intrinsic role for CCR2 has not been clearly demonstrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, to specifically examine T-cell intrinsic functions of CCR6 and CCR2 in T-cell trafficking during EAE, we constructed bone marrow (BM) chimeras, reconstituting lethally irradiated B6.Ly5.1 recipients with 80% BM from B6.Tcra/ donors and 20% BM from either B6, B6.Ccr6/, B6.Ccr2/ or B6.Ccr6/.Ccr2/ donors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, T-cell-specific deletion of Ccr2 reduced CNS-infiltrating Th17 cells and diminished EAE severity (Table 1 and Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, deletion of Ccr6 delayed, but ultimately exacerbated EAE without substantially altering CNS-infiltrating Th17 cells, but reduced CNS-infiltrating Tregs at peak (d14) and chronic (d25) disease (Table 1 and Fig 3ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of both Ccr6 and Ccr2 in T cells substantially delayed disease onset (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, akin to Ccr6-deficient T-cell chimeras, Ccr6/Ccr2/ T-cell chimeric mice ultimately manifest EAE, associated with fewer CNS-infiltrating Th17 cells at peak disease, but also reduced frequencies of CNS-infiltrating Treg cells at all time points assessed (Table 1 and Fig 3ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fewer CNS-infiltrating Gr1+ leukocytes were present in Ccr2-deficient and Ccr6/Ccr2-deficient T-cell chimeras at peak disease, consistent with diminished CNS Th17 cell responses in these mice (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that CCR2 plays a key role in mediating trafficking of T cells with pathogenic function to the CNS during EAE, whereas CCR6 functions as an important axis for Treg function in this model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent data have shown that encephalitogenic Th17 cells in EAE produce the inflammatory cytokine GM-CSF6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In keeping with this, T-cell-specific deletion of Ccr2 reduced GM-CSF+ Th17 cell abundance in the CNS without altering their development in SLOs (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, GM-CSF-producing Th17 cells were more abundant in circulation, suggesting that CCR2 drives circulation-to-CNS trafficking of encephalitogenic Th17 cells (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To more definitively address this point, we transferred purified Ccr2-deficient CD4+ T-cells into B6.Rag1/ recipients and induced EAE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this model, Th17 cells with pathogenic function that arise from transferred CD4+ T cells represent the critical disease-initiating cell type7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, recipient mice receiving Ccr2-deficient T cells were resistant to EAE (Table 2 and Fig 3f), exemplifying the critical requirement for CCR2 in encephalitogenic T-cell function in this model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, although Th17 cell frequencies were equivalent in SLOs (Supplementary Fig 2), Th17 cells and GM-CSF+ CD4+ T cells were markedly reduced in the CNS of B6.Rag1/ recipients reconstituted with Ccr2-deficient CD4+ T cells (Fig 3g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, fewer CNS-infiltrating Gr1+ and Gr1lo/F4/80+ leukocytes were present in these mice (Fig 3h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, GM-CSF-producing Th17 cells were substantially reduced in the CNS in the absence of CCR2 (Fig 3i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data indicate that CCR2 drives CNS accumulation of Th17 cells with pathogenic function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 EAE disease parameters in T-cell-specific chemokine receptor-deficient BM chimeras.Full size table', 'Figure 3: CCR2 drives recruitment of Th17 cells with pathogenic function into the inflamed CNS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) EAE clinical disease scores of T-cell-specific chemokine receptor-deficient bone marrow (BM) chimeras.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T-cell-specific knockout (KO) chimeric mice were generated by transferring BM derived from B6.Tcra/ (80%) and B6 (n=16), B6.Ccr6/ (n=18), B6.Ccr2/ (n=16) or B6.Ccr6/.Ccr2/ (n=18) (20%) into lethally irradiated B6.Ly5.1 recipients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are pooled from two independent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Representative flow cytometric analysis and quantification of CNS-infiltrating Th17 cell frequencies in T-cell-specific KO chimeras on d14 EAE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  B6 (n=9), B6.Ccr6/ (n=10), B6.Ccr2/ (n=9) and B6.Ccr6/.Ccr2/ (n=9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Frequency and total number of CNS-infiltrating Tregs in T-cell-specific KO chimeras on d14 (top) and d25 (bottom) EAE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  B6 (d14: n=9;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In the present study, we demonstrate that CCR2 is a critical driver of encephalitogenic GM-CSF-producing Th17 cell recruitment to the CNS in EAE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, we show that CCR6 functions to promote homing of Th17 cells only during initial phases of inflammation and is more critically required for Treg trafficking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This switch from CCR6 to CCR2 usage by Th17 cells appeared to be temporally regulated during priming as the earliest Th17 cells predominantly expressed CCR6, followed by later emergence of CCR6+CCR2+ and CCR6CCR2+ populations in SLOs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter population required IL-23 and, to a lesser extent, IL-1, TNF and IFN, and the transcriptional regulators T-bet and Eomesodermin for development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assessment of cytokine expression among Th17 populations in humans and in murine models of autoimmunity and persistent bacterial infection revealed that CCR6CCR2+ Th17 cells align with previously described GM-CSF+/IFN+ pathogenic Th17 cells, while CCR6+CCR2+ Th17 cells resemble previously reported Th17 cells with a more limited pathogenic potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we define a molecular mechanism governing encephalitogenic Th17 cell recruitment to the CNS and identify unique cell surface signatures and differentiation requirements of phenotypically distinct Th17 cells in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Manipulation of the chemokine system has been considered a tractable target for therapeutic intervention in CD4+ T-cell-driven immunopathologies for many years43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Central to the rational design of such approaches is a detailed understanding of unique spatio-temporal homing signals used by inflammatory and regulatory subsets of T cells to infiltrate lesions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although CCR2 has been reported to be expressed on subsets of T cells previously44,45, until now the functional significance of this was unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With regard to Th17 migration, most focus has fallen on CCR6 with an early report demonstrating a critical requirement for this receptor in encephalitogenic T-cell migration in EAE18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this has been challenged with the results of more recent studies demonstrating a largely redundant role for CCR6 in EAE pathogenesis19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data demonstrate that CCR6 promotes early infiltration of Th17 cells, but this is dispensable for the development of EAE, which is driven by CCR2-dependent recruitment of encephalitogenic Th17 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our experiments using mice with Ccr6/Ccr2/ T cells indicate that when T cells lack CCR6, pathological inflammation ensues even in the absence of CCR2 on T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that although CCR2 strongly promotes encephalitogenic T-cell recruitment to the CNS, a degree of CCR2-independent recruitment of encephalitogenic T cells must also occur, but these cells are constrained from causing disease in a CCR6-dependent manner, probably by CCR6+ Tregs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a clinical perspective, our data, and those of others19,20, suggest that therapeutic targeting of CCR6 will have detrimental effects on Treg function without restraining pathogenic T cells and emphasize CCR2 as a prospective target for the treatment of inflammatory T-cell-driven pathologies such as MS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This notion is strengthened by our findings that GM-CSF- and IFN-producing Th17 cells bear a CCR6CCR2+ phenotype in humans, other studies demonstrating that IFN-producing Th17 cells are preferentially recruited in MS lesions31, the observation that IL-17A/GM-CSF co-expressing CD4+ T cells are enriched in MS brain lesions32 and the well-established dependency on CCR2 for monocyte infiltration of the CNS46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our data indicate that initial Th17 cells differentiate in an IL-23-independent manner, bear a CCR6+CCR2 phenotype and are recruited to the uninflamed CNS via CCR6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reboldi et al.18 proposed that an early CCR6-dependent wave of Th17 cells initiates CNS inflammation in EAE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CCR6+CCR2 Th17 cells express a unique cytokine profile

CCR6+CCR2 Th17 cell-derived factors may synergistically contribute to the initiation of CNS inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly however, our data clearly demonstrate that the absence of this CCR6-driven wave of Th17 cells does not prevent subsequent CCR2-driven population of the CNS by encephalitogenic Th17 cells or the development of clinical EAE, challenging notions that these cells form an essential component of EAE pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Subsequent to the generation of CCR6+CCR2 Th17 cells is the emergence of CCR2-expressing Th17 cell populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

express abundant GM-CSF and IFN, and probably constitute the previously described pathogenic Th17 cell3,4,6,7,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Th17 cells with pathogenic function are reported to derive from committed TGF1/IL-6-driven Th17 precursors in the presence of IL-23 (refs 6, 7, 8) and from naive precursors via TGF3 and IL-6 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4), or independently of TGF1 in an IL-6-, IL-1- and IL-23-dependent manner3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate that the absence of the IL-23/IL-23R axis specifically curtails the development of GM-CSF-producing CCR6CCR2+ Th17 cells, suggesting that the CCR6CCR2+ signature defines the IL-23-driven pathogenic/inflammatory Th17 cell subset in vivo that may represent an advanced differentiated state of Th17 cells that arise from early CCR6+ precursors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent reports have demonstrated that the fate of Th17 cells in chronic inflammatory settings includes transdifferentiation to an IL-17A IFN+ Th1-like phenotype (termed

GM-CSF/IFN-producing CCR6CCR2+ Th17 cells and Tr1ex-Th17/Th1ex-Th17 cells remains to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our data indicate that the transcriptional regulators T-bet and Eomesodermin drive CCR6CCR2+ Th17 cell development in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TGF1-mediated repression of Eomesodermin is required for in vitro Th17 differentiation51; however, although Eomes can be induced in committed TGF1/IL-6-driven Th17 cells by inflammatory cytokines27, ectopic Eomes expression did not promote IL-12-driven IFN+ Th17 cell development in vitro27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that among Th17 cells, Eomesodermin expression is restricted to CCR6-expressing Th17 cell populations but is not required for their development in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, Eomes deficiency led to a selective defect in CCR6CCR2+ Th17 cell generation, implicating Eomesodermin as a key regulator of the switch from CCR6 to CCR2 expression during Th17 cell development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T-bet function in pathogenic Th17 cell biology is controversial with data indicating that these cells develop independently of T-bet42 and reports demonstrating that IL-23/IL-12 induce T-bet11,27, which, in collaboration with Runx1, promote conversion of Th17 precursors into pathogenic IFN-producing Th17 cells27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data demonstrate that in the absence of T-bet, Th17 cell development is amplified but arrested at an early developmental stage with a selective defect in CCR6CCR2+ GM-CSF/IFN-producing Th17 cell formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T-bet interactions with Runx1 suppress Runx1-mediated transactivation of Rorc and sequester available Runx1 that would otherwise form transcriptionally active Runx1:RORt complexes required for Il17a and Il17f induction in CD4+ T cells41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, Eomesodermin directly represses Rorc and Il17a transcription51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we speculate that Eomesodermin and T-bet shape Th17 differentiation and plasticity by implementing changes to the transcriptional landscape of Th17 cells, such as repression of Rorc and Il17a, and induction of Ifng and Csf2 (directly or indirectly), as they differentiate from IL-17A+ CCR6+CCR2+/ Th17 cells, through IL-17A+ CCR6CCR2+ GM-CSF/IFN-producing Th17 cells and perhaps towards an ex-Th17 phenotype in chronic inflammation11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Taken together, our data support a step-wise model of Th17 cell differentiation and homing (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial CCR6+CCR2 Th17 cells develop independently of IL-23 and migrate to effector sites via CCR6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Continuing antigen exposure in SLOs drives transition of CCR6+CCR2 Th17 cells to CCR2+ Th17 cell populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, persistent antigen drives the development of CCR6+CCR2+ Th17 cells and the cytokines IL-23, IL-1, IFN and TNF promote CCR6CCR2+ GM-CSF/IFN-producing Th17 cells that develop in a T-bet- and Eomesodermin-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CCR2 drives subsequent waves of Th17 cell recruitment to inflammatory sites where it is likely to be that a balance between CCR6CCR2+ GM-CSF/IFN-producing Th17 cells, CCR6+CCR2+ IL-10-producing Th17 cells, other effector T-cell populations and CCR6+ Tregs dictates whether amplification or resolution of inflammation results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This switch from CCR6 to CCR2 as Th17 cells develop greater inflammatory potential identifies a novel temporally regulated recruitment mechanism that amplifies T-cell-dependent inflammation, a finding that has important implications for understanding regulation of autoimmune inflammation and protective immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: Proposed model of Th17 cell development and homing in EAE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Initial Th17 cell differentiation from naive precursors occurs independently of IL-23 and gives rise to CCR6+CCR2 Th17 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells gain access to the CNS via CCR6 (first wave) and may contribute to the initiation of CNS inflammation via the provision of inflammatory cytokines including IL-17A/F, TNF, IL-22 and IL-2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Meanwhile in the SLOs, persistent antigen drives the emergence of CCR2+ Th17 cell population whereby prolonged TCR stimulation gives rise to CCR6+CCR2+ Th17 cells, which express IL-10 and IL-9, whereas the presence of IL-23 and, to a lesser extent, IL-1, TNF and IFN drives differentiation of GM-CSF/IFN-producing CCR6CCR2+Th17 cells in a T-bet and Eomesodermin-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Encephalitogenic Th17 cells gain access to the CNS via CCR2, independently of CCR6 (second wave), where the balance between CCR6+CCR2+ IL-10-producing Th17 cells, CCR6CCR2+ GM-CSF/IFN-producing Th17 cells, other effector T cells (not depicted)
