Control of finite critical behaviour in a small-scale social system  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Many adaptive systems sit near a tipping or critical point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For systems near a critical point small changes to component behaviour can induce large-scale changes in aggregate structure and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Criticality can be adaptive when the environment is changing, but entails reduced robustness through sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This tradeoff can be resolved when criticality can be tuned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We address the control of finite measures of criticality using data on fight sizes from an animal society model system (Macaca nemestrina, n=48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that a heterogeneous, socially organized system, like homogeneous, spatial systems (flocks and schools), sits near a critical point; the contributions individuals make to collective phenomena can be quantified; there is heterogeneity in these contributions; and distance from the critical point (DFC) can be controlled through biologically plausible mechanisms exploiting heterogeneity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose two alternative hypotheses for why a system decreases the distance from the critical point.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Over the last decade new technologies for making large numbers of fine-grained measurements have led to the surprising discovery that many biological systems sit near a critical point1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a system is near the critical point small changes to component behaviour can induce large-scale changes in aggregate structure and function3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examples of systems in which this behaviour has been observed include networks of neurons6, ant groups cooperatively carrying a load5 and animal groups forming flocks and schools7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accounting for criticality remains a challenge as sensitivity to perturbation suggests a lack of robustness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, change induced by perturbation may not be adaptive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complicating matters further, critical phenomena can result from history-dependent stochastic processes11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A question central to distinguishing among these conflicting views of criticality is to what degree criticality can be controlled by the components of the system2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "We address the control of criticality using data on fight sizes from an animal society model system (Macaca nemestrina, n=48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like many biological systems, it contains relatively few individuals, which means we cannot use standard physics measures to define critical behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we introduce a two-component operational definition of criticality for finite systems that uses (1) the Fisher information to capture sensitivity across scales and (2) a measure of collective instability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We ask whether conflict behaviour in the model system is critical using empirically grounded equilibrium (maximum entropy) and dynamic (branching process) models of the monkeys' fight-joining behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the system does sit near a critical point, and we quantify this distance in terms of the number of individuals that would need to be perturbed to reach the point of maximal sensitivity and instability."  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Study system and modelling framework', 'Our analysis begins with a time series of fights from a large, captive pigtailed macaque group collected over multiple observation periods during a four month period (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data consist of a series of binary fight participation vectors x of length n. For each vector an individual is assigned a 1 if it participated in that fight and a 0 if it did not (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To study criticality we modify tools from statistical mechanics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These tools are best deployed when the study system can be described using a simple, tractable and well-understood modelling framework like a spin-glass or branching process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence our first task is to assess whether these models are empirically justified descriptions of our study system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess this, we ask whether our data are consistent with any of three basic fight-joining models: (1) decisions to join fights are independent, (2) decisions to join are correlated (equilibrium model) and (3) decisions to join fights are strategic with correlations resulting from one individual joining in response to a second individual joining (dynamical branching process)12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluate these models by determining how effectively each recovers a key social featurethe distribution of fight sizes s (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13)when parameterized by the empirical data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The independent model simply takes into account the individual fight-joining frequencies xi (see Independent model inference in Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The correlated decision-making model (see Model descriptions and justification in Methods) is an equilibrium maximum entropy model that fits all pair-wise correlations and corresponds to a spin-glass model14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The word equilibrium is used here to indicate that interactions governing fights do not change over time (stationarity) and that time within fights does not play an explicit role (simultaneity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting probability distribution over possible fights has relative negative log likelihood', '', 'where the coefficients Jij are numerically fit to match individual and pairwise frequencies xi and xixj (see Pairwise maximum entropy model inference in Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the dynamical branching process (see Model descriptions and justification in Methods), the dominant causes of conflict are temporal pairwise interactionsan individual joins the current fight with some finite probability only when it sees another individual join.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fight initiation is assumed to occur at a slower timescale, when a random individual becomes aggressive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individuals join the fight by receiving aggression from or initiating aggression against an individual already in the fight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parameters include individual initiation parameters p0i, each denoting the relative probability that individual i begins a fight, and conditional redirection parameters pij, each denoting the probability that j joins a fight due to i having just joined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consider only the relative ordering of individuals joining fights, not direct interactions, and estimate parameters by fitting conditional frequencies Pijthe frequency of seeing individual j at any later time in a fight sequence given that i appeared first (see Branching process inference in Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We test the performance of each model through its ability to predict the distribution of fight sizes (Fig 1) and correlations up to 3rd order (Supplementary Fig 7, Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We rule out the independent model (Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find the empirically parameterized maximum entropy (as in prior work14) and branching process models recover the observed distribution of fight sizes, indicating that these models are mechanistically consistent with the data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can now use these empirically parameterized models to investigate whether the system is near critical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Testing fit of fight-joining processes to individual-level data.Models that include social correlations (the equilibrium maximum entropy and dynamic branching process models) can reproduce the relatively long tail of the observed distribution of fight sizes, whereas assuming independent fight-joining events

to what in physics is called a phase transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A phase transition (Supplementary Note 3) can be thought of as a point at which the system becomes infinitely sensitive to perturbations when the number of individuals becomes infinite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This diverging sensitivity is caused by a collective instability, meaning that perturbations to individuals spread to change the behaviour of the entire system (Supplementary Note 3, details on collective instability).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Phase transitions are typically identified by examining the asymptotic behaviour of the infinite limit (for a review of definitions, see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Social systems like the one studied here are, however, not large enough to be well described by the infinite limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, it is natural in these systems to focus on the effects caused by individual components, which is different from the typical case in physics, where tuning parameters are external and applied at a macroscopic level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences make the limit of an infinite number of components awkward in social systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these reasons we move to an operational definition of critical points that captures the core idea of criticality in infinite systems appropriate in the finite case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This definition takes into account two quantitiessensitivity and collective instability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "We define sensitivity as the derivative of the average fight size with respect to an individual's agitation, averaged over individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the equilibrium model, the control parameter associated with the average fight size s is an external field hext, which we interpret as uniformly increasing each individual's agitation, making it more likely to become involved in fights.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adding an external field to equation (1), we have , where hi=hext for all i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding sensitivity is equal to the susceptibility :", '', 'A sharp peak in susceptibility is one indicator that a phase transition may be present in the corresponding infinite system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically this is verified by measuring the growth of the peak with increasing system size15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, for a system with a fixed number of individuals, we will later verify that the peak is caused by an instability that would lead to such growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Results for the equilibrium model are shown in Fig 2a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For fit parameters (hext=0), there is increased sensitivity compared with a non-interacting model with the same mean fight size, meaning that an amplification process is occurring that makes changes to patterns of aggression at the individual level visible at the global system level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This amplification process cannot be attributed to external events as these data were collected in a captive setting in which such disturbances were minimized (see Model descriptions and justification in Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: The system is near a sensitive and unstable region of parameter space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The susceptibility , measuring the sensitivity of average fight size to an external perturbation, has a peak near the fit parameters (at hext=0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The susceptibility is also equal to the Fisher information F(hext), describing how quickly the distribution over fights becomes distinguishable as hext is varied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Instability of the lowest order mean-field solution is indicated by the eigenvalue  becoming larger than 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yellow dashed lines indicate a system of the same size with independent individuals, and

size image', 'The susceptibility can also be interpreted as a Fisher information, an information theoretic quantity that describes how sensitive a distribution is to the parameters that describe it (Supplementary Note 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A large  implies faster learning: large susceptibility means that aggregate level statistics are informative about conflict dynamics at the individual level16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Analogously to the susceptibility in the equilibrium model, we can define sensitivity in the dynamic model as how quickly fight sizes grow following perturbation of redirection probabilities pij:', '', 'where p adds probability uniformly to all redirection probabilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We define collective instability using perturbation theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is straightforward in the branching model: when the system is perturbed by one individual becoming active, the average number of other individuals triggered in the next time step, R0, indicates whether perturbations are amplified or decay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If R0 is above 1, perturbations grow exponentially and the peaceful state of the system is unstable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our dynamic model, this linear stability of the peaceful state is indicated by the largest eigenvalue R0 of the redirection probability matrix pij (corresponding to the least stable mode of the system).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the case of the equilibrium model, an analogous quantity  measures the stability of the mean-field solution, corresponding to the eigenvalue with largest magnitude of the matrix Mij=2(1ij)Jijxi(1xi) (see Supplementary Note 3, details on collective instability).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results for the equilibrium model stability at increasing hext are shown in Fig 2b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In each model, the stability factor (R0 or ) becoming 1 indicates a true phase transition in the case when the number of individuals in the system becomes infinite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a finite system, the stability, like the sensitivity, is a useful measure in its own right, one that we use as an indicator of whether a peak in sensitivity is caused by a collective instability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Distance from criticality', 'Figure 2 suggests that the system is near a transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing to a simple homogeneous system of the same size that is poised directly at instability (red dashed lines in Fig 2), we see in the inferred model a similar peak in sensitivity, but one that is shifted to occur when the system is exposed to a field that increases overall agitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnitude of the field necessary to reach the peak defines a distance from the transition, but one that is measured in units that are not easily related to biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To quantify in a biologically meaningful way how much agitation is required to move the system towards the critical point, we measure how sensitivity and stability vary as we force-through parameterized-simulation (Supplementary Note 3) some number of individuals to fight continuously (while allowing the system to consist only of the non-forced individuals).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of individuals required to reach a peak in sensitivity corresponding to a collective instability (Supplementary Note 3) is a measure of the distance of the system from the critical point (DFC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond this peak lies saturation and decreasing sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the equilibrium model forcing is accomplished by removing the forced individuals and adding their interaction terms to the fields acting on the remaining individuals: the new fields are given by .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the dynamic model this is accomplished by explicitly including the forced individuals at each time step in the simulation but only recording the behaviour of the remaining individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The change in sensitivity caused by forcing each individual also provides sensitivity scores that quantify the extent to which each individual brings the system closer to criticality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As shown in Fig 3, both models predict a substantial increase in sensitivity when a few individuals are forced to be continuously involved in conflict.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The system begins to saturate in sensitivity after 35 individuals are simultaneously forced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is similar to the finding that bird flocks require only a small proportion of informed individuals to correctly choose direction18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use perturbation theory to demonstrate that this sensitivity arises from instability in each model (Supplementary Note 3, details on collective instability), a conclusion that is robust to uncertainties in model parameter estimates (Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Simulation of forced individuals provides a biologically meaningful measure of distance from criticality.In equilibrium (ac) and dynamic (df) models, forcing a few individuals to become simultaneously aggressive leads to a more sensitive system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,d) In each model, peak sensitivity is reached when on average 35 individuals are forced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shaded regions indicate the standard deviation around the mean over different realizations of the chosen individuals.

individuals vary in their sensitivity scores such that forcing participation of individuals with the top two to three sensitivity scores is sufficient to move the system close to a critical point

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Social systems must learn to tune the benefits of flexibility with the need for robustness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be achieved through collective forms of interaction that in effect tune the distance of a system from a critical point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We are able to quantify through simulation the distance of a population from a finite critical point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of individuals (or, in principle, subgroups) that must be forced to reach peak sensitivity provides an operational definition of DFC and has the advantage of allowing the measurement of DFC in units that are natural to the system and hence mechanistically meaningful.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We find three to five individuals are sufficient, with significant individual variation in sensitivity scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both the equilibrium and branching process models, individuals with higher sensitivity scores are those who (by definition) exert greater influence on how far a system sits from the critical point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that individuals inducing the largest increase in average fight sizes correspond to those who promote the largest increase in sensitivity, as might be expected in any system with largely excitatory interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The question of whether biological systems can control how responsive they are to environmental change is an ongoing debate in the criticality community (for example, refs 1, 20) and the closely related evolvability community (for example, refs 21, 22, 23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The sensitivity scores generated by each model are capturing different tuning mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of the branching process model, we capture the spread of fight joining through direct interactions: one individual through its behaviour triggers the involvement of a second individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence this model only allows that the target individuals, through their own fight-joining decisions, can up or down regulate their fight involvement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a high sensitivity individual up or down regulates its own behaviour moving the system respectively closer to or further from the critical point, we call this direct tuning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The equilibrium model, on the other hand, is agnostic to cause, recording any pairwise correlation in fight joining regardless of which individual triggered the joining event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such it captures the full space of behavioural mechanisms leading to fight-joining: individuals can become involved in fights by up regulating their own fight involvement and also through changes to third-party behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, policing (by third parties to the fight, see Operational definitions in Methods25) and other conflict management mechanisms reduce the frequency of redirected and directed aggression in the system and, in particular, towards the high sensitivity individuals, and hence dampen the fight-joining behaviour of these individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a third party, like a policer, up or down regulates the behaviour of high sensitivity individuals we call this indirect tuning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A natural question raised by the discovery that DFC can be tuned and that there are behavioural mechanisms in place that allow for this tuning is whether to favour robustness (increase DFC) or criticality (decrease DFC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This decision depends on three factors: (1) the adaptive utility of criticalitywhen does it make sense to sit near the critical point?, (2) the true state of the environmentis it uncertain or stable and predictable?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and (3) the perceived state of the environmentthe accuracy with which system components can detect and encode the environmental state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The consequences of being near or at the critical point is that information can propagate quickly or more completely, with small changes to component behaviour inducing large-scale changes in both structure and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence criticality allows the system to more easily reconfigure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose two hypotheses for tuning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The first hypothesis we call the unspecified reconfiguration or evolvability hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The idea is that if the environment becomes uncertain after a period of stability, strategies adapted to the previously stable environmental state will be ill-suited to both the increasing uncertainty as well as to any new state the environment settles into.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence the system moves toward the critical point to allow a reconfiguration to take place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To make this more concrete consider the model system studied here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moving towards criticality changes the distribution of fight sizes such that there are more large fights.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Social reconfiguration becomes more likely with large fights because large fights cost more13 and costly conflict can lead to changes in alliances, coalitions and the power structure, which controls the cost of conflict management26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence the opportunity for large-scale reorganization of social structure becomes possible, though it is not possible to predict the specific form the social structure will take.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We predict that unspecified reconfiguration is adaptive when the environment is uncertain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence when the state of the environment is stable or very slowly changing (represented, for example, by a delta function), we expect the optimal choice is to increase DFC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the state of the environment is uncertain, the system should decrease DFC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unspecified reconfiguration can be thought of as an evolvability mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The second hypothesis we call directed reconfiguration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The idea here is that if a change occurs in the environment and this change has been observed before (for example, a predator appears), it may make sense to quickly switch from the current social configuration (say foraging) to one more appropriate for the perturbation7,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decreasing DFC allows information about the perturbation to quickly spread across the system so that components can rapidly exhibit behaviour appropriate for the new, but understood, environmental state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Directed reconfiguration is a mechanism for switching between behavioural states at the aggregate level as described in refs 7, 10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For tuning to be adaptive, the state of the environment must also be correctly perceived by the tuning agent(s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To make this clear, consider the following: a flock of birds in search of food with high and low sensitivity individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some individuals in the flock have poor eyesight and so misjudge the location of food and others have good eyesight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the high-sensitivity birds (those whose position in the network means changes to their behaviour can be felt globally) are also those with poor eyesight, the system may be inappropriately driven away from food sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If on the other hand the good eyesight birds are also highly sensitive, the system will be appropriately driven towards food.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a similar way, tuning DFC will require accurate perception of the most beneficial change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence in order for DFC to be tunable and for that tuning to be adaptive in a biological system these two types of heterogeneity must be aligned: high sensitivity score individuals must also be good detectors of environmental state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither of these types of heterogeneity has received much attention in the collective behaviour, criticality, or biological phase transition literatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently little is known about how common it is for these types of heterogeneity to be aligned or whether there are in some systems mechanisms to bring them into alignment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In our model system, both types of heterogeneity appear to be aligned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results of earlier work29 suggest the individuals with the highest sensitivity scores also are those who serve as good detectors of environmental state, with environmental state in this case corresponding to whether the underlying social order is stable or uncertain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The idea is as follows: some individuals register stressful periods more visibly (in their health state) than the other group members due to their social position30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study system, these individuals are those perceived least capable of winning fights and who consequently sit in the lowest 10% of the social power distributionthese individuals pay a relatively high cost (in terms of aggression received) for social interactions25,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Health state, which fluctuates over days and weeks, is a slow variable29,32, compared with behaviours like aggression and submission which fluctuate on an hourly or daily scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When these low-power individuals are healthy, the system can be said to be in a stable, low variance period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When these individuals are stressed above some baseline level, social dynamics are becoming uncertain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study system, the high sensitivity score individuals tend to be these weak individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other individuals can adjust their propensity to attack or protect (for example, through policing26) these weak individuals based on their perceived health state and, in doing so, efficiently adjust DFC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'All biological systems need to balance stability and robustness with the need for rapid adaptive change (for example, refs 22, 33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet many biological systems are observed to sit near a critical point1, which suggests a lack of robustness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This apparent conflict can be resolved by the discovery that DFC can be tuned (or computed) through realistic biological mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tuning DFC allows for switching between stability and criticality, providing a means for accessing alternative social structures that may be more appropriate if and when the environment should change29,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This discovery raises many new questions: it is one thing for tuning to be possible and another to tune adaptively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose robustness is a good strategy when the environment is stable and low variance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Criticality is a good strategy when the environment is uncertain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, in order for tuning to be adaptive the state of the environment must be accurately perceived by, or mirrored in, the individuals whose behaviour changes the DFC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This appears to be the case in our system but may present a crucial evolutionary challenge for other systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future comparative studies are required to quantify the range of DFC across social groups within a species, as well as across biological systems more generally, and to study how DFC might be controlled in other systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can then assess whether variation in DFC and its control are correlated with the rate of change in the environment and or environmental uncertainty.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
