Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A cardioprotective response to increase left ventricular contractile ability and improve myocardial metabolism occurs with increased workload in cardiac conditions such as hypertension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When this response is excessive, pathological cardiac remodelling occurs, a condition often progressing to heart failure (HF), a leading cause of death that affects more than 23 million people worldwide1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HF is a cardiac dysfunction marked by perturbations in adequate oxygen supply required to maintain proper heart contractility and energy production2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decreased cardiac contractility seen in HF is marked by reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, in HF associated with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), contractile function appears normal despite the presence of symptoms and the condition is thought to be caused by abnormal diastolic function3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both contraction and relaxation are major energy-consuming processes4,5, suggesting that failure of myocardial energy metabolism underlies both HFrEF and HFpEF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cardiac hypertrophy, defined as increased heart mass caused due to cardiomyocyte enlargement, is also an adaptive response that maintains cardiac function in response to increased workload6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pathological stimuli, such as hypertension, promote the transition from hypertrophy to HF, the latter condition associated with cardiac fibrosis and re-expression of a fetal cardiac gene programme9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, exercise induces physiological hypertrophy characterized by preserved myocardial structure and energy metabolism, protecting the heart from HF10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistic differences between physiological and pathological hypertrophy remain unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The signalling factor angiopoietin-like protein 2 (ANGPTL2), one of eight ANGPTL proteins13, functions in maintenance of tissue homeostasis by inducing inflammation and angiogenesis14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some contexts, ANGPTL2 overexpression promotes irreversible pathological tissue remodelling and development or progression of obesity-associated metabolic diseases, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerotic vascular diseases and some cancers16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these conditions, ANGPTL2 expression increases in infiltrating immune cells or resident cells, such as adipocytes, vascular endothelial cells and tumour cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enhanced ANGPTL2 autocrine or paracrine signalling accelerates disease development and progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several studies report ANGPTL2 expression in heart13,17, although its function in those tissues has not been clarified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we report that cardiac ANGPTL2 expression increases in pathologically stressed hearts in mice and humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice overexpressing ANGPTL2 in heart showed cardiac dysfunction accompanied by inactivation of AKT and sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA)2a signalling and by decreased myocardial energy metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Angptl2 knockout (KO) mice showed increased left ventricular contractile capacity via increases in AKT-SERCA2a signalling, myocardial energy metabolism and ATP production, all of which protected mice from HF in a pressure overload model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Angptl2 KO phenotypes resembled exercise-induced hypertrophy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, cardiac ANGPTL2 expression significantly decreased in physiological cardiac remodelling induced by endurance training in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, in a mouse pressure overload model, suppression of cardiac ANGPTL2 induction blocked HF development and was accompanied by increased AKT-SERCA2a signalling and improved cardiac energy metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ANGPTL2-knockdown (KD) human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS)-derived cardiomyocytes showed induction of AKT-SERCA2a signalling and proper myocardial energy metabolism compared with control iPS-derived cardiomyocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results suggest that increased ANGPTL2 activity accelerates cardiac dysfunction and that therapeutic ANGPTL2 suppression could antagonize this condition.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The main findings of this study are: (1) cardiac ANGPTL2 production increases in stressed mouse heart as it undergoes pathological remodelling and potentially in some DCM patients; (2) pathological stimuli increase cardiomyocyte ANGPTL2 production via calcineurin-NFAT signalling; (3) ANGPTL2 protein secreted from cardiomyocytes predisposes heart to HF development likely by perturbing left ventricular contractile ability, an outcome attributable to inactivation of AKT-SERCA2a signalling and decreased myocardial energy metabolism in cardiomyocytes; (4) exercise training and/or miR-221/222 activity decreases cardiac ANGPTL2 expression; (5) Angptl2 KO mice are protected from pathological cardiac remodelling, and their heart phenotypes resemble those induced by exercise; (6) AAV6-shAngptl2 blocks cardiac ANGPTL2 upregulation in heart stressed by pressure overload and blocks the transition to HF by activating AKT-SERCA2a signalling and improving energy metabolism in cardiomyocytes in mice; and (7) AKT-SERCA2a is activated and myocardial energy metabolism is enhanced in ANGPTL2-KD human iPS-derived cardiomyocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, we showed that increased cardiac ANGPTL2 activity accelerates cardiac dysfunction and that therapeutic ANGPTL2 suppression could antagonize this dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Others reported that circulating ANGPTL2 levels in HF patients were higher than in control individuals, and that cardiac function was inversely correlated with levels of ANGPTL2 circulating in the periphery36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The authors did not address underlying mechanisms, but noted that increased levels of circulating ANGPTL2 in these patients could be secondary to increased ANGPTL2 secretion from adipose tissues under pathological conditions of HF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such an outcome is feasible given induction of adipose tissue inflammation and subsequent insulin resistance seen in HF conditions37,38 and the fact that circulating ANGPTL2 levels are relatively high in subjects with adipose tissue inflammation and/or insulin resistance17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our study strongly suggests that pathological stimuli activate ANGPTL2 production in cardiomyocytes, and that heart-derived ANGPTL2 is the likely source of increased ANGPTL2 levels in circulation in HF conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, suppression of cardiac ANGPTL2 production by treatment of AAV6-shAngptl2 decreased ANGPTL2 levels in circulation (Supplementary Fig 9e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, to date we and others have independently reported that circulating ANGPTL2 levels increase in various pathological conditions other than obesity accompanied by adipose tissue inflammation, such as atherosclerotic vascular disease and type 2 diabetes and that these levels are associated with disease severity17,20,39,40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because, some of these conditions are risk factors for HF development, further studies are needed to investigate whether circulating ANGPTL2 affects cardiac function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Non-pro-inflammatory ANGPTL2 function in cardiomyocytes reported in this study is noteworthy, as ANGPTL2 reportedly acts primarily by promoting progression of chronic inflammation16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we do not exclude the possibility that cardiomyocyte-derived ANGPTL2 may have a pro-inflammatory effect during pathological cardiac remodelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we have also reported that ANGPTL2 induces pro-inflammatory phenotypes in macrophages (Supplementary Fig 10)18,42, suggesting that cardiomyocyte-derived ANGPTL2 modulates activity of cells other than cardiomyocytes, such as infiltrated macrophages, in a paracrine manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If so, activities in those cells could promote heart tissue inflammation, worsening cardiac dysfunction43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interestingly, a recent paper demonstrated that cardiac miR-222 expression increased after endurance exercise training, an activity required for physiological cardiomyocyte growth in adult hearts, and that miR-222 expression protected against adverse cardiac remodelling44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  miR-221 and miR-222 target the identical RNA sequence, and miR-221/222 overexpression in mice antagonized pressure overload-induced pathological cardiac remodelling45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it has been reported that pressure overload-induced cardiac miR-221 promotes HF development46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the role of cardiac miR-221/222 remains controversial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we found that expression of both miR-221 and miR-222 markedly increased in pressure overload-induced cardiac stress following TAC (Supplementary Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, we also found that cardiomyocyte-specific miR-221/222 KO mice were predisposed to HF development (Supplementary Fig 5cf), suggesting that miR-221/222 functions in cardioprotection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, miR-221/222 KO mice showed significantly increased ANGPTL2 protein levels in stressed heart after TAC (Supplementary Fig 5g), suggesting that ANGPTL2 is a direct target of miR-221/222 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  42) (Fig 4b,c) and that miR-221/222 promotes cardioprotection via ANGPTL2 suppression (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Myocardial hypoxia is a critical pathology in HF development48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we also found that chronic hypoxia occurs in heart tissues of TAC animals (Supplementary Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent paper reported that amelioration of aging-related capillary and blood supply deficits is associated with downregulated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a key angiogenic factor, and its receptor (VEGFR) in heart50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That study also reported that cardiac VEGF and VEGFR mRNA levels increase following exercise training, increasing cardiac capillarization50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicate overall that VEGF signalling is critical for cardioprotective heart tissue remodelling through maintaining myocardial oxygen levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study shows decreased ANGPTL2 production in mouse heart after endurance exercise training (Fig 4a) and increased ANGPTL2 production in hearts of aged mice (Supplementary Fig 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, both anti-VEGF therapy51 and chronic hypoxia23 increase ANGPTL2 expression in tumour tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since ANGPTL2, like VEGF, possesses pro-angiogenic activity22,23, increased ANGPTL2 expression in stressed hearts might be caused by hypoxia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our observations support the idea that increased ANGPTL2 in stressed hearts likely decreases cardiac contractility by perturbing AKT-SERCA2a signalling and myocardial energy metabolism rather than counteracting hypoxia by increasing angiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we hypothesize that cardiac ANGPTL2 production is partially regulated by myocardial oxygen levels, potentially down-regulating ANGPTL2 in physiological exercise-induced cardiac remodelling and up-regulating it in pathological myocardial hypoxia-associated remodelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recent studies indicate that exercise-trained mice are protected from HF development11,12 and that activation of PI3K-AKT signalling is necessary for exercise-induced cardioprotection28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Tg mice overexpressing AKT in cardiomyocytes show cardiac hypertrophy with enhanced left ventricular function associated with increased SERCA2a expression52,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed cardioprotection following AKT-SERCA2a activation in Angptl2 KO mice, while ANGPTL2 upregulation antagonized AKT activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings in cultured cardiomyocytes suggest that AKT is destabilized in the presence of ANGPTL2 (unpublished observations), although further investigation of this activity is required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interestingly, we observed ANGPTL2 production in heart of 40% of DCM patients tested here, suggesting that cardiac dysfunction may be worsened by ANGPTL2 activity and that this subset of patients might be candidates for therapeutic ANGPTL2 suppression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings also suggest that mechanisms underlying DCM vary among individuals and that personalized medicine approaches are required to treat these diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we were surprised to find that left ventricular dilatation in cases of DCM harbouring some ANGPTL2-associated cardiac dysfunction was milder than that seen in DCM cases lacking an association with ANGPTL2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed that DCM patients showing upregulated cardiac ANGPTL2 production were generally older than other DCM patients (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that the impact of ANGPTL2 on progression of DCM may be less than that of other mechanisms, and that evaluating changes in cardiac ANGPTL2 production in DCM pathology might be useful to predict DCM progression, although further investigation is required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, it remains important to determine whether cardiac ANGPTL2 production contributes to cardiac dysfunction in HF patients without DCM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we also found that ANGPTL2 production in hearts of aged mice increased (Supplementary Fig 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, abundant expression of ANGPTL2 was reported as a senescence-associated secretory phenotype factor in senescent cells54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because pathologies are well documented in the aging heart, cardiac ANGPTL2 activation might be associated with dysfunction associated with aging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'ANGPTL2 reportedly interacts with the intracellular domain of the Ang II type1a (AT1A) receptor and promotes its recycling in non-cardiomyocyte cells55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we also recently reported down-regulation of ANGPTL2/Arap1 function in sepsis-induced hypotension due to reduced AT1A receptor recycling in vascular cells56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ang II signalling through AT1A closely follows the progress of cardiac pathology, whereas suppression of ANGPTL2/Arap1 expression did not alter Ang II downstream signalling in cardiomyocytes (Supplementary Fig 13), suggesting that ANGPTL2/Arap1 activity is not essential for AT1A receptor recycling in cardiomyocytes and that other AT1A receptor-associated proteins, such as ATRAP, might regulate recycling in this cellular context57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, this is the first study to report
