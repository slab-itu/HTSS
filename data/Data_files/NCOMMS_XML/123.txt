Allelic variation contributes to bacterial host specificity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Understanding the molecular parameters that regulate cross-species transmission and host adaptation of potential pathogens is crucial to control emerging infectious disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although microbial pathotype diversity is conventionally associated with gene gain or loss, the role of pathoadaptive nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) has not been systematically evaluated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, our genome-wide analysis of core genes within Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium genomes reveals a high degree of allelic variation in surface-exposed molecules, including adhesins that promote host colonization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent multinomial logistic regression, MultiPhen and Random Forest analyses of known/suspected adhesins from 580 independent Typhimurium isolates identifies distinct host-specific nsSNP signatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, population and functional analyses of host-associated nsSNPs for FimH, the type 1 fimbrial adhesin, highlights the role of key allelic residues in host-specific adherence in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our data provide the first concrete evidence that functional differences between allelic variants of bacterial proteins likely contribute to pathoadaption to diverse hosts.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Evolutionary events that modulate interactions between a pathogen and its host have a critical impact on interspecies transmission and adaptation, and thus on host range and pathogenesis1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, although most avian influenza viruses remain restricted to birds, some, such as H5N1 and H7N9, cause serious infections in humans2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of influenza viruses to cross host barriers is determined by the amino-acid sequence of its haemagglutinin protein, a lectin that recognizes sialylated glycan receptors on the apical surface of host cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even small changes of a few amino acids in the haemagglutinin protein are sufficient to convert receptor specificity from avian to human1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exact mechanisms for host tropism and adaptation of bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella remain elusive, and what is known has been primarily revealed by either gene-centric functional investigations3,4,5 or by genomic studies6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the biological relevance of most host-specific associations identified in genome-wide studies remains untested8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The 1,500 closely related but distinct Salmonella enterica subsp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  enterica serovars, determined by lipopolysaccharides and flagellar antigens, can be divided into three groups based on epidemiological host prevalence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many S. enterica serovars such as S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) are restricted to the intestine, and cause limited clinical or subclinical enteric infections in a variety of unrelated hosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, several S. enterica serovars that are particularly well adapted to their host, including Typhi in humans and Gallinarum in poultry, are more invasive, and result in a systemic infection that can be lethal if not treated promptly with antibiotics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, epidemiological evidence supports various levels of host adaptation even among strains of broad host range serovars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, whereas most strains of S. Typhimurium cause a typhoid-like disease in susceptible mice, particular phage types such as DT2 or DT99 can cause systemic infections in pigeons11 and the multi-locus sequence type ST313 causes systemic infection in humans and chickens12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it appears that both inter- and intra-serovar variation have a role in host range and disease severity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we undertook a genome-wide search to identify genomic sequences that contribute to host adaptation and surprisingly found that allelic variants of shared surface adhesion molecules correlated most strongly with host specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, functional analysis of identified variants of the FimH adhesin confirmed their biological relevance in modulating host-specific binding that can contribute to host-adaptation and ultimately to the Salmonella strain pathotype.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Detection of genome-host associations in S. Typhimurium', 'To determine what genomic changes contribute to host association in Salmonella, we focused on S. Typhimurium, a broad-host range serovar for which the molecular basis for host preferences remains essentially unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparative analysis of the 3,192 core genes from 12 available complete genomes of S. Typhimurium (Supplementary Fig 1a) detected a relative and preferential accumulation of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among the annotated genes for membrane-associated surface and exported proteins (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most SNPs (69%) were nonsynonymous (nsSNPs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noticeably, nsSNPs in the core genomes associated with specific hosts, as shown in a heat map of nsSNPs (Supplementary Fig 1b), suggesting that host preferences of individual Typhimurium strains involves unique combinations of cell surface and exported allelic proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, no host-specific associations were identified in the 2,312 partially shared genes, which were frequently associated with loci carrying phage DNA (Supplementary Fig 1c and Supplementary Table 1), the 1,207 unique genes, which were mostly mobile elements (Supplementary Fig 1c,d), the 19 different plasmids (Supplementary Data 1), the few detected genomic rearrangements (Supplementary Fig 2), or the shared pseudogenes (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the most distinctive genomic property of S. Typhimuriums association to diverse hosts was its allelic variants of surface or exported proteins, we further investigated the potential role of a representative set of these proteins in hostpathogen interactions that may contribute to host adaptation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Comparative analysis and host origin association for S.

Typhimurium adhesin SNPs are host specific', 'Adhesive proteins or ligands on bacteria are likely to have an essential role in initiating hostpathogen interactions that contribute to host adaptation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we undertook a population-scale analysis of 580 Typhimurium strains and focused on 12 known or predicted fimbrial adhesins and 3 outer membrane proteins suspected to have binding properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence data were collected from 198 available genomes (Supplementary Data 2) and from targeted sequencing of 382 independent isolates (Supplementary Data 3)14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first investigated the degree of variability for the 15 genes, and found that fimH encoded the largest number of different alleles (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tajimas D tests for non-neutral evolution suggested that all 15 genes underwent positive selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SNPs from these 15 genes were further analysed for host association using Random Forest (RF), multinomial logistic regression and MultiPhen analyses (Supplementary Data 46)15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 182 host-associated mutations were detected by at least one method, 82 by two methods and 32 by all three methods (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 32 consistently identified host-associated mutations, half were nsSNPs, two of which were related to the absence or presence of a full-length open-reading frame (Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, a 3D scaling plot from the RF analysis that separated subpopulations of isolates from the same host clearly revealed host-specific DNA signatures (Fig 1b and Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these in silico data strongly suggest that allelic variation in known or predicted bacterial adhesins of a broad-host range serovar is associated with host-specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A S. Typhimurium FimH residue shapes host-specific adhesion', 'The next goal was to evaluate whether a detected host-associated allelic variant effectively alters bacterial binding in a host-specific manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the 15 genes studied in S. Typhimurium, we found that fimH encoded the greatest number of predicted alleles, with 17 identified variants, most of which were expressed in only one to three strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, two alleles were present in over 30 isolates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although fimH1 was a broad adaptive allele, it most frequently associated with human isolates, whereas the second most common allele, fimH7, was most frequently associated with isolates of bovine origin (Fig 2a; P less_than 0.0009, Fishers exact test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two alleles differ by only one amino acid; with a valine for FimH1 and an alanine for FimH7 at position 223.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the potential biological function of this residue switch, we tested the binding property of recombinant E. coli expressing isogenic S. Typhimurium type 1 fimbriae with either one of the two allelic FimH proteins or no FimH as control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using three human and four bovine intestinal epithelial cells, the affinity of S. Typhimurium FimH7 was greater than that of FimH1 for all bovine cells (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although FimH1 appeared to preferentially bind to some human cells, the difference was not statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, these results indicated that the alanine at position 223 in FimH7 has a role in bovine-specific adhesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like FimH1, all 48 available genome sequences of the human-restricted S. Typhi encode a valine at position 223.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, to determine whether this valine contributed to the preferential binding of S. Typhi FimH to human cells, we mutagenized the representative fimH80 gene of S. Typhi by substituting its valine with an alanine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacteria expressing the mutated FimH80(V223A) allele demonstrated significantly decreased binding to all three human cells and increased binding to three of the four bovine cells investigated (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results highlighted how unique nsSNPs in a bacterial adhesin from a broad-host range serovar contribute to bacterialhost interactions, and likely participate in host specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Residue 223 variation in FimH of S.

Typhisuis, and fimH104 of S. Choleraesuis, a porcine isolate of this typical porcine-adapted serovar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All three encoded allelic adhesins mediated significantly greater bacterial binding to the porcine enterocytes IPEC-J2 when compared with all the other allelic FimH proteins, including FimH2 of S.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Most studies of host adaptation by bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella focus either on a functional analysis of a specific gene24 or utilize genomic comparisons to identify potential virulence genes4,25 but do not undertake subsequent functional assessments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The systematic approach used here determined that nsSNPs could potentially participate in the strain adaptation of Salmonella to individual host species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our ability to identify specific sequence-determined host-adhesion properties that may contribute to pathodaptation to specific host-species resulted from a novel stepwise approach starting with a genomic comparison of 12 strains of serovar Typhimurium, the quintessential broad host range S. enterica serovar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, SNPs in genes for membrane and surface-exposed proteins were among their most differentiating characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, none of the other strain characteristics, such as the accessory and unique genes, pseudogenes, mobile DNA or genomic rearrangements bore any association with host specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more stringent analysis of genes that encode S. Typhimurim surface proteins with known or suspected adhesive properties for colonization of host surfaces clearly highlighted associations between S. Typhimurium nsSNPs and specific hosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This in silico result was further supported by the ability of FimH7, the most frequent FimH allelic adhesin of the Salmonella type 1 fimbriae from bovine isolates, to preferentially bind to bovine rather than human enterocytes (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As an expansion of our investigation on FimH variants within another broad-range serovar, FimH of S. Newport, further illustrated nsSNPs effects on host-preferences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bovine isolates of serovar Newport had two fimH alleles for proteins that bound best to bovine cells, whereas the third fimH was mainly present in human isolates and encoded a FimH adhesin that bound best to human enterocytes (Fig 5 and Supplementary Figs 8 and 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the most impressive host-specific interactions were observed with the FimH adhesins of host-adapted systemic serovars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, a detailed analysis of allelic variants of FimH in the swine-adapted serovar Choleraesuis, which can cause systemic diseases in humans, identified allelic adhesins that preferentially bind to intestinal epithelial cells of either humans or swine (Fig 5 and Supplementary Figs 7 and 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The host-specific adhesive properties of the FimH allelic proteins corresponded significantly with the host origin of the Salmonella strains that carried the respective fimH allele, verifying their physiologic relevance in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noticeably, FimH of known host-associated serovars, such as Typhi, Dublin, Gallinarum, Pullorum and Cholereasuis, had at least one fimH allele for an adhesin that mediated preferential bacterial binding to the epithelial cells of their respective hosts (Fig 5 and Supplementary Figs 710).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, functional analysis of 21 allelic FimH adhesins confirmed the participation of these proteins in host-specific binding, strongly suggesting that preferential adhesion to relevant mammalian or avian cells participates in the evolutionary adaptation to specific hosts, even within individual serovars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These relevant associations were detected despite potential confounding effects, such as the likely inclusion of Salmonella strains from broad host serovars transiently passaging in non-preferential hosts, the polygenic nature of host-adaptive evolution, or nsSNPs responsible for neutral substitutions, highlighting the power of the approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our finding that all mammal-specific FimH allelic proteins identified bound intestinal cells of their hosts in a mannose-inhibitable manner was somewhat surprising, as it is currently unclear how binding of mannose residues on glycoprotein receptors could contribute to host specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We predict that the differential ability of FimH adherence to bind to various host cells is due to the density, accessibility, flexibility, orientation or length of the diverse mannose-bearing oligosaccharides on host cell-specific receptors18,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, such factors may explain why simple in vitro binding assays that classify FimH adhesins according to their binding affinity for mono-, tri- or penta-mannose model receptors, or adhesion to yeast or non-intestinal human cell lines27,28,29,30,31 do not always reflect their host-specific binding to intestinal cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, we found that the serovar Typhisuis FimH, which is identical to the serovar Indiana FimH reported to have low-affinity binding in vitro29, bound strongly to the porcine enterocytes (Fig 5 and Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, Choleraesuis FimH105 (V41G) and Newport FimH45, which do not bind mannose in vitro29, bound well to human intestinal cells, with the latter binding best to human Caco2 cells (Fig 5 and Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our results support the critical importance of utilizing physiologically relevant cells to functionally characterize pathogenhost interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although the binding of all mammalian FimH allelic proteins is mannose-sensitive, the specific binding of FimH adhesins from avian Pullorum and Gallinarum to chicken leukocytes is not mannose-inhibitable, indicating that this FimH allele recognizes a distinct receptor17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we confirmed the avian-specificity and relative insensitivity to mannose inhibition of the Gallinarum and Pullorum FimH, with the incomplete inhibition observed likely reflecting the use of alpha-methyl-D-mannoside, a modified and powerful inhibitor, in excess (Fig 5 and Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the FimH amino-acid substitution T56I in Gallinarum, Pullorum and chicken isolates of Paratyphi B with the fimH56 allele (Figs 3, 4b and 6f) is a strong determinant for avian specificity17,22,29,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutation of the avian fimH to substitute an isoleucine with a threonine at position 56, restores its ability to bind a mannosylated glycoprotein22, and a Gallinarum strain engineered to express such a mannose-binding FimH was significantly less invasive in chicks32, supporting the idea that this single amino-acid substitution determines both mannose-binding and avian host specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Gallinarum and Pullorum adhered to and invaded mammalian cells only when engineered to express the Typhimurium type 1 fimbriae with a threonine in position 56 of FimH33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our results corroborate the importance of the FimH amino-acid substitution at position 56 to make a jump between mammalian and avian hosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, our data confirm that a single amino-acid
