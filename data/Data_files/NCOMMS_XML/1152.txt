Large-scale GWAS identifies multiple loci for hand grip strength providing biological insights into muscular fitness  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Hand grip strength is a widely used proxy of muscular fitness, a marker of frailty, and predictor of a range of morbidities and all-cause mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the genetic determinants of variation in grip strength, we perform a large-scale genetic discovery analysis in a combined sample of 195,180 individuals and identify 16 loci associated with grip strength (P less_than 5 × 108) in combined analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of these loci contain genes implicated in structure and function of skeletal muscle fibres (ACTG1), neuronal maintenance and signal transduction (PEX14, TGFA, SYT1), or monogenic syndromes with involvement of psychomotor impairment (PEX14, LRPPRC and KANSL1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mendelian randomization analyses are consistent with a causal effect of higher genetically predicted grip strength on lower fracture risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, our findings provide new biological insight into the mechanistic underpinnings of grip strength and the causal role of muscular strength in age-related morbidities and mortality.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Muscle strength, measured by isometric hand grip strength, is an accessible and widely used proxy of muscular fitness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lower grip strength is associated with impaired quality of life in older adults, and is an established marker of frailty, predicting physical decline and functional limitation in daily living1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The value of grip strength as a clinical predictor of fracture risk has been demonstrated in different populations4,5, and higher grip strength has been found to be prognostic of walking recovery after hip fracture surgery in later life6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Grip strength has also been shown to predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality over many years of follow-up7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whilst it remains unclear whether these prospective associations with fracture risk, CVD and mortality are causalor reflect early manifestation of underlying disease processesthe role of muscular strength as a predictor of functional capacity highlights the importance of understanding its aetiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Grip strength is highly heritable (h2=3065%)10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whilst candidate gene approaches have implicated multiple loci in this phenotype, including thermogenic and myogenic factors13,14, there remain few robustly replicated associations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two genome-wide association studies in up to 27,000 individuals have been reported to date15,16, yielding one intergenic genome-wide significant association16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, in a combined sample size of 195,180 individuals, including 142,035 individuals from the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort17, we identified 16 genome-wide significant loci associated with grip strength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also performed Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses, which showed no evidence for causality in the associations of grip strength with CVD or all-cause mortality, but were suggestive of a causal effect of muscular strength on fracture risk.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Multiple novel loci are associated with grip strength', 'In stage one analyses, we tested the association of  greater than 17 million variants (minor allele frequency (MAF) greater than 0.1%, imputation quality  greater than 0.4), in 142,035 white European individuals from UK Biobank (Supplementary Table 1) with maximal grip strength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome-wide single-nucleotide variant (SNV) heritability was estimated at 23.9% (SE 2.7%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty-one loci showed genome-wide significant associations (P less_than 5 × 108) in stage one (Supplementary Fig 1), and were subsequently followed up in stage two analyses of up to 53,145 individuals from 8 additional studies (Supplementary Table 1; Supplementary Note) including the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twelve loci were independently replicated (directional consistency with stage one, P less_than 0.05) in stage two cohorts (Supplementary Table 2A) and 16 loci contained genome-wide significant associations (P less_than 5 × 108) in combined analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Effect sizes on grip strength ranged from 0.14 to 0.42 kg per allele under an additive model (Table 1; Supplementary Fig 1; Supplementary Table 2A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the discordance in sample size between stage one and two analyses, and in the interests of maximizing power, we considered there to be evidence of association at any locus reaching genome-wide significance in combined analyses, and pursued all 16 in downstream analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lead SNVs at the 16 grip strength-associated loci included common variants (MAF5%) in or near POLD3, TGFA, ERP27, HOXB3, GLIS1, PEX14, MGMT, LRPPRC, SYT1, GBF1, KANSL1, SLC8A1, IGSF9B, ACTG1, a low-frequency variant (MAF 3%) in DEC1, and a further common variant falling within the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region (Table 1; Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximate conditional analyses identified no additional signals at genome-wide significance at these 16 loci after conditioning on their respective lead SNVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At two loci, we saw evidence for a departure from additivity (P less_than 3.13 × 103 under a dominance deviation model (see Methods)); at the GBF1 locus, we saw evidence for a dominant effect of the grip strength-raising A allele (Pdomdev=2.3 × 103; Supplementary Fig 3A), and at the SYT1 locus, we saw evidence for a recessive effect of the grip strength-raising A allele (Pdomdev=3.0 × 103; Supplementary Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No individual variants showed significant effect modification by age or sex (Supplementary Table 2C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The association of the 16 SNV genetic score (modelled as the sum of the grip strength-increasing allele dosage at each SNV per individual) showed no interaction with age (Pinteraction=0.30), but was stronger in men than in women (men: =0.20 kg per grip strength-increasing allele, P=2.38 × 1048; women: =0.13 kg per grip strength-increasing allele, P=3.61 × 1043; Pinteraction=1.56 × 105; Fig 1; Supplementary Table 2C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Age at recruitment was independent of strength-increasing allele dosage at each of the 16 SNVs from combined analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equally, allele frequency at each SNP was not predicted by age, suggesting that there is no selection of alleles by age at these loci18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not replicate the previously-reported association at rs752045 with grip strength16 ( per minor allele (95% confidence interval (CI))=0.01 (0.06, 0.08), P=0.75).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Association of the sixteen loci reaching genome-wide significance in combined analyses.Full size table', 'Figure 1: Association of the 16

skeletal muscle (ACTG1), excitation-contraction coupling (SLC8A1), evidence for neurotrophic roles (TGFA), or involvement in the regulation of neurotransmission (SYT1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ACTG1 (Actin, 1A) encodes a key component of the costamerea protein complex localized to the Z-disc of skeletal muscle which physically tethers myofibrils to the cell membrane and transmits contractile force generated at the sarcomere to the extracellular matrix via the dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC)19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monogenic loss of elements of the DGC results in muscular dystrophies21, whilst Actg1 knockout mice display overt muscle weakness, progressive myopathy and decreased isometric twitch force22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SLC8A1 encodes a transmembrane Na+/Ca2+ exchanger which is vital to restoring Ca2+ concentration to pre-excitation levels in excitable cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Muscle-specific overexpression of SLC8A1 has been shown to induce dystrophy-like skeletal muscle pathology23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synaptotagmin-1, encoded by SYT1, is an integral synaptic membrane protein which regulates Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release at the presynaptic terminal24, and is implicated in development of neuromuscular junction pathology in rodent models of spinal muscular atrophy25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TGFA encodes transforming growth factor alpha, a well-characterized growth factor which plays a key neurotrophic role in the central and peripheral nervous systems26, and is upregulated during the acute injury response of motor neurons, promoting neuronal survival27,28.

particular, the inverted haplotype was associated with lower strength (=0.17 kg, P=3.85 × 106), independent of age, sex, height and BMI (Supplementary Table 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This association appeared to be driven by the inverted 2.2 structural variant (=0.18 kg, P=1.24 × 105).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In sensitivity analyses, we re-tested associations of the 16 grip strength variants in UKB

regulatory regions for a number of tissues, including bone/connective tissue (P=2.03 × 1010), skeletal muscle (P=1.88 × 109) and the CNS (P=7.37 × 108).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enrichments at weaker levels of

mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At LRPPRC (rs10186876), the strength-increasing allele was associated with higher LRPPRC expression levels in cerebellum (PEXP-Lead=6.35 × 107, PEXP-Best eQTL=9.35 × 108, r2=0.93) and cerebellar hemisphere (PEXP-Lead=1.29 × 106, PEXP-Best eQTL=3.62 × 108, r2=1.00), which appears directionally concordant with previously characterized loss of function and otherwise

levels of MGP expression in tibial nerve (PEXP-Lead=5.90 × 1010, PEXP-Best eQTL=2.19 × 1012, r2=0.84).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MGP (Matrix Gla Protein) is a well-characterized inhibitor of vascular tissue and

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have identified 16 loci associated with maximal hand grip strength at genome-wide significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of the lead variants were located within or close to genes implicated in structure and function of skeletal muscle fibres, neuronal maintenance and signal transduction in the central and peripheral nervous systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Partitioned heritability analyses indicated significant tissue-specific enrichment of skeletal muscle, CNS, connective tissue and bone in the genome-wide grip strength results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed evidence of shared genetic aetiology between lean mass and grip strength, while pathway analyses indicated a role for genes involved in regulation of protein catabolism in the aetiology of grip strength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Due to the well-established observational associations of grip strength with mortality and incident CHD it has been hypothesized that improvement of muscle strength might increase longevity and reduce risk of adverse cardiovascular events7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our MR analyses do not find evidence supportive of a causal role of muscular strength in mortality risk, nor in risk of cardiovascular events (CHD and MI), leaving open the possibility that these observational associations may be attributable to confounding and/or reverse causality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless, this does not negate the importance of maintaining strength and muscle mass during ageing as a strategy to maintain physical function59, and we acknowledge the potential limitations of our MR. For example, the limited variance in intermediate traits explained by genetic variants leaves uncertainty over the presence of a small causal effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, expanded genetic discovery efforts and greater availability of large-scale studies of disease outcomes will improve the precision of MR analyses in future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We saw evidence for shared genetic aetiology of bone mineral density and lean mass with grip strength, and MR results suggested a causal role for higher muscular strength in lower risk of fracture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results suggest that the determinants of muscular strength are shared with the determinants of fracture risk and are consistent with findings from intervention studies to increase muscle strength, which have been shown to improve functional capacity and reduce the rate of falls59, as well as attenuating the rate of functional decline and increased frailty which often follows major fracture among the elderly60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the established decline in grip strength with increasing age, we did not observe heterogeneity in the effect of grip strength-associated variants with grip strength by age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we did observe that the cumulative effect of the genetic score was greater in men than women.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We saw evidence of enrichment of associations with grip strength around genes implicated in myopathies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also noted three loci with genome-wide significant associations containing genes (KANSL1, PEX14 and LRPPRC) implicated in rare, severe clinical syndromes characterized by phenotypes of progressive psychomotor impairment, muscle hypotonia and neuropathy29,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the UKB discovery cohort, the association of all three loci with grip strength persisted at genome-wide significance even after sensitivity analyses restricted to participants without any form of self-reported condition which might affect muscle mass or function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whilst these clinical conditions represent the extreme phenotype of highly deleterious rare mutations in these genes, we demonstrate that proximal common variants are likely to underpin more subtle population-level variation in strength in healthy populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, we found that common variation at ACVR2B, the principal receptor of myostatin and activin in skeletal muscle, is associated with population-level variation in grip strength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ongoing clinical trials and development of pharmaceutical agents targeting this pathway have demonstrated their potential to reverse atrophy and improve physical functioning46, and our findings provide some level of genetic support for a role in muscular strength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we identified 16 loci robustly implicated in grip strength and provide insight into the underlying biology of this important, widely studied, yet poorly characterized trait.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MR analyses suggest no causal role for muscular strength in mortality, but do provide evidence for a causal role in fracture risk, highlighting the importance of interventions to improve muscle strength as a means to reduce fracture risk and resultant morbidities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further genetic and functional work to characterize these loci will elucidate new pathways involved in the regulation of muscle strength and inform the development of drugs to tackle muscle wasting and weakness.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Study cohorts', 'Stage one (discovery) analyses comprised participants drawn from the UK Biobank (UKB) study17, a large population-based cohort of middle and older-aged (4069 years) British residents recruited from UK National Health Service (NHS) primary care registers between 2006 and 2010.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, 503,325 participants were enrolled, and attended an initial assessment visit at one of 22 study centres located throughout England, Scotland and Wales, during which a comprehensive catalogue of anthropometric, lifestyle and behavioural exposures were assessed, and biological samples were attained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All participants provided informed consent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  UKB gained ethical approval from the National Research Ethics Committee (North West) and was conducted in full compliance with principles of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Independent lead variants from stage one were followed-up (stage two analyses) in an independent sample of up to 53,145 white European individuals drawn from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium16 and an additional seven collaborating studies, which had assessed maximal isometric hand grip strength by dynamometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details of all stage two cohorts (including the constituent cohorts of CHARGE) are provided in the Supplementary Note.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further descriptive details of the seven additional cohorts are provided in Supplementary Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Descriptive details of CHARGE Cohorts have been published in detail elsewhere16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Assessment of grip strength and covariates', 'Hand grip strength at baseline in UKB was measured isometrically using a calibrated Jamar J00105 hydraulic hand dynamometer (Lafayette Instrument Company, IN, USA) adjusted to the individuals hand size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the participant seated, one measurement was taken per hand, and maximal grip strength taken as the higher of the two readings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Body mass was assessed using a BC418MA Body Composition Analyser (Tanita Europe BV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), with the participant dressed in light clothing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Standing height was measured on a rigid stadiometer (Seca, Birmingham, UK).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phenotyping details for each of the stage two cohorts are detailed in Supplementary Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Genotyping and imputation', 'Our stage one analyses use data from UKBs imputed interim genotyping release (May 2015), restricted to biallelic SNVs with MAF 0.1%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genotyping and imputation were conducted by UKB using a centralized pipeline, for which detailed protocols are available (see URLs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, UKB extracted DNA from EDTA buffy coat, before shipping to Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, USA) for centralized genotyping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were genotyped at  greater than 800,000 loci on two custom-designed arrays with 95% common content, designed to optimize quality and quantity of genome-wide imputation: the UK Biobank Axiom array, and the UK BiLEVE Axiom Array.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After restriction to biallelic SNVs with MAF1% and additional sample genotyping QC, a subset of 641,081 autosomal SNVs from 152,256 samples were available for imputation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SNVs were pre-phased using SHAPEIT3 software and imputed (using a modified version of IMPUTE2 software) to a merged reference panel containing haplotypes from the UK10K Consortium combined with the 1000 Genomes Project reference (see URLs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach has previously been shown to provide a high-quality imputation reference in populations of mixed ancestry61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genotyping and imputation details of stage two cohorts are detailed in Supplementary Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', '17q21.31 Haplotype imputation and analyses', 'Nine structural haplotypes previously reported at 17q21.31 were imputed according to previous work33,34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imputation was based on a haplotype reference panel34, which uniquely coded each structural haplotype using a combination of twelve surrogate, virtual binary markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the file contained 6,302 flanking variant haplotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IMPUTE v2.3.2 was used to impute the genotypes of the surrogate markers against the reference panel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The panel contained 284 genotyped variants within the reference region, pre-phased with SHAPEIT v2.837.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variants within the copy-number variable region, or with MAF less_than 0.01/Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium P less_than 1 × 106 were excluded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surrogate markers were subsequently decoded into the corresponding nine structural haplotypes for analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Association of haplotypes (inverted versus non-inverted, continuous structural variant // copy number, and 9 common haplotypes as a categorical exposure) with grip strength was modelled using linear regression adjusted for age, sex, height (m), BMI (kg m2) and UKB genotype chip in up to 111,860 unrelated genetic white Europeans

using Restricted Estimate Maximum Likelihood (REML) models in BOLT-LMM software (v2.2)62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic variance was calculated on all quality controlled genotyped autosomal SNVs, adjusting for genotyping array and the top five genetically-determined principal components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Genome-wide association analyses of grip strength', '142,035 UKB participants had imputed genetic data, grip strength and full covariate availability for genome-wide association analyses; all were of self-identified white ancestry, with the majority (94.6%) reporting as white British.

BOLT-LMM software (v2.2)62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary analyses assumed additive (per-allele) effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses were restricted to biallelic variants with MAF0.1% which had been directly typed, or imputed with imputation quality (IMPUTE2 info)0.4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LMMs offer a robust solution to handle unknown confounding (particularly that arising from sub-ethnic population stratification and cryptic relatedness) in genome-wide association studies, and confer increased power in large population-based cohorts62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Independent loci from genome-wide discovery were defined as the 500 kb region flanking each lead variant reaching genome wide significance (P5 × 108).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Independent lead variants (n=21) were followed-up in up to 53,145 individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cases where an index variant was not typed or imputed at sufficient quality, appropriate proxies were defined as the variant with the next-lowest P-value within 500 kb of the index (Supplementary Table 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each stage two cohort accounted for population structure according to its usual practice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full details of the analytical approach and model specification of each replication cohort are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stage one and stage two results for each of the 21 variants were combined by inverse variance-weighted fixed-effect meta-analysis using METAL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sixteen loci reached P5 × 108 in combined meta-analysis and were considered to be associated with grip strength.

the CEU panel of 1000G Phase I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate possible independent signals at each of the 16 replicated loci, approximate conditional analyses were undertaken using Genome-Wide Complex Trait Analysis software (GCTA, Version 1.25.2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'LD score regression', 'Using genome-wide summary statistics from our UKB phase one analyses, the recently-described LD Score Regression method described by Bulik-Sullivan and colleagues63 (implemented in LDSC software, v1.0.0) was used to (i) estimate genetic correlation between grip strength and other phenotypes, and (ii) derive tissue-specific partitioned heritability of grip strength, based on pre-calculated European LD Scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid confounding by imputation quality, all analyses were restricted to variants available in HapMap Phase III.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Genetic correlations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using cross-trait LD Score regression, genome-wide genetic correlations of grip strength were calculated with CHD risk, lean mass index (LMI), fat mass index (FMI) and bone mineral density (BMD) measured at the forearm, femoral neck or lumbar spine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For CHD and BMD we used publicly available GWAS summary statistics form the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D57 and GEFOS58 consortia, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain genome-wide summary statistics for LMI and FMI, we conducted GWAS in up to 12 851 individuals drawn from the Fenland Study and EPIC-Norfolk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details of these cohorts are provided in the Supplementary Note, and Supplementary Table 14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LMI and FMI (kg m2) were defined as dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-derived lean mass or fat mass, respectively, divided by the square of DXA-derived height (GE Lunar Prodigy processed using Lunar EnCORE v14.1, GE Healthcare).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GWAS were conducted separately in each cohort running a linear mixed model using BOLT-LMM62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FMI analyses were adjusted for age and sex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the sex specific distribution of the phenotype, LMI analyses were run sex stratified and adjusted for age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results from both cohorts were combined by fixed-effect inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis using METAL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Tissue-specific partitioned heritability: Partitioned heritability by LD Score Regression can identify whether certain cell types are enriched for functional gene categories which disproportionately contribute to the heritability of a phenotype36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, over-represented effector tissues important in the aetiology of the phenotype can be identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Partitioned heritability was run individually for each of the eight curated tissue classes distributed with LDSC, adjusting in each case for heritability explained by each functional category of variants across the genome (that is, in a non-tissue-specific manner).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Bonferroni-corrected log10 P-value accounting for eight tests was taken as indicative of statistical significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Expression analyses', 'To explore the potential functional significance of grip strength variants in gene expression, and to prioritize functional genes falling within identified loci, we undertook a number of expression-based analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially, a look-up of all 16 replicated grip strength variants or their best proxy (r2 greater than 0.8) was conducted in skeletal muscle, transformed fibroblasts, nervous system and brain regions in the GTEx resource to identify eQTL associations (see URLs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variants passing GTEx criteria for tissue-specific eQTL association, and in high LD (r20.8) with the best eQTL for the transcript in question in the tissue of interest were considered significant eQTLs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To supplement this variant-centric approach, we additionally took advantage of two new methods for integrating genome wide GWAS summary statistics with expression associations from independent studies: SMR40 and MetaXcan39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By utilizing established eQTL data sets as reference, these approaches are able to effectively model expected variation in the transcriptome of the GWAS sample based on variation in autosomal SNVs across the genome, and then test for independent associations between imputed transcript levels and the phenotype of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test for associations of transcript abundance with grip strength in whole blood, we implemented SMR software using published whole blood eQTL data from Westra and colleagues41 as the reference panel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MetaXcanan extension of the PrediXcan approach modified to use summary-level association statistics as inputanalyses were used to explore further tissue-specific associations between modelled gene expression and grip strength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissue-specific expression prediction models generated from GTEx were downloaded from the PredictDB resource (see URLs) as transcriptome reference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conservatively considered predicted expression of a gene to be associated with grip strength
