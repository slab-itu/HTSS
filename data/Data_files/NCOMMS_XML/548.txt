Genome-wide association study for acute otitis media in children identifies FNDC1 as disease contributing gene  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Acute otitis media (AOM) is among the most common pediatric diseases, and the most frequent reason for antibiotic treatment in children.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Risk of AOM is dependent on environmental and host factors, as well as a significant genetic component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify genome-wide significance at a locus on 6q25.3 (rs2932989, Pmeta=2.15 × 1009), and show that the associated variants are correlated with the methylation status of the FNDC1 gene (cg05678571, P=1.43 × 1006), and further show it is an eQTL for FNDC1 (P=9.3 × 1005).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mouse homologue, Fndc1, is expressed in middle ear tissue and its expression is upregulated upon lipopolysaccharide treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this first GWAS of AOM and the largest OM genetic study to date, we identify the first genome-wide significant locus associated with AOM.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Otitis media (OM) is among the most common pediatric diseases, and the most frequent reason for antibiotic treatment, in children.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interrelated phenotypes include acute OM (AOM), recurrent AOM and OM with effusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among OM phenotypes, AOM is defined by the presence of (purulent) fluid in the middle ear accompanied by earache, bulging of the tympanic membrane and fever, usually preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection1,2,3, which is the type of OM most frequently encountered by pediatricians, and constitutes the largest number of OM patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The etiology of OM is one of complex associations between environmental, pathogen, host and genetic risk factors4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heritability is well-established in sibling, twin and family studies, with the fraction of phenotype variability attributed to genetic variation (h2) estimated between 0.22 and 0.74 (refs 5, 6, 7, 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The genetic susceptibility loci for OM are not well understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Candidate gene studies, based on biological plausibility of the genes and evidence from model organisms, have examined the association of some relevant genes to OM and yielded significant associations for  greater than 20 genes including several interleukin (IL) genes, mucin genes, TLR4, FBXO11, TNF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (reviewed by Rye et al.9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as with most candidate gene studies, results are conflicting with only a small proportion of the discoveries replicating in independent studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, agnostic discovery approaches have been adopted to identify the genetic susceptibility loci underlying OM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at several loci have been reported to be associated with OM, such as those at 10q26.3, 19q13.43, 17q12, 10q22.3, 2q31.1 for association with chronic and recurrent OM10,11,12,13, 2p23.1 (genes CAPN14, GALNT14) and 20q11.21 (BPIFA gene) for association with OM in general14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of these signals broke the threshold of genome-wide significance (P less_than 5 × 108), likely due to the small sample size and limited number of genetic variants examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study of OM via exome sequencing identified the cosegregation of a rare duplication variant in gene A2ML1 with OM in a Filipino pedigree, and additional A2ML1 variants were found in otitis-prone American children15, but these variants were all of very low frequency which could not account for the high prevalence of OM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, there has been no genetic study specifically examining the susceptibility loci for AOM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify susceptibility loci for AOM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the meta-analysis of two discovery cohorts including 825 cases, 7,936 controls and 1,219 cases, 1067 controls respectively, we identify a genome-wide significant locus at on 6q25.3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We subsequently replicate the association in an additional cohort of 293 cases of AOM and 1,719 controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further reveal significant correlation between the associated variant and the methylation status and expression levels of the fibronectin type III domain containing 1 (FNDC1) gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we demonstrate that the mouse homologue Fndc1 is expressed in the middle ear tissue and is being upregulated under proinflammatory conditions, such as lipopolysaccharide treatment, suggesting FNDC1 is the causal gene underlying the association.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'GWAS identifies AOM susceptibility locus', 'We performed a GWAS on AOM with age of onset  less_than 3 years old.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both patients and controls were recruited and their genomic DNA (gDNA) was genotyped at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the Generation R Study (Supplementary Figs 1 and 2, Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the discovery phase, all samples were genotyped using Illumina HumanHap550-V1/V3 or HumanHap610 or 660-Quad DNA Bead Chips.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After quality control filtering, a total of 825 cases and 7,936 controls of European descent retained for analysis at CHOP together with 1219 cases and 1,067 controls at Generation R. Logistic regression analysis under an additive model was performed to assess the association between SNP genotype and AOM at each individual site, including the first three principal components and sex as covariates (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The residual genomic inflation factor was 1.00 for analysis at CHOP and 1.01 at the Generation R Study (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The site-specific GWAS were subsequently meta-analysed to combine the 460,000 exclusively non-imputed SNPs (minor allele frequency (MAF) greater than 0.01) shared by the two centers, using a sample-size based fixed-effect model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One variant on 6q25.3 with MAF 0.13 in controls (rs2932989, Pmeta=4.36 × 1008) (Table 1, Supplementary Fig 5) surpassed the genome-wide significance threshold (P less_than 5 × 1008) following the meta-analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The associated locus was subsequently imputed using the 1,000Genome data set as a reference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 77 genotyped and imputed SNPs in this region showed suggestive association with P values  less_than 5 × 1005 (Fig 1a, Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Genome-wide significant association of 6q25.3 with acute otitis media.Full size table', 'Figure 1: The association statistics of locus 6q25.3 with acute otitis media and correlation with methylation status in gene FNDC1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The regional association plot at locus 6q25.3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SNP chromosomal location on genome build hg19 is indicated on the x axis and the negative log10 of P value for each SNP is plotted on the left-hand y axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Association statistics were from the meta-analysis of the two cohorts in the discovery phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most associated SNP (rs2932989) is shown as purple dot and the other SNPs including both genotyped SNPs and imputed SNPs are coloured according to their linkage disequilibrium with SNP rs2932989.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recombination rates are shown as blue lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plot was generated with software LocusZoom70.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The position of the methylation probe cg05678571 is indicated by a grey dot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) M-values for methylation probe cg05678571 are plotted against the additive genotype at SNP rs2932989.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dark horizontal lines in the boxplots represent the median of the group, the boxes represent the 2575% quantiles, and the whiskers of the boxplot extend beyond those quartiles to 1.5 times the interquartile range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data outside those ranges are represented by points (open circles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Red diamonds indicate the means of each group, and the red text is the mean±s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of each group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of individuals with each additive genotype of minor allele T is indicated below the x axis.Full size image', 'We subsequently investigated whether the association signal could be replicated in an independent cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional 293 cases of AOM and 1,719 controls were recruited at CHOP and genotyped for this purpose, using the Illumina HumanOmniExpress-12 v1 chip (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The replication samples were mainly of European and African American ancestry with a minority of subjects of Asian and Hispanic ancestry (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first three principal components and sex were included as covariates in the association analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting genomic inflation factor was 1.01 (Supplementary Fig 4), suggesting population stratification was well controlled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the top SNP from the discovery cohort, rs2932989 is not directly genotyped on the HumanOmniExpress chip, two proxy SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium (r2=1) with rs2932989 both showed association with AOM (P less_than 0.05) (Supplementary Table 4) in the replication cohort and approached genome-wide significance in the discovery cohort based on imputed genotype data (P=7.49 × 1007 for rs578217 and P=9.79 × 1007 for rs419009, Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct interrogation of rs2932989 following imputation of the replication cohort confirmed the association P=0.0155 (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further meta-analysis of the discovery cohorts and the replication cohort yielded a P value of 2.15 × 1009 for top SNP rs2932989.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We, therefore, demonstrate the first genome-wide significant association of common variation with susceptibility to AOM and replicate the finding in an independent pediatric AOM cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Test statistics for suggestive loci and candidate genes', 'In addition to the genome-wide significant association at 6q25.3 locus, we also observed suggestive evidence for association at eight additional loci (5 × 108 less_than P value less_than 5 × 105;

http://www.eurexpress.org; GTEx database25) indicate FNDC1 is expressed in different tissue types with high levels in mesenchymal stem cells, synovial membrane, fetal cartilage, thyroid gland, adipose tissue and others (Supplementary Fig 7; Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Fndc1 expression was also found in pharyngeal tissues including the oral epithelium, next to esophagus tissue, lips, palate and salivary glands (Supplementary Table 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Database Bgee: Gene Expression Evolution (http://bgee.unil.ch/)26 included three studies detecting the expression of Fndc1 in mice ears and one study showed its expression in inner ears27,28,29; additional data from the Shared Harvard Inner-Ear Laboratory database (https://shield.hms.harvard.edu) indicate Fndc1 expression is present in both the cochlea and utricle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further conducted experiments to examine the expression of Fndc1 in mouse middle ears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By western blotting, we observed not only the expression of Fndc1 in C57/BL6 mice middle ears but also the upregulation of Fndc1 upon lipopolysaccharide treatment compared with control treated with PBS alone (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'AOM variants correlate with FNDC1 expression and methylation', 'In addition to the expression of FNDC1 in tissues of relevance to the phenotype, data from the GTEx database25 also indicates the AOM associated SNP, rs2932989, is an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for FNDC1 in esophageal smooth muscle (Supplementary Fig 9) (P=9.3 × 1005).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Evidence of an association between the AOM-associated variants and FNDC1 expression was further strengthened following the analysis of methylation data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found significant association between methylation probe cg05678571 (chr6:159,660,813159,660,813, Fig 1a) and rs2932989 (beta=0.200, P=1.43 × 106, Fig 1b) and even a stronger association between cg05678571 and SNP rs2501175 (beta=0.31, P=7.27 × 1015;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In summary, we have performed the first GWAS of AOM and the largest genetic study of OM to date, the most common medical problem encountered by general pediatric practitioners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discovered genome-wide significance at a locus on 6q25.3 that contains the FNDC1 gene and replicated the association in an independent pediatric cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further show that the mouse homologue of this gene is expressed in the middle ear and is upregulated upon lipopolysaccharide treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the tissue expression patterns, the eQTL and methylation data also implicate FNDC1 as the causal gene underlying the association.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'FNDC1 gene encodes a fibronectin type III domain containing protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fibronectin is an important type of extracellular matrix proteins, which interacts with integrins and is involved in cell adhesion, migration, proliferation and differentiation37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only a few studies have been reported regarding the function of FNDC1, which suggest that FNDC1 is involved in multiple cellular processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FNDC1 was expressed in heart tissue, with the role of activating G-protein signalling by interacting with G38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interaction also affects CX43 function and cell permeability, thus sensitizing cells to hypoxic stress in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes and playing an essential role in hypoxia induced apoptosis39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While the biological function of FNDC1 has not been well studied, it has been shown that FNDC1 has a role in inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FNDC1 was first identified as a differentially expressed mRNA from human dermal fibroblasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its expression level is increased following treatment with TGF-, IL-1 and TNF-23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Partially unfolded type III fibronectin module has been shown to induce the expression of IL-8 and TNF- via activation of the NF-B signalling pathway, suggesting that fibronectin matrix remodelling may impact cytokine expression40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both tissue remodelling and increased levels of cytokines are involved in AOM42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with these observations, in our study, the minor allele (T allele) of SNP rs2392989 confers a higher risk of AOM and is correlated with a lower level of methylation at cg05678571 in FNDC1, as well as higher expression of FNDC1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Fndc1 expression in mouse middle ear was upregulated upon lipopolysaccharide treatment, which is known to be a potent inducer of inflammation, stimulating TGF-, TNF- and IL-1 signalling44,45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the association of FNDC1 with OM and its expression being modulated by lipopolysaccharide, several important players involved in these signalling pathways of inflammatory responses also showed at least nominal association with OM in our GWAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FNDC1 is also one of the differentially expressed genes in primary central nervous system lymphoma compared with normal lymph node tissues47, with possible involvement in lymphocyte production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the cumulative evidence from literature and the results from our GWAS and mouse experiments suggest that FNDC1 may have a role in the pathogenesis of OM, likely through altered immune or inflammatory response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The diverse signalling processes that FNDC1 is involved in are inter-related.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an environment of inflammation, hypoxia is typical, with decreased level of oxygen and glucose, as well as increased level of inflammatory cytokines48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypoxia and hypoxia-inducible factor have an important role in chronic OM and myringotomy reduces hypoxia and inflammation, which are demonstrated by mouse model49,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypoxia-inducible factor is of well-known function in hypoxia induced apoptosis51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypoxia signalling is linked to innate immunity, adaptive immunity and infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes functioning in hypoxia signalling interact with players of NF-B pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (reviewed by Eltzschig and Carmeliet52) G protein signalling is of critical roles in various immune functions53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FNDC1 interactor G has important functions in immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, it activates PI3Kgamma, regulating inflammation through neutrophil recruitment54,55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also activates RhoGef, involved in lymphocyte chemotaxis and actin polymerization56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It would be interesting to examine whether FNDC1 is involved in AOM pathogenesis through any of these signalling pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Among the genes that have been previously proposed to be involved in OM pathogenesis, we found more than half of them exhibited nominally significant association, suggesting consistency between genetic studies and/or with results from model organism studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not surprising that some of the candidate genes did not show significant association, considering the following possible reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our GWAS, we focused on a more defined phenotype of early-onset AOM, which is different from the phenotypes examined in many of the previous OM genetic studies including OM in general, chronic OM or OM with effusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, different ethnicity of the study population is another influential factor to consider.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, polymorphisms of candidate genes, proposed based on evidence from differential gene expression, molecular, cellular functions and rodent model studies, may not always present an effect large enough to be captured by GWAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The strength of the study lies in the largest sample size and dense genome-wide SNP coverage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we have balanced power and optimal quality control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with previous efforts, this study applied more stringent quality control and more robust correction for population substructure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, by performing principal-component analysis (PCA) to identify participants of European ancestry, followed by a second PCA on this selected population, we were able to more thoroughly correct for population stratification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By a well-defined phenotype in both populations we were able to combine data from two studies of different designs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Limitation herein is severity of disease, as in one population cases consisted of children who were specifically diagnosed with AOM, likely the more severe episodes, whereas the other population used extensive questionnaires, discovering even the mildest of episodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences were resolved by the increased power of combining the studies, underlined by results showing the same direction of effect and similar effect size between both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the P value of homogeneity test in our meta-analysis is  greater than 0.9 for the genome-wide significant SNP rs2932989, which indicates that there is no suggestion of between-study heterogeneity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This study provides evidence of a genetic component influencing susceptibility to AOM in children.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By gaining better understanding of the complex polygenetic pathogenesis of AOM, we hope to be able to develop more specific therapies and to ultimately learn which children are most susceptible to this disease, where earlier clinical intervention may have the most impact.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

and unmethylated probe intensities) were extracted and stored as a matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additive genotypes at rs2932989 for subjects of European ancestry were extracted from existing genotyping data using PLINK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are a total of 402 subjects of European ancestry without missing genotype at rs2932989 and extreme outlier values of methylation M-values (median M-value of the genotype group±3 s.d.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Methylation data in gene FNDC1 were analysed as the response variable in a linear regression, with genotype at rs2932989 as the predictor variable among these 402 subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sex, age, and 10 genotype-derived principle components were included as covariates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Linear regression and generation of boxplots was performed using base packages in R.", 'Animals', 'The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the CHOP approved all animal studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C57/BL6 female mice were used in the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were randomly distributed into two groups and deeply anesthetized, using ketamine (100 mg per kg) and xylazine (10 mg per kg) via intraperitoneal injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimental group received lipopolysaccharide (2 mg per ml) in PBS, 20 ul per ear derived from Salmonella typhimurium (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.01 M PBS was injected into the middle ears of the control group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were killed at third day after injection of lipopolysaccharide or PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Western blot analysis', 'For western blot analysis, mice middle ear tissue, including the epithelial lining was removed from animals after decapitation and sonicated in ice-cold NP40 lysis buffer (Invitrogen) containing protease inhibitor (Calbiochem).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins extracts were boiled for 5 min in SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (0.125 M Tris-HCl, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, and 0.005% bromo-phenol blue) for denaturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 20-g protein sample was separated on a 412% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel (Novex), transferred overnight to a nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen), and blocked overnight with 3% BSA tris-buffered saline with Tween (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The membrane was cut in half with the upper half of the membrane incubated with rabbit anti-FNDC1 polyclonal antibody (H-65; sc-382009) at 1:1000 dilution and the lower half of the membrane probed with rabbit anti--Actin polyclonal antibody (N-21; sc-130656) at 1:1000 dilution at room temperature for one hour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, the membranes were washed for three times and incubated in a 1:10,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidaseconjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Promega) for 1 h at room temperature and washed again three times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WesternBright enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Advansta) was used to detect bound antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then the band
