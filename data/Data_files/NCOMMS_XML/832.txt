Stepwise reprogramming of liver cells to a pancreas progenitor state by the transcriptional regulator Tgif2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The development of a successful lineage reprogramming strategy of liver to pancreas holds promises for the treatment and potential cure of diabetes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The liver is an ideal tissue source for generating pancreatic cells, because of its close developmental origin with the pancreas and its regenerative ability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, the molecular bases of hepatic and pancreatic cellular plasticity are still poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report that the TALE homeoprotein TGIF2 acts as a developmental regulator of the pancreas versus liver fate decision and is sufficient to elicit liver-to-pancreas fate conversion both ex vivo and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hepatocytes expressing Tgif2 undergo extensive transcriptional remodelling, which represses the original hepatic identity and, over time, induces a pancreatic progenitor-like phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, in vivo forced expression of Tgif2 activates pancreatic progenitor genes in adult mouse hepatocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study uncovers the reprogramming activity of TGIF2 and suggests a stepwise reprogramming paradigm, whereby a lineage-restricted dedifferentiation step precedes the identity switch.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Successful lineage reprogramming relies on the identification of defined factor(s) able to establish the new cell fate transcriptional program and, concomitantly, silence the original gene expression program1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we sought to investigate cellular plasticity between liver and pancreas and to what extent this enables their fate interconversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Lineage reprogramming holds distinct advantages over stem cell-based replacement strategies, with the new cells being autologous in origin, residing within their native tissue, and with a theoretically lower risk of tumorigenesis5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies have unveiled an unsuspected degree of cellular plasticity in the adult pancreas and pointed to pancreas-resident cells as potential sources for new -cells6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, from a clinical perspective, adult liver cells hold important advantages over pancreatic cells, representing a more accessible and abundant starting cell population for fate conversion approaches to generate pancreatic cells with therapeutic potential3,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, adenovirus-mediated ectopic expression of pancreatic transcription factors (TF) (for example, Pdx1, Ngn3) in the liver has been shown to partially correct hyperglycaemia in diabetic mice, even though the phenotypic conversion appears incomplete17,18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, delivery of the same pancreatic TFs through adeno-associated viruses (AAV), which have low-immunogenity but high-transduction efficiency, or upon transgene expression in mice did not exert the same effects19,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations are consistent with the fact that the two lineages are closely related but yet at a greater distance than cells of the same lineage, for example, exocrine and endocrine pancreas cells23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional limitations might be the lack of appropriate interaction partners or the presence of antagonistic factors in liver cells that lock cell identity, hampering cell plasticity and conversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome these lineage restrictions, we investigated whether developmental regulator(s) of the pancreas versus liver fate decision might be effective reprogramming determinants for achieving conversion of liver cells into pancreas fate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The transcriptional mechanisms underlying hepatic and pancreatic lineage divergence in the mouse embryo begin to be unravelled25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a RNASeq gene expression profile of liver and pancreas progenitor cells isolated from the mouse embryo, we identified the Three-Amino-acid-Loop-Extension (TALE) homeobox TG-interacting factor 2 (TGIF2) at the cell-fate branchpoint, being in the common endoderm progenitor pool and whose expression changes in opposite directions as cells commit to pancreatic or hepatic lineages25,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TALE proteins are involved in many crucial developmental processes and diseases through their function as Hox-transcriptional co-regulators, but also through Hox-independent mechanisms29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TGIF2 contains a highly conserved homeodomain and has been described as a context-independent transcriptional repressor, exerting its function either through modulation of the BMP/TGF-beta pathway or through direct DNA binding28,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Xenopus embryos, Tgif2 acts as an intracellular endodermal effector promoting pancreatic fate by inhibiting BMP signalling28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the mouse embryo, overlapping functions between Tgif2 and its close family member, Tgif1, have been previously reported during different embryological processes, such as gastrulation and neural development32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we demonstrate that TGIF2 is a developmental regulator of pancreas versus liver fate decision using both loss- and gain-of function experiments in mouse embryos and embryonic stem (ES) cells, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, when ectopically expressed in murine adult liver cells, TGIF2 promotes suppression of the hepatic transcriptional program and induction of a subset of pancreatic genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, hepatocytes expressing Tgif2 acquire a pancreatic progenitor state and upon exposure to pancreatic microenvironment or in vivo transplantation into diabetic mice the reprogrammed cells undergo further differentiation and acquire certain functional pancreatic properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, in vivo AAV-mediated Tgif2 expression in adult mice turns on marker genes of the pancreatic lineage in hepatocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, this study defines a novel strategy for controlled generation of pancreatic progenitors based on TGIF2-dependent fate conversion and opens to new investigation into the mechanistic aspects of cellular identity and plasticity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that Tgif2 enhanced differentiation of the DE-induced population toward pancreatic fate, as judged by the further increase in expression levels of Sox17, Pdx1 and Hnf1b (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, when DE cells were differentiated into hepatic endoderm (HE)44 in the presence of Tgif2, we observed marked decrease in the expression of liver-specific genes (for example, Serpina1, Hnf4a, C/EBPa) (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our results indicate that TGIF2 acts as a developmental regulator of the hepatopancreatic lineage, pushing foregut progenitors toward pancreatic cell fate and counteracting hepatic fate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, these properties make TGIF2 a pertinent candidate to be tested for lineage reprogramming of liver to pancreas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Tgif2 expression induces adult murine liver cells to acquire molecular features of pancreatic progenitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Map of LVs and schematic of the ex vivo reprogramming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Murine adult primary or BAML hepatocytes (HEP) were transduced with the constitutively active PGK-TGIF2-EGFP LV (LV-TGIF2) expressing Tgif2 and EGFP, FACS-sorted for EGFP and characterized at different time points by various ex vivo and in vivo approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) RT-qPCR analysis of hepatic and pancreatic gene expression in mouse primary HEPs at d7 and d14 after transduction with LV-TGIF2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were normalized to Sdha and represented as Log2-expression ratio between LV-TGIF2-transduced and control hepatocytes at matched time-points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) RT-qPCR analysis of hepatic and pancreatic gene expression in murine adult BAML HEP cells transduced with LV-TGIF2 at the indicated time points after transduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were normalized to Sdha and represented as Log2-expression ratio between LV-TGIF2-transduced and control cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values shown are mean±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (n=5) *P less_than 0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) IF of unsorted (no FACS) LV-TGIF2-transduced (right) BAML HEP cells and control cells (left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In top panel of LV-TGIF2-transduced cells, asterisks (*) indicate Albumin (ALB)-positive cells that are PDX1-negative;

Supplementary Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At one week after transduction with LV-TGIF2, we measured robust ectopic Tgif2 expression and concomitant repression of liver-specific genes, including Albumin, Serpina1 and Transthyretin (Ttr), and the TFs Hex, Hnf4a and Hnf4a1 liver-specific isoform (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two weeks post-transduction, the depletion of hepatic transcripts was maintained (Fig 3b) and accompanied by induction of pancreatic progenitor genes, such as the TFs Pdx1, Ptf1a, Neurod1, Pax6, MafA, Isl1, and Insm1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23), as well as Nestin, encoding an intermediate filament protein, which marks undifferentiated pancreatic precursor cells at E10.5 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  45) (Fig 3b; Supplementary Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the expression of all these pancreatic TFs, besides Pdx1 and Ptf1a, begins at the onset of pancreatic bud formation by E10.5 and later is restricted to the endocrine cell population23,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LV-TGIF2 did not affect the expression levels of endogenous Tgif2 or Tgif1 (Supplementary Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Prolonged analysis of the LV-TGIF2-transduced cells beyond 2 weeks was not possible because of the limited viability of primary HEP cultures in vitro46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome this problem, we used the well-characterized non-transformed BAML hepatic cell line48, as an additional ex vivo model system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BAML is a cell line established from adult wild-type mouse liver that was previously shown to repopulate the liver in vivo48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cell line displays various mature hepatic features, including expression levels of Albumin, Serpina1, Ttr, Fah, which are comparable to those in the adult mouse liver (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the level of important enzymes in glucose homoeostasis, such as G6pc and Pepck, and members of the cytochrome P450 family, such as Cyp3a11, is lower than in adult mouse liver, while biliary epithelial markers Cytokeratin 7 and 19, are present in BAML, like in bi-potential hepatic progenitor cells (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We cultured the BAML hepatic cells in their standard hepatocyte culture medium and characterized them after transduction with either LV-TGIF2 or LV-GFP, as control, at multiple time points ex vivo, as well as in vivo (Fig 3c; Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tgif2-expressing cells proliferated at a lower rate than controls during the first week after transduction and reacquired the normal proliferative activity after 10 days (Supplementary Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At early time points (1 and 2 weeks), ectopic Tgif2 expression in BAML HEP cells elicited effects similar to those observed in primary HEPs, including strong reduction of the hepatic gene expression program and subsequent induction of a set of pancreatic genes (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the levels of pancreatic transcripts either remained stably induced or increased (for example, Pdx1 and MafA) over time (day (d) 30 and d50 time points after Tgif2 expression) (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repression of the hepatic gene expression program was also maintained in long-term cultures of LV-TGIF2-tranduced BAML HEP cells, even though it became less prominent after d50, suggesting possible occurrence of culture heterogeneity (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'IF analysis corroborated these findings, showing LV-TGIF2-transduced BAML HEP cells positive for GFP that were also positive for SOX9 and/or PDX1 but displayed reduction or loss of hepatic differentiation markers (albumin and glutamine synthetase (GS)) (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three weeks after transduction, a typical TGIF2-LV culture was composed of 50±4% SOX9-positive cells, 8.75±1.23% PDX1-positive cells and 48.10%±3.84% of the PDX1-positive cells also co-express SOX9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, PDX1-positive cells were not simultaneously positive for liver markers, such as albumin or GS, excluding hybrid cellular phenotypes in LV-TGIF2 HEP cultures (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, control BAML HEP cultures displayed typical abundant cytoplasmic albumin or GS in the absence of pancreatic markers (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'TFs in common between the two fates, such as Prox1 and Foxa2, were expressed at similar levels in both control and Tgif2-expressing HEP cells (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Induction of marker genes for stomach, duodenal and intestinal fates (for example, Sox2, Nkx6.3 and Cdx2) was not detected in Tgif2-expressing HEP cells (Fig 3b,c; Supplementary Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, induction of pancreatic fate was not accompanied by the activation of a facultative liver stem/progenitor population (for example, Lgr5-positive)49, pluripotency markers or other lineage-specific transcripts, suggesting a fate-restricted switch (Fig 3b; Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, we also observed induction of endodermal genes, such as Gata6 and Cxcr4, as well as of Pdx1 and Ptf1a expression when LV-TGIF2 was transduced in adult mouse fibroblasts, suggesting a potential broader reprogramming activity of TGIF2 also in non-endodermal lineage cells (Supplementary Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Altogether these data show that Tgif2 is uniquely able to rapidly down-regulate the typical hepatic gene regulatory network and promote a pancreatic progenitor gene-expression signature even in conditions that favour hepatic cell maintenance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then tested if LV-TGIF2-transduced primary HEPs grow and expand in three-dimension (3D) culture conditions that have been recently established for pancreas progenitor cells50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that TGIF2-LV primary HEPs formed organoids, which were composed of SOX9- and PDX1-positive cells (Fig 4a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, control non-transduced primary HEPs did not cluster to form 3D aggregates under the same pancreatic conditions and failed to grow (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, to start testing the differentiation potentials of the organoids established from TGIF2-LV primary HEPs, we transplanted them into fresh E12.5 mouse pancreatic explants (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, when exposed to their native pancreatic microenvironment, the grafted progenitor cells (GFP-positive) either expressed pancreatic progenitor markers (PDX1, NKX6.1) or retained the potential to differentiate and expressed acinar (AMYLASE) or endocrine (INSULIN, GLUCAGON) markers (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Endocrine differentiation of GFP-positive grafted progenitor cells was more frequent into glucagon+ cells, resulting in average of 30% GLUC+/GFP+ versus 10% INS+/GFP+, while exocrine cells were less frequent (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these results indicate that in the presence of TGIF2 mature hepatocytes acquire a typical pancreatic progenitor gene expression signature and can further differentiate as true progenitor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reprogrammed primary and BAML HEP cells are hereafter referred to as TGIF2-induced Pancreatic Progenitor (TiPP) cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Primary hepatocytes transduced with LV-TGIF2 formed pancreatic organoid structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Micrographs of primary HEPs grown in three-dimension (3D) culture conditions for E10.5 mouse pancreas progenitor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control (CTRL) primary hepatocytes failed to grow in the same conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All organoid structures shown in the figure were generated from LV-TGIF2-transduced primary hepatocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bar, 100 m.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our data show that TGIF2 functions as a versatile reprogramming factor, exerting a twofold activity: it unlocks and represses hepatic identity and establishes pancreatic cell identity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hepatic cells undergoing fate switching pass through an intermediate state that lacks characteristics of both the initial and final cellular identities, a so-called dedifferentiation step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we found that this intermediate state is not widely plastic and Tgif2-expressing cells are instead lineage-restricted toward the pancreatic progenitor fate, without reverting to pluripotency or switching to other closely related lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, given the fact that adult hepatocytes are differentiated and arrested in quiescence (G0 phase), the change in cell identity triggered by Tgif2 occurs in the absence of cell division (Supplementary Fig 8), possibly implying a direct fate transitioning through discrete steps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous liver-to-pancreas reprogramming studies used adenovirus vectors to force the expression of pancreatic TFs (for example, Pdx1, Ngn3) in the liver in vivo or hepatic cell cultures17,18,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies mostly focused on the acquisition of insulin expression and some other markers of pancreatic identity, but they did not assess the degree of loss of hepatic fate and did not follow the fate transition (liver to pancreas) temporally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, in the strategy presented here, we showed that TGIF2 first represses hepatic gene expression, which is followed by induction of pancreatic progenitor genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such temporal succession of the events is a prerequisite to avoid aberrant hybrid cellular states in lineage reprogramming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, in previous studies the forced expression of pancreatic TFs seems to work only under certain conditions that might be favourable to cellular transdifferentiation17,18,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, adenovirus-mediated delivery of Pdx1 or Ngn3 was shown to induce insulin expression by the liver, whereas AAV-mediated overexpression of the same TFs did not result into insulin production or correction of diabetes in mice19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that adenoviruses may facilitate cellular reprogramming, possibly because of their ability to induce general inflammatory responses, which is instead absent upon AAV gene transfer19,56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore crucial to assess the exact contribution of the reprogramming factor(s) itself in the absence of an inflammatory microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, in our novel strategy we assessed the specific reprogramming activity of TGIF2 using independent in vivo and ex vivo approaches and different delivery methods, including AAV under liver homoeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'TGIF2 has been characterized as a context-independent transcriptional repressor, being able to exert its function either through modulation of the BMP/TGF-beta pathway or direct DNA binding28,29,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the transcriptome analysis of the TiPP cells shows a higher number of upregulated than downregulated genes (470 out of 592 differentially regulated genes; P less_than 0.01, FC less_than 4 or  greater than 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If TGIF2 acts solely as a repressor, one possible mechanism of action to achieve activation of so many genes would be through the repression of a repressor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, TGIF2 may function simultaneously as both an activator and repressor of genes during reprogramming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is indeed a common feature of other TALE homeoproteins to act both as transcriptional repressor or activator in a context-dependent manner, for example, depending on cellular environment and binding partners29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Systematic characterization of TGIF2-mediated transcriptional activity will establish if this is the case also for this homeoprotein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Reprogramming of hepatic cells to a pancreatic identity presents a valuable model to study hepatopancreatic plasticity and to identify by which mechanism each fate is established and maintained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, we identified a subset of molecular networks that are activated both in TGIF2-induced reprogramming as well as during liver and pancreas fate decision in the embryo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the enrichment of numerous non-canonical Wnt players in TiPP cells is consistent with the RNA-Seq profiling of mouse pancreatic and hepatic progenitor cells at the time of their lineage divergence25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to Wnt modulation, we found robust and stable upregulation of Fgfr1 and some of its well-known downstream signal transducers, including Akt3, Plcg2, Mapk12, in the reprogrammed TiPP cells when compared with control hepatocytes (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent observations identified a regulatory loop between SOX9 and FGF signalling in the early pancreatic niche that is required to repress liver-specific gene expression program and ensure pancreatic fate identity at early time point57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our findings suggest that TGIF2 may install a similar circuit between SOX9 and Fgfr in hepatocytes that undergo reprogramming, recapitulating the same in vivo mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, we also found induction of the transcription factor Tead2 in TiPP cells at early stage of reprogramming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in in line with the Teads being pancreatic progenitor-enriched factors in the mouse embryo25 and human pancreatic progenitors58, where they act as integral components of the pancreatic lineage-specific transcriptional program, regulating SOX9 and FGF receptors58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'From a broader perspective, the reported TGIF2-mediated stepwise fate conversion affords a unique opportunity to decipher genetic and epigenetic changes during the intermediate states of liver-to-pancreas reprogramming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might also shed light on more fundamental reprogramming mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, fate conversion via a tissue-restricted dedifferentiation step, which precedes re-differentiation into the new cell type, has been reported in natural transdifferentiation events in worms59, as well as during limb regeneration in the axolotl (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  60), suggesting possible common themes in reprogramming and regeneration across phyla.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The knowledge gained from these experimental manipulations will have broad implications not only for understanding the molecular basis of cellular identity and plasticity, but also for potential clinical application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultimately, the stepwise TGIF2-dependent fate conversion represents a novel strategy for controlled generation of pancreatic progenitors from liver and, possibly, a starting point for future production of pancreatic -cells suitable for therapeutic use in diabetic patients.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
