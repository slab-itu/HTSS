Haematopoietic ESL-1 enables stem cell proliferation in the bone marrow by limiting TGF availability  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The life-long maintenance of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) critically relies on environmental signals produced by cells that constitute the haematopoietic niche.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report a cell-intrinsic mechanism whereby haematopoietic cells limit proliferation within the bone marrow, and show that this pathway is repressed by E-selectin ligand 1 (ESL-1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice deficient in ESL-1 display aberrant HSPC quiescence, expansion of the immature pool and reduction in niche size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the traits were transplantable and dominant when mutant and wild-type precursors coexisted in the same environment, but were independent of E-selectin, the vascular receptor for ESL-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, quiescence is generated by unrestrained production of the cytokine TGF by mutant HSPC, and in vivo or in vitro blockade of the cytokine completely restores the homeostatic properties of the haematopoietic niche.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings reveal that haematopoietic cells, including the more primitive compartment, can actively shape their own environment.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Quiescence, an essential feature of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), is thought to prevent exhaustion of the most primitive compartment and to ensure protection from environmental stress and DNA-damaging agents1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imaging and computational analyses have revealed that mesenchymal perivascular cells around bone marrow (BM) arterioles promote cycle arrest on HSC2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These arteriolar niches are in turn innervated by nerves ensheathed by Schawnn cells, which also contribute to cycle arrest and preservation of HSC in vivo3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To preserve a homeostatic balance, however, the environment must also provide HSC with proliferative signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among niche cells, endothelial cells promote HSC proliferation through E-selectin4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether proliferative regulation can also originate from non-stromal cells, including haematopoietic cells that are an integral part of the BM niche, remains an outstanding question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'HSC, which by definition are located within the niche, can produce cytokines that impact their own proliferation and differentiation5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these cytokines, transforming growth factor  (TGF) has been implicated in the regulation of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) cycling by inhibiting lipid raft clustering and cytokine signalling6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The impact of this cytokine for the in vivo maintenance of HSC is highlighted by the loss of both quiescence and function of HSC lacking the TGF receptor II, or by analysis of animals in which TGF-producing Schwann cells were eliminated by sympathetic denervation3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Defining the mechanisms that regulate TGF production is therefore essential to understand how maintenance of HSPC in ensured in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, while searching for the ligand responsible for relaying the proliferative signals that emerge from vascular-borne E-selectin on HSPC, we found that the absence of E-selectin ligand 1 (ESL-1), a major ligand for E-selectin on haematopoietic cells7, results in global quiescence in the primitive haematopoietic compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, we show that ESL-1 maintains homeostatic proliferation within the BM not by engaging E-selectin, but by repressing the production of TGF by haematopoietic cells, including HSPC.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

MPs) and LSK cells, as well as in primitive LSK CD135NEGCD90+ cells (LT-HSC) in these mutants (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrasting with the expansion of immature precursors, we did not find increased numbers of mature myeloid cells in the BM of ESL-1-deficient mice, with the exception of resident macrophages which were expanded (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blood leukocyte counts were slightly elevated but normal for erythrocyte and platelet numbers, and the mice presented a mild splenomegaly (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data indicated that ESL-1 controls HSPC cycling and numbers, suggesting that ESL-1 might be the E-selectin ligand responsible for transducing proliferative signals in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: ESL-1 controls the proliferation and numbers of HSPC in the bone marrow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Representative plots of BrdU proliferation assays gated on LineageNEG cKitHI Sca1+ (LSK) cells, LSK CD48NEG and LSK CD48NEG CD150+ cells in Glg1/ and Glg1WT/ littermates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Right, percentage of BrdU-incorporating cells;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Although the list of stromal constituents of the niche is being rapidly refined17, only a handful of studies have focused on haematopoietic cells as functional niche elements that regulate the fate of the HSC from which they originate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we show that haematopoietic progenitors have the capacity to regulate the proliferative status of neighbouring HSPC through production of TGF and that this function is limited by ESL-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings reveal that regulation of the niche can originate from haematopoietic cells, including HSPC, and suggest that the partnership of haematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells that are at the core of the BM niche18 allows mutual regulation of both partners, as has been evidenced in leukaemic models19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Besides HSPC, other haematopoietic cells including macrophages21,22 and megakaryocytes23,24 may be relevant sources of TGF and may thus regulate niche size and HSPC proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we have excluded macrophages as a major source, perivascular megakaryocytes, which produce abundant TGF24, could also have a strong impact on the global levels of the cytokine in the BM in the absence of ESL-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, we provide evidence that HSPC, which were shown in early in vitro studies to be an autocrine source of TGF25, can function as regulators of their own environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is particularly relevant because these cells are by definition the only population unambiguously located within a haematopoietic niche.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An important extension from our study will be to uncover the physiological or pathological scenarios in which the regulatory restraint imposed by ESL-1 becomes inactive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As under steady-state conditions blockade of the TGF pathway does not alter HSC proliferation (this study and11), we propose two possible scenarios in which loss of this regulation may be relevant: ageing and stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finding that Glg1/ mice display a myeloid bias and display delayed recovery from stress parallels changes described in the aged haematopoietic system26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, alterations in TGF signalling have been associated with HSC ageing and are likely to underlie the myeloid expansion in old animals27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional scenario, pathological stress, is also of interest in light of recent work showing that a transient wave of TGF in the stressed marrow prompts the return of HSC to quiescence after an initial proliferative phase11, suggesting that pathways that regulate TGF signalling may be important for restoring haematopoietic homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both scenarios are currently being tested in our laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The dominant effect that ESL-1 exerts on neighbouring HSPC has implications for understanding the interactions of stem cells within their niche.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It suggests that deregulation of the pathway in a single cell could initiate alterations in restricted populations of HSPC and stromal cells that share a common microniche.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether clustering represents the normal distribution of HSPC in vivo is unclear, but the recent identification of hemospheres as units of clonal expansion29 supports this possibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also noteworthy is the finding that subsets of stromal niche cells associated with myeloid or the most primitive precursors (endothelial and CAR cells17,30) appear repressed in the absence of ESL-1, whereas osteoblasts that are associated with the lymphoid lineage that expresses little ESL-1 remain largely unaffected, suggesting local regulation of the various haematopoietic environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An unexpected finding from our study was that, although ESL-1 has been shown to be a ligand for E-selectin on haematopoietic progenitors7, each molecule (ESL-1 and E-selectin) affects HSPC proliferation through independent mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The predominant expression of ESL-1 inside the cell rather than at the surface (which would be required for selectin binding) is consistent with this independent mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the identity of the relevant E-selectin ligand(s) on HSPC responsible for the proliferative effects remains unknown, although it is possible that glycosphingolipids, or a combination of various glycoproteins (as shown for the recruitment of neutrophils31), cooperate for selectin binding and for cycle arrest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This possibility is sustained by the growing appreciation that a complex array of differentially glycosylated proteins (and lipids) other than PSGL-1 and ESL-1 can function as ligands for E-selectins on haematopoietic cells7,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This important issue deserves further study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, although it has been speculated that E-selectin might control HSPC by dictating their distribution within the non-uniform BM microenvironment4, the mechanism by which this selectin and its ligand(s) ultimately regulate HSPC proliferation remains to be elucidated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, the identification of an intrinsic pathway controlled by ESL-1 that regulates HSPC proliferation, but can also impact the behaviour of neighbouring stromal cells and HSPC (scheme in Supplementary Fig 10), yields important insights into how stem cell dynamics are regulated to maintain homeostasis within the BM.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
