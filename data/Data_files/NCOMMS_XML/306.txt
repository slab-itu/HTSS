Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Lightweighting of automobiles by use of novel low-cost, high strength-to-weight ratio structural materials can reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and in turn CO2 emission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Working towards this goal we achieved high strength in a low cost -titanium alloy, Ti1Al8V5Fe (Ti185), by hierarchical nanostructure consisting of homogenous distribution of micron-scale and nanoscale -phase precipitates within the -phase matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequence of phase transformation leading to this hierarchical nanostructure is explored using electron microscopy and atom probe tomography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that the high number density of nanoscale -phase precipitates in the -phase matrix is due to  assisted nucleation of  resulting in high tensile strength, greater than any current commercial titanium alloy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus hierarchical nanostructured Ti185 serves as an excellent candidate for replacing costlier titanium alloys and other structural alloys for cost-effective lightweighting applications.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'With rapid global climate change and alarming levels of atmospheric CO2 concentration, there is growing interest in and attention to reducing anthropogenic CO2 emission1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emissions from fossil fuel combustion in transportation vehicles accounts for a significant portion of the global CO2 emissions3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has recently led to development of number of government policies and mandates for global automobile manufacturers to meet increasingly stringent CO2 emission standards and higher fuel efficiency targets for future years4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lightweighting of transportation vehicles is the key to reducing fossil fuel consumptions and anthropogenic CO2 emissions1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primary approach to lightweighting is through increased use of structural materials with high specific strength (strength to weight ratio).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In recent years, titanium alloys, more specifically -titanium alloys, have been widely explored as candidate materials owing to their attractive specific strength, toughness and corrosion resistance5,6,7, for example, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which is one of the most fuel efficient airplanes in its class, is utilizing about 15% titanium alloys, the largest percentage of titanium used in a passenger airplane till date8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, wide scale adoption of -titanium alloys in transportation applications has been limited due to its high cost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The cost of -titanium alloys can be lowered by replacing the expensive  stabilizers such as Mo, Cr and V (in full or in part) by low cost Fe (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9) such as the case in Ti1Al8V5Fe (Ti185) alloy introduced in 1960s (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ti185 alloy demonstrated high tensile and shear strength proving to be an excellent candidate for fastener applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the advantages, the production of Ti185 alloy in bulk by conventional ingot processing remained a challenge since addition of Fe in excess of 2.5 wt% in titanium alloys lead to segregation of Fe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The segregation of Fe results in the formation of inhomogeneous  structures also known as  flecks, which is detrimental to the mechanical performance of the alloy11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recently the authors have demonstrated a novel route to develop engineering components of -titanium alloys using a low-cost TiH2 powder feedstock12,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanical properties of the Ti185 alloy developed through this low-cost process are found to be at par with ones developed via the conventional route.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strength of the low-cost powder processed Ti185 alloy is further improved to achieve strength level higher than all current commercial titanium alloys by achieving a hierarchical nanostructure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequence of phase transformation leading to the formation of this hierarchical nanostructure and its role in controlling the strength of the alloy is the subject of this publication.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We now turn to explain the sequence of phase transformation leading to the formation of hierarchical nanostructure in the low-cost powder processed Ti185 specimens subjected to the three STA conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in solution treatment temperature increases the stability of the -phase, which explains the decrease in the volume fraction of intragranular primary  with increasing solution temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This in turn suggests that the large intragranular primary  in all three STA treated Ti185 specimens formed during the initial solution treatment stage, which is evident from the significant difference in intragranular primary  volume fraction observable in the SEM BSE images between 1,300ST and 1,450ST conditions given in Fig 5a,d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ti185 alloy considered here has the same alloying elements but different concentration as in -titanium alloy, Ti10V2Fe3Al (Ti1023).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of studies have been reported on varying the morphology and volume fraction of -phase and metastable -phase precipitates by thermomechanical treatment of Ti1023 alloy19,20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The -phase was observed in the solution treated and water quenched Ti1023 specimens23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The formation of cuboidal shaped metastable -phase was also reported in another low misfit TiV-based alloy upon water quenching past solution treatment24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The formation of -phase in -titanium alloys is in general associated with local rejection of  stabilizing elements resulting in local compositional instability25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the microstructure of all three STA treated Ti185 specimens upon water quenching past solution treatment contained: grain boundary , intragranular primary , and retained  with -phase precipitates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dark field TEM images of Ti185 specimens conditioned to 1,300ST and 1,450ST, Fig 5c,f, clearly show that such is the case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The primary  formed during the initial solution treatment stage would reject the -stabilizing elements into the remaining -phase hence increasing the solute concentration in the remaining -phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high volume fraction of primary  precipitates in 1,300ST compared with 1,450ST explains the observed increase in beta stabilizing element concentration in the -phase in 1,300ST (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temperature for the start of -phase transformation during water quenching from  or  microstructure was found to be lowered with increasing solute content in the -phase for TiV binary alloys28, rendering  to -phase transformation unstable for higher solute concentrations in -phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence the  to -phase transformation is comparatively more stable during water quenching past solution treatment at 1,450 °F compared with 1,300 °F due to the lower solute concentration in the -phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This results in high number density (or say volume fraction) of -phase precipitates in the retained -phase in the specimens water quenched past solution treatment at 1,450 °F compared with the specimens water quenched past solution treatment at 1,300 °F as qualitatively visible in the dark field TEM images in Fig 5c,f.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The solution treated water quenched specimens were then subjected to ageing heat treatment at 900 °F for 2 h to complete the STA treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The long-term annealing at low temperatures leads to -phase precipitation from existing -phase precipitates28,29,30,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Ti1023 alloy it was suggested in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32 that fine-scale, blocky -phase precipitation occurred from existing -phase precipitates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence the presence of high number density of -phase precipitates in the specimens solution treated at 1,450 °F resulted in high number density of fine-scale, blocky -phase precipitates past aging treatment at 900 °F.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the specimens solution treated at 1,300 °F had lower number density of the -phase precipitates in the retained -phase, hence, comparatively low number density of secondary -phase precipitates nucleated during the aging treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, the final microstructures formed in Ti185 specimens following the three STA conditions have: (i) grain boundary , with roughly similar morphology irrespective of the solution treatment temperature; (ii) primary intragranular , whose number density decreases with increasing solution treatment temperature; (iii) secondary intragranular , whose number density increases with increasing solution treatment temperature; and (iv)  and -phases with chemical compositions being independent of the solution treatment temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detailed characterization of both STA and ST conditions permitted to clearly understand the microstructure evolution pathway leading to the final hierarchical nanostructures formed following the three STA conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detailed understanding of the final microstructure for the three STA conditions underlies the understanding of increase in strength with increasing solution treatment temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The roughly similar steady-state partitioning of alloying elements between - and -phase precipitates as well as presence of similar grain boundary -phase precipitates irrespective of the STA condition, suggests that the observed hierarchical nanostructure (two size scales of -phase precipitates) within the grain is the sole factor contributing to strengthening with increasing solution treatment temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of bimodal distribution of -phase precipitate on the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) of the material can be empirically written as33,34,35,36:', '', 'where,  is the overall CRSS of the material, p is the contribution of primary -phase precipitates,s is the contribution of secondary -phase precipitates and k is an adjustable parameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The value of k lies in the range 1k2 with k=1 corresponding to linear superposition and k=2 corresponding to the Pythagorean superposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The STA conditioned Ti185 contains distribution of large primary  (more likely to be impenetrable that is, strong) in the midst of fine secondary  (more likely to be shearable that is, weak) and for such a microstructure linear superposition is more likely to be dominant17,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we know that the critical stress required for a dislocation to overcome obstacles is inversely proportional to the average spacing of the obstacles and the CRSS can be related to the yield strength of the material by the Taylor factor17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, equation (1) under the assumption of linear superposition can be rewritten as:', '', 'where, y is the yield strength of the material, lp is the inter-particle spacing of the primary -phase precipitates, ls is the inter-particle spacing of the secondary -phase precipitates and Kp and Ks are constants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note, all the constants including the Taylor factor are merged in Kp and Ks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values of lp for the three STA conditions 1,300-900-2, 1,375-900-2 and 1,450-900-2 in m are roughly 0.6, 0.89 and 1.4, respectively while the values of ls for the three STA conditions in m are roughly 0.08, 0.054 and 0.045, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values of the constants KP and Kswere found to be 442.6 MPa-m and 60.2 MPa-m, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prediction of the empirical model in equation (2) is compared with the yield strength of the three STA conditioned Ti185 alloy in Fig 1a and good agreement is noted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Hence following equation (2) it can be now concluded that the decrease in the number density of primary  (increase in inter-particle spacing) with increase in solution treatment temperature decreases the strength of the alloy, which is not only compensated but is surpassed by the increase in the number density (decrease in inter-particle spacing) of fine-scale secondary  precipitates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of these two competing changes in the microstructure also explains the relatively small increment in strength by increasing the solution treatment temperature from 1,375 to 1,400 °F compared with the large increment in strength by increasing the solution treatment temperature from 1,300 to 1,375 °F.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, since intergranular fracture is the dominant failure mechanism in these alloys, the roughly similar strain to failure irrespective of the STA conditions can be dedicated to the uniformity of grain boundary -phase precipitates37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, the increase in uniformly distributed, fine-scale secondary  precipitates led to the observed increase in strength with increase in solution treatment temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also due to the uniformity of grain boundary  precipitates the % elongation of the alloy remained at 46% irrespective of the solution treatment temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The authors believe that the excellent mechanical properties, when additionally complemented by the low cost of this alloy manufactured by TiH2 based powder processing can indeed provide an attractive alternative for replacing more expensive titanium alloys as well as other heavier engineering alloys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We anticipate that this approach can also be used to fabricate other -titanium alloys with hierarchical nanostructure and superior strength.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
