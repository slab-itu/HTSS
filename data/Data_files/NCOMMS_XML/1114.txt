Selective BET bromodomain inhibition as an antifungal therapeutic strategy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Invasive fungal infections cause significant morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised individuals, posing an urgent need for new antifungal therapeutic strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we investigate a chromatin-interacting module, the bromodomain (BD) from the BET family of proteins, as a potential antifungal target in Candida albicans, a major human fungal pathogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the BET protein Bdf1 is essential in C. albicans and that mutations inactivating its two BDs result in a loss of viability in vitro and decreased virulence in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report small-molecule compounds that inhibit C. albicans Bdf1 with high selectivity over human BDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystal structures of the Bdf1 BDs reveal binding modes for these inhibitors that are sterically incompatible with the human BET-binding pockets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we report a dibenzothiazepinone compound that phenocopies the effects of a Bdf1 BD-inactivating mutation on C. albicans viability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings establish BET inhibition as a promising antifungal therapeutic strategy and identify Bdf1 as an antifungal drug target that can be selectively inhibited without antagonizing human BET function.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Invasive fungal infections are a major global health concern, with 2 million cases and 800,000 deaths estimated annually worldwide1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Candida species such as C. albicans and C. glabrata are among the most significant human fungal pathogens, with invasive candidiasis yielding 3040% mortality2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An increase in drug-resistant fungal strains and the limited repertoire of available drugs has led to an urgent need for novel therapeutic agents1,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Promising results have emerged from the study of chromatin-interacting proteins as antifungal targets, including histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histone deacetylase inhibitors have weak antifungal activity when used alone but synergize with antifungal drugs such as azoles and echinocandins8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of either the histone deacetylase (HST3) or histone acetyltransferase (RTT109) regulating histone H3 Lys56 acetylation (H3K56ac) in C. albicans increases susceptibility to genotoxic and antifungal agents10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a study of the Mediator complex subunit Med15, which interacts via its KIX domain with a transcription factor (Pdr1) implicated in pleiotropic drug resistance in C. glabrata, drug-resistant strains were re-sensitized to antifungals by a small-molecule inhibitor targeting the KIX domainPdr1 interface11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings point to an important role of chromatin-interacting proteins in fungal drug susceptibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we investigated an epigenetic reader module, the bromodomain (BD) from the bromo- and extra-terminal domain (BET) family, as a potential antifungal target in C. albicans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BET proteins are chromatin-associated factors that regulate transcription and chromatin remodelling12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human BET family members are Brd2, Brd3, Brd4 and Brdt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BET proteins bind chromatin through their two BDs (BD1 and BD2), which specifically recognize histones acetylated on lysine residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas canonical BDs bind mono-acetylated histone peptides, BET BDs possess a wider ligand-binding pocket allowing them to recognize diacetylated peptides13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small-molecule inhibitors, such as JQ1 and IBET, which selectively target BET BDs have been used to validate BET inhibition as a therapeutic strategy against cancer, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory disorders and other medical conditions, with several inhibitors currently in clinical trials12,15,16,17,18,19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The fungal BET protein Bdf1 has been characterized as a global transcriptional regulator in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where it regulates over 500 genes22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S. cerevisiae Bdf1 (ScBdf1) associates with acetylated histones H3 and H4 (refs 22, 23, 24) and with the general transcription factor TFIID25, and is a subunit of the SWR1 chromatin remodelling complex24,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ScBdf1 is also important for chromatin compaction during sporulation28 and for the salt stress response29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to BDF1, S. cerevisiae possesses a second BET gene, BDF2, which is partly functionally redundant with BDF1 (refs 24, 25, 30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disruption of BDF1 causes severe morphological and growth defects, while deletion of both BDF1 and BDF2 is lethal22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Point mutations that abolish ligand binding by ScBdf1 BD1 and BD2 cause growth and sporulation defects24 and affect the majority of transcripts altered by disruption of the entire gene22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many pathogenic fungal species (including C. albicans, C. glabrata, Aspergillus fumigatus, Cryptococcus neoformans and Pneumocystis jirovecii) lack BDF2, suggesting that inhibition of the sole BET family protein Bdf1 might significantly reduce viability and virulence32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we demonstrate that Bdf1 BD functionality is essential in C. albicans and identify small-molecule inhibitors that target Bdf1 BDs without inhibiting human BET proteins, establishing Bdf1 inhibition as a potential antifungal therapeutic strategy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  albicans Bdf1 BDs bind multi-acetylated histone tails', 'A phylogenetic tree of human and fungal BET proteins is shown in Fig 1a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BDs from C. albicans Bdf1 (CaBdf1) share 3146% sequence identity with human BET BDs and 5866% identity with those from ScBdf1 and hence are likely to bind multi-acetylated H3 and H4 tails (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify this hypothesis, we purified recombinant CaBdf1 BD1 and BD2 and assessed binding to a microarray of human histone tail peptides bearing diverse post-translational modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While H2A and H2B tail sequences differ considerably between human and C. albicans, those of H3 and H4 are nearly perfectly conserved, justifying use of the array (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, CaBdf1 BDs showed weak binding to mono-acetylated peptides and stronger binding to peptides bearing two or more acetylation marks (Fig 1d,e and Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the two BDs, BD1 exhibited more promiscuous binding, recognizing 14 distinct H3 and H4 acetylation patterns, versus only 7 for BD2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We replaced a conserved tyrosine residue in the binding pocket of each BD by phenylalanine, a mutation known to compromise ligand binding in ScBdf1 (refs 22, 23) (Supplementary Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two YF mutations (Y248F and Y425F) abolished binding to all acetylated peptides, confirming interaction specificity (Fig 1d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both BD1 and BD2, the strongest binding was observed with an H4 peptide tetra-acetylated on lysines 5, 8, 12 and 16 (hereafter denoted H4ac4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A pull-down assay confirmed H4ac4 peptide recognition by both BDs, which was abolished by the YF mutation (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, CaBdf1 BD1 and BD2 bound tetra-acetylated H4 peptides with comparable strength (Fig 1e), in contrast with mammalian Brd2, Brd4 and Brdt, which bind tetra-acetylated H4 more tightly through BD1 than through BD2 (refs 13, 14), highlighting a certain redundancy in the ligand-binding activity of the two CaBdf1 BDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: CaBdf1 BDs bind multi-acetylated histone tails.

function is important for the viability of C. albicans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a heterozygous BDF1 deletion mutant generated in strain SN152 (derived from SC5314) exhibited no significant phenotype, we were unable to obtain a homozygous bdf1/ mutant, suggesting that BDF1 is essential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm essentiality we placed the remaining allele of the BDF1 gene in the heterozygous strain under the control of a conditional promoter and evaluated survival under repressive conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used either a methionine-repressible promoter or a newly engineered tetracycline (Tet)-regulatable cassette compatible with animal studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tet-dependent gene expression in C. albicans is usually achieved by integrating a chimeric transactivator protein and a Tet-responsive promoter independently into the genome33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we constructed a cassette allowing integration of all required components in a single step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cassette contains the transactivator (TetR-VP16), a selective marker (ARG4) and seven tandem Tet-operator elements, which we inserted upstream of the BDF1 open reading frame (ORF) to generate strain bdf1/pTetO-BDF1 (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoblotting with a polyclonal antibody developed in this study to allow specific CaBdf1 detection (Supplementary Fig 1c,d) confirmed that Bdf1 was expressed from the pTetO promoter in the absence of doxycycline (Dox), albeit at a weaker level than from the endogenous BDF1 promoter, and was effectively repressed in the presence of Dox (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, the growth of strain bdf1/pTetO-BDF1 mirrored these expression levels: compared to wild type (WT), growth was reduced in the absence of Dox and abrogated in its presence (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phenotype was rescued by re-introducing a functional copy of BDF1 (strain BDF1-R/pTetO-BDF1), confirming that BDF1 is essential in C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Bdf1 BDs were inactivated by domain deletion or by the YF point mutation while the other WT allele is expressed from the Dox-repressible promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strains in which both BDs were inactivated grew as poorly as the conditional deletion mutant, whereas strains in which only BD1 or BD2 was inactivated displayed milder growth defects, with BD2 inactivation yielding the more pronounced defect (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional assays evaluating stress resistance or cell wall integrity did not reveal any significant phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Growth rates in liquid media recapitulated the phenotypes observed in the colony formation assay (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analogous results were obtained when BDF1 expression was repressed using the methionine-regulatable promoter (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, C. albicans viability in vitro requires the presence of at least one functional BD within Bdf1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Bdf1 BDs are required for virulence in a mouse model', 'Using our Tet-OFF system for Dox-repressible Bdf1 expression, we verified the role of Bdf1 in a murine model of invasive candidiasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially, mice were injected with either WT C. albicans, the conditional BDF1 deletion strain (bdf1/pTetO-BDF1) or the rescue strain (BDF1-R/pTetO-BDF1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice injected with the WT or rescue strains exhibited a high fungal load (110,000 CFU g1) in the kidney 7 days post infection (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fungal load observed with strain bdf1/pTetO-BDF1 was reduced by 30-fold (3,500 CFU g1) in the absence of Dox and was abolished in its presence, mirroring the growth phenotypes observed in vitro (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, we evaluated the virulence of strains in which both Bdf1 BDs were deleted or inactivated by the YF point mutations (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These strains exhibited markedly reduced fungal loads (by 8,800- and 1,600-fold, respectively), consistent with the in vitro growth rates associated with these mutations (Fig 2d,e and Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, Bdf1 BD functionality appears critical for the virulence of C. albicans in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'CaBdf1 BDs are resistant to human BET inhibitors', 'For Bdf1 inhibition to be a feasible antifungal therapeutic strategy, small-molecule inhibitors need to discriminate fungal from human BET BDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To probe the similarity between the ligand-binding pockets of C. albicans and human BET BDs, we asked whether human BET inhibitors (BETi) could inhibit CaBdf1 BDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assay to evaluate the ability of four chemically diverse BETi compounds (JQ1, PFI-1, IBET-151 and bromosporine) to inhibit BD binding to an H4ac4 peptide (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The four compounds inhibited human Brd4 BD1 and BD2 with median inhibitory concentrations (IC50 values) in the low nM range (395 nM), consistent with previous reports16,35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the CaBdf1 BDs were relatively insensitive to these inhibitors, with IC50 values between 0.3 and 10 M, or approximately a two- to threefold log-reduction in sensitivity (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results were confirmed for JQ1 by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC): whereas JQ1 bound Brd4 BD1 tightly (Kd of 62 nM), no binding was detected for CaBdf1 BD1 or BD2 (Fig 3c and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the BETi compounds significantly inhibited growth of C. albicans in vitro at 10 M concentration (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is consistent with the poor IC50 values observed for JQ1 and PFI-1 towards CaBdf1 BDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also indicates that IBET-151 and bromosporine, which display (sub)micromolar IC50 values, have poor cellular potency, possibly due to mechanisms known to reduce drug potency in C. albicans, including cell wall and plasma membrane permeability barriers37,38 and the activity of efflux pumps leading to rapid drug extrusion39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, CaBdf1 and human BET BDs have distinct BETi-binding activity, supporting the feasibility of targeting CaBdf1 BDs with highly selective small-molecule inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: CaBdf1 BDs are resistant to BETi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) HTRF assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A biotinylated

between JQ1 and the fungal BDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, whereas JQ1 fits snugly into the Brd4-binding pocket, the fit with the CaBdf1-binding pockets is poor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Brd4 the fused ring system of JQ1 is sandwiched between the WPF shelf (Trp81, Pro82 and Phe83) and Leu residues 92 and 94, with the thiophene ring positioned within the ZA channel defined by Trp81 and Leu92 (ref.

structure of CaBdf1 BD1 bound to 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compound 1 mimics the acetyllysine ligand by interacting with the conserved Tyr248 and Asn291 residues, forming direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds via the thiazepinone carbonyl group (Fig 6eg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dibenzothiazepinone ring system engages hydrophobic residues from the Val-Pro-Phe (VPF) shelf (Pro233), helix B (Phe290) and the ZZ loop (Val238, Leu243 and Val245), while the cyclopropyl group interacts with the VPF shelf (Pro233 and Phe234), helix B (Cys287) and the gatekeeper residue on helix C (Ile297).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the oxadiazole and pyrazine groups point away from the pocket, adopting different orientations in the four complexes present in the crystals asymmetric unit (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Superimposing the ligand-bound structure with that of Brd4 BD1 results in a steric overlap between the larger Brd4 side chains at signature positions 1 and 3 (Trp81 and Leu94) and the oxadiazole and distal benzene groups of compound 1, explaining why 1 fails to inhibit the human BD (Fig 6f,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Steric hindrance from the corresponding residues in CaBdf1 BD2 (Phe409 and Ile422) also account for this domains insensitivity to compound 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Similarly, we identified an imidazopyridine compound 2 (Fig 7a), which inhibits CaBdf1 BD2 with high selectivity: HTRF and ITC assays yielded IC50 and Kd values of 1.1 and 2.1 M, respectively, whereas human Brd4 BD2 and CaBdf1 BD1 were only weakly inhibited (IC5040 M) (Fig 7b,c and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, no significant inhibition of any human BDs was observed for compound 2 by BROMOscan profiling and by an ITC assay on the two most sensitive BDs identified by this screen (SMARCA2 and SMARCA4; Supplementary Figs 4 and 5b); while only mild cytotoxicity was observed towards mammalian cells (EC50 60 M; Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystal structure of CaBdf1 BD2 bound to 2 reveals that the compound forms a hydrogen bond via its amino group with the conserved Asn468 residue, as well as a cationpi interaction involving the phenolic ring and the partial positive charge on Asn468 (Fig 7df).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, unlike most BET inhibitors, a water-mediated hydrogen bond with Tyr425 is not observed for 2 (presumably because the ligand dislodges water molecule 1, consistent with the dislodgement of this water by a glycerol molecule in the unbound BD structure; Supplementary Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the compounds imidazolyl and hydroxyl groups form water-mediated hydrogen bonds with backbone atoms of the Phe-Pro-Phe (FPF) shelf (Pro410) and helix B (Val460).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Replacement of the hydroxyl group in 2 by a hydrogen (2a) or fluorine (2b) atom severely reduces inhibitory activity, underscoring the importance of this group for high-affinity binding (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The methylpyridinyl and phenolic groups are sandwiched between the FPF shelf and gatekeeper residue Val474 on one side, and residues Val415 and Leu420 on the other, while the tolyl group additionally contacts residues Ile422 and Phe467 (Fig 7df).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A structural alignment with Brd4 BD2 shows that larger Brd4 side chains at four of these contact positions, including signature positions 1,3 and 5 (Trp374, Leu387 and His437) and residue Tyr432 (Fig 7e,g), reduces the volume available for compound 2, explaining the inability of 2 to inhibit the human BD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the poor affinity for CaBdf1 BD1 is due to smaller side chains at signature positions 1 and 3 (Val232 and Val245), resulting in poor complementarity between the binding pocket and ligand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The

compounds identified in our screen by evaluating their effect on C. albicans growth in liquid media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not surprisingly, none of the compounds significantly inhibited growth of the WT

#@NEW_LINE#@#  Attempts to simultaneously inhibit both BDs by testing binary combinations of compounds also did not result in significant growth inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore tested individual compounds on mutant strains in which either BD1 or BD2 was inactivated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most inhibitors, including compounds 1 and 2, showed little antifungal activity against these

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have shown that C. albicans BDF1 deletion is lethal and that mutations abolishing BD-mediated ligand-binding activity severely compromise growth (Fig 2ce), validating BET BD inhibition as a potential antifungal strategy in C. albicans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the combined inactivation of both CaBdf1 BDs is lethal, that of a single BD leads to only a partial reduction in growth (Fig 2d,e and Fig 8e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This likely reflects functional redundancy between the two BDs, consistent with their similar binding profiles towards acetylated H4 tails (Fig 1d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Growth inhibition appears slightly more pronounced on BD2 inactivation compared to that of BD1 (Fig 2d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This contrasts with the finding that the selective inhibition of human BET BD2 in liver cancer cells induced only minor effects on transcriptional regulation43 and that BD1 plays a more important role than BD2 in Brdt-mediated chromatin remodelling44, in recruiting Brd3 to acetylated sites on GATA1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  45), and in chromatin binding by Brd4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discrepancy may partly reflect differences between human and C. albicans BET BD selectivity towards acetylated histone peptides, as well as different histone acetylation patterns in these species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Because C. albicans strains inactivated in only one Bdf1 BD remain viable, a chemotherapeutic strategy targeting CaBdf1 would likely require the inhibition of both BDs to be effective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such inhibition could be achieved via a single compound, which targets both BDs or through the combined use of two compounds, supplied independently or covalently linked as a bivalent BD inhibitor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, dual-warhead BET inhibitors that simultaneously engage both BDs within a single BET protein have recently been described, which possess greatly enhanced biochemical and cellular potency as well as increased efficacy in animal disease models relative to monovalent inhibitors47,48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, one could envisage a Proteolysis Targeting Chimera approach, whereby a single BD inhibitor conjugated to a ligand for an E3 ubiquitin ligase would trigger the degradation of CaBdf1, as recently demonstrated for human BET proteins50,51,52,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Compounds 1 and 2 target CaBdf1 BD1 and BD2, respectively, with low-micromolar affinity, yet do not significantly inhibit human BET or non-BET BDs, demonstrating that small-molecule inhibition of CaBdf1 BDs can be achieved with high selectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The selectivity of 1 and 2 for CaBdf1 results from steric incompatibility with bulkier side chains in the human BET BD-binding pockets, particularly at signature positions 1 and 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, all 169 CaBdf1-selective hits identified in our screen target either CaBdf1 BD1 or BD2, but not both, in contrast with many BETi compounds, which inhibit both BD1 and BD2 in human BET proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A likely explanation is that, whereas residues at signature positions 1 and 3 are conserved between human BET BD1 and BD2, they diverge between CaBdf1 BD1 and BD2, facilitating the identification of CaBdf1 inhibitors with single BD selectivity (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, an inhibitor that targets both CaBdf1 BDs without inhibiting human BET BDs is in principle achievable, because the WPF-shelf Trp residue at signature position 3 in human BET BDs is bulkier than the corresponding (Val and Phe) residues in both CaBdf1 BD1 and BD2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, medicinal chemistry optimization of compound 2 could conceivably yield an analogue that would inhibit both CaBdf1 BD1 and BD2 without losing selectivity against human BET BDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our chemical screen identified a dibenzothiazepinone compound, 3, that selectively inhibited CaBdf1 BD1 and displayed antifungal activity against susceptible strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we were unable to obtain biochemical evidence for a direct interaction between 3 and Bdf1 in C. albicans cells, the different susceptibility of Bdf1 mutant strains provides compelling evidence that Bdf1 BD1 is the intracellular target (Fig 8e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, strains expressing Bdf1 mutants in which BD1 was the lone functional BD (mutants bdf1-bd2 and bdf1-Y425F) were sensitive to 3, consistent with this compounds selectivity for CaBdf1 BD1, whereas all other strains with a functional BD2 were insensitive, arguing strongly against a potential off-target effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, compound 1 did not significantly inhibit growth, despite being an analogue of 3 with nearly identical binding affinity for CaBdf1 BD1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This makes the dibenzothiazepinone an attractive scaffold for structureactivity relationship studies, as these may reveal the molecular determinants of a compounds ability to reach its intracellular target and thereby lead to analogues with improved cellular potency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, Bdf1 BDs are required for the viability and virulence of C. albicans and can be selectively targeted by small-molecule inhibitors without compromising human BET BD function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings pave the way for the development of BET inhibitors as a novel class of antifungal therapeutics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
