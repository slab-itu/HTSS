Efficient hydrogen evolution in transition metal dichalcogenides via a simple one-step hydrazine reaction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Hydrogen evolution reaction is catalysed efficiently with precious metals, such as platinum; however, transition metal dichalcogenides have recently emerged as a promising class of materials for electrocatalysis, but these materials still have low activity and durability when compared with precious metals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report a simple one-step scalable approach, where MoOx/MoS2 core-shell nanowires and molybdenum disulfide sheets are exposed to dilute aqueous hydrazine at room temperature, which results in marked improvement in electrocatalytic performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nanowires exhibit 100 mV improvement in overpotential following exposure to dilute hydrazine, while also showing a 10-fold increase in current density and a significant change in Tafel slope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In situ electrical, gate-dependent measurements and spectroscopic investigations reveal that hydrazine acts as an electron dopant in molybdenum disulfide, increasing its conductivity, while also reducing the MoOx core in the core-shell nanowires, which leads to improved electrocatalytic performance.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Hydrogen has the potential to be a zero-emission, renewable fuel; however, today it is primarily obtained from thermal steam reforming of natural gas1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be produced via water splitting, but the high cost of precious metal catalysts and rare earth materials that are currently used present a challenge to large scale implementation5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as WS2, MoS2 and so on, have been explored as a viable alternative to precious metal catalysts9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bulk MoS2 powders have limited catalytic activity due to an inert crystal basal plane and low in-plane conductivity11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High electrocatalytic activity can be achieved by either increasing the exposure of the active edge planes12,13,14,15,16,17, increasing the conductivity of MoS2 (refs 18, 19, 20), phase transformation21,22,23,24,25,26, use of a co-catalyst27 or a combination of these approaches28,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these techniques, phase transformation from semiconducting (bulk hexagonal 2H-MoS2) to a metastable trigonal crystal structure (1T-MoS2), which has metallic properties and does not suffer from anisotropy, has recently shown the most promise for electrochemical and opto-electronic applications28,31,32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phase-transformed TMDs, obtained via lithium intercalation, result in very efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic characteristics; however, the processing conditions are expensive, time consuming (days), involve use of inert glove box atmosphere and often require elevated temperatures (100 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lithium processing has also been shown to result in the formation of Li2S nanoparticle contaminants9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-aspect ratio structures, such as one-dimensional core-shell nanowires29, also have the potential to achieve high HER activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these structures possess properties such as high surface area and a conductive reduced oxide core, the primary drawback is that synthesis methods lead to the relatively inert basal plane of the MoS2 shell growing parallel to the length of the nanowire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reduces the exposure of available active edge sites, resulting in lower catalytic activity for HER than theoretically achievable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Hydrazine has been well researched as a reducing agent in two-dimensional (2D) reduced graphene oxide34 and demonstrated as an n-type dopant in graphene35,36, single-walled carbon nanotubes, both semiconducting and metallic37,38, as well as observed in inorganic nanocrystalline systems39,40, but its effects on layered TMDs and electrocatalytic properties have not been previously investigated to date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemical modification of the MoS2 inert basal plane to increase its charge carrier concentration, that is, electron doping, could lead to marked improvement in electrocatalytic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report a simple process, in which exposure of the MoOx/MoS2 core-shell nanowire arrays, as well as pure MoS2 particles and 2D sheets, to dilute hydrazine (N2H4) results in a marked improvement in catalytic activity towards HER, that is, both a significant improvement in overpotential (100 mV versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), which is among the lowest reported HER overpotentials for any MoS2 architecture, and a 10-fold increase in current density (2 to 22 mA cm2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed characterization and conductivity measurements of MoOx/MoS2 core-shell nanowires, as well as pure MoS2 particles and sheets, show that hydrazine is acting as an electron dopant, donating electrons to increase the conductivity of MoS2, which leads to improved electrocatalytic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of the core-shell nanowires, hydrazine further reduces the oxide core, which enhances conductivity and facilitates the charge transfer kinetics in the system, synergistically improving the HER performance of core-shell nanowires after exposure to hydrazine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This activation of the normally inert TMD basal plane by electron doping from hydrazine presents a unique opportunity to serves as a novel direction for efficient catalytic development and the use of simple processing techniques that can rival state-of-art platinum catalysts.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

following the hydrazine treatment, an improvement in both the current density and HER overpotential is observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tafel analysis (Fig 2d) shows a decrease in the Tafel slope of the pure 2H-MoS2 particles, indicative of increased favourability for proton absorption onto the catalysis surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of the MoS2 particles before and after hydrazine treatment (Fig 2e) show a significant decrease in the charge transfer resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Rs-(CPE-Rct) circuit diagram is used to fit the experimental electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solution resistance (Rs) remains nearly constant (12 ), whereas the charge transfer resistance (Rct) decreases from 2,340 to 625 , indicative of enhanced conductivity after the hydrazine treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To quantify the improvement in catalytic activity following the hydrazine treatment, turnover frequency (TOF) is calculated for the MoOx/MoS2 core-shell nanowires and MoS2 particles using the following equation:', '', 'Exchange current densities (i0) are calculated from the Tafel equation, while the number of active sites is calculated from cyclic voltammograms of MoS2 particles and MoOx/MoS2 core-shell nanowires, both as-grown and treated with hydrazine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following HER measurements, the potential applied to the working electrode was driven to high oxidation potentials (1.4 V versus RHE) to convert MoS2 particles to MoO3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calculation of active sites was obtained from the reduction charge transfer (MoO3  Mo0) occurring at  0.3 to 0.0 V (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29), assuming that each Mo3+ reduced to Mo0 corresponded to one MoS2 site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of these electrochemical decompositions to calculate surface area are shown in Supplementary Figs 3 and 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of active sites for MoS2 bulk particles are similar before and after hydrazine treatment, 9.0 × 1014 and 9.8 × 1014 MoS2 sites per cm2, while Tafel analysis indicates an increase in exchange current density from 8.4 × 106 to 1.7 × 105 A cm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using these values, the calculated TOF values increase for the MoS2 particles following the hydrazine treatment, from 0.030.05 s1, while the number of active sites remain relatively unchanged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Summary of these obtained values, shown in Table 1, are consistent with reports by other researchers31,45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Electrochemical parameters with hydrazine treatment of MoS2.Full size table', 'A similar analysis process is performed to calculate TOF values for the MoOx/MoS2 core-shell nanowires.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 0.3 to 0.0 V region used in the particle calculations is more convoluted in the nanowires case with the combination of core and shell oxidationreduction peaks (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the oxidation of MoS2 to MoO3 involving 11 e was used as the region for determining the number of MoS2 sites (as explained by Chen et al.)29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the series of oxidationreduction decomposition peaks observed in the as-grown nanowires, resulting from the MoOx core, are not observed following hydrazine treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the hydrazine, in addition to doping of MoS2 shell, also reduces the oxide core, which increases its conductivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculated number of MoS2 sites per surface area for the as-grown MoOx/MoS2 core-shell nanowires is 5.9 × 1014 sites per cm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is almost no change in the concentration of active sites in the nanowires following exposure to hydrazine, 6.0 × 1014 sites per cm2;

the MoS2 powder particles are composed of several tens of molecular MoS2 layers with random orientations, as seen in Fig 2f.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in contrast to the core-shell nanowires, which have a few molecular layer thick MoS2 shell on an oxide core, as shown in Fig 2g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Hydrazine is a reducing agent, as well as an electron dopant; we hypothesize that it interacts with the oxide core, further reducing it and increasing the intra-particle conductivity of the nanowire, while hydrazine also electron dopes the MoS2 surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the hypothesis of reduction of oxide core, pure MoO3 nanowires are treated with dilute 1 % hydrazine, reported in the Supplementary Fig 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pure MoO3 is catalytically inactive and decomposes quickly in acid solutions47 As expected, the MoO3 nanowires show no catalytic activity and decompose in the 0.5 M H2SO4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When exposed to hydrazine before testing, the MoO3 reduction and oxidation peaks are no longer observed, suggesting that the oxide has been reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This experiment supports a synergistic mechanism; hydrazine improves electron conductivity of the nanowire core, that is, intra-particle conductivity, while also electron doping the MoS2 surface (shown in pure MoS2 powder).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MoOx/MoS2 core-shell nanowire morphology, combined with the hydrazine treatment, uniquely provides architecture for an optimized electrocatalyst.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduction of the MoOx core by hydrazine is also confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of a MoOx/MoS2 core-shell nanowire array in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: XPS Spectroscopy following hydrazine treatment.Spectra for MoOx/MoS2 core-shell nanowire array before and after hydrazine treatment, showing the Mo 3d, S 2s, and S 2p core level binding energies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The red curves denote the Mo 3d and S 2p signals corresponding to 2H-MoS2, with the purple curves showing the shift resulting from the phase transformation to 1T-MoS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MoOx core seems to be a mixed phase valence, the Mo 3d oxidation states are shown by the dark and light blue curve, and sulfur signals are denoted by green.Full size image', 'Spectroscopic investigation of MoOx/MoS2 architectures', 'The core level binding energies of molybdenum and sulfur in as-grown MoOx/MoS2 core-shell nanowires are analysed using XPS, depicted in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The as-grown MoOx/MoS2 core-shell nanowires show strong doublet peaks at 229 eV, which are consistent with literature values for Mo4+ 3d5/2 and Mo4+ 3d3/2 of 2H-MoS2, shown by the red curves21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MoOx core results in a convolution of two oxidation states for Mo6+ in the reduced oxide core, shown by the dark and light blue signals at 232.6 and 230.6 eV; these binding energies suggest MoO3 and reduced MoO3x.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a result of incomplete reaction between the original MoO3 nanowires and the H2S during synthesis29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following exposure to hydrazine, the partially reduced oxide core continues to reduce, indicated by the shift in Mo 3d signal towards lower binding energies of the further reduced oxide core (MoOx), 230.6 and 229.6 eV, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is established that reduced molybdenum oxide has almost metallic conductivity48; hydrazine, as a reducing agent, is increasing the intra-particle conductivity of the nanowire core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the shift in Mo corresponding to the molybdenum oxide core, there is no shift in the MoS2 Mo 3d binding energies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When observing the S 2p signal for the MoS2 nanowire shell, the as-grown sample shows the clear doublet signal at 162 eV, typical for 2H-MoS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After exposure to hydrazine, there is no detectable shift in the peak positions of the Mo 3d binding energies for 2H-MoS2 and only a slight broadening of the S 2p binding energy, but no noticeable shift.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, the XPS spectra for chemically exfoliated 1T-MoS2 and 2H-MoS2 sheets are shown, modified from Cummins et al.30 It is well established that the phase transition from semiconducting 2H-MoS2 to metallic 1T-MoS2 has a corresponding large XPS binding energy shift of  0.9 eV (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21), which is clearly evident in the chemically exfoliated control sample, but is not observed during the hydrazine treatment; it appears that hydrazine does not induce phase transition of MoS2 from 2H to 1T phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This lack of phase transformation from 2H to 1T is also corroborated using Raman spectroscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Raman analysis of MoS2 is discussed in Supplementary Note 1, with the Raman spectra shown in Supplementary Fig 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown that the 1T-MoS2 crystal phase results in unique Raman excitations, which can distinguish the metastable phase from the stable 2H-MoS2 structure21,30;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'It is essential to understand the interactions between hydrazine and MoS2, as well as which mechanism leads to increased conductivity and enhancement in electrocatalysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydrazine has been shown to be an intercalating compound,51 can act as a pseudo-reducing agent in TMD systems52 and also is a strong reducing agent, which can repair oxidized sulfur sites and inhibit further oxidation of the TMD surface39,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, hydrazine has also been shown to be an effective electron dopant in graphene35,36, carbon nanotubes37,38, and experiments suggest it can improve the conductivity in PbSe quantum dots39,53,54,55,56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to these numerous possible pathways, it is somewhat challenging to pinpoint the exact mechanism; we investigate these possible mechanisms by identifying key experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, no change in the d-spacing of the MoS2 nanowire shell or MoS2 sheets is observed following exposure to hydrazine (Supplementary Fig 8); therefore, hydrazine acting as an intercalating agent is ruled out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, hydrazine has been proposed as pseudo-reducing agent52 in alkaline conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proposed mechanism of hydrazine forming OH to act as a pseudo-reduction agent is outlined in Supplementary Note 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, MoS2 particles are treated with 0.1 M KOH, but show no improvement in the electrocatalytic characteristics (Supplementary Fig 9), therefore, the pseudo-reduction of the MoS2 surface purely by OH groups does not adequately explain the mechanism of hydrazine interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, in the case of MoOx/MoS2 core-shell nanowires, hydrazine can interact with the oxide core, further reducing the MoOx to make it more conductive48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydrazine acting as a strong reducing agent is confirmed by CV measurements (Supplementary Fig 5) as well as XPS studies (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, electron doping of MoS2 by hydrazine should facilitate the adsorption of protons; slight broadening of the sulfur 2p binding energies in the XPS spectra (Fig 3) is consistent with this modification of the surface energies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of the hydrazine-treated MoOx/MoS2 core-shell nanowire system supports this mechanism, providing evidence of electron donation from hydrazine to the conduction band of the MoS2 (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To characterize the chemical form of hydrazine in the MoOx/MoS2 core-shell nanowire system, the nitrogen XPS signal (N 1s) is analysed, shown in Supplementary Fig 11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following exposure to hydrazine, a N 1s signal arises at 400.3 eV, which is not observed in the as-grown sample; the nitrogen signal is in the vicinity of Mo 3p binding energies (analogue to Mo 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This nitrogen binding energy corresponds to a surface absorbed amine phase, such as NH3 or a sub-amine (NH, NH2 and so on)57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While XPS makes it difficult to exactly identify the dissociated hydrazine (N2H4) species, it is clear that amine groups have absorbed on the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown that ammonia, NH3, can potentially act as an n-type dopant in metal oxides.58,59 However, it is more likely that a dissociated radical of hydrazine is acting as the electron donor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thermal decomposition studies show that N2H4 readily decomposes to form 2 NH2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  60), a reactive radical species that could contribute electrons to the MoS2 surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent theoretical work by Zhang et al.61 shows that at room temperatures, hydrazine hydrate readily dissociates at a catalyst surface to form radicals, which can donate electrons to the semiconductor surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The XPS signal of an absorbed amine group supports this theorized mechanism, where dissociated hydrazine radicals (NH2* and NH3) are present at the MoS2 surface and capable of donating electrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While there are amine groups on the surface, there is no evidence that there is a chemical bonding between the nitrogen and the MoS2 shell; the amine group acts as the electron donor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To conclude, in case of core-shell nanowires, hydrazine reduces the oxide core and also acts as an electron dopant for the MoS2 shell; in the case of pure MoS2 sheets, the change in conductivity is entirely due to electron doping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, for commercialization and technologically viable use of TMDs for hydrogen production, thermal stability and long-term durability are required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemically exfoliated 1T-MoS2 sheets are sensitive to temperature as the metastable phase transformation is reversed on annealing (loss of catalytic activity)21,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electrocatalytic activity of hydrazine-treated nanowires before and after annealing at 150 °C for 1 h under argon are shown in Fig 6a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is no significant change in HER onset potential or current density, which demonstrates that the effect of the hydrazine treatment is not merely due to physisorption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrochemical durability at room temperature of the hydrazine-treated nanowires is also investigated, shown in Fig 6b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial current density at 0.35 V versus RHE is 24 mA cm2 following the hydrazine treatment, which is set as 100%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 10 scans, the current density at 0.35 V actually increases, which has been seen in other reports29, but slowly decreases to 60% of its initial activity, stabilizing after around 400 cycles to an average of 13 mA cm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This degradation may be due, in part, to decomposition of the oxide core, since the MoS2 shell is thinner than in other reports29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Stability studies of hydrazine-treated MoOx/MoS2 core-shell nanowire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Linear voltammetry for MoOx/MoS2 core-shell nanowires treated with Hydrazine (red curve), then annealed at 150 °C for 1 h (red dashed line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Stability of hydrazine-treated MoOx/MoS2 core-shell nanowires over 2,000 cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current densities are normalized to 24 mA cm2 as 100%.Full size image', 'In conclusion, exposure of MoOx/MoS2 core-shell nanowires to an aqueous hydrazine solution leads to a marked improvement in electrocatalytic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe a 100 mV improvement in the HER onset potential (from approximately 200 mV to approximately 100 mV versus RHE) and also an exponential increase in generated current density (from 2 to 22 mA cm2at 0.35 V versus RHE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the TOF for the core-shell nanowires increases five-fold following the hydrazine treatment, from 0.04 to 0.2 s1, due to the synergistic reduction of the oxide core and the electron doping of the MoS2 shell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of MoS2 bulk powder, the TOF increases by nearly twofold, from 0.03 to 0.05 s1, since electron doping is the only contributing factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surface characterization studies reveal that the change in catalytic properties does not result from a phase transformation, but is due to enhanced conductivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increased conductivity, as result of hydrazine treatment, is shown in MoOx/MoS2 core-shell nanowires, 2H-MoS2 particles, and single layer sheets, by utilizing field effect gating experiments, conductivity, and spectroscopic techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydrazine is shown to act as an electron dopant; dissociated amine radicals donate electrons to the MoS2 surface, facilitating electrocatalysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reported hydrazine modifications can be performed in ambient conditions and on the order of minutes, when compared to conventional techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is one of the first known investigations into the effect of hydrazine exposure in 2D layered chalcogenides for electrocatalysis application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding the effects of hydrazine on TMDs in catalysis can lead to a fundamental breakthrough in the areas of electrochemistry and material science.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
