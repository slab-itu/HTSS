Macrophage-dependent IL-1 production induces cardiac arrhythmias in diabetic mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Diabetes mellitus (DM) encompasses a multitude of secondary disorders, including heart disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the most frequent and potentially life threatening disorders of DM-induced heart disease is ventricular tachycardia (VT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in cardiac macrophages mediate the production of IL-1 in DM mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-1 causes prolongation of the action potential duration, induces a decrease in potassium current and an increase in calcium sparks in cardiomyocytes, which are changes that underlie arrhythmia propensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-1-induced spontaneous contractile events are associated with CaMKII oxidation and phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further show that DM-induced arrhythmias can be successfully treated by inhibiting the IL-1 axis with either IL-1 receptor antagonist or by inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results establish IL-1 as an inflammatory connection between metabolic dysfunction and arrhythmias in DM.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Sterile inflammation usually resolves an initial insult1, but sometimes persists, as in the case of metabolic dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several metabolism-associated diseases and represents a putative link between diabetes mellitus (DM)1,2,3,4 and secondary heart disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In diabetic patients, cardiomyopathy and its main complication, ventricular arrhythmias, are the leading cause of death5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, diabetic patients show higher frequency of fatal ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, these patients present both QT and corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation due to increased ventricular action potential duration (APD), which predisposes to arrhythmogenesis7,8,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main mechanisms underlying these diabetic arrhythmias are still unknown, but we hypothesized that sterile inflammation triggered by hyperglycemia is the main pathophysiological mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, hyperglycemia upregulates toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) expression in monocytes12 leading to continuous interleukin (IL)-1 production, which in turn has been implicated as a mediator of the deleterious effects of hyperglycemia13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the presence of this cytokine has been reported in type 1 diabetic hearts14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing protein (NLRP) family of cytosolic pattern recognition receptors has a critical role in promoting sterile inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recognition of danger signals released from failing or malfunctioning cells, leading to production of mature IL-1, is a key event in this process15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TLR agonists can transcriptionally induce the expression of NLRP3 and pro-IL-116.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NLRP3 oligomerizes with the adaptor molecule apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD domain (ASC) in response to different signals1,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NLRP3 and ASC subsequently recruit the cysteine protease pro-caspase-1 to generate a caspase-1-activating platform, known as the inflammasome1,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inflammasome then promotes caspase-1-dependent proteolytic cleavage of pro-IL-1 into mature IL-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the effects of IL-1 on target organs, which are involved in the pathogenesis of DM, are still to be unravelled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we investigated the role of sterile inflammation in the induction of arrhythmias in DM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that IL-1 produced by DM heart macrophages targets cardiomyocytes to induce cardiac arrhythmias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a multi methodological approach, we demonstrate how TLR2 and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages mediate the production of IL-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that the inflammatory response to the metabolic dysfunction in DM generates cardiac arrhythmias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study also reveals a novel treatment option of DM-related arrhythmias by using either an IL-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra) or a NLRP3 inhibitor (MCC-950).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'TLR2 is required for diabetes-induced arrhythmias', 'Hyperglycemia upregulates TLR2 expression in monocytes12 and TLR2 participates is cardiac sterile inflammation in a number of situations20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the involvement of the TLR2-IL-1 axis in cardiac electrical activity, DM was induced in wild-type (WT) and Tlr2/ mice (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite similar high blood glucose levels (inset Fig 1a), the diabetic Tlr2/ group presented shorter QT (Fig 1b and Supplementary Fig 1a,b) and QTc intervals, when compared with diabetic WT mice (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In diabetic WT mice cardiac action potential (AP) displayed slower repolarization, when compared with non-diabetic WT mice, while in diabetic Tlr2/ mice AP duration (APD) was similar to non-diabetic mice (Fig 1d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of TLR2 drastically reduced the susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias after caffeine and dobutamine (Caff/Dobu) challenge in diabetic mice (Fig 1f,g), which were not detected in non-diabetic animals (Supplementary Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results were gender-independent, since these key findings were very similar in females (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cardiac relative mass and left ventricular morphology and function were preserved in all groups (Supplementary Fig 3ae).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No differences were observed in QRS duration or in cardiac fibrosis among experimental groups (Supplementary Fig 1c and 3f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a similar manner compared with an earlier study22, we have observed a trend towards lower insulin levels in Tlr2/ diabetic compared with Tlr2/ non-diabetic mice (unpaired t-test; P=0.07) (Supplementary Table 1), although the difference did not reach statistical significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the Tlr2/ diabetic mice showed insulin levels similar to WT+DM mice suggesting that: (i) the anti-inflammatory protection afforded by the lack of TLR2 was not enough to protect the streptozotocin-impaired pancreatic function; and (ii) the lack of electrophysiological changes observed in this KO mice could be not related to changes in insulin levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TLR2 activation has a key role in metabolic and cardiac diseases and its presence is required to trigger IL-1 production in different animal models23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that diabetic Tlr2/ mice have lower systemic (Fig 1h) and local (heart) (Fig 1i,j and Supplementary Fig 4) concentrations of IL-1 than diabetic WT mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No differences were observed in the cardiac IL-1 messenger RNA expression between WT and Tlr2/ (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data demonstrate that TLR2 contributes to IL-1 production, electrical disturbances and arrhythmias in a mouse model of DM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: TLR2 regulates cardiac electrical parameters and incidence/severity of DM-induced arrhythmias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Experimental

in local and systemic levels of IL-1, we hypothesized that IL-1 is involved in these cardiac changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We, therefore, investigated whether 24 h exposure to IL-1 is able to induce cardiac functional changes by measuring APD, ion currents and Ca2+ handling in isolated rat cardiomyocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we found that IL-1 prolongs the APD (Fig 2ac), then we investigated its effect on a key repolarizing potassium current, namely the transient outward potassium current (Ito).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incubation of isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes in the presence of IL-1,

Using confocal imaging, we examined the impact of IL-1 on SR Ca2+ leak by monitoring Ca2+ spark properties, which were increased after IL-1 exposure (Fig 2g,h,j and Supplementary Fig 6bf).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, a modest but significant negative post-rest variation in the SR Ca2+ content was observed only in IL-1-treated myocytes (Fig 2i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the SR Ca2+ content was not significantly different in cells incubated for 24 h in the presence and absence of IL-1 (Supplementary Fig 6g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rest does not typically affect the SR Ca2+ load, unless Ca2+ efflux by the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) is enhanced25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, however, one would expect a greater ratio of the rate constants of Ca2+i re-uptake upon application of 10 mM caffeine or by electrical stimulation27, in which Ca2+ clearance from the cytosol is dependent mainly on the NCX and the SR Ca2+ ATPase plus NCX, respectively28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, neither the rate constants of Ca2+ re-uptake/efflux (not shown), nor their ratio (Supplementary Fig 6h) was significantly changed by IL-1 incubation, which indicates that the IL-1-induced diastolic leak is not accompanied by stimulation of NCX-mediated Ca2+ efflux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We next investigated whether the reported IL-1 effects on cardiac electrical properties in rodents could be also observed in human cardiomyocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We, therefore, tested IL-1 effects in human induced pluripotent stem-cell derived cardiomyocytes (hIPS-CM) using field potential duration (FPD) measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experiments revealed longer FPD on IL-1 treated hIPS-CM, when compared with untreated hIPS-CM (Fig 2km).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Thus, IL-1 decreases Ito current, prolongs repolarization, and increases diastolic SR Ca2+ leak, providing a cellular substrate for triggered arrhythmogenic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'IL-1 and pCaMKII/oxiCaMKII induce arrhythmias', 'Ca2+ and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) have been implicated in diabetes-associated arrhythmias29,30 and recent evidence indicates that MyD88 inflammatory signalling leads to CaMKII oxidation and activation31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We, therefore, explored CaMKII activity upon exposure of cardiac strips to 10 ng ml1 of IL-1 for 24 h and then freeze-clamped the tissue for western blotting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-1 effectively promoted CaMKII oxidation (oxiCaMKII) and phosphorylation (p-CaMKII) (Fig 3a,b and Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether mere exposure to IL-1 is sufficient to generate a pro-arrhythmogenic substrate, ventricular myocytes were incubated for 24 h with IL-1 and the number of spontaneous contractile events (NSE), an index of cellular arrhythmic activity, was measured after pacing the cells during 10 min at either 0.5 or 3 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells incubated in the absence of IL-1 (control) had only sporadic NSE, whereas they were significantly enhanced by IL-1 (Fig 3c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the IL-1-induced NSE were largely reduced when tissue was pretreated with 2.5 mol l1 of the CaMKII inhibitor, KN93 (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since it is well accepted that KN-93 has numerous off target actions, including ionic currents with potential relevance to the observed arrhythmia phenotypes, a set of experiments were conducted using, the KN93 inactive analog KN92, either in the absence or presence of IL-1 (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While KN92 alone did not significantly affect the NSE, the combination of KN92+IL-1 induced an increase in the number of NSE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to confirm the role of CaMKII as a mediator of the increased NSE, another set of experiments were conducted using cardiomyocytes from mice with genetic CaMKII inhibition by cardiac-specific expression of autocamtide 3 inhibitory peptide (AC3-I) mimicking a conserved sequence of the CaMKII regulatory domain and their respective controls, which have an scrambled version of AC3-I (autocamtide 3 control peptide (AC3-C))32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such as shown in Fig 3c,d, AC3-C cells exposed to IL-1 presented a higher number of NSE compared with the same cell type under control condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, the AC3-I cells exposed to IL-1 did not show a significant increase in NSE (Fig 3c,d and Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, in order to elucidate whether the CaMKII inhibition also could have a key role in human cells, hIPS-CM were exposed to IL-1 in the absence or in the presence of a selective CaMKII inhibitor (autocamtide2related inhibitory peptide (AIP)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this setting, it was observed that the CaMKII inhibition was able to prevent the IL-1-induced longer FPD

left ventricular myocardial strips from healthy rats for 24 h with a TLR2/1 agonist (Pam3) (Fig 4a); these strips are known to contain other cell types besides CMs, such as immune cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pam3 incubation yielded a significant increase in cardiac IL-1 concentration (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since IL-1 secretion can be triggered by TLR2 activation in macrophages23, a group of animals was previously treated with liposomes containing clodronate-L (dichloromethylene diphosphonate (Cl2MDP)), a chemical agent that induces macrophage apoptosis33, in order to test whether macrophages are the source of IL-1 production induced by TLR2 activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a control condition, liposomes containing PBS were used (Fig 4a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stimulation of myocardial strips from macrophage-depleted animals with Pam3 resulted in significantly lower IL-1 amounts compared with those from non-macrophage-depleted healthy hearts (PBS liposome condition) (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, stimulation of the left ventricular wall for 24 h with either Pam3 or IL-1 promoted similar cardiac AP prolongation, an effect prevented by simultaneous incubation

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Diabetic patients often suffer of associated cardiovascular diseases, such as increased susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanistic link between DM and arrhythmias, however, remains unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we dissected the complex signalling pathways involving different cell types present in the diabetic heart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DM induces a sterile inflammation that activates TLR2 and the NLRP3 inflammasome in heart macrophages to produce IL-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cardiomyocytes, IL-1 then induces AP prolongation (through a decrease in Ito current) and an increase in Ca2+ sparks resulting in increased electrical vulnerability to arrhythmias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of TLR2, NLRP3, Caspase 1 or IL-1r, DM fails to sensitize rodents to ventricular arrhythmias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, treatment with either MCC-950 (NLRP3 inhibitor) or anakinra (IL-1ra) reverses the cardiac electrical remodelling and decreases the incidence of arrhythmias, emphasizing the pathomechanistic relevance of IL-1 and also a novel pharmacological strategy for the treatment of DM-associated arrhythmias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The activation of the inflammasome and the secretion of IL-1 seem to be a major danger-sensing pathway to sterile inflammation and cardiac repair in several heart diseases38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Earlier studies have demonstrated activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and increased expression of IL-1 in both type 1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39) and type 2 (refs 40, 41) diabetes (T1D and T2D), but until now their relevance in the pathogenesis of diabetic heart disease has been unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein we show that genetic deletion of TLR2, NLRP3, Casp1 or IL-1r is sufficient to prevent both QTc prolongation and increased susceptibility to arrhythmias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that DM-triggered TLR2 activation induces the expression of pro-IL-1 and the NLRP3 activation in heart macrophages, thus promoting pro-IL-1 cleavage to a mature form by Casp1 resulting in IL-1 secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then IL-1 acts on cardiomyocytes to prolong the AP and to increase Ca2+ sparks, sensitizing hearts to arrhythmias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the endogenous TLR2 agonists and NLRP3 activators in our T1D model are not precisely known, hyperglycemia is the most likely suspect to trigger IL-1 production, since it is able to activate monocytes through TLR2 to produce IL-112,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intermediary steps from hyperglycemia to TLR2 and NLRP3 activation may involve the release of endogenous TLR2 ligands43 and the generation of oxidative stress44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in both TLR2 and IL-1 expression in diabetic patients45,46,47 suggests that this mechanism of sterile inflammation is active in the natural course of disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A protective effect of TLR2 deficiency in DM has previously been observed by others20, as well as the role of TLR2 activation in the induction of arrhythmic events in an ischemia/reperfusion animal model21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The close association between TLR2 activation and IL-1 secretion and their influence on arrhythmogenesis indicates that TLR2 and IL-1 are part of an inflammatory pathway that has a major role in the pathogenesis of diabetes-associated electric dysfunction of the heart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The absence of insulin signalling can reduce Ito current, resulting in AP and QT prolongation48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the circulating insulin levels in diabetic IL-1r/ were significantly decreased compared with non-diabetic counterparts, while a strong trend towards decreased levels was found in diabetic Tlr2/ and Casp1/ mice, even though it was not statically different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only diabetic Nlrp3/ mice presented circulation insulin levels similar to non-diabetic controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we cannot exclude the possibility that preserved circulating insulin levels account for the prevention of electrophysiological abnormalities in diabetic Nlrp3/ mice, this is certainly not the case in IL-1r/, Tlr2/ and Casp1/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results reflect the limitation of our study where the systemic and local anti-inflammatory effects in the KO animals are not discernable using our global KO mice models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The source of IL-1 production in vivo has been elusive in disease models in which inflammasome activation has a major pathophysiological role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In T1D patients, monocytes spontaneously secrete IL-149, indicating that macrophages may represent such a source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that depletion of macrophages from cardiac muscle strips not only prevented TLR2 activation-induced IL-1 release, but also the Pam3/TLR2/IL-1-induced prolongation of the cardiac AP, pointing to macrophages as the source of IL-1 secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show increased NLRP3 content inside cardiac macrophages of WT diabetic mice compared with Tlr2/ diabetic mice, demonstrating that macrophage inflammasomes are activated in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The direct effects of IL-1 on electrical function of cardiomyocytes reported in the literature are scant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent review50 on this subject highlights the rather indirect evidences linking IL-1, TNF and IL-6 to delayed repolarization, long QT syndrome and ventricular tachycardia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 1993, IL-1 (not the mature IL-1) was shown to increase the duration of the AP51 .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another study described acute effects of IL-1 on atrial preparations, and did not find any effects on APD52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein we demonstrate that IL-1 creates a pro-arrhythmic environment both in rodent and human cells by reducing the repolarizing K+ current (Ito), by increasing CaMKII oxidation/ phosphorylation and Ca2+ spark frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A prolongation of the cardiac AP due to lower Ito current has been described in diabetic experimental models53,54 and in agreement with these data, we show here that binding of IL-1 to its receptor in the heart can produce similar effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hyperglycemia was previously reported to enhance CaMKII-dependent activation of spontaneous SR Ca2+ release events29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also provide evidence that IL-1 increases both Ca2+ spark frequency and loss of SR Ca2+ content during rest in cardiac cells, indicating enhanced SR Ca2+leak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, although the possibility that IL-1 could promote oxidation and activation of CaMKII has not been explored in cardiac tissue, recent evidence suggests that this could be achieved via MyD88 inflammatory signalling31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the IL-1 receptor uses MyD88 as a signalling adaptor and we illustrate that IL-1 promotes oxidation of CaMKII (oxi-CaMKII) and increased CaMKII phosphorylation (p-CaMKII) in cardiac tissue, it is likely that IL-1 acts through CAMKII to promote pro-arrhythmic effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'QTc prolongation is an independent marker of increased mortality in T1D patients55,56, and on resting electrocardiograms (ECGs) it is closely associated with susceptibility to tachyarrhythmias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that pharmacological strategies of blocking either the IL-1 receptor or NLRP3 activation were both very effective in reversing QTc prolongation and attenuating the vulnerability to Caff/Dobu induced arrhythmias in our experimental DM model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As IL-1Ra has already been successfully used to improve the control of T1D and T2D57,58, it could be readily tested in DM patients undergoing IL-1Ra clinical trials to reduce the electrical vulnerability of the heart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the robust results obtained here using the NLRP3 inhibitor, MCC-950, open a new therapeutic avenue for T1D induced cardiac arrhythmias, since it improves the cardiac electrical profile, while keeping other inflammasomes involved in the response to infectious diseases intact.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
