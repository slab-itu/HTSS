Nicotinamide riboside is uniquely and orally bioavailable in mice and humans  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is in wide use as an NAD+ precursor vitamin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we determine the time and dose-dependent effects of NR on blood NAD+ metabolism in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report that human blood NAD+ can rise as much as 2.7-fold with a single oral dose of NR in a pilot study of one individual, and that oral NR elevates mouse hepatic NAD+ with distinct and superior pharmacokinetics to those of nicotinic acid and nicotinamide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further show that single doses of 100, 300 and 1,000 mg of NR produce dose-dependent increases in the blood NAD+ metabolome in the first clinical trial of NR pharmacokinetics in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also report that nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NAAD), which was not thought to be en route for the conversion of NR to NAD+, is formed from NR and discover that the rise in NAAD is a highly sensitive biomarker of effective NAD+ repletion.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), the central redox coenzyme in cellular metabolism1,2 functions as a hydride group acceptor, forming NADH with concomitant oxidation of metabolites derived from carbohydrates, amino acids and fats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NAD+/NADH ratio controls the degree to which such reactions proceed in oxidative versus reductive directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas fuel oxidation reactions require NAD+ as a hydride acceptor, gluconeogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, ketogenesis, detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipogenesis require reduced co-factors, NADH and NADPH, as hydride donors (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to its role as a coenzyme, NAD+ is the consumed substrate of enzymes such as poly-ADPribose polymerases (PARPs), sirtuins and cyclic ADPribose synthetases1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In redox reactions, the biosynthetic structures of NAD+, NADH, NADP+ and NADPH are preserved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, PARP3, sirtuin4 and cyclic ADPribose synthetase5 activities hydrolyze the linkage between the nicotinamide (Nam) and the ADPribosyl moieties of NAD+ to signal DNA damage, alter gene expression, control post-translational modifications and regulate calcium signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: The NAD+ metabolome.NAD+ is synthesized by salvage of the vitamin precursors, NA, Nam and NR, or from tryptophan in the de novo pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NAD+ can be reduced to NADH, phosphorylated to NADP+ or consumed to Nam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nam can also be methylated and oxidized to waste products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NAAD was not thought to be a precursor of NAD+ from NR.Full size image', 'In animals, NAD+-consuming activities and cell division necessitate ongoing NAD+ synthesis, either through a de novo pathway that originates with tryptophan or via salvage pathways from three NAD+ precursor vitamins, Nam, nicotinic acid (NA) and nicotinamide riboside (NR)2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dietary NAD+ precursors, which include tryptophan and the three vitamins, prevent pellagra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though NR is present in milk6,7, the cellular concentrations of NAD+, NADH, NADP+ and NADPH are much higher than those of other NAD+ metabolites8,9, such that dietary NAD+ precursor vitamins are largely derived from enzymatic breakdown of NAD+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although milk is a source of NR6,7, the more abundant sources of NR, Nam and NA are unprocessed foods, in which plant and animal cellular NAD+ metabolites are broken down to these compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human digestion and the microbiome10 play roles in the provision of these vitamins in ways that are not fully characterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the conventional NAD+ precursor vitamins, NA and Nam, have long been supplemented into human and animal diets to prevent pellagra and promote growth11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though NR has been available as a GMP-produced supplement since 2013 and animal safety assessment indicates that it is as nontoxic as Nam13, no human testing has been reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Different tissues maintain NAD+ levels through reliance on different biosynthetic routes and precursors14,15 (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because NAD+-consuming activities frequently occur as a function of cellular stresses3 and produce Nam, the ability of a cell to salvage Nam into productive NAD+ synthesis through Nam phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) activity versus methylation of Nam to N-methylnicotinamide (MeNam) regulates the efficiency of NAD+-dependent processes16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NAD+ biosynthetic genes are also under circadian control17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both NAMPT expression and NAD+ levels decline in a number of tissues as a function of aging and overnutrition19,20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'High-dose NA but not high-dose Nam is prescribed to treat and prevent dyslipidemias, although its use is limited by painful flushing23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas it takes only 15 mg per day of NA or Nam to prevent pellagra, pharmacological doses of NA can be as high as 24 g. Despite the  greater than 100-fold difference in effective dose between pellagra prevention and dyslipidemia treatment, we proposed that the beneficial effects of NA on plasma lipids might simply depend on function of NA as an NAD+ boosting compound1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to this view, sirtuin activation would likely be part of the mechanism because Nam is an NAD+ precursor in most cells14,15 but inhibits sirtuins at high doses25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On the basis of the ability of NR to elevate NAD+ synthesis, increase sirtuin activity and extend lifespan in yeast6,26, NR has been employed in mice to elevate NAD+ metabolism and improve health in models of metabolic stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, NR allows mice to resist weight gain on high-fat diet27, prevent noise-induced hearing loss28 and maintain the regenerative potential of stem cells in aging mice, providing a longevity advantage29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the hepatic NAD+ metabolome has been interrogated as a function of prediabetic and type 2 diabetic mouse models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data indicate that levels of liver NADP+ and NADPH, which are required for resistance to ROS, are severely challenged by diet-induced obesity, and that diabetes and the NAD+ metabolome can be partially controlled while diabetic neuropathy can be blocked by oral NR30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data indicate that NR is a mitochondrially favoured NAD+ precursor31 and in vivo activities of NR have been interpreted as depending on mitochondrial sirtuin activities27,28, though not to the exclusion of nucleocytosolic targets32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), the phosphorylated form of NR, has been used to treat declining NAD+ in mouse models of overnutrition and aging19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beneficial effects of NMN have been shown to depend on SIRT120.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because of the abundance of NAD+-dependent processes, the effects of NR and NMN may depend on multiple targets including sirtuins, PARP family members, cADPribose synthetases, NAD+-dependent oxidoreductases and NADPH-dependent ROS detoxification enzymes30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To translate NR technologies to people, it is necessary to determine NR oral availability and utilization in different tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we began with targeted quantitative NAD+ metabolomics of blood and urine in a pilot experiment in which a healthy 52-year-old man took 1,000 mg of NR daily for 7 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that blood cellular NAD+ rose 2.7-fold after one dose of NR and that NA adenine dinucleotide (NAAD) unexpectedly increased 45-fold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then performed a detailed analysis of 128 mice comparing oral NR, Nam and NA in a manner that eliminated the possibility of circadian artefacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that NR boosts hepatic NAD+ and NAD+- consuming activities to a greater degree than Nam or NA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further experiments clarified that NR is a direct precursor of NAAD and that NAAD sensitively reports on increased NAD+ metabolism in mouse liver and heart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we performed a clinical study with 12 healthy human subjects at three single doses of NR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated that NR supplementation safely increases NAD+ metabolism at all doses and validated elevated NAAD as an unexpected, sensitive biomarker of boosting NAD+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unique oral bioavailability of NR in mice and people and methods established herein enable clinical translation of NR to improve wellness and treat human diseases.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Oral NR increases human blood NAD+ with elevation of NAAD', 'GMP-synthesized NR showed no activity as a mutagen or toxin13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite use as an over-the-counter supplement, no data addressing human availability were available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A healthy 52-year-old male (65 kg) contributed blood and urine before seven days of orally self-administered NR (1,000 mg per morning).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blood was taken an additional nine times during the first day and at 24 h after the first and last dose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blood was separated into peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and plasma before quantitative NAD+ metabolomics by liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS)9, which was expanded to quantify methylated and oxidized metabolites of Nam30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Supplementary Table 1 and Fig 2, the PBMC NAD+ metabolome was unaffected by NR for the first 2.7 h. In six measurements from time zero through 2.7 h, NAD+ had a mean concentration of 18.5 M; while Nam had a mean concentration of 4.1 M and the methylated and oxidized Nam metabolite, N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (Me2PY), had a mean concentration of 2.6 M. However, at 4.1 h post ingestion, PBMC NAD+ and Me2PY increased by factors of 2.3 and 4.2, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Elevation of the PBMC NAD+ metabolome by oral NR in a 52 year-old male.A healthy 52-year-old male ingested 1,000 mg NC Cl daily for 1 week.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PBMCs were prepared from blood collected before the first dose (0 h), at seven time points after the first dose (0.6, 1, 1.4, 2.7, 4.1, 7.7 and 8.1 h), before second dose (23.8 h) and 24 h after the seventh dose (167.6 h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concentrations (a, NMN; b, NAD+; c, NADP+; d, Nam; e, MeNam; f, Me2PY; g, Me4PY; h, NAAD; i, ADPR) are with respect to whole blood volumes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data indicate that the NAD+ metabolomewith the exception of Nam and NAADis elevated by the 4.1 time point post ingestion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas PBMC Nam was never elevated by NR, NAAD was elevated by the next time point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NAD+ and NAAD remained elevated 24 h after the last dose.Full size image', 'In yeast, deletion of NR kinase 1 (NRK1) does not eliminate utilization of NR26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1, NR can be phosphorylyzed to Nam by purine nucleoside phosphorylase and still contribute to NAD+ synthesis through Nam salvage26,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as shown in Fig 2, Nam concentration in the human subjects PBMCs merely fluctuated in a range of 2.6 to 7.1 M throughout all 11 observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 4.2-fold increase in Me2PY concentration at the 4.1 h time point suggests that increased cellular NAD+ accumulation is accompanied by increased NAD+-consuming activities linked to increased methylation and oxidation of the Nam product.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the subjects PBMCs at 7.7 and 8.1 h post ingestion, NAD+ and Me2PY peaked, increasing above baseline concentrations by 2.7-fold and 8.4-fold, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At these times, unexpectedly, NAAD, the substrate of glutamine-dependent NAD+ synthetase35,36, which is only expected to be produced in biosynthesis of NAD+ from tryptophan and NA2, was elevated from less than 20 nM to as high as 0.91 M. Whereas NAAD lagged the rise in PBMC NAD+ by one time point, the relative rise in PBMC NAD+ was not as pronounced as the spike in NAAD, which was at least 45-fold above the baseline level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although contrary to expectations, these data suggested that NR might be incorporated into NAAD after formation of NAD+ and chased back to the NAD+ peak as NAD+ declines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

cellular NADP+ plus NADPH oxidized in extraction, and the peak of ADPR, which signals an increase in NAD+-consuming activities, co-occur with peak NAD+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using methods optimized for recovery of nucleotides, NR was not recovered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Figs 3 and 4, the major time-dependent waste metabolite in plasma and urine was Me2PY, which rose 10-fold from pre-dose to

hepatic NAD+ precursor vitamin', 'On the basis of known NAD+ biosynthetic pathways31, it was difficult to understand how levels of NAAD rose in human PBMCs after an oral dose of NR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though NR did not elevate Nam in blood samples at any time during the n=1 experiment, it remained possible that NR was partially converted to Nam before salvage synthesis to NAD+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such conversion to Nam might allow bacterial hydrolysis of Nam to NA by pncA gene productspotentially in the gut10and subsequent conversion to NAD+ through an NAAD intermediate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NAAD was reported in mouse liver when 500 mg kg1 of radioactive Nam was injected intraperitoneally (IP) into the body cavity of mice37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, NAAD was observed in kidneys, ovaries, lung, heart and brain in addition to liver in mice IP-injected with 500 mg kg1 of NA but not Nam38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, careful analysis of mouse liver perfused with radioactive NA and Nam indicated that NAAD is produced from NA but not Nam at physiological concentrations39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, formation of blood or tissue NAAD from oral administration of Nam or NR has never been observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although some mouse experiments have been done with IP administered NR at dosages of 1,000 mg kg1 twice per day28, NR is active as an oral agent at a daily dose of 400 mg kg1 by supplementation into food27,29,30 and demonstrated potent NAD+ boosting activity in the n=1 human experiment at 15 mg kg1 (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of weight/surface area, the conversion between human adult dose and mouse dose is a factor of 12.3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  40), suggesting that mice should be administered 185 mg kg1 to achieve comparable levels of supplementation with the human pilot experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore designed a reverse translational experiment in which mice were administered 185 mg kg1 of NR or the mole equivalent doses of Nam and NA by oral gavage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ascertain the timecourse by which these vitamins boost the hepatic NAD+ metabolome without the complication of circadian oscillation of NAD+ metabolism17,18, we euthanized all mice at 2 pm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, gavage was performed at 0.25, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 h before tissue harvest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To stop metabolism synchronously, mouse livers were harvested by freeze-clamping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 5, we additionally performed saline gavages at all time points and euthanized mice for quantitative NAD+ metabolomic analysis to ensure that animal handling does not alter levels of NAD+ metabolites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flat timecourses of saline gavages established methodological soundness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Baseline levels of hepatic NAD+ metabolites (pmol mg1) at 2 pm were 1,000±35 for NAD+, 230±29 for Nam, 210±20 for NADP+, 66±13 for ADPR and  less_than 15 for all other NAD+ metabolites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hepatic levels of NA, NAR, NAMN, NAAD have baselines of  less_than 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a point of orientation to quantitative metabolomics in tissue samples, 1,000 pmol mg1 is 1 mM, 200 is 200 M and 10 is

greater increases in NAD+ metabolism than Nam or NA with distinctive kinetics, that Nam is disadvantaged in stimulation of NAD+-consuming activities, and that NAAD is surprisingly produced after oral NR administration.Full size image', 'Targeted NAD+ metabolomics8,9 allows simultaneous assessment of functionally important metabolites such as NAD+ and NADP+ along with metabolites that could serve as biomarkers of biosynthetic processes, such as NA, NAR, NAMN, NR, NMN and NAAD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, quantification of increases in ADPR, Nam, MeNam, Me2PY and N-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide (Me4PY) on a common absolute scale with NAD+ permits assessment of increased NAD+-consuming activities associated with NAD+ precursor vitamin supplementation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Hepatic concentrations of 13 NAD+ metabolites were quantified in three to four mice at seven time points after gavage of saline and each vitamin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, on each experimental day, three mice were gavaged with saline and euthanized to serve as time zero samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each vitamin produced a temporally distinct pattern of hepatic NAD+ metabolites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with rapid phosphorylation of NR and NAR by NR kinases41, the only NAD+ metabolites that do not produce hepatic peaks as a function of gavage of NAD+ precursor vitamins are NR and NAR (Supplementary Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The accumulation curves of some metabolites as a function of each vitamin are strikingly similar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the accumulation of NMN (Fig 5a) is nearly identical to that of NAD+ (Fig 5b) and NADP+ (Fig 5c), though at a scale of 1:400:40, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the accumulation of Me4PY (Fig 5f) is nearly identical to that of Me2PY (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As shown in Fig 5b, NA produced the least increase in hepatic NAD+ and also was 46 h faster than NR and Nam in kinetics of hepatic NAD+ accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When NA was provided by oral gavage, liver NA peaked (340±30 pmol mg1) in 15 min (Fig 5g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hepatic NA appearance was followed by an expected peak of 220±29 NAAD at 1 h post gavage (Fig 5i) and a rise in hepatic NAD+ from 990±25 baseline to 2,200±150 at 2 h (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hepatic NADP+ due to NA (Fig 5c) rose in parallel to that of hepatic NAD+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the hours after gavage of NA, as hepatic NAD+ and NADP+ fell, there was clear evidence of enhanced NAD+-consuming activities with significant rises in ADPR (Fig 5j), Nam (Fig 5d), MeNam (Fig 5e), Me2PY (Supplementary Fig 1c) and Me4PY (Fig 5f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, oral administration of NA doubled hepatic NAD+ from 1 to 2 mM through expected intermediates and produced an increase in NAD+ consumption and methylated products, MeNam, Me2PY and Me4PY.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Net conversion by the liver of NA to Nam has been documented for decades30,37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Essentially, the liver transiently elevates NAD+ biosynthetic capacity so long as NA is available while increasing NAD+-consuming activities, thereby making Nam available to other tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of hepatic NNMT results in net production of MeNam from NAD+ precursors, which stabilizes SIRT1 protein in liver and is associated with better lipid parameters in mice and some human populations42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As shown in Fig 5g and consistent with radioactive experiments39, oral Nam was not used by the liver as NA because it did not produce a peak of NA at any time after gavage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though there was a clear increase in hepatic NAD+ 2 h after Nam gavage, the Nam gavage drove increased hepatic NAD+ accumulation from 2 to 8 h with a peak at 8 h (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nam gavage produced two peaks of Nam in the liver (Fig 5d), the first at 15 min, consistent with simple transport of Nam to liver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second broad peak was coincident with elevation of NAD+ and NADP+ (Fig 5c,d) and elevation of the NAD+-consuming metabolomic signature of ADPR (Fig 5j), MeNam, Me4PY and Me2PY (Fig 5e,f and Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Of the metabolites associated with NAD+-consuming activities, ADPR is the only one that must be formed from NAD+ because Nam, MeNam and the oxidized forms of MeNam could appear in liver from the gavaged Nam without conversion to NAD+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, of three NAD+ precursor vitamins provided in bolus at equivalent oral doses, Nam provided the least increase in ADPR (Fig 5j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the area under the curve (AUC) of the Nam-driven rise in hepatic NAD+ indicated a 50% advantage of Nam over NA (Fig 5b), there was a  greater than 50% deficit in Nam-driven ADPR accumulation versus NA (Fig 5j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the idea that high-dose NA, though not an ideal hepatic NAD+ precursor, is effective as a cholesterol agent whereas Nam is not44 because high-dose Nam inhibits sirtuins1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, NR is active as a cholesterol-lowering agent in overfed mice30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As shown in Fig 1, Nam is expected to proceed through NMN but not NR, NAR, NaMN or NAAD en route to forming NAD+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though there was no elevation of hepatic NR or NAR with oral Nam, there was also little elevation of hepatic NMNthis metabolite never reached a mean value of 5 pmol mg1 at any time after Nam administration (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, as shown in Fig 5i, 24 h after oral Nam, NAAD was elevated to nearly 200 from a baseline of  less_than 2 pmol mg1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elevated NAAD occurred during the broad peak of elevated hepatic NAD+ and NADP+ (Fig 5b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that the rise in NAAD is a biomarker of increased NAD+ synthesis and does not depend on the conventionally described precursors of NAAD, namely NA and tryptophan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As shown in Fig 5b, NR elevated hepatic NAD+ by more than fourfold with a peak at 6 h post gavage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NR also produced the greatest elevation of NMN (Fig 5a), NADP+ (Fig 5c), Nam (Fig 5d), NAMN (Fig 5h), NAAD (Fig 5i) and ADPR (Fig 5j) in terms of peak height and AUC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, although gavage of Nam produces a peak of Nam in the liver at 15 min, the peak of Nam from NR gavage corresponds to the peak of NAD+, NMN, NADP+ and ADPR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data establish that oral NR has clearly different hepatic pharmacokinetics than oral Nam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More NAD+ and NADP+ were produced from NR than from Nam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, there was three times as much accumulation of ADPR, indicating that NR drives greater NAD+-consuming activities in liver than mole equivalent doses of Nam and NA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though it has been speculated that NR would be a more potent NAD+ and sirtuin-boosting vitamin than conventional niacins45, these are the first in vivo data in support of this hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As was seen in the n=1 human blood experiment, at time points in which the abundant NAD+ metabolites, NAD+ and NADP+, were elevated by NR by twofold or more, NAAD rose from undetectable levels to 10% of the level of NAD+, thereby becoming a highly sensitive biomarker of increased NAD+ metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though compounds such as MeNam, Me2PY and Me4PY are also correlated with increased NAD+ synthesis, they are waste products that can be produced without NAD+ synthesis, whereas NAAD is functional NAD+ precursor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To test whether NAAD is also elevated in other tissues and through other routes of administration, we euthanized mice after 6 days of NR or saline by IP administration and analysed hepatic and cardiac NAD+ metabolomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 6, steady-state levels of hepatic NAD+ and NADP+ are much more responsive to NR than are steady state levels of cardiac NAD+ and NADP+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, cardiac NAD+ metabolism was clearly elevated on the basis of statistically significant elevation of NMN, Nam, MeNam and Me4PY.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these metabolites, only NMN, which was elevated in the heart by approximately twofold, could be considered diagnostic for increased NAD+ formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, NAMN and NAAD were increased by about 100-fold in heart and liver with NAAD rising to 10% of the concentration of heart and liver NAD+ in supplemented animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Despite  greater than 75 years of human use of NA and Nam11 and  greater than 10 years of preclinical NR research6, there has never been a quantitative metabolomic or pharmacokinetic comparison of the three NAD+ precursor vitamins in any system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In terms of elevation of mouse liver NAD+, we discovered that NR is more orally bioavailable than Nam, which is more orally bioavailable than NA (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three precursors also differ in the degree to which they promote accumulation of ADPR, a measure of sirtuin and other NAD+-consuming activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 5j, the ability of NR to elevate ADPR exceeded that of Nam by 3-fold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This validates NR as the favoured NAD+ precursor vitamin for increasing NAD+ and NAD+-consuming activities in liver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'NR, Nam and NA each have unique pharmacokinetic profiles in mouse liver, both in terms of kinetics of NAD+ formation and the population of NAD+ metabolites as a function of time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 5d, Nam is the only vitamin precursor of NAD+ that produces elevated hepatic Nam 15 min after oral administration and, as shown in Fig 5g, NA is the only precursor that produces elevated NA 15 min after oral administration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data exclude the possibility that all three vitamins are utilized through the Preiss-Handler pathway in liver or that oral NR is used exclusively as Nam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we have demonstrated that utilization of both NR and extracellular NMN are limited by activity of the NR kinase pathway48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'When PBMCs were analysed from the first person to ingest NR, NAAD was observed to increase at least 45-fold from a baseline of less than 20 nM to a peak value of nearly 1 M. This occurred concomitant with a rise in NAD+ from 18.5 to 50 M. NAAD was also observed to be elevated in liver when mice were orally administered NAD+ precursor vitamins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, NR led to striking elevation of NAAD in the heart, a tissue that increases NAD+ metabolism without increasing steady-state NAD+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Surprisingly, NA, the only precursor expected to proceed to NAD+ through an NAAD intermediate, produced the least NAAD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, although Nam and NR never produced peaks of hepatic NA or NAR, both produced peaks of hepatic NAAD during the periods in which these compounds elevated hepatic NAD+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temporal basis of the NAAD excursions suggested that elevating NAD+ (Fig 5b) not only stimulates accumulation of NAD+-consumption products ADPR (Fig 5j), Nam (Fig 5d), MeNam (Fig 5e) and Me4PY (Fig 5f), but also stimulates retrograde production of NAAD (Fig 5i) and NAMN (Fig 5h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to this view, as the rate of NAD+ synthesis increases, a previously unknown activity would deamidate NAD+ to NAAD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, similar conditions could result in NMN deamidation, giving rise to NAMN and NAAD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In mouse liver, the apparent flux through this pathway is quite significant: the NR-driven peak of NAAD amounted to 10% of the NR-attributable peak of NAD+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Production of high levels of NAAD from NAD+ could therefore account for the NR-stimulated peak in NAMN because NAMN adenylytransferase is a reversible enzyme49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Striking elevation (100-fold) of NAAD was also seen in the heart of mice supplemented with NR after 6 days of IP administration (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The hypothesis that NAAD is formed from NR in vivo was tested by administering NR labelled in the Nam and ribosyl moieties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 7, NR stimulates appearance of double-labelled NAAD (8% of total) at the same time in which 5% of NAD+ is double-labelled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biochemical basis for a potential NAD+ deamidation reaction is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, glutamine-dependent NAD+ synthetase is irreversible35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One intriguing possibility is that NAAD is formed by the long-sought enzyme that forms intracellular NAADP50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to this view, an NADP deamidase may be responsible for formation of NAADPthis same activity might deamidate NAD+ at high concentrations forming NAAD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike ADPR and methylated Nam waste products, NAAD is not only a biomarker of elevated NAD+ metabolism but also a reserve metabolite that contributes to elevated NAD+ over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, in the first clinical study of NR, we established that blood NAD+ metabolism is increased by single 100, 300 and 1,000 mg doses of NR without dose-dependent increases in PBMC Nam or serious adverse events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In people, as in mice, NAAD is the most sensitive biomarker of boosting NAD+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While 1,000 mg of NR elevated PBMC NAD+ from 12 to 18 M and generated a 90% increase in 24 h AUC, NAAD was elevated from below the limit of quantification to 1 M and generated a 2,900% increase in 24 h AUC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability to detect NAAD in human samples is expected to aid conduct of clinical testing of NR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Availability of over-the-counter supplements can complicate clinical trials because patients may enrol to obtain compounds they expect to bring benefits and be inclined to take supplements in case they are assigned to placebo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detection of NAAD should therefore be incorporated in phase II and III trials to eliminate the confounding effects of off-study NR use.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
