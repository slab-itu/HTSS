Low-temperature-processed efficient semi-transparent planar perovskite solar cells for bifacial and tandem applications  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Semi-transparent perovskite solar cells are highly attractive for a wide range of applications, such as bifacial and tandem solar cells; however, the power conversion efficiency of semi-transparent devices still lags behind due to missing suitable transparent rear electrode or deposition process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report a low-temperature process for efficient semi-transparent planar perovskite solar cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A hybrid thermal evaporationspin coating technique is developed to allow the introduction of PCBM in regular device configuration, which facilitates the growth of high-quality absorber, resulting in hysteresis-free devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We employ high-mobility hydrogenated indium oxide as transparent rear electrode by room-temperature radio-frequency magnetron sputtering, yielding a semi-transparent solar cell with steady-state efficiency of 14.2% along with 72% average transmittance in the near-infrared region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With such semi-transparent devices, we show a substantial power enhancement when operating as bifacial solar cell, and in combination with low-bandgap copper indium gallium diselenide we further demonstrate 20.5% efficiency in four-terminal tandem configuration.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The emerging perovskite solar cells have received increasing attention due to the high efficiency, easy processing and potentially low cost1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells have soared up to 20.1% (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3), there is still ample room for further efficiency improvement through novel concepts4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An effective approach to increase the efficiency and lower the production cost is to make semi-transparent solar cells that can convert solar energy into electricity from both front and rear side of the device7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bifacial cell concept has been implemented in various kinds of solar cell technologies8,9,10,11,12, and up to 50% output power enhancement has been demonstrated in Si wafer bifacial modules by collecting the albedo radiation from surroundings13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the semi-transparent perovskite solar cells hold great promise for applications in tandem solar cells14, photon energy upconversion15, building-integrated photovoltaics16, wearable electronics17, powering sensors and electronic gadgets in homes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'There are still many challenges hindering the realization of high-performance semi-transparent perovskite solar cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells3,18,19,20,21,22 employ high-temperature-processed (500 °C) TiO2 (mesoporous and compact) as electron transporting layer (ETL), which is incompatible with monolithic tandem or flexible solar cells on plastics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is desirable to develop a planar structure that allows low-temperature processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is well known that perovskite solar cells, particularly in planar configuration with TiO2 as ETL, suffer from pronounced hysteresis in the current densityvoltage (JV) curve, which often results in overestimated device performance23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is imperative to eliminate the hysteresis, which is not only important to ensure a stable performance but also to unambiguously evaluate the real device efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6,6-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) has been proven to assist in eliminating the JV hysteresis in inverted device configuration24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several efforts have been made in positioning PCBM in regular device structure; however, the hysteresis phenomenon still remains25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For bifacial and tandem solar cell applications, it is crucial to replace the commonly used metal contacts in perovskite cells by highly transparent conducting electrodes, which allow sunlight incident from front and rear side of the device and to transmit the photons with energy below the bandgap of the perovskite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously, thin layers of Au (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27), carbon nanotubes28 and PEDOT:PSS29 have been explored as transparent contact for perovskite solar cells, while the efficiencies are generally below 10% and these contacts featured strong absorption in near infrared (NIR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Efficient semi-transparent devices have been realized with graphene rear electrode; however, all the devices show strong hysteresis in current densityvoltage curves30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, sputtered transparent conductive oxides (TCO), including indium tin oxide (ITO)32, ZnO:Al33 and indium zinc oxide (IZO)34, have been reported with highest efficiency of up to 12.1% for a semi-transparent cell and 19.5% in perovskiteCIGS (copper indium gallium diselenide) four-terminal configuration33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bailie et al.35 developed a 12.7% efficiency semi-transparent perovskite solar cell employing Ag nanowires, and demonstrated 18.6 and 17% tandem efficiency by combining with CIGS and low-quality silicon bottom cell, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the high NIR transparency and low sheet resistance of Ag nanowires, the complicated deposition method leads to large efficiency variation and poor reproducibility, and the fast diffusion of Ag into Spiro-OMeTAD and perovskite results in degradation of device stability and performance36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the implementation of a suitable transparent electrode material and deposition process is the key and challenge to high-efficiency semi-transparent perovskite solar cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An ideal transparent electrode for perovskite solar cells should meet the following requirements: superior transparency in visible and NIR region, low sheet resistance, robust adhesion, good chemical stability and compatibility with adjoining layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the perovskite and Spiro-OMeTAD are temperature and solvent sensitive35, a low-temperature and dry process would be favoured for the deposition of transparent electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, the room-temperature sputtering deposited TCO would be an ideal candidate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report a low-temperature (50 °C)-processed hysteresis-free high-efficiency semi-transparent planar perovskite solar cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hysteresis is eliminated through a PCBM interlayer and high-quality perovskite absorber enabled by the hybrid thermal evaporationspin coating method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-mobility hydrogenated indium oxide (In2O3:H) is employed as transparent rear electrode through a room-temperature radio-frequency magnetron sputtering, which enables a semi-transparent device with steady-state efficiency of 14.2% and 72% average transmittance between 800 and 1,150 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a device when operated as a bifacial cell yields an additional 13.5% power output improvement, and 20.5% efficiency is demonstrated using perovskite top cell and CIGS bottom cell in four-terminal tandem configuration.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Low-temperature-processed planar perovskite solar cells', 'Figure 1 shows a schematic drawing and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the perovskite absorber deposited by hybrid thermal evaporationspin coating method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high-temperature-processed TiO2 is replaced by 100 nm compact ZnO layer deposited through radio-frequency magnetron sputtering at room temperature, followed by spin coating of 50 nm PCBM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The room-temperature-processed ETL is attractive for low-cost, lightweight and flexible plastic substrates, and compatible with monolithic tandem fabrication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As illustrated in Fig 1a, the perovskite layer is formed through a hybrid evaporation solution approach, where a compact PbI2 layer is initially deposited by thermal evaporation37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method allows a uniform and compact PbI2 deposited over large area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then CH3NH3I in isopropanol solution is added by spin coating, followed by thermal annealing at 50 °C for 2 h on hotplate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Afterwards, 200 nm Spiro-OMeTAD is spin coated on top of the perovskite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the cell is finished by evaporating 60 nm Au for opaque reference solar cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For semi-transparent solar cells, thermally evaporated MoO3 and room-temperature-sputtered In2O3:H are employed as rear contact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the highest processing temperature during the opaque and semi-transparent device fabrication is not higher than 50 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More detailed fabrication

layer is essential for achieving high efficiency38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As ZnO conformally covers the rough fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) surface, the deposition of PCBM smoothens the surface where the perovskite is grown (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the thermally evaporated PbI2 exhibits a compact and uniform layer over large area (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1d,e presents the cross-sectional SEM images of perovskite layer before and after annealing, showing that the perovskite layer retained the desired compact morphology from parent PbI2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With thermal annealing, the grain size increases considerably from several tens of nanometres to values comparable to the film thickness (Fig 1d,e), which might be beneficial to the transport and recombination properties of the absorber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The herein introduced perovskite preparation method offers several merits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In previously reported two-step methods where PbI2 is spin coated from solution, it is quite challenging to control the morphology of the PbI2 film deposited from solution on planar substrates39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low solubility of PbI2 in the commonly used solvent N,N-dimethylformide40 could limit the thickness variation and the choice of the underlying substrates where PbI2 is deposited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We overcome these challenges by using a simple thermal evaporation method, which can deposit a compact and uniform PbI2 layer with precisely controlled thickness over large area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The room-temperature vapour deposition has no constraints on the underlying substrates, which opens up numerous possibilities for exploring other solvent-sensitive carrier-selective contacts and novel cell structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, this process allows the introduction of PCBM below the perovskite layer, which is crucial to eliminate the JV hysteresis24, but difficult to realize in solution process as the commonly used polar solvents, such as N,N-dimethylformide, dimethylsulfoxide or -butyrolactone, for perovskite formation are detrimental to thin layers of PCBM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Planar perovskite solar cells without JV hysteresis', 'The hybrid thermal evaporationspin coating method enables us to investigate the influences of PCBM on perovskite microstructure and device performance in regular planar configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2a,b presents the cross-sectional SEM images of the planar perovskite solar cell with and without PCBM layer, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other than PCBM, the devices are fabricated by an identical process with perovskite layer grown from 120 nm PbI2 (estimated by quartz microbalance) and 40 mg ml1 CH3NH3I solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be seen from the SEM images that the perovskite layer shows considerable surface roughness and thickness non-uniformity when grown directly on ZnO, which leads to low-resistance shunting paths and insufficient light absorption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A uniform and compact perovskite layer with large grain size is obtained when grown on PCBM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The microstructural difference in perovskite layers is mainly attributed to the morphological differences in PbI2 layers, as shown in Supplementary Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If PbI2 is grown on ZnO directly, porous layers comprising numerous nanoplates are obtained41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could form lots of grain boundaries and defects after the conversion into perovskite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that high-efficiency devices produced by the here described process always contain residual PbI2 as shown in Supplementary Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of residual PbI2 is also observed in many high-efficiency devices reported in literature and several beneficial effects, for example, grain boundary passivation, hole-blocking effect and so on, have been proposed42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Microstructure, time-resolved

JV measurements31, it is crucial to report both forward (short circuit to forward bias) and backward (forward bias to short circuit) measurements along with the measurement conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The device with PCBM layer shows an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.101 V, short circuit current density (Jsc) of 17.6 mA cm2 and fill factor (FF) of 74.9%, resulting in power conversion efficiency () of 14.5% in forward scan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In backward scan a Voc of 1.103 V, Jsc of 17.5 mA cm2, FF of 74.6% and  of 14.4% are obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The JV curves from forward and backward scans coincide well, indicating no JV hysteresis is observed in the devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Jsc is confirmed by external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement (Fig 2d) with an integrated Jsc of 17.4 mA cm2 under AM1.5G spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the efficiency measured at the maximum power point

continuous illumination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the JV and EQE measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The device without PCBM layer generally shows a lower Voc, Jsc and FF with pronounced JV hysteresis, and the steady-state efficiency lies between forward and backward efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The integrated Jsc of 12.1 mA cm2 is also lower than that derived from the JV measurement.

tails allow to estimate a minority carrier lifetime of 80 ns (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it can be seen that the addition of PCBM leads to a nonlinear initial PL transient, which can be explained by charge-separating fields45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the application of PCBM promotes a working junction without the need of initial biasing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the elimination of JV hysteresis and enhanced photovoltaic performance primarily stem from improved interface and junction formation and from the high-quality perovskite layer with enhanced crystallinity, uniform and compact morphology with large grain size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Semi-transparent planar perovskite solar cells', 'For semi-transparent cells, the opaque Au is substituted by In2O3:H transparent electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In2O3:H is a high-mobility TCO material with superior visible and NIR transmittance46, and excellent thermal and chemical stability for solar cell applications were reported47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deposition of In2O3:H by sputtering at room temperature without post-annealing results in layers with reasonably high mobility of 51.3 cm2 V1 s1 and sheet

'The degree of ion bombardment is more severe during the deposition of ZnO:Al than that in In2O3:H due to the different sputter geometries, lower total pressure and shorter target-to-substrate

with direct deposition of TCO on top of the hole transporting layer (HTL) as back electrode without buffer layer, indicating that direct sputtered TCO might allow to achieve high-efficiency if the ion

lowering the parasitic absorption of semi-transparent perovskite solar cell in NIR region if front FTO is replaced by high-mobility In2O3:H.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In conclusion, a low-temperature-processed high-efficiency semi-transparent planar perovskite solar cell without JV hysteresis is developed by using sputtered hydrogenated indium oxide (In2O3:H) as transparent rear electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high-temperature-processed (500 °C) TiO2 is replaced by room-temperature-sputtered ZnO, and the perovskite is prepared by a combined thermal evaporation of PbI2 and spin coating of CH3NH3I followed by 2-h annealing at 50 °C, thus making the maximum processing temperature as low as 50 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hybrid thermal evaporationspin coating method enables the introduction of PCBM in regular device configuration, which results in a high-quality perovskite layer and better electron collection, thus leads to a 14.5% hysteresis-free planar perovskite solar cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-mobility In2O3:H is employed as transparent rear electrode deposited by sputtering at room temperature, which enables a semi-transparent planar perovskite solar cell with high steady-state efficiency of 14.2% and simultaneous 72% average transmission between 800 and 1,150 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we show a 13.5% output power enhancement when the semi-transparent cell functioned as bifacial solar cell and demonstrate 20.5% efficiency device with perovskite top cell and CIGS bottom cell in four-terminal tandem configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work has significant beneficial implications in lightweight tandem solar cells, bifacial solar cell, photon energy upconversion, photovoltaic-integrated buildings and wearable/portable electronics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
