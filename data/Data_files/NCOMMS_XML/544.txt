Surpassing the no-cloning limit with a heralded hybrid linear amplifier for coherent states  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The no-cloning theorem states that an unknown quantum state cannot be cloned exactly and deterministically due to the linearity of quantum mechanics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Associated with this theorem is the quantitative no-cloning limit that sets an upper bound to the quality of the generated clones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this limit can be circumvented by abandoning determinism and using probabilistic methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report an experimental demonstration of probabilistic cloning of arbitrary coherent states that clearly surpasses the no-cloning limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our scheme is based on a hybrid linear amplifier that combines an ideal deterministic linear amplifier with a heralded measurement-based noiseless amplifier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate the production of up to five clones with the fidelity of each clone clearly exceeding the corresponding no-cloning limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, since successful cloning events are heralded, our scheme has the potential to be adopted in quantum repeater, teleportation and computing applications.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The impossibility to perfectly duplicate an unknown quantum state deterministically, known as the no-cloning theorem1, lies at the heart of quantum information theory and guarantees the security of quantum cryptography2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This no-go theorem, however, does not rule out the possibility of imperfect cloning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The idea of generating approximate copies of an arbitrary quantum state was conceived by Buzek and Hillery in their seminal work4 with the proposal of universal quantum cloning machine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discovery has since sparked intense research in both discrete5,6,7,8 and continuous variable9,10,11,12,13 systems to explore the fundamental limit of cloning fidelity allowed by quantum mechanics, known as the no-cloning limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several quantum cloning experiments approaching the optimal fidelity enforced by this limit have since been demonstrated for single photons14, polarization states15 and coherent states16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By forgoing determinism, perfect cloning is not entirely forbidden by the law of quantum physics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, if the quantum states to be cloned are chosen from a discrete, linearly independent set, then the unitarity of quantum evolution does allow probabilistic exact cloning17,18,19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Non-deterministic high-fidelity cloning of linearly dependent input states can also be performed if the cloning operation is only arbitrarily close to the ideal case20,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, the invention of probabilistic noiseless linear amplifier (NLA)23, and its subsequent theoretical studies24,25,26,27,28 and implementations29,30,31,32,33 in principle provided a method for cloning arbitrary distributions of coherent states with high-fidelity via an amplify-and-split approach29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In practice, however, implementing NLA for coherent states with amplitude ||1 remains a technical challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because the resources required scales exponentially with the coherent state size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this article, we follow a different path by adopting a method that interpolates between exact-probabilistic and approximate-deterministic cloning34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that a hybrid linear amplifier, comprising of a probabilistic NLA and an optimal deterministic linear amplifier (DLA)16,35, followed by an N-port beam splitter is an effective quantum cloner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously, MÃ¼ller et al.36 demonstrated probabilistic cloning of coherent states which outperformed the best deterministic scheme for input alphabet with random phases but fixed mean photon number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we propose a high-fidelity heralded cloning for arbitrary distributions of coherent states and experimentally demonstrate the production of N clones with fidelity that surpasses the Gaussian no-cloning limit FN=N/(2N1)12,13.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

noise level is 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the probabilistic amplification incurs no noise at all, the variance is a function of gDLA only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such set-up can be interpreted as two linear amplifiers with distinct features, complementing each other by sharing the burden of amplification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lower noise can be achieved at the expense of the probability of success by increasing the NLA gain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, a higher probability of success, although with an increased noise, can be obtained by increasing the DLA gain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, by tailoring both gains appropriately, one can achieve the desired cloning fidelity, with vanishing probability of success as the fidelity approaches unity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A key feature in our implementation is the observation that when the probabilistic gain is less than the deterministic gain, gNLA less_than gDLA, the hybrid amplifier can be translated to a linear optical setup35 with an embedded measurement-based NLA (MBNLA) (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This equivalence is illustrated in Fig 2, and discussed in more detail in Supplementary Note 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MBNLA is the post-selective version of the physical realization of NLA that has been proposed37,38, and experimentally demonstrated recently39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with its physical counterpart, MBNLA offers the ease of implementation and avoids the predicament of demanding experimental resources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By deploying MBNLA as the heralding function in a feed-forward control set-up40, HCM preserves the

the input state is a priori unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, owing to the phase-sensitive dual-homodyne measurement and coherent feed-forward control in DLA27,42, the state to be cloned is amplified

coherent input states with different complex amplitudes , where (x, p)=(0.71, 0.72), (0.01, 1.51), (2.23, 2.19) and (5.26, 0.02).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The figure of merit we use is the fidelity F=|i|, which quantifies the overlap between the input state  and the i-th clone i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a setting of Ts0.6, our device clones the four input states with average fidelities of 0.695Â±0.001, 0.676Â±0.005, 0.697Â±0.001 and 0.681Â±0.007, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the experimental fidelities are significantly higher than that of a classical measure-and-prepare (M&P) cloner (FM&P=0.5), where the clones are prepared from a dual-homodyne measurement of an input state43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, all the clones also surpass the no-cloning limit of F2=2/3, which is impossible even with a perfect deterministic cloning machine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To further analyse the HCM, we examine the cloning of an input state (x, p)=(2.23, 2.19) (||=1.56) in greater detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This experiment is repeated 5 Ã 107 times, from which about 5.9 Ã 105 runs produced successfully heralded clones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electronic gain gx,p and the splitting ratio of the beam splitter are carefully tuned to ensure that the two clones produced are nearly identical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probabilistic heralding function was chosen to ensure that the output clones have exactly unity gain on average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is done to prevent any overestimation of the fidelity (Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As can be seen in Fig 3c, the produced clones have noise significantly lower than the M&P cloning protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the noise variance is only affected by the deterministic amplification, setting gNLA greater than 1 will reduce the required DLA gain, while still achieving unity gain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the clones produced by our HCM will have less noise compared with its deterministic counterpart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data points also show that the heralded events (purple region of Fig 3c right) have Gaussian distributions with mean equal to that of the input state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We experimentally obtained a fidelity of 0.698Â±0.002 and 0.697Â±0.002 for the two clones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fidelity plot in Fig 3d clearly demonstrates that the fidelities of both clones exceed not only the M&P limit but also lie beyond the no-cloning limit by more than 15 s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Multiple clones', 'We operate our HCM at higher gains to enable the production of more than two clones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To have gNLA greater than 1, from equations (1) and (2), we require gDLA less_than , which leads to Ts greater than 1/N.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, by tailoring Ts for each N, HCM can produce N clones with fidelity beating the deterministic bound FN with the desired probability of success.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 4a shows the fidelity of the multiple clones with an input of ||0.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average fidelities of the clones for N=2, 3, 4 and 5 are 0.695Â±0.002, 0.634Â±0.012, 0.600Â±0.009 and 0.618Â±0.007, respectively, clearly surpassing the corresponding no-cloning limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 4b, we plot the theoretical prediction of the fidelity as a function of the probability of success with the experimental data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The theoretical fidelity is modelled on the dual-homodyne detection efficiency of 90Â±5%, which is the main source of imperfection (see Supplementary Note 3 for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that our results lie well within the expected fidelities, with the probability of success ranging between 5 and 15%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, by keeping 5% of the data points, the average cloning fidelity for N=5 can be enhanced by  greater than 15%, and hence exceeding the no-cloning limit F5 by 11.2%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Multiple clones with hybrid cloning machine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Fidelity of N

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In summary, we have proposed and demonstrated a hybrid cloning machine that combines a deterministic and a probabilistic amplifier to clone unknown coherent states with fidelity beyond the no-cloning limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although an ideal NLA implementation is not possible with our set-up, as this would require zero deterministic gain, our hybrid approach does allow the integration of measurement-based NLA in the optimal deterministic amplifier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed that our device is capable of high-fidelity cloning of large coherent states and generation of multiple clones beyond the no-cloning limit, limited only by the amount of data collected and the desired probability of success.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our cloner, while only working probabilistically, provides a clear heralding signal for all successful cloning events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Several comments on the prospects and avenues for future work are in order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An immediate extension is the implementation of HCM in various feed-forward based cloning protocols, such as phase conjugate cloning44, cloning of Gaussian states45,46, telecloning47 and cloning with prior information36,48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our tunable probabilistic cloner could further elucidate fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics and quantum measurement, for instance, quantum deleting50 and quantum state identification34,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This probabilistic coherent protocol might also play a role in the security analysis of eavesdropping attacks in continuous variable quantum cryptography as well52,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The implication of HCM in the context of quantum information distributor54 and quantum computation55 also demands further investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Beyond probabilistic cloning, owing to the robustness and ease of implementation of this heralded hybrid amplification, we envisage numerous applications in quantum communication39,56,57, quantum teleportation40,58,59 and quantum error correction60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, we believe our scheme will be a useful tool in the quest to realize large-scale quantum networks.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
