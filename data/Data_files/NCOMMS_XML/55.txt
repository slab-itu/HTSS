Activation and lysis of human CD4 cells latently infected with HIV-1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The treatment of AIDS with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) remains lifelong largely because the virus persists in latent reservoirs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elimination of latently infected cells could therefore reduce treatment duration and facilitate immune reconstitution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report an approach to reduce the viral reservoir by activating dormant viral gene expression and directing T lymphocytes to lyse previously latent, HIV-1-infected cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An immunomodulatory protein was created that combines the specificity of a HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibody with that of an antibody to the CD3 component of the T-cell receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD3 engagement by the protein can stimulate T-cell activation that induces proviral gene expression in latently infected T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It further stimulates CD8 T-cell effector function and redirects T cells to lyse these previously latent-infected cells through recognition of newly expressed Env.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This immunomodulatory protein could potentially help to eliminate latently infected cells and deplete the viral reservoir in HIV-1-infected individuals.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The persistence of latently infected cells during long-term combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in HIV-1-infected individuals represents a significant hurdle towards a functional cure for HIV-1 (refs 1, 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation and elimination of the latently infected cells in HIV-1 infection has therefore become a major goal of HIV research3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A variety of strategies aim to activate HIV gene expression in latently infected cells, which then might be eliminated by antiviral drugs or the immune system (reviewed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial use of anti-CD3 and interleukin (IL)-2 treatment to purge the latent HIV-1 reservoir in patients on therapy led to deleterious effects on the immune system and also failed to eliminate the latently infected cells5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, the use of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) inhibitors to target latent HIV-1 infection stimulated reactivation of latently infected cells in HIV-1-infected patients; however, the effect in clearing the latent reservoir was modest6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apart from the HDAC1 inhibitors, other molecules such as bryostatin, a protein kinase C activator, and disulfiram have also been shown to activate latent HIV-1 expression7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although HIV-1 preferentially infects actively replicating cells, it can also infect quiescent cells such as resting CD4+ T cells at lower frequencies9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Latent HIV-1 infection of resting memory CD4+ T cells is established when activated CD4+ T cells return to a quiescent state or through infection of quiescent T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Since most antiretroviral drugs target viral proteins involved in the viral replication cycle, they are unable to eliminate quiescent cells that harbour proviral DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During therapy, active viral replication is potently limited by these drugs; however, on treatment interruption, active viral replication resumes in most cases11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, infected individuals must undergo lifelong therapy to limit HIV replication and improve their prognosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the benefits of cART, treated patients have increased risk for the development of drug-induced diseases including cardiovascular, metabolic and bone disorders12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, there remains a high prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders in the cART era14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, eliminating the latently infected cells in HIV-1-infected individuals would limit the dependence on cART drugs for treating HIV-1 infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Bispecific antibodies have been designed to redirect T cells for targeting multiple tumours and viral infections15,16,17,18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While there has been encouraging progress in cancer immunotherapy21, progress in eliminating HIV-1 infection has been limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of efficacy in previous studies was likely because of the use of soluble CD4 as a ligand, which binds with low affinity compared with the aggregated receptors that engage in the immune synapse formed during infection, or the use of anti-HIV-1 antibodies with restricted strain specificity16,17,19, that is, previous bispecific proteins had neither the specificity nor activation potential required to activate and redirect T-cell killing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, combination monoclonal antibody therapy has shown promise in suppressing viral infection in animal models22,23; however, it does not provide a mechanism for activating infected T cells from latency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of an anti-HIV-1/CD3-bispecific protein to activate and redirect T cells to lyse latently infected T cells provides an immunotherapy that may help to reduce the levels of latently infected cells in HIV-1-infected subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we have developed a novel immunomodulatory protein by combining the broad recognition of HIV-1 Env (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24) with binding to a T-cell activation glycoprotein, CD3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This immunomodulatory protein was able to both activate CD4+ T cells latently infected with HIV-1 and also redirect CD8+ T cells to lyse these infected cells through recognition of HIV-1 Env expressed on these previously latent cells.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Production and characterization of immunomodulatory proteins', 'We developed a single immunomodulatory protein by generating a dual specificity antibody that could both activate CD4 cells latently infected with HIV-1 and also facilitate their lysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first specificity was directed to the conserved CD4-binding site of HIV-1 Env while the second recognized the CD3 antigen25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A bispecific protein was prepared by linking a humanized scFv directed to CD3 to the COOH terminus of the light chain of the Fab region of VRC07 containing a highly active previously described mutation (G54W)26 (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The immunomodulatory protein, VRC07-CD3, was purified using size exclusion chromatography and showed the expected monomeric molecular weights and composition (Fig 1a, bottom and right, Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Bispecific immunomodulatory protein binds the CD4-binding site (CD4bs) of HIV Env and CD3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

T cells and any protein bound to the T cells was detected with flow cytometry after dual staining with fluorescently labelled anti-human Fab and HIV-1 Env (RSC3) probes.Full size image', 'Three additional controls were generated that yielded fusion proteins with either specificity alone or a double-negative mutant control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These controls were synthesized either by replacing the VRC07 Fab with an irrelevant control Fab that did not recognize HIV-1 Env, or by substituting the anti-human CD3 scFv with a scFv to rhesus CD3 that did not react with human CD3, or both (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The VRC07-CD3 protein demonstrated the expected ability to bind HIV-1 Env (Supplementary Fig 2) and neutralize HIV-1 (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also showed the predicted pattern of binding to CD3 on human T cells and HIV Env on HIV-1-infected CEM-NKr-CCR5 cells using flow cytometry (Fig 1b, red curve in both panels).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relevant negative control antibodies also displayed the expected non-reactivity with HIV-1 Env and CD3, respectively, using flow cytometry (Fig 1b, blue versus green versus pink curves in both panels).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed concurrent binding using flow cytometry of the VRC07-CD3 protein to an HIV-1 Env probe, a resurfaced stabilized HIV core protein, RSC3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27), when it was bound to naive human T cells through anti-CD3 that was not observed with the relevant single or double mutant control proteins (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Neutralization IC50 titres (g ml1) for the indicated

whether these immunomodulatory proteins could stimulate the appropriate activation response in T cells after exposure to HIV-1, we analysed the response of human CD4 and CD8 cells in the presence or absence of HIV-1 Env with the VRC07-CD3 protein and each of the specificity controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of HIV-1, CD4 T cells showed a ninefold increase in interferon (IFN)- intracellular cytokine staining compared with 1.4-fold in the absence of HIV-1 relative to unstimulated CD4 T cells (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the fusion proteins that reacted with either CD3 or Env alone, or the double-negative control, showed minimal effects (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examination of the CD8 response revealed a similar trend in IFN- intracellular cytokine staining, with a higher percentage of reactive cells in this population (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other control proteins that reacted with Env alone or the double-negative control that was not reactive with CD3 or Env also produced minimal activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, VRC07-CD3 stimulated a dose-dependent increase in CD69 expression in CD4 T cells from three different donors in the presence but not the absence of Env (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, a control fusion protein that reacted with CD3 alone showed minimal stimulation (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examination of the CD8 response revealed a similar pattern of stimulation, with a higher percentage of reactive cells in this population (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar trends were observed for the cytokines IFN- and tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-, both in CD4 and CD8 T cells (Supplementary Figs 3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These analyses document that stimulation by VRC07-CD3 is antigen-specific, and it causes minimal antigen-independent immune stimulation in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Activation of T cells by an immunomodulatory protein targeting the CD4bs of HIV Env and CD3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a)

examined several constitutive or latent yet inducible T leukaemia cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used CEM-NKr-CCR5 cells chronically infected with HIV-1 IIIb (CEM-IIIb) or latently infected derivatives of ACH2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28), Jurkat (J1.1)29 and OM10 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30) cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CEM-IIIb cells show constitutive expression of HIV-1 Env, in contrast to the three latently infected cell lines that show no detectable expression of HIV-1 Env in the absence of TNF- (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When CD8 cells from uninfected donors were incubated with CEM-IIIb cells, they readily lysed the infected target cells in the presence of the VRC07-CD3 protein that was not seen with the monospecific or double-negative controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, all of the latently HIV-1-infected cell lines, grown in the absence of TNF-, were lysed in a dose-dependent manner by naive donor CD8 cells in the presence of the dual specificity protein but not with the control proteins (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings show that engagement of both targets of VRC07-CD3 are required to stimulate T-cell cytolysis of target cells latently infected with HIV-1.

cell surface using an allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated 2G12 was measured using flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in the expression of HIV Env indicates the inducible expression in the

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Here a highly potent broadly neutralizing antibody was linked to an activating anti-human CD3 antibody so that both activities were retained and synergistic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach is designed to utilize the CD3-signalling component of the bispecific protein to stimulate Env gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By coupling it directly to the VRC07 antibody arm, it allows more efficient recognition and lysis of cells that express low levels of Env.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such levels of HIV Env are not readily quantitated, and there is evidence that low levels of replication occur even during ART31,32,33,34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific physiologic stimulation of HIV gene expression further potentiates activation and expression of Env for T-cell-mediated lysis by this immunomodulatory protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since there may be cells expressing Env in HIV-infected subjects, these cells likely provide a nidus for attachment of this immmunomodulatory protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once attached, it provides a cell surface that can crosslink CD3 and stimulate signalling that further enhances Env expression, further stimulating the process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of Env, this activity is minimized because the CD3 arm is a monomer and less readily triggers T-cell activation; hence the selectivity, although some levels of nonspecific T-cell activation because of monovalent CD3 engagement or nonspecific binding of the bispecific protein to cells cannot be excluded, consistent with the T-cell effects observed in non-human primate (NHP) studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that both effects are seen in vivo, and together they may in fact provide a greater effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While this therapy can be evaluated in animal models, such as bone marrow-liver-thymus (BLT)-humanized mice, this model is limited in its ability to evaluate the treatment of HIV latency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, engrafted T cells are exposed continuously to xenogeneic mouse antigens never encountered in humans, which leads to a state of chronic hyperstimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the antigen specificity/repertoire of engrafted human T cells differs from those educated completely in a human.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the interactions of HIV-1 with different cell types are confounded in chimeric mice in which there is variability in levels of engraftment and the relative proportion of human and murine cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, these mouse models are unreliable and potentially misleading with respect to human HIV-1 latency, and further studies in humans will be required to test the proof of concept of this approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Safety concerns may be better addressed in NHPs, and preliminary evaluations reported here suggest that this treatment is well tolerated and does not increase viral replication in the presence of ARVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further clinical studies will be required to evaluate its efficacy in humans and its potential to reduce proviral DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that VRC07-CD3 be administered to patients with concomitant ART to inhibit new cycles of infection, while it both activates and eliminates the latently infected cells of the reservoir.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Having documented the potential of this approach, it is likely that the efficacy of these proteins can be improved, either by addition of specificities directed to other highly conserved Env domains24, modulating CD3 affinity25, or including a third specificity directed to T-cell co-stimulatory molecules such as PD-1, CD28 or CD137 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HDAC inhibitors have also shown promise in activating HIV-1 from latency6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bispecific activating and targeting proteins could potentially be used in combination with such drugs to better activate and eliminate such infected cells in reservoirs of latent infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach can therefore contribute to the challenging goal of functional eradication of latent HIV reservoirs that might ameliorate the need for lifelong ARV therapy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
