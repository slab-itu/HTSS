ZBTB7A mutations in acute myeloid leukaemia with t(8;21) translocation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The t(8;21) translocation is one of the most frequent cytogenetic abnormalities in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and results in the RUNX1/RUNX1T1 rearrangement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the causative role of the RUNX1/RUNX1T1 fusion gene in leukaemia initiation, additional genetic lesions are required for disease development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we identify recurring ZBTB7A mutations in 23% (13/56) of AML t(8;21) patients, including missense and truncating mutations resulting in alteration or loss of the C-terminal zinc-finger domain of ZBTB7A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transcription factor ZBTB7A is important for haematopoietic lineage fate decisions and for regulation of glycolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On a functional level, we show that ZBTB7A mutations disrupt the transcriptional repressor potential and the anti-proliferative effect of ZBTB7A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specific association of ZBTB7A mutations with t(8;21) rearranged AML points towards leukaemogenic cooperativity between mutant ZBTB7A and the RUNX1/RUNX1T1 fusion.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Block of myeloid differentiation is one of the hallmarks of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First insights into this key mechanism were gained by the discovery of the t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocation, which was the first balanced translocation described in a tumour and results in the RUNX1/RUNX1T1 fusion gene (also known as AML1/ETO)1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RUNX1/RUNX1T1 rearrangement is one of the most frequent chromosomal aberrations in AML and defines an important clinical entity with favourable prognosis according to the World Health Organization classification3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RUNX1/RUNX1T1 fusion protein disrupts the core-binding factor complex, and thereby blocks myeloid differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in vivo models indicate the requirement of additional lesions, such as of KIT or FLT3 mutations, for leukaemogenesis as the RUNX1/RUNX1T1 fusion gene alone is not sufficient to induce leukaemia4,5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we set out to identify additional mutations in AML t(8;21) and discovered frequent mutations of ZBTB7Aencoding a transcription factor important for the regulation of haematopoietic development9 and tumour metabolism10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is very likely that ZBTB7A mutations are one of the important missing links in RUNX1/RUNX1T1-driven leukaemogenesis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'ZBTB7A is frequently mutated in AML t(8;21)', 'To identify additional cooperating mutations, we performed exome sequencing of matched diagnostic and remission samples from two AML patients with t(8;21) translocation and detected 11 and 12 somatic variants, respectively (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZBTB7A was the only mutated gene identified in both patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZBTB7A (also known as LRF, Pokemon and FBI-1) is a member of the POZ/BTB and Krüppel (POK) transcription factor family9, which is characterized by an N-terminal POZ/BTB proteinprotein interaction domain and C-terminal C2H2 zinc fingers11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first patient carried a homozygous missense mutation resulting in the amino-acid change R402H (NM_015898:exon2:c.1205G greater than A:p.R402H) affecting the highly conserved zinc-finger domain, while a heterozygous frameshift insertion (NM_015898:exon2:c.522dupC:p.A175fs) resulting in loss of the zinc-finger domain was identified in the second patient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both mutations were validated by Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Fig 1; Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using targeted amplicon sequencing of ZBTB7A and 45 leukaemia relevant genes, we screened 56 diagnostic AML t(8;21) samples, including one of the two samples analysed by exome sequencing (UPN 1), whereas for the other one (UPN 2) availability of material was insufficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZBTB7A mutations were identified in 13 of 56 patients (23%; Fig 1a,b; Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patient characteristics are summarized in Supplementary Table 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two recurring mutational hotspots (A175fs and R402) in exon 2 were identified altering or resulting in loss of the zinc-finger domain (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was previously shown that the zinc-finger domain of ZBTB7A is essential for DNA binding12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural modelling revealed that arginine 402 binds into the major groove of the DNA double helix and likely contributes to the affinity or sequence specificity of the DNA interaction of the zinc-finger domain of ZBTB7A (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed that both ZBTB7A mutants A175fs and R402H fail to bind DNA (Fig 2b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: ZBTB7A mutations in AML t(8;21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) ZBTB7A protein (NP_056982.1) and identified mutations (red=truncating;

6%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This lower mutation frequency might be due to the lower sensitivity of Sanger sequencing and incomplete coverage of the coding exons of ZBTB7A (we were not able to reliably amplify exon 3 encoding amino acids 422584).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the consequences of truncating ZBTB7A mutations on the protein level, we performed western blot analysis for one patient with available material and detected a shorter form of the ZBTB7A protein resulting from the R377X mutation (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recently, frequent ASXL2 mutations were identified in t(8;21) AML13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our cohort, ZBTB7A and ASXL2 mutations occurred at similar frequencies (Fig 1b) and 5 of 13 patients carried mutations in both genes;

Supplementary Fig 7), suggesting a relevance in AML beyond the t(8;21) subgroup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The favourable prognostic impact of high ZBTB7A transcript levels was most obvious in elderly patients (age  greater than 60 years) and high ZBTB7A expression was associated with a low molecular risk genotype (mutated NPM1 without FLT3-ITD;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In summary, we have identified ZBTB7A as one of the most frequently mutated genes in t(8;21)-positive AML.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our findings, ZBTB7A mutations in 3 of 20 (15%) AML t(8;21) patients and 1 of 395 AML inv(16) patients were reported18 during the revision of the present manuscript.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our functional analyses indicate that ZBTB7A mutations result in loss of function, due to alteration or loss of the zinc-finger motives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond DNA binding, the zinc-finger domain of ZBTB7A is also known to interact with TP53 and BCL6 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, multiple pathways might be influenced by alteration or loss of the ZBTB7A zinc-finger domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The N-terminal missense mutations in the BTB domain may result in failure of co-repressor recruitment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that 4 of 13 of patients had more than one ZBTB7A mutation, our finding that overexpression of wild-type ZBTB7A leads to reduced proliferation of Kasumi-1 cells and a decreased number of CFCs of murine bone marrow cells, we suggest that ZBTB7A acts as a tumour suppressor in t(8;21)-positive AML.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial studies characterized ZBTB7A as proto-oncogene in various tissues14,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Maeda et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  demonstrated that transgenic mice with Zbtb7a overexpression in the immature T- and B-lymphoid lineage develop precursor T-cell lymphoma/leukaemia14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, it was more recently shown that ZBTB7A can also act as a tumour suppressor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of Zbtb7a in murine prostate epithelium did not result in neoplastic transformation; unexpectedly, Zbtb7a inactivation lead to the acceleration of Pten-driven prostate tumorigenesis20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, somatic zinc-finger mutations of ZBTB7A were found at low frequencies ( less_than 5%) in a variety of solid cancers suggesting a common mechanism across tumour entities21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the de-repression of glycolytic genes upon deletion or mutation of ZBTB7A10,21 might underlie the loss of anti-proliferative properties that we observed for ZBTB7A mutants A175fs and R402C in the present study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any inactivating alteration of ZBTB7A will likely increase glycolysis, and, thus, helps the tumour cells to produce more energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides tumour metabolism, it is known that ZBTB7A also plays an important role in haematopoietic lineage fate decisions9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During lymphopoiesis ZBTB7A regulates B-cell development22, whereas in the myeloid lineage it is essential for erythroid differentiation23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, ZBTB7A mutations may contribute to the block of differentiation in AML t(8;21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The favourable prognostic relevance of high ZBTB7A expression in CN-AML, which accounts for half of all AML patients, may point towards a more general tumour suppressor role of ZBTB7A in myeloid leukaemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the anti-proliferative properties of ZBTB7A may slow down disease progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High ZBTB7A expression as a favourable prognostic marker has been reported also in colorectal cancer10, consistent with a clinicobiological role of ZBTB7A across malignancies of multiple tissue origins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that somatic mutations of ZBTB7A seem to be absent or rare in CN-AML, other mechanisms, including epigenetic changes or alterations of upstream regulators, may lead to inactivation or downregulation of ZBTB7A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our discovery of frequent ZBTB7A mutations in AML with t(8;21) translocation, one of the most common translocations in AML and the first balanced translocation identified in leukaemia1, demonstrates that the mutational landscape of AML is still not fully understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies will be required to unravel the mechanism underlying leukaemogenic cooperativity between mutated ZBTB7A and the RUNX1/RUNX1T1 fusion gene.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
