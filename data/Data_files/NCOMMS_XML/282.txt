Catch-bond mechanism of the bacterial adhesin FimH  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Ligandreceptor interactions that are reinforced by mechanical stress, so-called catch-bonds, play a major role in cellcell adhesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They critically contribute to widespread urinary tract infections by pathogenic Escherichia coli strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These pathogens attach to host epithelia via the adhesin FimH, a two-domain protein at the tip of type I pili recognizing terminal mannoses on epithelial glycoproteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we establish peptide-complemented FimH as a model system for fimbrial FimH function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reveal a three-state mechanism of FimH catch-bond formation based on crystal structures of all states, kinetic analysis of ligand interaction and molecular dynamics simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of tensile force, the FimH pilin domain allosterically accelerates spontaneous ligand dissociation from the FimH lectin domain by 100,000-fold, resulting in weak affinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Separation of the FimH domains under stress abolishes allosteric interplay and increases the affinity of the lectin domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell tracking demonstrates that rapid ligand dissociation from FimH supports motility of piliated E. coli on mannosylated surfaces in the absence of shear force.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cellcell adhesion often occurs under dynamically varying conditions and mechanical stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In many cellcell adhesion systems, the lifetime of adhesinreceptor complexes is increased under tensile mechanical force via catch-bonds, which permit capture or retention of cells under flow conditions while still allowing for release under reduced mechanical force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Catch-bond interactions are prominent in vascular systems and are formed, for example, by selectins for leukocyte recruitment1,2, by cadherins controlling tissue integrity3,4 in the epithelial adhesion of cancer cells5 and by the interactions between T-cell receptors (TCRs) and peptide-bound major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) on antigen-presenting cells6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Catch-bonds also play a major role in bacterial adhesion and infection by uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains, which are responsible for the vast majority of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in humans8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A first critical step in the establishment of infection is bacterial adhesion to urothelial cells under flow conditions, which is mediated by 0.12 m long, proteinaceous filaments on the bacterial surface termed type 1 pili9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Type 1 pili are composed of up to 3,000 copies of the subunit FimA building the pilus rod, as well as the subunits FimF, FimG and FimH forming the distal tip fibrillum11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The adhesin FimH at the fimbrial tip specifically binds in a catch-bond mode12 to terminal -D-linked mannoses of N-linked glycans of the receptor uroplakin 1a on urinary epithelial cells13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to its important role in establishing infection, FimH is an attractive target for the development of anti-adhesive drugs for UTI treatment14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'FimH is a two-domain protein, composed of an N-terminal, mannoside-binding lectin domain (FimHL) and a C-terminal pilin domain (FimHP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FimHP possesses an incomplete immunoglobulin-like fold that is completed by insertion of an N-terminal donor strand of FimG, the subsequent subunit in pilus assembly11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two-domain architecture of FimH is a prerequisite for catch-bond formation because the interactions between FimHL and FimHP determine the conformational state and ligand-binding properties of FimHL (refs 12, 16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A compressed FimHL conformation was observed in the crystal structure of FimH in the context of the type 1 pilus tip fibrillum in the absence of ligands, with an open binding site and interactions to FimHP mediated via three loop segments: the swing (amino acids (aa.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2733), linker (aa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  154160) and insertion loops (aa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  112118)17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, an extended FimHL conformation was observed in crystal structures of the isolated, ligand-bound FimHL domain18,19,20,21,22,23 and in the complex between FimH and the pilus assembly chaperone FimC, where FimC prevents the interactions between FimHL and FimHP (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This extended form of FimHL is characterized by a closed ligand-binding pocket and rearranged swing, linker and insertion loops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Notably, isolated FimHL was reported to show a ligand-binding affinity about two orders of magnitude higher than that of full-length FimH in the tip fibrillum17,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with mutagenesis experiments disrupting the interdomain interface26, these data indicated that ligand-binding is linked to domain separation in FimH, and that mechanical force shifts the ligand-binding affinity towards that of the isolated FimHL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, fundamental aspects of the mechanism underlying the force-dependent binding of FimH remained unknown: (i) How is domain-associated, full-length FimH interacting with ligands?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) Does ligand-binding directly induce domain separation?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iii) How are interdomain interactions linked to the ligand-binding affinity of FimH and the kinetics of ligand-binding and dissociation?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To address these questions, we designed a stable, soluble variant of full-length FimH that is equivalent in its structural and functional properties to those of FimH in the assembled fimbrial tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This variant allowed us to obtain high-resolution structural snapshots of all functional states of FimH and to obtain a complete characterization of ligand-binding kinetics in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with molecular dynamics simulations, these data reveal a three-state mechanism of FimH catch-bond formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FimHP accelerates ligand release from FimHL via dynamic allostery by 100,000-fold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, using single-cell tracking experiments, we show that the modulation of ligand affinity by FimHP is not only required for adhesion under mechanical stress, but also for efficient bacterial surface motility in the absence of shear force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results provide a first complete structural and kinetic description of a catch-bond system and establish a framework for the analysis of the distinct catch-bond mechanisms in other systems, which also commonly couple interdomain interactions to ligand affinity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The characterization of full-length FimH had so far been restricted to the analysis of the adhesive properties of piliated E. coli cells and binding studies with the purified type 1 pilus tip fibrillum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the FimH·DsG complex, we have now established a model system for quantitative studies of the interaction of FimH with carbohydrate ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soluble FimH·DsG efficiently mimicks FimH in the context of the assembled tip fibrillum, is readily available in milligram quantities and permits the determination of ligand-binding and release kinetics in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using FimH·DsG, we obtained high-resolution snapshots of three functionally relevant states of FimH (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of ligands, FimH adopts the Afree state with associated FimHL and FimHP and an open conformation of the ligand-binding site, which is responsible for the 30-fold faster ligand-binding of full-length FimH as compared with the isolated FimHL domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ligand-binding in the absence of shear force induces the Abound state with a closed binding site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to earlier hypotheses17, the transition from Afree to Abound is restricted to the ligand-binding site, while all interactions between FimHL and FimHP observed in the Afree state remain preserved in Abound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AfreeAbound transition most likely follows an induced fit mechanism, in which the formation of an encounter complex between FimH·DsG and HM is rate-limiting and followed by a fast, unimolecular rearrangement to the Abound state, in agreement with the observation that binding of the model ligand HM remained rate-limiting for the formation of Abound even at the highest HM concentrations used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stopped-flow-binding kinetics indicate that the lifetime of the proposed encounter complex before Abound formation is below 1 ms (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under tensile mechanical force applied to the FimHligand complex, mimicked here by the destabilized variant FimH·DsF and crystal packing forces, the domain-separated state of FimH, Sbound, is formed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Sbound state, FimHL and FimHP no longer interact specifically and are only connected via the linker segment comprising FimH residues 154160.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this Sbound state, FimHL adopts a conformation closely resembling isolated FimHL with bound ligand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: Catch-bond mechanism of FimH-mediated cell adhesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) In the absence of tensile mechanical force, formation of the FimH-Uroplakin 1a (UPIa) complex comprises the highly dynamic transition of the Afree to the Abound state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction likely proceeds via a transient encounter complex (indicated in square brackets).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction of the encounter complex to Abound is not rate-limiting and must have a half-life of less than 1 ms. Dissociation of the receptor from the FimH lectin domain in the Abound state is promoted via dynamic allostery by the pilin domain that acts as a negative allosteric regulator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction from Abound to the encounter complex corresponds to koff.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fast binding and release of UPIa by FimH enables bacterial motility on the bladder epithelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Shear force increases the population of the Sbound state of FimH, in which the pilin and lectin domains are separated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dissociation of Sbound under shear force is slowed down up to 100,000-fold compared with Abound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The indicated rate constants and half-lives correspond to the interaction between FimHF18 and the model ligand HM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rate limiting reactions are indicated by solid arrows, and fast, non-limiting reactions by dashed arrows.Full size image', 'Notably, ligand dissociation from FimH·DsG is 100,000-fold faster than that from the isolated FimHL domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is striking because the respective crystal structures revealed indistinguishable ligand interactions and binding-site conformations in the FimH·DsG·HM and FimHL·HM complexes (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MD simulations identified a considerable increase in the conformational dynamics of the FimHLligand-enclosing clamp loop in the Abound state as the most likely cause of the dramatic increase in koff in the FimH·DsG·HM complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The altered dynamics in FimHL in the Abound state are the result of the presence of FimHP, which can be described as a negative allosteric regulator36,37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The allosteric communication from the FimHPFimHL interface to the ligand-binding site reaches over 40 Å, and is mediated via changes in protein dynamics rather than in static structure, in line with a general model of dynamic allostery39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data demonstrate that the interdomain interactions in FimH (i) maintain the open conformation of the binding pocket and guarantee rapid ligand-binding and (ii) intramolecularly catalyse ligand dissociation by more than 100,000-fold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rapid ligand-binding and short lifetimes of the FimH ligand complex allow for rapid dissociation of individual pili from their ligands in the absence of shear force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our biophysical data demonstrate that this mechanism is conserved between the K12 and the F18 E. coli strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Different mechanistic models, such as the two-pathway41, the deformation42 and the sliding re-binding model43, have been developed to describe catch-bond interactions, often based on powerful single-molecule atomic force measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These models included the principle of allosteric control of ligand-binding affinity26,31, which was clearly fully confirmed in our present study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these conceptual models did not reveal the underlying atomic-scale mechanisms in different catch-bond systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For most catch-bond systems, including the cadherincatenin binding to actin filaments3,44, integrin epithelial cell adhesion45,46 and TCRMHC interactions6,7,47, structural information is, if at all, available only for one state or from computer simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One exception is the selectins, which employ catch-bond binding for leukocyte recruitment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selectins are multidomain cell surface receptors, which consist of a lectin domain for complex carbohydrate binding, linked via an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain to a variable number of short consensus repeat domains and a transmembrane-anchoring helix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selectins exist in two conformations, a bent and an extended one, which differ in the angle between their lectin and EGF-like domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ligand-binding and conformational changes in the ligand-binding site are directly linked via a complex allosteric coupling mechanism to the adoption of the extended conformation48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tensile mechanical force under flow conditions acts along the axis of the ligand-binding site and the Lec-EGF interface resulting in a stabilization of the extended conformation and thus increased ligand complex lifetimes2,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in FimH, catch-bond behaviour is mediated by the interplay of a lectin and an anchoring domain that does not interact with the ligand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ligand-binding by FimH in the absence of shear force results in a closing of the ligand-binding site, but, in contrast to selectins, is not directly linked to altered interdomain interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here mechanical force promotes domain separation and completely releases FimHL from FimHP, which acts as an activator of ligand release via dynamic allostery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, selectins and the fimbrial adhesin FimH thus employ entirely different mechanisms for establishing catch-bond behaviour by crosstalk between a lectin and an anchoring domain that provides tethering to a shaft.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both systems, the selectins and fimbrial adhesion, the shaft structures linking the terminal lectin/coupling domains to the cell surface, may contribute to the overall catch-bond behaviour, either via directly influencing coupling domain behaviour or via their general elastic properties50,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The cell-tracking experiments indicate the importance of rapid ligand release from the high-mannose-type glycoprotein receptor uroplakin 1a in the lower urinary tract52 for flagellar motility of piliated bacteria, and hence their ability to colonize new tissue areas under certain conditions during infection12,29,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provides a plausible explanation for the fact that low-affinity FimH variants were preserved in numerous uropathogenic E. coli strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding of terminal mannoses with low affinity in the absence of shear force may also play a role in preventing the clearance of uropathogenic E. coli from the urinary tract by competitive binding to the TammHorsfall protein in the urine54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In turn, populating the Sbound state with an extremely low dissociation rate ensures tight bacterial adhesion under the mechanical forces of urine excretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FimH is a promising target for anti-adhesive therapy of UTI because FimH antagonists, in contrast to antibiotics, are not exerting selection pressure towards resistance formation18,55,56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous ligand-binding studies on the isolated FimHL domain mimic the domain-separated Sbound state of FimH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This state is characterized by extremely low off-rates and is promoted in vivo only after ligand-binding and the onset of flow conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our kinetic data on ligand dissociation from full-length FimH demonstrate that rapid, competitive displacement of FimH from its carbohydrate ligands by FimH antagonists is well possible in the absence of shear force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, full-length FimH (for example, in the form of the FimH·DsG complex established in this study) instead of the isolated FimHL domain is the relevant target for the development of anti-adhesive drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the concept of the FimH·DsG model system can now be expanded to other related adhesive pilus adhesins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In combination with the novel fluorescent GN-FP-4 ligand, this model system paves the way for efficient screening for anti-adhesive drug candidates.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
