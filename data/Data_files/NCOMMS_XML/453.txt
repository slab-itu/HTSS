Disruption of Kcc2-dependent inhibition of olfactory bulb output neurons suggests its importance in odour discrimination  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Synaptic inhibition in the olfactory bulb (OB), the first relay station of olfactory information, is believed to be important for odour discrimination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We interfered with GABAergic inhibition of mitral and tufted cells (M/T cells), the principal neurons of the OB, by disrupting their potassium-chloride cotransporter 2 (Kcc2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Roughly, 70% of mice died around 3 weeks, but surviving mice appeared normal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these mice, the resulting increase in the intracellular Cl concentration nearly abolished GABA-induced hyperpolarization of mitral cells (MCs) and unexpectedly increased the number of perisomatic synapses on MCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo analysis of odorant-induced OB electrical activity revealed increased M/T cell firing rate, altered phasing of action potentials in the breath cycle and disrupted separation of odour-induced M/T cell activity patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice also demonstrated a severely impaired ability to discriminate chemically similar odorants or odorant mixtures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work suggests that precisely tuned GABAergic inhibition onto M/T cells is crucial for M/T cell spike pattern separation needed to distinguish closely similar odours.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Discrimination between different, often very similar odorants does not only involve a very large diversity of olfactory receptors in the nose, but also requires precise neuronal processing in the olfactory bulb (OB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OB is the first relay station of olfactory information in the central nervous system where odour-specific excitatory input from olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) is received by glutamatergic mitral and tufted cells (M/T cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These projection neurons relay the odour information to the olfactory cortices and other areas like the amygdala.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M/T cells are extensively controlled by inhibitory input from three major subtypes of GABAergic interneurons, granule cells (GCs) and periglomerular cells1, as well as parvalbumin positive interneurons2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These interneurons form predominantly dendro-dendritic reciprocal as well as axo-dendritic synapses with M/T cells and mediate lateral and recurrent inhibition onto or between M/T cells2,4,5,6,7, which is important for correct processing and perception of odour information8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Processing of olfactory information within the OB involves spatial and temporal coding11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spatial coding is mediated by the distinct glomerular activity patterns elicited by odour-specific input from the OSNs to single glomeruli of the OB12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temporal coding provides further levels of odour processing and discrimination, especially if the glomerular activity pattern for two odours is largely overlapping like with structurally similar odorants15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temporal component involves synchronously spiking mitral cells (MCs), reflected by -frequency oscillations10,18,19, as well as separation of M/T cell activity pattern over time20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both types of coding depend on GABAergic inhibition4,10,21,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, discrimination of similar odours or of odour mixtures seems to be influenced by the strength of inhibitory input from GCs, the predominant interneuron type in the OB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conclusion was supported by experiments that changed GC activity with genetic, pharmacological or optogenetic tools8,9,10,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, changing the electrical excitability of GCs by disrupting specific glutamate receptor subunits with Cre-recombinase encoding viruses influenced the time needed for odour discrimination without affecting discrimination accuracy8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mature central nervous system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It activates GABAA receptor anion channels that, depending on the electrochemical Cl gradient, typically hyperpolarize the postsynaptic membrane or shunt excitatory currents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The appropriate low cytoplasmic Cl concentration is created by Kcc2 (potassium-chloride cotransporter 2), the main chloride extruder in mature neurons25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown or deletion of Kcc2 leads to an elevated intracellular chloride concentration (Cli) and decreases GABAergic driving force25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on the brain region, Kcc2 may be expressed in rodents already at birth or is upregulated during the first postnatal weeks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to its transport function, Kcc2 may also have morphogenic effects28,29,30,31 on spine morphogenesis30,32, synapse formation33,34 and proper localization of glutamatergic AMPA receptors28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the present study, we disrupted Kcc2 within the murine OB specifically in M/T cells, the main projecting neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to other studies, which used viral transfection or injection of drugs into the OB, we targeted almost completely synaptic inhibition of M/T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This led to a reduced GABAergic hyperpolarization of MCs and, surprisingly, also to changes in synaptic connections at their somata.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that these changes in the olfactory circuitry led to increased M/T cell firing rate and to deficits in M/T cell activity pattern separation in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes were associated with a severely impaired ability of these mice to discriminate closely similar odours and odour mixtures.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'M/T cell deletion of potassium-chloride cotransporter 2', 'Kcc2lox/lox mice, in which exons 25 are flanked by loxP sites27, were crossed with Pcdh21::Cre mice to obtain Kcc2lox/lox;Pcdh21::Cre mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Pcdh21 promotor was reported to drive Cre expression specifically in M/T cells of the OB35 and also in restricted parts of the cerebellum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We verified this expression pattern with R26R and Z/AP reporter mouse strains that express the LacZ gene and alkaline phosphatase, respectively, only in cells that produce the Cre recombinase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although crosses with reporter mice revealed Pcdh21-driven Cre activity in the granular layer of the anterior part of the cerebellum (Supplementary Fig 1a, b), immunolabelling for Kcc2 did not show a pronounced difference in Kcc2 protein expression between cerebella of control and Kcc2lox/lox;Pcdh21::Cre mice (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, specific deletion of Kcc2 in cerebellar GCs could be clearly visualized in a previous study27 that used 6::Cre mice for GC-specific Kcc2 disruption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This comparison suggests that compared with 6-driven Cre expression, Pcdh21-driven Cre expression does not only occur in a smaller region of the cerebellum, but is also weaker in the anterior region where both promoters are active.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As even 6-driven deletion of Kcc2 from virtually all cerebellar GCs resulted specifically in the impairment of consolidation of vestibulo-ocular learning without detectable effects on motor performance27, it is unlikely that a potential cerebellar deletion of Kcc2 will affect conclusions of the present study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected from the reporter stainings, Kcc2 protein expression appeared unchanged in the hippocampus and the piriform cortex between the genotypes (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Intense immunolabelling of Kcc2 in the external plexiform layer (EPL) and the glomerular layer (GL) of the OB indicated that Kcc2 is mainly localized to the lateral dendrites, dendritic tufts and to a lesser extent to the somata of MCs as seen by a lower signal intensity in the mitral cell layer (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar subcellular distribution with stronger Kcc2 expression in the dendritic compartment than at somata has been described previously in other neurons36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Kcc2lox/lox;Pcdh21::Cre mice (subsequently called MC-Kcc2 mice), Kcc2 was almost completely absent from the EPL (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining, less pronounced Kcc2 labelling in the MC-Kcc2 GL might originate from juxtaglomerular cells surrounding the glomeruli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kcc2 mRNA can be detected in MCs as early as E15 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kcc2 may be sufficiently active in lowering intracellular Cl concentration at P1 as GABA is able to inhibit action potential firing in MCs at that age39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Pcdh21 promotor begins to drive Cre expression only postnatally, with robust expression from P14 onwards40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, residual levels of the Kcc2 protein could be observed in the EPL of 1-week-old and 2-week-old MC-Kcc2 mice (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 5-week-old and older MC-Kcc2 mice, the EPL almost completely lacked Kcc2 expression compared with control mice (Kcc2lox/lox; Fig 1 and Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About 70% of MC-Kcc2 mice died spontaneously at an age of around 3 weeks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, mice surviving beyond that age had a normal life expectancy and displayed no obvious phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reason for this increased lethality could not be clarified but may be related to spurious Cre expression in those mice that die early.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used mice at P30 and older for all following experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Cell-type specific deletion of  greater than Kcc2 greater than  in mitral/tufted cells within the main OB.Immunofluorescent staining of Kcc2 (green) and mitral cell marker reelin (red) of coronal sections of the main OB from 5-week-old MC-Kcc2 mice compared with Kcc2lox/lox littermates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 30 m.

MC-Kcc2: 65.6±1.4 mV, n=6 cells; Fig 2ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A qualitatively similar, but smaller shift (11 mV) was observed when EGABA was calculated from voltage clamp experiments by applying muscimol at different voltage steps (Kcc2lox/lox: 80.2±2.15 mV, n=16 cells; MC-Kcc2: 69.7±0.84 mV, n=16 cells; Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in the values for EGABA obtained with these different methods might be explained by a slight inaccuracy of the offline access resistance correction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In MCs the bulk of Kcc2 is located to dendrites that display low electrical accessibility when cells are patch-clamped at their somata.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence the shift in EGABA might even be more pronounced in their dendritic compartments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When MCs were held at their resting membrane potential (RMP) in the current clamp mode (I=0), application of muscimol markedly hyperpolarized control MCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a hyperpolarization was strongly reduced or absent in MCs of MC-Kcc2 mice (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RMP of MCs did not differ between genotypes (Kcc2lox/lox: 65.06±0.62 mV, n=8 cells;

 #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the preferred phase of Kcc2lox/lox M/T cells drifted during the odour epoch compared with baseline, the preferred phase of M/T cells from MC-Kcc2 mice was much less affected by the odour stimulation (Fig 5df).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we observed a reduced odour-evoked change of phase by a distribution of delta phase (baselineodour) skewed towards 0 degree for the negative values (Fig 5f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the preferred phase for each odorant was significantly (KolmogorovSmirnoff test P=0.0046) less distributed over the sniff and tended to be drifted towards later phase (Fig 5f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, the Kcc2lox/lox M/T cells spread their phase-related activity throughout the breathing period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, phase-related activity of M/T cells from MC-Kcc2 mice remained centred around the middle part of the sniff (180°), similarly to the baseline period (Fig 5e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentage of odours that evoked a significant rate change for each MC was also reduced in the MC-Kcc2 mice (Fig 5h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the percentage of excited and inhibited cells was also significantly reduced for nine odours

compared the duration of the three first sniffs in the odour epoch, and their respective pre-odorant period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MC-Kcc2 mice had more stereotyped breathing patterns since they were displaying less fast sniffing both during baseline and odour periods (Supplementary Fig 8ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference might reflect an altered olfactory perception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that the difference of breathing patterns cannot simply explain the differences of phasing observed between Kcc2lox/lox and MC-Kcc2 mice (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed no significant difference was observed when comparing the sniff-related preferred phase of cells in Kcc2lox/lox mice for fast ( less_than 250 ms) and slow ( greater than 250 ms) sniffs (Supplementary Fig 8d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, the observed fast sniffing in Kcc2lox/lox may be in part due to the novelty effect when a new odorant is presented to the mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the odour-epoch sniffs of the first three trials are faster than the last six, in contrast to the MC-Kcc2 mice (Supplementary Fig 8e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite that, cells recorded in Kcc2lox/lox mice still do not display sniff phase preferences (Supplementary Fig 8f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, the differences of sniff duration cannot explain the phase changes observed between the two genotypes.

different odorants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We computed the activity rate of all single M/T cells in a population vector and calculated the Pearsons correlation between vectors of activity evoked by different

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We investigated the impact of GABAergic inhibition of M/T cells, a crucial relay station in the OB, on the local circuitry involved in the processing of olfactory information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modulation of M/T cells by inhibitory inputs is thought to refine the spatial representation of odours and thereby provide contrast enhancement of sensory information4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GABAergic inhibition in the OB also controls temporal coding of odour information by regulating the synchronization and activity pattern separation of simultaneously spiking M/T cells20,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, regulation of GABAergic input to M/T cells plays a role for odour discrimination in mice8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous studies addressing the role of GABAergic inhibition in the OB with mouse models mainly approached the question by modulating the activity of GCs, the predominant GABAergic interneurons of the OB8,9,10, or by a combination of genetic manipulations using viral transfection and pharmacological manipulations, procedures that did not target all MCs or affected GABAA receptors of other neurons as well9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, we globally decreased synaptic inhibition of the principal cells of the OB by increasing intracellular Cl concentration in virtually all MCs by deletion of Kcc2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aside from decrease in GABAergic hyperpolarization, we found an effect on the subcellular distribution of GABAergic inputs with a higher number of reciprocal synapses contacting the perisomatic region of MCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes in GABAergic inhibition led to an increased M/T cell firing rate and an impaired diversity of phased activity, and resulted in a lack of odour-evoked pattern separation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike the more subtle phenotype of other mouse models targeting inhibition in the OB8,9,10, MC-Kcc2 mice showed severely impaired ability to distinguish structurally closely related odorants or different odorant mixtures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe that the global decrease of M/T cell inhibition in our mice importantly contributes to the stronger effect on olfactory learning tasks when compared with other mouse models8,9,10,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Rather than completely abolishing GABAergic synaptic inhibition by disruption of postsynaptic GABAA receptors, we chose to reduce the strength of inhibition by disrupting the neuronal Cl extruder Kcc2 within the OB specifically in M/T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kcc2 was almost completely deleted from M/T cells in mice older than P30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since Kcc2 disruption in cerebellar Purkinje and GCs elicits only a weak vestibulo-ocular learning phenotype27, we expect that the additional partial disruption in the cerebellum which we observed only in a small subset of GCs of MC-Kcc2 mice does not influence our results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using sensitive reporter mice, we could not detect Pcdh21-driven Cre-recombinase activity in brain regions other than the OB and the cerebellum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Obviously, however, it is impossible to completely rule out the possibility that we missed spurious Cre-recombinase expression in a few neurons or small nuclei that might contribute to the observed high lethality of MC-Kcc2 mice at an earlier age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that MC-Kcc2 mice performed indistinguishably from WT mice in relatively easy olfactory learning tasks aimed at distinguishing, for example, ethyl valerate from ethyl tiglate (Fig 7a) or octanal from hexanal (Fig 7b), demonstrated that these mice have no general defect in, for example, thirst, motor control and learning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, any hypothetical influence in our mice from non-OB brain neurons should specifically affect the distinction between closely similar odours, or decisions based on such distinctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In principle, such an influence appears possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OB receives input not only from olfactory epithelia, but also numerous centrifugal fibres from different brain areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include feedback loops involving olfactory cortex neurons (from the anterior olfactory nucleus and the piriform cortex), which directly excite OB GCs, or result in feedforward inhibition of GCs through interposed short axon cells, or can, to some extent, also excite MCs47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is also input from neurons in the basal forebrain (horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca (HDB) and magnocellular preoptic area (MCPO)), which includes both cholinergic and GABAergic fibres24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nunez-Parra et al.24 have also selectively silenced GABAergic neurons of the HDB/MCPO with inhibitory chemogenetic tools and observed a selective deficit in discrimination of closely related odours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Speculating further, there might be, for example, a change in neuronal circuits setting a threshold for the decision to lick.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as we did not observe Cre expression in brain areas of MC-Kcc2 mice other than the OB and restricted parts of the cerebellum, and since similar, but weaker effects were observed by others when interfering in different, and often less complete ways with M/T cell inhibition, the most straightforward interpretation of our data is that the inability to distinguish closely similar odours results solely, or very predominantly, from reduced inhibition of M/T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As observed in other neurons25,27, deletion of Kcc2 significantly increased Cli in MCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the pronounced reduction of the hyperpolarizing GABA response indicated a severely reduced synaptic inhibition of MCs, GABA-mediated inhibition may be partially preserved by a weaker shunting effect49,50,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The shunting inhibition of MC-Kcc2 MCs may be enhanced by the increased number of inhibitory synapses on their somata where they more efficiently modulate MC excitability than at dendritic sites52,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the increase in somatic GABA receptors may influence somatic chloride concentration and hence the driving force for GABAergic currents during sufficiently high neuronal activity or in the presence of tonic GABA54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The unchanged interevent intervals of mIPSCs in MC-Kcc2 MCs argue against a significant overall increase in synapse number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the large number of synapses on lateral dendrites, the increased number of perisomatic synapses appears small.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the larger proportion of somatic synapses, which are electrically better accessible in our patch-clamp experiments, may explain the increased proportion of large-amplitude mIPSCs in MC-Kcc2 MCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Several studies suggested an ion transport-independent role of Kcc2 on spine maturation30,32, synapse formation33,34 and receptor localization in synaptic spines28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect, which is probably mediated by Kcc2 binding to the cytoskeleton-associated protein 4.1 (refs 28, 29, 30), is not seen universally as no changes in synapse density or morphology were found on Kcc2 deletion in cerebellar Purkinje and GCs27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We do not know whether a loss of Kcc2/cytoskeleton interactions contributes to the observed shift of synapses to the perisomatic region of MC-Kcc2 MCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shift may represent a homoeostatic mechanism that partially compensates for the decreased inhibition of MCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with other brain regions, OB circuits may adapt more easily because of a constant stream of neuronal progenitors from the subventricular zone to the OB where these cells differentiate to interneurons and replace existing ones throughout life55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, in a mechanism called synaptic scaling, neurons can maintain a specific level of network activity by adjusting the density and strength of individual synapses56,57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the density of perisomatic synapses on mitral cells was previously found to be reduced on sensory deprivation58, suggesting a change in the density of perisomatic synapses as a more general mechanism in the regulation of MC excitability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In accordance with reduced GABAergic inhibition, MC-Kcc2 M/T cells displayed an overall increased firing rate, either during baseline or odour-evoked activity (for the entire odour set tested).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the larger number of perisomatic synapses, which are expected to be inhibitory mostly by shunting59, cannot compensate for the reduction or loss of hyperpolarizing GABAergic currents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Population rate activity was unchanged between baseline and odour presentation in both genotypes as reported previously for awake mice43,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More interestingly, MC-Kcc2 M/T cells displayed a more phased activity compared with controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this overall increased phased activity, and although MC-Kcc2 M/T cells were able to change their spike timing distribution through the sniff period (Fig 5h), the preferred phase remained much more similar before and during the course of odour presentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reduced the diversity of the M/T cell response of MC-Kcc2 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Hence, synaptic inhibition of M/T cells is essential to maintain a multiplexed coding strategy based on rate and phase shift60,61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The impaired inhibition resulted in a poor diversity of neuronal activity and led to a depleted odour-specific pattern generation as shown by the increased overall correlation between odorants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The representation of each odorant in the odour coding space resembled each other, leading to an increased mismatch of prediction when using a simple classification algorithm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results emphasize the importance of an optimal pattern separation20 and more importantly, the role of GABAergic inhibition for sculpting odour-evoked patterns of activity, as previously suggested in vitro21,62,63 and in vivo22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'MC-Kcc2 mice could still smell and reliably distinguish structurally dissimilar odorants, but had severe difficulties in discriminating chemically similar odours or odour mixtures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, mice whose GC excitability was changed by virus-mediated excision of specific glutamate receptor subunits, could still discriminate between similar odours8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, an increase or decrease of interneuron excitability correlated with an increased or decreased speed, respectively, of odour discrimination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In another study9 injection of low doses of the GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin into the OB decreased, but did not abolish the ability of mice to discriminate enantiomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this pharmacological manipulation does not completely target MCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Global deletion of the 3-subunit of the GABAA receptor, which specifically disrupts GABAA receptors in OB GCs because these cells lack other -subunits, entailed complex changes in olfactory experiments10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While all three mouse studies suggest a role of GABAergic inhibition of M/T cells in the discrimination of similar odours, our mice, in which we have globally targeted the inhibition of M/T cells, display the strongest effect on odour discrimination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Temporal coding involves synchronization of simultaneously active M/T cells on one hand and pattern decorrelation of M/T cells over time on the other hand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pattern separation is involved in the processing and discrimination of similar odours22,63,64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GABAergic inhibition plays a fundamental role in this process as shown in studies from zebrafish and in experiments in acute OB slices of mice20,21,63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As recently described22, our results confirm that a proper pattern separation helps mice to discriminate between odorants under normal conditions (Kcc2lox/lox mice).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For some odour pairs, the reduced pattern decorrelation does not predict a reduction of discrimination learning in the MC-Kcc2 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, EV60/ET40 and ET60/EV40 are not discriminated by MC-Kcc2 mice while their amount of pattern correlation is not the highest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One reason might be our small-cell sampling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, it may not reflect the complete cell population recruited to encode a particular odorant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another reason might be related to small differences in odour composition due to differences in olfactometers used during recording and behavioural experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite that, our results support the idea that the generation of a proper temporal activity pattern is crucial to build a correct olfactory representation of similar odours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recent experimental work and models reported that GL GABAergic interneurons modulate mitral cells phasing over the sniff (theta oscillation)65,66, while few or no effect of GCs has been observed on such slow oscillation but rather on gamma synchrony66.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these observations are mainly based on anaesthetised preparations, in which M/T cells activity switches from a natural phasic temporal regime to a more artificial tonic rate regime43,45,67.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, distribution of GC phasic activity across the sniff time course is also strongly depleted68, which probably does not reflect a physiological firing regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, GCs in awake mice display a much broader odour-evoked tuning likely helping to improve the diversity of MC responses over the sniff time course.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has been confirmed by recent work showing that GCs play a crucial role in enhancing M/T cells diversity of response and further driving similar odorant discrimination22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, our work suggests that proper odour discrimination needs correctly tuned GABAergic inputs onto M/T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decrease of GABAergic hyperpolarization, as observed in MCs of MC-Kcc2 mice, was associated with a strong impairment of discrimination between related odour pairs or odour mixtures, an effect that is very likely due to the observed deficits in pattern generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Somatic localization or strengthening of GABAergic synapses in mitral cells of MC-Kcc2 mice might partially compensate for the decrease in the driving force of the GABAergic currents by increased shunting inhibition at the soma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, this does not rescue the impairment in M/T cell pattern separation and odour discrimination.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
