Proliferation of Listeria monocytogenes L-form cells by formation of internal and external vesicles  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'L-forms are cell wall-deficient bacteria that divide through unusual mechanisms, involving dynamic perturbations of the cellular shape and generation of vesicles, independently of the cell-division protein FtsZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe FtsZ-independent mechanisms, involving internal and external vesicles, by which Listeria monocytogenes L-forms proliferate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using micromanipulation of single cells and vesicles, we show that small vesicles are formed by invagination within larger intracellular vesicles, receive cytoplasmic content, and represent viable progeny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the L-forms can reproduce by pearling, that is, generation of extracellular vesicles that remain transiently linked to their mother cell via elastic membranous tubes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using photobleaching and fluorescence recovery, we demonstrate cytoplasmic continuity and transfer through these membranous tubes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings indicate that L-forms polyploidy and extended interconnectivity through membranous tubes contribute to the generation of viable progeny independently of dedicated division machinery, and further support L-forms as models for studies of potential multiplication mechanisms of hypothetical primitive cells.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Bacteria are surrounded by a rigid cell wall that confers stability and defines the shape of the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite its pivotal role, bacteria are able to undergo a transition into a cell wall-deficient state, in which they adopt alternative lifestyles in order to survive and proliferate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These L-form bacteria were first discovered in 1935 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1), and have since been described for many Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generation of L-form bacteria is based on interference with peptidoglycan synthesis or integrity, followed by cultivation in osmotically adapted media2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The L-forms may assume a transient state (that is, reversion to the walled form is possible), or a stable state, in which they can be cultivated in absence of the inducing agent (without reversion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several mutations were reported to support L-form conversion3,4,5, and it was also shown that deleterious mutations may accumulate during the L-form state, possibly preventing subsequent regeneration of a mature cell wall6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cell division usually is a tightly regulated process orchestrated by highly dedicated machinery, which guarantees precise distribution of components essential for autonomous life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rod-shaped bacteria generally proliferate by binary fission, giving rise to two equal daughter cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tubulin homologue FtsZ represents a central player during this process and assembles a Z-ring at midcell, to which further division proteins are then recruited7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, L-form multiplication seems independent of FtsZ3,9 resulting in the evolution of various modes of proliferation, including binary fission, extrusion-resolution, blebbing, and extra- and intracellular budding10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phenotypically different mechanisms can be explained by (or are the result of) an apparently unorganized and non-orchestrated proliferation4,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased membrane synthesis and changes in the surface-to-volume ratio might be sufficient to drive enlargement and vesicular proliferation in absence of other components3,4,9,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apparent ability of L-forms to replicate without cell division machinery suggests L-forms as attractive model for top-down studies on the properties of hypothetical primitive cells10,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as an apparent consequence of uncoordinated proliferation and uneven distribution of essential elements such as a chromosome, ribosomes and a basic set of metabolic enzymes, only a fraction of L-form progeny seem to be viable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we study the different proliferation modes of a stable L-form of Listeria monocytogenes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Time-lapse imaging of growing cells reveals highly variable shape perturbations that result in FtsZ-independent generation of both intra- and extracellular daughter vesicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Micromanipulation for selective isolation of single cells and internal vesicles enables us to refine our previous hypothesis regarding viable reproduction units13,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, our findings indicate that primary internal vesicles (PIVs) within the L-form do not represent viable offspring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, the much smaller secondary internal vesicles (SIVs, formed inside the PIVs) are viable progeny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Newly formed L-forms in liquid culture remain transiently linked to each other, via filament-like tubular strands of lipid material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These strands show a high degree of mechanical flexibility and stability, mediate cytoplasmic continuity and allow transfer of cytoplasmic material between cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the highly polyploid nature of L-forms, and the transfer of essential molecules through membranous tubes, contribute to the generation of viable progeny in the absence of dedicated division machinery.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Listeria L-forms produce intra- and extracellular progeny', 'In earlier studies on proliferation13,15 and pathogenicity16 of L. monocytogenes L-forms, we used strains that were only able to grow in soft agar media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we employed a stable L-form derivative of L. monocytogenes strain EGDe able to grow in various media, including liquid culture, soft agar and agar plates17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate in more detail how these cells proliferate under different conditions, we established an L-form live cell imaging platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  L-forms grown in liquid culture were transferred into multi-well glass bottom dishes, carefully centrifuged and spun onto the glass layer, and overlaid with Listeria L-form medium (LLM) soft agar to minimize passive motility, that is, Brownian motion of the cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Employing a temperature-controlled incubation chamber assembled on the confocal microscope stage, L-form growth and multiplication was observed and recorded over extended time periods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, cell proliferation was found to be quite heterogeneous, and several distinct proliferation modes were observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a first step, the initially spherical L-form (mother or donor) cells adopted a more irregular shape, before they started to generate protrusions that eventually led to generation of new (daughter or recipient) cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These shape perturbations appeared to be membrane-synthesis dependent, and often resembled a budding-like process (Fig 1a, Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other instances, cells formed multiple evaginations that almost simultaneously pinched off, resulting in production of several progeny cells at once (Fig 1b, Supplementary Movie 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, newly formed extracellular vesicles (EVs) tended to remain connected to the mother cell by thin strands of presumably membrane-like material (Figs 1c,d and 5 and Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These strands often featured small EVs (a phenotype known as pearling10), which also represent potential progeny (Fig 1c, arrowhead).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the occurrence of such strands or similar structures had also been reported for L-forms of other genera, including Streptobacillus1 and Bacillus18, but their function remained unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Employing extended time-lapse microscopy of Listeria L-forms over periods of up to 10 h enabled us to monitor differentiation of the membrane strands into cell-like elements (Fig 1c, Supplementary Movie 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the strand-like morphology of L-form cells could also be observed by eye in liquid culture, where the visible growth frequently formed long, thread-like assemblies (Fig 1f, arrow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Larger, matured L-form cells often contained primary intracellular vesicles (PIVs, Fig 1e arrows), which can harbour one or more smaller secondary intracellular vesicles (SIVs, Fig 1e, arrowheads).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Appearance of the PIVs in phase contrast microscopy frequently appeared similar to the medium, suggesting that they may actually contain extracellular fluid (Fig 1e, arrow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the SIVs generally appeared much denser and similar to the cytoplasmic material of the mother cell, which suggested that they contain cytoplasm transferred from the mother cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although emergence of the PIVs and especially the SIVs was difficult to follow by time-lapse microscopy, it was evident that they were very small upon first appearance inside the cell, but subsequently increased in size along the growing mother cell (Supplementary Movie 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, there seems to be a limitation for L-form multiplication, that is, individual cells stopped producing new vesicles at some point, but continued to increase in size (including PIVs and SIVs) for several hours.

occurring during L-form proliferation appeared very heterogeneous and uncontrolled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, it was shown for L-forms of other genera that they can divide independent of FtsZ3,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we addressed the questions whether Listeria L-forms continue to employ the FtsZ-based cell division machinery used by normal rod-shaped walled cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we determined FtsZ localization employing a mutant strain featuring an ectopic ftsZ-gfp fusion expressed under control of an inducible promoter19 on a multicopy shuttle vector20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it is known that GFP tagged FtsZ might interfere with its function and ultimately the division process if the expression level is higher than 25% of the native FtsZ7, we observed a septal location of the protein, as reported previously21 (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if the somewhat irregular chain-forming phenotype of the cells was due to too high levels of the GFP fusion, we inserted the gene fusion into the single-copy integration vector pPL2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, mutant cells displayed correct localization of FtsZ, but without chain formation (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the L-form cells were transformed with these plasmids, we found no abnormal morphology irrespective of the expression levels of FtsZ-GFP, which suggested that FtsZ might have lost its function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, two distinct FtsZ-GFP localization patterns were observed in L-forms: in the majority of cells, FtsZ-GFP formed many short filaments which results in a spotty pattern throughout the cells (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some cases, however, long filaments were formed (Fig 2d) that spanned the entire cytoplasm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For better visibility, images are presented as 3D reconstruction of Z-stacks (Supplementary Movie 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We wanted to determine whether L-forms could multiply in absence of functional FtsZ, which organizes cell-division7, and used PC190723 as specific inhibitor23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The drug blocks the inherent GTPase activity of FtsZ, and stabilizes the otherwise highly dynamic FtsZ filaments in a dose-dependent manner24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell counts of walled Listeria cells cultivated in presence of the compound decreased drastically (Supplementary Fig 2a), whereas L-forms continued to grow at the same or even four-fold higher concentration of the drug (Supplementary Fig 2b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, the initially inhibited walled cells resumed growth after prolonged incubation periods, possibly due to degradation of the inhibitor (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In follow-up experiments, we used higher concentrations of PC190723 (16 g ml1 instead of 8 g ml1), and added the drug at 0, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h. As a result, walled cells suffered from a severe growth defect, whereas the L-forms continued to grow with and without repeated addition of the inhibitor, albeit at a slightly lower growth rate (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microscopical observations of walled cells revealed a filamentous morphology indicating absence of a functional Z-ring and lack of septum formation, whereas the morphology of L-forms cells did not reveal obvious changes (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to verify that PC190723 stabilizes FtsZ filaments in L-forms and thus inhibits its function, we studied its effect on FtsZ-GFP spatial distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In treated cells, the majority of FtsZ-GFP should appear in the polymerized form, which can be visually differentiated from monomeric FtsZ-GFP by stronger fluorescence based on close spatial accumulation in the filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we found that polymerized FtsZ-GFP dominated in L-forms grown in presence of the inhibitor, whereas the untreated cells showed a mixture of polymerized and free FtsZ-GFP (Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of the normalized histograms of ten cells grown in presence or absence of the inhibitor confirmed this observation (Supplementary Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these findings confirm that PC190723 acts on FtsZ present in both rod-shaped and L-form cells, and all evidence strongly suggests that functional FtsZ and its associated machinery is dispensable for proliferation of wall-deficient L-form cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Secondary internal vesicles represent viable progeny', 'As described above, within the relatively large PIVs, small SIVs were frequently observed, which seem to contain cytoplasmic material likely originating from the mother cell (Fig 1e, arrowheads).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, SIVs harbouring mother cell cytoplasm including essential components such as a chromosome, ribosomes and metabolic enzymes may be viable entities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we wanted to show intracellular transfer of cytoplasmic material into vesicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, L-form strains featuring cytoplasmic reporters were generated, employing a PEG-based plasmid transformation protocol25 adapted for L. monocytogenes L-form cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We created two different strains, expressing green (GFP) or red (RFP) fluorescent proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confocal fluorescence microscopy confirmed the presence of corresponding markers inside the SIVs (Fig 3a,b, arrowheads), and their absence in the larger primary vesicles (Fig 3a,b, arrows).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Staining of nucleic acids indicated the presence of chromosomal DNA within the smaller SIVs (Fig 3c, arrowhead), but not the larger PIVs (Fig 3c, arrow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, in some cases we observed SIVs which themselves seemed to contain even smaller tertiary internal vesicles (TIVs), but these were non-fluorescent (Fig 3b, asterisk).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TIVs likely also emerge from invagination of membrane into the SIVs, and therefore receive the non-fluorescent content from the PIVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation further supports our conclusion that the SIVs receive cytoplasmic content from the original L-form mother cell cytoplasm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although these results already suggested that SIVs actually represent viable reproduction units, the ultimate proof was to be able to independently culture isolated SIVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Towards this aim, micromanipulation was employed as a tool for isolation of SIVs directly from L-form cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test and demonstrate applicability of this approach, we adopted a microcapillary technique for isolation of single GFP or RFP expressing L-form cells from mixed culture of both strains, followed by transfer into fresh media and on agar plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inspection of colonies revealed pure communities of either GFP or RFP expressing cells (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a next step, single L-form cells (Fig 3e, arrow) containing larger SIVs (Fig 3e, arrowhead) were aspirated into the front end of a 6 m diameter glass capillary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, the internal vesicles were released into the capillary, by mechanical disruption of the mother cell membrane with the aid of a second 0.4 m diameter ultra-microcapillary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The liberated vesicles could then be transferred into fresh soft agar medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extended incubation for up to 16 days resulted in the appearance of L-form colonies (Fig 3e, red circle) in 27% (n=15) of the transfers (Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GFP fluorescence served as control for origin from the initial culture (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that the above-mentioned transfer of intact L-form cells also yielded colonies in only 38% (n=29) of the transfers (Fig 3f), which suggests a rather inefficient proliferation mode of L-forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As control, the cellular contents of L-forms apparently devoid of SIVs were also isolated and cultured in the same way.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that only 5% (n=20) of the transfers yielded viable L-forms (Fig 3f), and this was likely due to very small SIVs not recognized by microscopical screening and selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, the findings support that the secondary vesicles receive cytoplasmic content from the mother (donor) cells and represent viable reproduction units.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'L-form cells are highly polyploid', 'To properly quantitate L-form growth in liquid media, we employed three different methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to optical density measurement and CFU determination by plating, chromosome copies were determined in parallel using qPCR (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings confirmed previous results obtained for L-form growth on semi-solid media, that is, that L-form cells grew very slow and reach stationary phase after 2 days of incubation, and viable counts slowly decrease thereafter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, quantitative determination of chromosome copies revealed that genome replication ceased after reaching the stationary phase plateau.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, optical density continued to increase until day 7, and remained constant thereafter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding supports the observations from time lapse microscopy, that is, that mature L-forms continue to metabolize and increase in size, even though multiplication had stopped.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Taken together, the obvious discrepancy between viable counts and chromosome copies indicates the highly polyploid nature of these Listeria L-forms3,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average chromosome copy number for L-forms of L. monocytogenes strain ScottA was reported to be 18.0±3.6 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15), while the EGDe L-forms studied here contained approximately 34.5±5.8 chromosome copies per colony-forming unit (that is, viable cell), during exponential growth in liquid culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, considering that only approximately one-third of the L-form cells were able to form a colony (Fig 3f), the actual chromosome number per cell is much lower, corresponding to approximately 13 copies per cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In another approach to determine polyploidy of L-forms and to verify the results described above, we used the DNA intercalating dye Hoechst 33342 in L-form cells in combination with quantitation of the fluorescence signals (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The imaging analysis (described in Supplementary Fig 4) revealed an approximately ten-fold higher DNA content in growing L-forms compared to rod-shaped cells (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming an average of 1.5 chromosomes per rod, an L-form cell contains approx.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15 chromosome copies, which is within the same range as indicated by the other methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To provide even further support, multiple active chromosomal replication sites were observed in L-form cells grown in presence of the modified thymidine analogue EdU, followed by fluorescent labelling (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Lipidic filaments enable transfer of cytoplasmic material', 'During growth in liquid culture, multiplying L-form cells frequently appeared to remain connected to each other via thin filament-like strands, presumably consisting of membrane material (Fig 1c,d,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lipid-based nature of the strands was confirmed by staining with FM 464 dye (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hoechst 33342 staining revealed the presence of DNA in some of the strands (Supplementary Fig 5a), whereas others were devoid of any detectable DNA (Supplementary Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assumed that the filaments may break and release individual cells upon physical shear stresses such as mixing and swirling of the cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess rigidity of the lipidic strands, we exposed growing L-form cells to controlled shear stress, by immobilization in a miniaturized flow-cell chamber and application of defined flow rates of the medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 5b shows two L-form cells connected by a strand of approximately 0.3 m in length, at an initially low flow rate of 30 l min1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By increasing the flow rate to 960 l min1, this strand could be stretched to 28 m length (almost 100-fold) without rupturing it, and it reversed back to 2.2 m length after the flow rate was decreased again (Supplementary Movie 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation demonstrated the stability and flexibility of the connecting intercellular lipid filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We next determined whether the lipidic strands may possibly represent a connection channel between the cytoplasm of adjacent cells, and if cytoplasmic content could be transferred through the strands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a mechanism would have important implications for how progeny cells would receive essential components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microscopic examination of the connecting strands revealed that they are filled with cytoplasmic GFP originating from the L-form cells (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if an exchange of cytoplasmic material through these apparently tubular strands can occur between connected cells, we used Fluorescence Loss in Photobleaching (FLIP) experiments to follow the fate and replenishment of cytoplasmic GFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In case the cytoplasm of different cells would remain connected, the bleached (non-fluorescent) GFP within the treated cell could be substituted by intact GFP from the associated cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, fluorescence should recover in the bleached cell, and proportionally decrease in the connected cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, we first monitored fluorescence intensity in multiple cells within a colony, before and after bleaching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some cells showed partial fluorescence recovery, yielding first evidence that cytoplasmic exchange is possible in L-forms (for example, regions of interest (ROI) 10 in Fig 5d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, in a defined approach, single cells connected by strands were identified and specifically laser-bleached, while the fluorescence was continuously monitored in both cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some cases, recovery of fluorescence by transfer of GFP from a fluorescent cell into a bleached one was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 5fh, the fluorescence intensity of a bleached cell (ROI1) dropped by more than 80% after treatment, but started to recover immediately after bleaching stopped.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, fluorescence of the connected cell (ROI3) started to decrease, obviously due to the transfer of intact GFP molecules into the receiving cell and concomitant loss of its own cytoplasmic GFP pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a control, fluorescence intensity of a control cell (ROI2) did not change, demonstrating stability of the setup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another example of laser bleaching of one cell and subsequent concomitant loss of fluorescence in a connected cell is shown in Supplementary Movie 7 and

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Recent findings suggest that L-forms do not only differ morphologically from their walled counterparts, but may also feature changes on the genetic and molecular levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is especially evident with respect to cell division, which seems to be based mostly on biophysical processes4,9, and does not require certain cell division factors3,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'With the aim to better understand Listeria L-form proliferation independent of the classical cell division machinery (Fig 2), we employed various approaches to study the different, yet uncoordinated mechanisms used by these cell wall-deficient bacteria (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the unorganized and inefficient nature of L-form multiplication, it was not surprising to find that only approximately one third of the newly formed offspring cells were viable and able to form a colony (Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For internal vesicles, the ratio was even lower (Fig 3f), which could be explained by their small size and volume, which lowers the probability of acquiring a complete genome copy and all other essential cytoplasmic components during vesicle formation alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, our findings are consistent with the results from a study more than 40 years ago focusing on the viability of small internal granules in putative Streptococcus L-forms27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These L-forms featured far more granules inside their large bodies than CFU were produced following plating, indicating that not all granules were viable, which agrees very well with the findings reported here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In our study, live cell imaging of L. monocytogenes L-form growth in liquid culture revealed that new L-form cells remain connected to each other by ultrathin tubes or strands consisting of lipidic membrane material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that the high stability and extreme elasticity of the strands may be based on the physical properties of chromosomal DNA present inside the strands, which could potentially stabilize the structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we also observed strands without internal DNA (Supplementary Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, it has been shown that similar structures can be formed from artificial nucleic acid-free lipid vesicles28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, internal DNA might play a role in the high elasticity of the strands, but the formation of the strands does not require presence of internal DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The direct link between donor and recipient cells likely plays an important role in efficient L-form multiplication, since it allows the exchange of essential components between connected compartments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is possible that newly generated lipid vesicles can acquire essential components at a subsequent time point, as long as the cells remain connected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process most likely involves passive distribution of essential molecules into the newly formed vesicles, which should significantly enhance the ratio of viable L-form generation over non-viable membrane vesicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, entire chromosomes may possibly be too large for transmission through the small channels formed by the connecting strands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This disruption of the close link between genome replication and cellular division in regular cells results in an unusual accumulation of genetic material in the L-form cells3,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, genome distribution to newly produced vesicles may simply occur passively by chance; if this is so, then the fraction of viable cells may increase with the density of chromosomes in the mother cell cytoplasm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Uncoordinated multiplication of L-form bacteria has also been reported in other studies, which resulted in different, partially contradictory models for L-form proliferation, including binary fission, extrusion-resolution, extra- and intracellular budding10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These discrepancies may be due to various reasons, including the use of different organisms, growth media and induction protocols, and the very heterogeneous and variable properties of L-forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an example, the high degree of interconnectivity observed in strand-like growth of Listeria L-forms appears most pronounced during exponential growth, and declines with the age of the culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the number of L-forms containing intracellular vesicles (PIVs and SIVs) increases with the age of the culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, the data presented here demonstrate that two L-form proliferation mechanisms, that is, generation of external as well as internal progeny, can occur in the same bacterial strain (see model in Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two proliferation modes do not seem to be mutually exclusive, and may be affected by various culture conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Revised model of Listeria L-form proliferation mechanisms.As a prerequisite, only those cells receiving all essential cytoplasmic components, that is, chromosomes (purple dots), ribosomes, enzymes, may become viable progeny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initially round L-form cells (top left) may gradually transform into a more irregular shape, due to excess membrane lipid synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This results in numerous invaginations and evaginations that may eventually pinch off, resulting in EVs containing mother cell cytoplasm, or PIVs containing extracellular fluid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further evaginations into the PIVs generate SIVs (blue arrows), which directly receive mother cell cytoplasm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon burst of the mother cell, the SIVs are released.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, during growth in liquid media, mostly extracellular EVs are produced (red arrows), which appear transiently connected to the donor cell by thin strands of membrane material, which result in formation of string-like cell assemblies (pearling phenotype), which may still exchange cytoplasmic components.Full size image', 'Likely due to its relatively uncoordinated nature, the efficiency of progeny formation is much lower in L-forms compared to their walled counterparts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work we identified several characteristics that support L-form multiplication, such as the polyploidy and interconnectivity during growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, although the available evidence argues for it, it is still not clear whether L-form replication is an entirely passive process similar to what has been described for giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs30), or if energy-dependent cellular mechanism(s) may be involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of the features displayed by viable L-form cells resemble basic properties of abiotic, artificial lipid membrane vesicles10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In GUVs, a variety of proliferation modes similar to those observed for L-forms can be specifically triggered by variation of temperature31,32,33, pH34, osmolarity35, or exposure to detergents36 and other substances featuring extended hydrocarbon chains28,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar as for L-forms, the underlying mechanism that drives generation of new GUV progeny appears to be an increasing surface-to-volume ratio, which is less stable and thermodynamically unfavourable, and is immediately reduced following fragmentation into smaller vesicles38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for complete membrane fission to occur between connected lipid vesicles, a significant energy threshold needs to be overcome39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In absence of this, the process often results in generation of beads-on-a-string-like assemblies40,41,42, which resemble the structures described here (Figs 1c,d,f and 5ac and Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon exposure of growing Listeria L-form cultures to physical shear forces (such as vigorous swirling and shaking), the strands can break and individual cells are set free (data not shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, abiotic lipid vesicles can also be released by applying mild shear forces, whereby encapsulated RNA, representing a model for a primitive genome, is randomly distributed to the newly formed vesicles43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it was demonstrated that larger GUVs containing DNA can undergo spontaneous division upon exposure to membrane precursors, whereby the encapsulated DNA is also distributed into smaller progeny vesicles44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, self-reproducing GUVs containing higher concentrations of DNA featured an elevated frequency of spontaneous division, compared to GUVs comprising less or no DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these findings, it may be hypothesized that high density of chromosomal DNA in enlarged L-form cells may contribute to the initiation of membrane perturbations and shape changes resulting in distribution of one or more genome copies into newly formed vesicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Altogether, the fascinating analogies between reproductive mechanisms of viable L-form cells and abiotic giant lipid vesicles support the hypothesis that L-form replication relies on non-dedicated mechanisms, perhaps resembling a very primitive and simplified state of cell multiplication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  L-forms constitute a unique model for the study of potential mechanisms of growth and reproduction of hypothetical primordial cells10,14 in the absence of the highly complex set of structural elements employed by the current bacterial cell division machinery.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
