Direct PIP2 binding mediates stable oligomer formation of the serotonin transporter  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The human serotonin transporter (hSERT) mediates uptake of serotonin from the synaptic cleft and thereby terminates serotonergic signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously found by single-molecule microscopy that SERT forms stable higher-order oligomers of differing stoichiometry at the plasma membrane of living cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report that SERT oligomer assembly at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane follows a dynamic equilibration process, characterized by rapid exchange of subunits between different oligomers, and by a concentration dependence of the degree of oligomerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After trafficking to the plasma membrane, however, the SERT stoichiometry is fixed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stabilization of the oligomeric SERT complexes is mediated by the direct binding to phosphoinositide phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate (PIP2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed spatial decoupling of oligomer formation from the site of oligomer operation provides cells with the ability to define protein quaternary structures independent of protein density at the cell surface.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The human serotonin transporter (SERT) is a 12-pass transmembrane protein targeted to presynaptic nerve terminals and belongs to the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) or solute carrier 6 (SLC6) family1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These transmembrane proteins mediate the high-affinity uptake of neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft and are, hence, of pivotal importance for synaptic signal transmission by terminating chemical signal transduction between neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SERT is the target for antidepressants like serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors2 as well as for illicitly used drugs such as amphetamines3; the latter act by reversing the transport direction of SERT, provoking release of serotonin (5-HT) into the extracellular space4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Biochemical and spectroscopic studies have reported that SERT is present as oligomeric complexes at the plasma membrane5,6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, oligomerization of a number of other NSS family members has been described10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oligomeric state, however, does not seem to be crucial for uptake activity: for example, it was found that oligomerization-deficient mutants of the GABA transporter (GAT1) retain unchanged transport activity11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, two possible roles of NSS oligomerization are discussed: (i) oligomerization of correctly folded proteins is necessary to pass the quality control for trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)12, in the case of SERT specifically by allowing the interaction with SEC24C (refs 13, 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) It has been reported that oligomerization is a prerequisite for the reverse operation of the transporter which affords substrate release15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, we have previously discovered that SERT forms a broad distribution of assemblies ranging from monomers up to pentamers7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The homo-association at the plasma membrane did not depend on SERT surface density and was stable at least over 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We proposed a model based on kinetic trapping of oligomers at the plasma membrane, subsequent to an equilibration which occurred at an unknown subcellular organelle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The site of equilibration and the mechanism behind kinetic trapping, however, remained unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Some arguments pointed our interest to the negatively charged phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate (PIP2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PIP2 is part of a number of signalling pathways, for example, endo- and exocytosis, cell adhesion, cell motility, phagocytosis or G protein-coupled receptor signalling16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is a minor phospholipid that is mainly found at the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane, where it occurs at a surface density of about PIP 20,00060,000 molecules m2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pronounced differences exist in the subcellular localization of PIP2: PIP2 comprises about 1% of total lipid at the plasma membrane17, whereas only trace amounts of PIP2 are present at the ER18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PIP2 binding to transmembrane proteins is frequently observed, for example, for ion channels, where it regulates channel activity by influencing the open probability19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, we have recently found that the functional activity of SERT and the dopamine transporter (DAT) was influenced by PIP2 binding20,21: upon enzymatic depletion of PIP2 or mutation of identified PIP2 binding sites, amphetamine-induced substrate efflux was markedly reduced whereas uptake rates were essentially unaffected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, while the oligomeric configuration does not seem to influence neurotransmitter uptake11, amphetamine-induced neurotransmitter release has been shown to rely on the quaternary arrangement15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the present study, we quantify the degree of SERT oligomerization at different subcellular localizations of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and analyse the kinetics of protomer turnover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find evidence that SERT oligomers are pre-formed at the ER following a dynamic equilibrium model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the plasma membrane, kinetic trapping arrests the oligomers at the pre-set stoichiometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that the different subcellular concentrations of PIP2 mediate the differential SERT oligomerization behaviour, likely by direct physical connection of SERT protomers.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'SERT oligomerization depends on subcellular localization', 'First, we addressed if SERT oligomerization differs between the plasma membrane and the ER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monomeric GFP (mGFP) was inserted at the cytosolic N-terminus of SERT to allow for visualization (mGFPSERT)22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasma membrane-localized mGFPSERT was recorded at the bottom cell membrane via total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To retain SERT in the ER, we overexpressed a dominant-negative mutant of Sar1a (Sar1a-T39N)13, a small GTPase that regulates the assembly of COPII vesicles for plasma membrane trafficking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sar1a-T39N is a GDP-restricted mutant which prevents the formation of COPII in a dominant-negative manner, thereby arresting SERT in the ER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ER-retained mGFPSERT was studied at junctions between ER and the plasma membrane, where single-molecule tracking at high signal-to-noise ratio using TIRF microscopy is feasible23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We used the Thinning out clusters while conserving stoichiometry (TOCCSL) technique previously established in our lab7,25,26,27 to determine the oligomeric state of mGFPSERT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TOCCSL extends fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to the level of single-molecule fluorescence microscopy (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically, the high density of fluorescently labelled proteins results in a homogenously labelled surface, thereby precluding direct single-molecule measurements (Fig 1a,i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In TOCCSL, a small area of the cell membrane is irreversibly photobleached by a strong laser pulse focused through a rectangular pinhole onto the sample (Fig 1a,ii,iii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high laser intensity completely abrogates the fluorescence signal of the mGFPs in every SERT molecule within the illuminated area, while retaining full brightness outside this area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the subsequent recovery phase unbleached molecules and oligomers diffuse into the previously bleached area due to Brownian motion (Fig 1a,iv).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to FRAP experiments, however, we exploit in TOCCSL the very onset of this recovery process, when individual molecules can be monitored as single, clearly distinguishable fluorescent spots (Fig 1a,v).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The brightness of these spots was determined and compared with the brightness of single mGFPSERT molecules recorded under the same conditions and in the same subcellular compartments, yielding the statistical distribution of mGFPSERT oligomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that, similar to fluorescence correlation experiments, TOCCSL allows only analysis of the mobile fraction of molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Determination of mGFP-SERT oligomer sizes by single molecule brightness analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Thinning out clusters while conserving stoichiometry of labeling (TOCCSL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a field stop in the laser beam pathway, a small area of the densely fluorescently labelled cell membrane (i) is irreversibly photobleached (ii, iii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the recovery phase (iv), SERT oligomers diffuse back into the bleached area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the onset of this process, they can be discriminated as single, well separated fluorescent spots (v).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) The oligomeric state of SERT was evaluated in the plasma membrane (left panel) or the endoplasmic reticulum (right panel) by single-molecule brightness analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The brightness distributions (in counts) of mGFPSERT complexes are plotted as pdf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plots show the distribution of the complexes from the TOCCSL image after the recovery phase (black curves) and the measured brightness of a monomer (red curves); see also Supplementary Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A fit yields the distribution of oligomeric sizes at the respective organelle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars, 10 m.

0.05).Full size image', 'We used this experimental strategy to determine the mean aggregation size of mGFPSERT located at the plasma membrane (Fig 1b, left) or retained at the ER (Fig 1b, right) of CHO cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differences in the subcellular distributions are apparent in TIRF microscopy; while plasma membrane-localized SERT yields a homogenous intensity distribution over the whole interface of the cell with the glass slide (Fig 1b, left), we observed the characteristic reticular ERplasma membrane junctions upon Sar1a-T39N overexpression (Fig 1b, right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of the protein was freely mobile in both cellular compartments, yielding mobile fractions of 82±8% and 66±12% (s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ; n10 cells) for plasma membrane and for the ER in FRAP experiments, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We first confirmed our recent finding of SERT oligomerization at the plasma membrane: the left panel of Fig 1b shows the brightness distribution, plotted as a probability density function (pdf) obtained from the TOCCSL images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A large spread in the oligomer distribution was observed, and the mean oligomeric size did not depend on SERT surface density (Fig 1c, left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results were strikingly different, when we determined SERT oligomerization at the ER membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the overall oligomer distribution remained highly heterogeneous (Fig 1b, right), we found a pronounced increase of SERT oligomer size with increasing mean SERT density at the ER (Fig 1c, right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A second hallmark of dynamic size equilibration would be the exchange of subunits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To discriminate between stable association and rapid subunit exchange, we used the previously established method of repetitive TOCCSL runs7 (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed one run per minute (each consisting of a single bleaching pulse and a single recovery image) over 10 min on the very same cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pooling data from multiple cells provided brightness distributions as a function of time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By this procedure, the amount of active fluorophores per cell was substantially reduced to about 50%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this approach, stable interaction of subunits would reduce the total number of observed spots, but would not alter the brightness distribution (Fig 2a, scenario i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the exchange rate of subunits was high, however, bleached subunits would mix with unbleached subunits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over time, this mixing would increase the number of complexes containing both dark and fluorescent subunits, thereby shifting the observable oligomeric distribution towards smaller structures (Fig 2a, scenario ii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the plasma membrane, we observed no change in the oligomeric state with increasing number of TOCCSL runs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thereby confirmed our previous results which indicated stability of SERT oligomers at the minutes timescale (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the ER membrane, however, we found a substantial shift towards oligomers with smaller amounts of active fluorophores, indicating rapid exchange of subunits between SERT oligomers (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Evaluation of the oligomer stability in the plasma membrane and at the ER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) To study the stability of SERT oligomers we performed repeated TOCCSL runs on the same cells (1 run per minute over 10 min), and determined the brightness distributions in each run.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two different scenarios can be distinguished: if oligomers were stable over the time course of the experiment, the total number of diffraction-limited spots would be reduced without altering the brightness distribution (left, scenario i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, if oligomers would exchange subunits during the 10 min, increasing numbers of mixed SERT oligomers containing both bleached and non-bleached subunits would be observable, thereby shifting the determined oligomeric distribution towards smaller structures (right, scenario ii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Using the repetitive TOCCSL strategy, we have observed no change in the oligomeric distribution of SERT at the plasma membrane (n=20 cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oligomeric distributions are shown at the beginning of the experiment (white bars), after 1 min (dark grey), 3 min (light grey), and after 10 min (black).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) At the ER, however, we observed rearrangement of subunits over the timescale of the experiment,

oligomerization', 'Given the described SERTPIP2 interaction20 and the strong difference of PIP2 levels between plasma membrane17 and ER18, we hypothesized that PIP2 impacts on SERT oligomerization.

28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PIP2 depletion had no influence on the mean mGFPSERT surface density (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For low SERT surface densities (25 molecules m2), we observed a marked shift of SERT oligomers towards smaller complexes, whereas application of the inert orthologue o-3M3FBS did not elicit any effect (38 molecules m2, Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At higher SERT densities, however, oligomers increased in size (Fig 3b), indicating rapid equilibration of the oligomerization reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: SERT oligomerization at the plasma membrane depends on PIP2

'Next, we investigated whether direct PIP2 binding to SERT sustained oligomer formation or whether PIP2 would exert an indirect effect due to the downstream metabolites IP3 or DAG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, we identified the amino acids K352 and K460 as crucial residues for PIP2 binding to SERT20 (Fig 4a); mutation of both residues to alanine yielded a substantial decrease of PIP2-induced effects on parachloroamphetamine-induced, SERT-mediated current and efflux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, the PIP2SERT interaction was shown to be greatly reduced in pull-down experiments20.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Although there is a wealth of data supporting the existence of neurotransmitter transporters in oligomeric quaternary structures10, the nature of the interaction between the subunits has yet not been unravelled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we examined the size and stability of oligomeric complexes of SERT at two different subcellular localizations, the ER membrane and the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that dynamic equilibration of SERT oligomers occurs at the ER membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After trafficking through the secretory pathway, the pre-formed oligomers undergo kinetic trapping at the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pre-equilibration of subunit binding at the ER membrane and kinetic trapping of oligomerized protomers at the plasma membrane enables the cell to spatially decouple the oligomerization process from the final site of oligomer operation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This appears crucial to render the degree of oligomerization insusceptible to different SERT concentrations at various localizations on the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our data indicate that the phosphoinositide PIP2 plays an essential role in this process and that the different PIP2 concentrations of the ER membrane and the plasma membrane are responsible for the pronounced differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While other phosphoinositides would also be plausible candidates for mediating charge-induced SERT oligomerization, some lines of evidence indicate the specific role of PIP2 in this process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, PLC is a highly specific enzyme for PIP2 hydrolysis, leaving other phosphoinositides virtually unaffected29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments shown in Fig 3 hence reveal the specific contribution of PIP2 to SERT oligomerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, PIP2 is by far the most common phosphoinositide in the plasma membrane16, thereby outcompeting other phosphoinositide species by shear concentration effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, due to rapid dephosphorylation the ER membrane contains phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylinositol(4)phosphate (PI(4)P), but virtually no PIP2 or other multi-phosphorylated phosphoinositides16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figures 1 and 2 thus render a role of PI and PI(4)P in SERT oligomerization unlikely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the following, we propose a model how PIP2 may cause kinetic trapping of SERT oligomers at the plasma membrane (Fig 5), which has three cornerstones: ', '

i
two negatively charged phosphate groups on PIP2 bind electrostatically to positively charged patches on the cytosolic face of two SERT molecules
SERT contains a patch with a strong positive electrostatic potential on the intracellular face which is in contact with the polar headgroups of the membrane20 (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cationic patch is generated by basic amino acid residues (including K352 and K460).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inositol sugar ring of PIP2 has two functional PO42 groups in position 4 and 5, each harbouring a negative charge of 2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These functional PO42 groups are oriented towards opposing ends of the inositol ring and would therefore have the possibility to interact with two separate SERT monomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereby, they would effectively act as an ionic bridge between the two SERT transporters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ii
abrogation of PIP2 binding leads to rapid equilibration of the oligomerization process
 The oligomerization process of SERT rapidly equilibrates under conditions, where PIP2 does not contribute to the subunit association process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was inferred from the results of three different approaches: the depletion of PIP2 by enzymatic conversion to IP3 and diacylglycerol by activation of PLC (Fig 3); the retention of SERT in the ER, where PIP2 levels are extremely low31 (Figs 1c and 2c); the reduction of PIP2 binding by introduction of two point mutations20 (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All conditions revealed qualitatively similar behaviour, that is, the mean size of SERT oligomers became dependent on SERT surface density, and protomers exchanged rapidly between different oligomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intrinsic low affinity proteinprotein interactions between SERT protomers seem to mediate this process, however, contributions of low PIP2 concentrations cannot be ruled out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, equilibration of receptor oligomerization at the ER membrane was recently reported for a GPCR32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this stage, we do not know at which exact subcellular location oligomerization is ultimately adjusted; low PIP2 levels in virtually all subcellular membranes except for the plasma membrane suggest that the exchange of subunits remains rapid until the fusion of the cargo vesicles with the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  iii
elevated PIP2 levels saturate PIP2 binding sites on SERT, thereby stabilizing the oligomer

', 'Figure 5: A model for PIP2 dependent oligomerization of SERT.High PIP2 concentrations at the plasma membrane (left) saturates PIP2 binding sites on SERT, impeding further oligomerization of the subunits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also disassembly of the oligomers is efficiently prevented: in case of PIP2 unbinding, the vacant position is rapidly re-populated by a new PIP2 molecule before the protomers can separate by diffusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, the two effects lead to the kinetic trapping of the oligomeric state at the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the ER membrane, however, low PIP2 concentrations lead to coexistence of PIP2-ligated and -unligated SERT (right), which are capable of mutual binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, such conditions enable fast equilibration of the oligomerization process, including subunit exchange between SERT oligomers.Full size image', 'In principle, PIP2 binding to the polybasic patch at the cytosolic face of SERT, which includes the lysine residues in positions 352 and 460, increases the affinity to other, undecorated SERT protomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Naturally occurring concentrations of PIP2 at the plasma membrane (20,00060,000 molecules m2; (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33)), however, lead to saturation of SERT with PIP2, thereby imposing a charge-based repulsive interaction which precludes further oligomerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In consequence, over time most oligomers would disassemble to monomeric SERT until equilibrium is reached, where virtually only PIP2-decorated monomers would be present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, however, there are mechanisms which strongly slow down this equilibration process (kinetic trapping).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the high PIP2 concentration itself may account for such a mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following this line of argumentation, SERT disassembly may require the complete dissociation of one or several PIP2 molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high PIP2 concentrations at the plasma membrane would result in immediate replenishment of the vacant position before separation of the individual protomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Hence, according to our model PIP2 levels are not responsible for tuning the oligomeric distribution of SERT, but instead determine the kinetics for reaching the equilibrium of the oligomerization process: at low PIP2 levels (as present at the ER membrane) equilibration is fast, whereas at high PIP2 levels (as present at the plasma membrane) equilibration is substantially slowed down.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, our data show two important steps in the oligomerization of a transmembrane protein: (i) pre-equilibration of subunit binding at the ER membrane and (ii) kinetic trapping of oligomerization at the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By this, the oligomerization process becomes spatially decoupled from the final site of oligomer operation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could be important to make the degree of oligomerization insusceptible to different SERT concentrations at various locations on the plasma membrane.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
