Targeting dendritic cells to accelerate T-cell activation overcomes a bottleneck in tuberculosis vaccine efficacy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The development of a tuberculosis (TB) vaccine that induces sterilizing immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection has been elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Absence of sterilizing immunity induced by TB vaccines may be due to delayed activation of mucosal dendritic cells (DCs), and subsequent delay in antigen presentation and activation of vaccine-induced CD4+ T-cell responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that pulmonary delivery of activated M. tuberculosis antigen-primed DCs into vaccinated mice, at the time of M. tuberculosis exposure, can overcome the delay in accumulation of vaccine-induced CD4+ T-cell responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, activating endogenous host CD103+ DCs and the CD40CD40L pathway can similarly induce rapid accumulation of vaccine-induced lung CD4+ T-cell responses and limit early M. tuberculosis growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our study provides proof of concept that targeting mucosal DCs can accelerate vaccine-induced T-cell responses on M. tuberculosis infection, and provide insights to overcome bottlenecks in TB vaccine efficacy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death by infection1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TB is caused by aerosol exposure to the intracellular bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), leading to either latent disease or active pulmonary disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only currently licensed vaccine against TB is Mycobacterium bovis Bacille CalmetteGuerin (BCG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although BCG vaccination is effective against childhood forms of TB1, and in decreasing childhood TB morbidity1, it provides variable efficacy against adult pulmonary TB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, over the past two decades, concerted efforts have been made to develop new vaccines for TB that will provide improved protection on Mtb exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modern candidate TB vaccines have focussed on induction of T-cell responses, primarily CD4+ T cells producing interferon gamma (IFN)2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, an important role for mucosal interleukin 17A (IL-17A) in vaccine-induced protection against TB disease has been shown3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, induction of lung-resident IL-17A-producing CD4+ T-cell populations by TB vaccines is also being explored2,4,5,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these efforts, most TB vaccines reduce the burden of lung Mtb by 0.51.0 log in animal challenge models3,8,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recombinant live mycobacterial vaccines confer improved protection (2 log reduction), when compared with subunit and virally vectored TB vaccines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examples of recombinant vaccines include the recombinant Mycobacterium smegmatis vaccine, which induces sterilizing immunity in the liver, but not the lung12; recombinant BCG over-expressing Listeria monocytogenes listeriolysin and lacking urease C11,13; and the recombinant Mtb vaccine lacking PhoP14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other work has highlighted the benefit of administering recombinant Mtb vaccines mucosally, showing that macaques vaccinated with the attenuated Mtb mutant lacking SigH had sterile protection in some TB lesions15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these results are promising, considerable challenges are associated with the design and implementation of a recombinant Mtb vaccine to be delivered mucosally via the lungs, particularly in light of the TBHIV co-epidemic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is critical to fully understand the early events occurring in the vaccinated Mtb-infected lung.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'After Mtb infection of naive mice, accumulation of activated lung CD4+ T cells is delayed, occurring between 14 and 21 days post Mtb infection (dpi)16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This delay is thought to be due to Mtb-mediated inhibition of early antigen presentation by antigen-presenting cells (APCs)18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even in the presence of an existing Mtb-specific vaccine-induced CD4+ T-cell population in the lung, CD4+ T-memory cells do not accumulate in the lung until 1214 dpi3,6,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Priming of T-cell responses following primary Mtb infection requires trafficking of Mtb-infected DCs from the lungs to the lymph nodes (LNs)20,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Mtb-infected DCs do not efficiently present antigen directly to Mtb-specific CD4+ T cells, but antigen is transferred from Mtb-infected DCs to uninfected bystander DCs in the LNs, for antigen presentation to naive CD4+ T cells22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On Mtb infection, even vaccine-induced memory T cells accumulate in the LNs before mobilization to the lungs6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in the current study, we hypothesized that the delay in accumulation of lung vaccine-induced CD4+ T cells in vaccinated Mtb-infected hosts is due to a delay in antigen presentation by Mtb-infected APCs, thus resulting in a bottleneck and preventing sterilizing immunity to Mtb infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that we can overcome the delay in accumulation of vaccine-induced memory CD4+ T cells by transferring exogenously primed activated DCs into the lungs of vaccinated mice at the time of Mtb infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DC transfer into vaccinated Mtb-infected hosts results in rapid activation of vaccine-induced CD4+ T-cell responses, substantial changes in the lung micro-environment, activation of lung alveolar macrophages and early Mtb control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, these protective mechanisms are dependent on CD103+ DCs and the CD40CD40L activation pathway, as host-directed therapeutics targeting these pathways in vaccinated Mtb-infected mice can mimic the protective effects of pulmonary DC transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we have determined a key bottleneck for the failure of TB vaccines to induce sterilizing protection against Mtb infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide a roadmap for the type of immune responses that a sterilizing TB vaccine should induce, representing a milestone in our mechanistic understanding of TB vaccine-mediated immune responses.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'DC transfer confers superior vaccine-induced Mtb control', 'Following Mtb infection, vaccine-induced CD4+ T-cell responses are delayed in vaccinated hosts3,6, and could be a likely reason for the failure of TB vaccines to induce sterilizing immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we first assessed whether a delay in accumulation of CD4+ T-cell recall responses was due to an inherent deficiency in the ability of the vaccine-induced T cells to respond to antigen exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, naive CD4+ T cells were isolated from Mtb-specific immunodominant antigen 85B (Ag85B) T-cell receptor transgenic (TCR) mice and adoptively transferred into congenic C57BL/6 (B6) mice, which were vaccinated subcutaneously (s.c.) with BCG, rested for 4 weeks followed by a mucosal boost with the CD4+ T-cell epitope Ag85B240254.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following a period of rest for 4 weeks, lung CD4+ T cells were isolated and cultured in vitro in the presence of Ag85B-pulsed DCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recall Ag85B-specific CD4+ T cells proliferated rapidly, underwent activation, produced cytokines and on co-culture with Mtb-infected macrophages could mediate Mtb control (Fig 1ad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that vaccine-induced CD4+ T cells can rapidly respond to Mtb antigen, but activation is delayed in vivo following Mtb infection3,6,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is not due to a limitation of Mtb antigen availability, as infection of vaccinated mice with high doses (1,000 c.f.u.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of Mtb did not improve vaccine-induced Mtb control (Supplementary Fig 1a)23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T regulatory cells induced in response to Mtb infection are known to suppress early T-cell responses24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As before25, however, depletion of T regulatory cells in vaccinated B6 mice early following Mtb infection did not improve vaccine-induced Mtb control, instead increasing susceptibility to Mtb infection (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although recall CD4+ T-cell responses are delayed in vivo in Mtb-infected hosts3,6,21, vaccine-induced CD4+ T cells can rapidly respond ex vivo to activate macrophages for Mtb control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Z-DC transfer

activation of CD4+ T-cell recall responses on Mtb infection in vivo, we addressed whether delivery of Mtb antigen-pulsed DCs into the lungs of Mtb-infected-vaccinated mice could overcome this bottleneck and improve recall vaccine-induced CD4+ T-cell immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  B6 mice were thus vaccinated with BCG, rested for 4 weeks, followed by a mucosal boost with Ag85B240254.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were further rested for 4 weeks, after which they were challenged with a clinical W-Beijing Mtb strain, HN878 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the time of Mtb challenge, vaccinated mice received Ag85B240254-pulsed B6 bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDC) delivered intratracheally (i.t., DC transfer).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While vaccination and mucosal boost reduced lung Mtb burden as before4, B6 DC transfer into vaccinated mice reduced lung Mtb burden by 98.6%, when compared with the burden in unvaccinated Mtb-infected mice (Supplementary Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pulmonary delivery of Ag85B240254 peptide alone did not induce the superior protection seen with DC transfer in vaccinated mice (Supplementary Fig 2a), further suggesting that antigen availability was not the major reason for delayed vaccine-induced CD4+ T-cell recall responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further improve the ability of antigen-pulsed DCs to activate CD4+ T cells following Mtb infection, we next stimulated DCs with the Dectin-1 agonist zymosan (Z-DC)27 at the time of antigen pulsing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activating Z-DC, induced proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-23, IL-1 and IL-6 (Supplementary Fig 3ac), but also induced IL-10 (Supplementary Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-10 induction can dampen vaccine-induced immunity to Mtb infection28,29, and we next tested whether use of B6 DCs or Il10/ DCs treated with zymosan was more effective on transfer at conferring Mtb control in vaccinated hosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  B6 DC transfer into vaccinated Mtb-infected mice as before reduced Mtb burden significantly, when compared with vaccinated Mtb-infected hosts, while transfer of B6 Z-DCs had a small but significant improvement in Mtb control, when compared with vaccinated hosts receiving B6 DC transfer (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In sharp contrast, we found that vaccinated hosts receiving Z-DCs from Il10/ mice resulted in far superior Mtb control, with Mtb burden-bordering limit of detection by plating assays (Supplementary Fig 2b, limit of Mtb detection is 75100 c.f.u.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  per lung, Mtb burden from three out of five mice were in this range, 99.97% reduction in Mtb burden, when compared with unvaccinated Mtb-infected mice).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The near-sterilizing protection in vaccinated mice receiving Il10/ Z-DC transfer coincided with increased frequency of both activated IL-17-producing and IFN-producing Mtb-specific CD4+ T cells in the lungs (Supplementary Fig 2c,d; gating strategy in Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, B6 Z-DC transfer also resulted in increased frequency of lung IL-17-producing Mtb-specific CD4+ T-cell responses, but failed to improve IFN-producing CD4+ T-cell responses, when compared with responses in vaccinated hosts (Supplementary Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results together suggest that Z-DCs generated from Il10/ mice on transfer into vaccinated hosts can overcome a TB vaccine bottleneck, and confer superior protection against Mtb infection by significantly accelerating the accumulation of Mtb-specific cytokine-producing CD4+ T-cell vaccine responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in all experiments in the remainder of the study, Z-DCs from Il10/ mice (Ag85B-Z-DC) were used for DC transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'DC transfer accelerates vaccine CD4+ T-cell activation', 'Having established the ability of Z-DC transfer to significantly reduce Mtb burden in the lungs of vaccinated mice, we then assessed the kinetics of immune responses in Mtb HN878-infected vaccinated mice receiving Z-DC transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vaccine-induced CD4+ T-cell responses and activation of lung myeloid cells are not detected in vaccinated hosts until 1214 dpi following Mtb challenge3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, we observed significant early accumulation (8 dpi) of activated CD4+ T cells in vaccinated Mtb-infected mice receiving Z-DC transfer, when compared with vaccinated Mtb-infected mice (Fig 1e; gating strategy in Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, increased numbers of Mtb-specific CD44hi-activated cells producing the cytokines IL-17 and IFN- accumulated early in lungs of vaccinated Mtb-infected mice receiving Z-DC transfer, when compared with vaccinated Mtb-infected mice or naive Mtb-infected mice (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As noted previously, activated T-cell responses in vaccinated mice not receiving Z-DC transfer accumulated later at 14 dpi (Fig 1f)6, while T-cell responses between the different groups were comparable at later time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These protective and early activation events in vaccine-induced CD4+ T-cell responses coincided with increased early upregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II expression on lung alveolar macrophages in Z-DC-recipient-vaccinated Mtb-infected mice, when compared with levels expressed in unvaccinated mice (Fig 1g; gating strategy in Supplementary Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the early and rapid activation of vaccine-induced CD4+ T-cell responses, and concomitant activation of alveolar macrophages was associated with complete control of Mtb growth, maintaining burdens at levels of initial inoculum up to 20 dpi in vaccinated Mtb-infected mice receiving Z-DC transfer (Fig 1h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in contrast to naive and vaccinated Mtb-infected mice, in which Mtb burden increased in the lungs over time (Fig 1h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, Z-DC transfer at the time of Mtb challenge resulted in long-lasting protection up to 40 dpi, with Z-DC transfer-recipient mice still maintaining significantly lower bacterial burdens in the lungs (Fig 1h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, at later time points, vaccinated mice showed similar Mtb burden as unvaccinated mice30, suggesting that while Z-DC transfer provides long-lasting vaccine-induced immunity in Mtb HN878-infected mice, endogenous vaccine-induced responses are not long-lasting and are lost over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, robust rapid formation of B-cell follicles-harbouring localized T cells could be detected in the lungs of vaccinated Mtb-infected mice receiving Z-DC transfer (Fig 1i), indicating early development of protective lung granulomas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, even on challenge with a Euro-American Mtb strain, H37Rv, we found that Z-DC transfer effectively conferred superior Mtb control by activating alveolar macrophages and accelerating accumulation of activated CD4+ T cells (Supplementary Fig 5ad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our results suggest that DC transfer can effectively induce superior vaccine control on challenge with different Mtb strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As Mtb HN878 is a clinically relevant rapidly emerging Mtb strain, all experiments in the remainder of the study was carried out with Mtb HN878.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our data together suggest that DC transfer is effective in rapid restimulation of vaccine-induced T cells to produce cytokines and localize within lymphoid follicles to activate macrophages for rapid Mtb control, which is sustained long term, and across different Mtb strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'DC transfer-mediated Mtb control is CD4+ T-cell dependent', 'To test the durability of Z-DC transfer in inducing superior vaccine-induced immunity against Mtb challenge, BCG-vaccinated mice were boosted mucosally and rested for 10 weeks after vaccination, and Z-DC transfer and Mtb HN878 infection were carried out as before.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we found that Z-DC transfer still induced superior protection in long-term-rested-vaccinated hosts, with Mtb burden significantly lower and at levels of detection, when compared with control vaccinated Mtb-infected mice that were also rested for 10 weeks before Mtb challenge (Supplementary Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, vaccinated mice receiving Z-DC transfer also showed increased accumulation of activated IL-17+ and IFN-+ CD4+ T cells, when compared with CD4+ T-cell responses in vaccinated and unvaccinated Mtb-infected mice (Supplementary Fig 6b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that Z-DC transfer-induced protection confers superior Mtb control even following a prolonged period of rest, supporting the durability of DC transfer-mediated protective efficacy in overcoming the TB vaccine bottleneck.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous studies have employed administration of DCs as vaccination strategy31,32, during which mice were immunized with antigen-primed DCs, and then rested before Mtb infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the approach taken here is to enhance antigen presentation at the time of Mtb infection by administering DCs mucosally at the time of Mtb infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we tested whether use of Z-DCs as a mucosal boost to BCG vaccination, would similarly induce superior Mtb control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we show that pulmonary administration of Z-DCs as a mucosal boost to BCG vaccination only had a small protective effect in vaccinated hosts, and did not match the near-sterilizing Mtb control seen, when Z-DC transfer was carried out at the time of Mtb infection in vaccinated hosts (Supplementary Fig 6d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data show that the improved protection conferred by Z-DC transfer is specifically due to the enhanced antigen presentation and accelerated T cells priming at the time of Mtb infection, and use of DCs as vaccination tool does not enable the superior Mtb control in vaccinated hosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our data show that DC transfer into vaccinated mice at the time of Mtb challenge accelerates Mtb-specific CD4+ T-cell responses and confers superior protection against Mtb challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we next addressed whether DC transfer-induced immunity in vaccinated hosts was dependent on vaccine-induced T-cell responses, or whether DC transfer will similarly induce near-sterilizing immunity in previously unvaccinated Mtb-infected mice by accelerating priming of naive CD4+ T-cell responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, unvaccinated B6 mice or B6 mice that were BCG vaccinated and mucosally boosted were rested for 4 weeks, and then received Z-DC transfer at the time of Mtb challenge, and Mtb control was determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data show that while vaccinated Mtb-infected mice receiving Z-DC demonstrated superior bacterial control as before, Mtb control in unvaccinated mice receiving Z-DC transfer was less effective and resembled Mtb control seen in vaccinated hosts not receiving Z-DC transfer (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, although the numbers of IL-17 and IFN--producing Mtb-specific CD4+ T cells in Z-DC transfer-recipient Mtb-infected mice were significantly higher, when compared with Mtb-infected mice not receiving Z-DC, the numbers were reduced, when compared with numbers seen in vaccinated mice receiving Z-DC transfer (Fig 2b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, T-cell localization within B-cell follicles in vaccinated mice receiving Z-DC transfer was higher, when compared with unvaccinated mice that received Z-DC transfer (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results together suggest that DC transfer into unvaccinated hosts can also accelerate the priming of naive CD4+ T cells into cytokine-producing Mtb-specific CD4+ T-cell responses and improve Mtb control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the protection in naive Mtb-infected mice receiving Z-DC transfer is not as effective as seen in vaccinated mice receiving Z-DC transfer, suggesting that Z-DC transfer mediating near-sterilizing immunity occurs only in previously vaccinated hosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Z-DC transfer-mediated superior Mtb control is CD4+ T-cell dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ad)

increased accumulation of Batf3-dependent CD103+ DCs (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we have identified a CD103+ DC and CD40 pathway that can potentially be targeted for improved Mtb control in

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Thus far, the development of sterilizing vaccines against TB for human use has not become a reality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is especially concerning considering the status of TB, as one of the leading causes of death due to infectious diseases in the world today.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current study, we hypothesized that our inability to develop a sterilizing vaccine against Mtb infection is not due to a failure of the vaccine to induce effective T-cell responses, but due to a delay in antigen presentation and subsequent delay in accumulation of vaccine-induced T-cell responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we show here that vaccine-induced T cells can respond to antigen exposure and induce mycobactericidal activity ex vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transfer of exogenously primed DCs into lungs of vaccinated Mtb-infected mice can directly activate vaccine-induced T cells in vivo, leading to accelerated formation of protective B-cell follicles, rapid and early alveolar macrophage activation, and early control of establishment of Mtb infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, our results have identified novel mechanisms, involving CD103+ DCs and the CD40 activation pathway that may be therapeutically targeted to improve vaccine-induced protection during TB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our data provide novel and mechanistic insights into pathways that can be targeted to generate sterilizing vaccine-induced immunity against TB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Most modern TB vaccines induce lung and systemic Th1 and/or Th17 vaccine responses2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In animal models, however, none of these vaccines induce sterilizing immunity to TB, instead only decreasing the lung Mtb burden by 0.51.0 log (refs 3, 8, 9, 10, 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our studies show that vaccine-induced CD4+ Mtb-specific T cells isolated from the lung can undergo activation rapidly, proliferate and produce both IFN- and IL-17 ex vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we show that proliferating vaccine-induced CD4+ T cells can activate macrophages to control Mtb, suggesting that there is no inherent deficiency in vaccine-induced CD4+ recall responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, lung-resident vaccine-induced CD4+ T-cell responses are long lasting39 and adoptive transfer of T cells isolated from Mtb-infected animals into newly infected animals confers protective immunity40,41,42,43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mtb is a successful pathogen, known to inhibit MHC-II transactivator expression, MHC-II expression and antigen presentation in APCs18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the inability of TB vaccines to confer sterilizing immunity on Mtb challenge may be associated with delayed CD4+ T-cell responses due to delayed APC function, rather than just poor induction of vaccine-induced CD4+ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, targeting DCs in vaccinated hosts can substantially accelerate the activation and accumulation of cytokine-producing CD4+ T-cell recall responses in the lung, initiate rapid activation of alveolar macrophages and limit Mtb growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, pre-clinical vaccines that have come closest to inducing sterilizing immunity following Mtb infection have been recombinant mycobacterial vaccines delivered mucosally15,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BCG is known to reduce the overall childhood morbidity caused by infections other than Mtb46, which could be due to the ability of BCG to induce innate memory by epigenetically altering the phenotype of infected cells to one producing increased inflammatory cytokines, via autophagy and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2)-dependent pathways47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is possible that recombinant mycobacterial vaccines delivered mucosally target pathways similar to DC transfer through activation of lung-resident DCs and macrophages, thereby driving earlier activation of lung-resident T cells on Mtb challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further work delineating the specific mechanisms by which vaccine-induced immunity can be accelerated by targeting these pathways will therefore be highly relevant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous studies have attempted to improve DC function at the time of vaccination by targeting the CD40 activation pathway49, DC receptor Dec-205 (refs 50, 51), or by utilizing cell-derived vaccines, such as Mtb antigen-primed DCs31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Improving DC function by targeting the CD40 pathway during vaccination had no effect49, while activating Dec-205 at the time of vaccination had a small effect (0.5 log reduction) on vaccine-induced protection on Mtb challenge50,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vaccination with antigen-primed DCs has generated mixed results in Mtb-infected mice, with a study demonstrating a negative impact of DC vaccination due to exuberant inflammation31, or induction of vaccine-induced protection similar to levels seen in BCG-vaccinated hosts32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that use of Z-DCs as a mucosal vaccination tool as boost to BCG vaccination has a small protective effect on Mtb infection, but not as effective as use of Z-DC transfer at the time of infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, only very few studies have therapeutically manipulated early innate responses following Mtb infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Delivery of polyI:C, a TLR3 ligand, exacerbated inflammation and increased Mtb burden52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, delivery of FimH, a TLR4 ligand, improved T-cell responses and resulted in 1 log reduction in lung bacterial burden, following high-dose intranasal infection with Mtb H37Ra (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, no published studies have manipulated early host responses in vaccinated Mtb-infected hosts, with resulting complete early Mtb control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, both CpG (reviewed in refs 54, 55) and CD40 agonists (reviewed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  56) have been safely tested in clinical human trials, predominantly for cancer treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, repurposing these host-directed therapeutics, as well as other activators of CD103+ DC function57,58, for rapid activation of vaccine-induced T-cell responses may thus be useful in development of novel drugs or vaccination approaches for TB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results show that while delivery of unstimulated DCs by itself improves vaccine-induced CD4+ T-cell responses and Mtb control in vaccinated hosts, zymosan activation of DCs, especially generated from Il10/ mice confers superior vaccine-induced Mtb control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results support the idea that delayed antigen presentation and subsequent delayed induction of vaccine-induced T-cell activation is a major bottleneck for TB vaccine efficacy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, these results support an important role for IL-10 in limiting TB vaccine efficacy and early Mtb control in vaccinated hosts28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Z-DC transfer works in both standard BCG vaccinated as well as in mucosally vaccinated Mtb-infected hosts, the route of vaccination may define the mechanisms of protection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mucosally vaccinated Mtb-infected mice receiving DC transfer, mucosal lung-resident CD4+ T cells, primarily IL-17-producing cells are activated and accumulate rapidly in the lung, thus mediating the superior protection associated with this model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In BCG-vaccinated Mtb-infected mice receiving DC transfer, DC transfer can still prime a population of lung-resident IL-17-producing vaccine-induced CD4+ T cells, but likely DC migration to LNs is required to mobilize IFN--producing vaccine-induced CD4+ T-cell responses from the systemic pool, to provide enhanced Mtb control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless, that we can target CD103+ DCs and the CD40 activation pathway to limit Mtb growth in standard BCG-vaccinated Mtb-infected hosts suggest that our strategy is effective in overcoming a bottleneck associated with delayed induction of vaccine-induced CD4+ T-cell responses in vaccinated hosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is further supported by our results showing that DC transfer can protect vaccinated hosts on challenge with Mtb strains belonging to different lineages, suggesting that T-cell bottleneck for TB vaccines is universal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, that Z-DC transfer into unvaccinated hosts can also accelerate naive T-cell priming and improve primary immunity, albeit not to the effectiveness seen in vaccinated hosts, suggest the DC transfer may be useful to enhance both primary and vaccine-induced pathways during Mtb infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'DC transfer not only induces the rapid activation of vaccine-induced CD4+ T-cell responses in vaccinated Mtb-infected mice, but also has substantial downstream effects on activation of myeloid pathways in the lung.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, lung alveolar macrophages are rapidly activated in vaccinated hosts by 8 dpi, an event that does not happen until 14 dpi in vaccinated hosts and until 21 dpi in unvaccinated hosts3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the early global transcriptional changes in the lungs of vaccinated Mtb-infected mice receiving DC transfer mirror the transcriptional changes occurring in 21 dpi Mtb-infected lungs33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we observe early accumulation of myeloid DCs, including CD103+ DCs and an enhancement of DC activation pathways, in particular genes associated with CD40 activation in the lungs of vaccinated Mtb-infected mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD103+ DCs are a tissue-resident DC subset, which have primarily been implicated in cross-presentation and induction of CD8+ T-cell responses59,60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, however, CD103+ DCs have been shown to induce CD4+ T cells34,35,61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the lung, CD103+ DCs represent a migratory DC subset, with the ability to migrate from the lungs to the LN and back again62, and induce both Th1 and Th17 cytokines by CD4+ T cells34,35,63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although antigen presentation by transferred DCs likely directly activates vaccine-induced CD4+ T-cell responses, rapid activation of CD4+ T-cell responses also modifies the lung micro-environment to improve subsequent antigen presentation by endogenous host APCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show here that targeting DC activation pathways through the TLR ligand amph-CpG, along with use of the CD40 agonist FGK4.5, similarly control Mtb growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of DCs with granulocytemacrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a by-product of TLR9 stimulation through CpG64 has previously been shown to upregulate CD103 expression65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is possible that CpG stimulates CD103+ expression on DCs indirectly through inducing GM-CSF by other lung-resident cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upregulation of CD103 as well as recruitment of CD103+ DCs to the lung alone, however, are not sufficient for improved T-cell activation, suggesting that the activating signal delivered through the CD40 agonist FGK4.5 provides the second signal required for improved early antigen presentation to vaccine-induced CD4+ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, Mtb-infected individuals likely have a population of antigen-responsive T cells, and targeting DCs as a potential therapy, may provide the lung-resident T cells the necessary signals to proliferate and control Mtb infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Thus, our data for the first time show that delayed activation of vaccine-induced T-cell responses is a critical bottleneck for TB vaccine efficacy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate that this delay can be overcome by DC transfer, or by targeting DC activation, leading to rapid T-cell recall responses and enhanced alveolar macrophage activation, resulting in complete control of early Mtb growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide a roadmap for the type of immune responses that a sterilizing TB vaccine should induce, representing an important milestone in our mechanistic understanding of TB vaccine-mediated immune responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that despite induction of effective Mtb-specific vaccine T-cell responses by modern TB vaccines66,67,68, delayed T-cell vaccine responses on Mtb infection may pose a significant hurdle to development of a sterilizing vaccine for TB in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is possible that the development of a sterilizing vaccine for TB may not be a realistic goal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, redirecting our efforts towards developing novel vaccine strategies and therapeutics for preventing the reactivation of latent TB and TB transmission may benefit global control of TB.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
