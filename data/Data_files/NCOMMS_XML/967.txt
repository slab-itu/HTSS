Exploiting induced pluripotent stem cell-derived macrophages to unravel host factors influencing Chlamydia trachomatis pathogenesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Chlamydia trachomatis remains a leading cause of bacterial sexually transmitted infections and preventable blindness worldwide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are, however, limited in vitro models to study the role of host genetics in the response of macrophages to this obligate human pathogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we describe an approach using macrophages derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSdMs) to study macrophageChlamydia interactions in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that iPSdMs support the full infectious life cycle of C. trachomatis in a manner that mimics the infection of human blood-derived macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of the macrophage response to chlamydial infection highlighted the role of the type I interferon and interleukin 10-mediated responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we generated biallelic knockout mutations in host genes encoding IRF5 and IL-10RA in iPSCs, and confirmed their roles in limiting chlamydial infection in macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model can potentially be extended to other pathogens and tissue systems to advance our understanding of host-pathogen interactions and the role of human genetics in influencing the outcome of infections.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Chlamydia trachomatis is a leading cause of bacterial sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) worldwide, with more than a hundred million new cases of STDs caused by this pathogen annually.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These Gram-negative obligate intracellular bacteria cause genital infections leading to pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chlamydia are also a leading cause of preventable blindness due to trachoma, as well as being the aetiological agents responsible for non-gonococcal urethritis, and Chlamydia-induced reactive arthritis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During arthritis, C. trachomatis likely reaches the joint from the urogenital system through circulating monocytes and macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, although C. trachomatis preferentially infects epithelial cells, within the synovial tissues of reactive arthritis patients, viable, metabolically active Chlamydia predominately reside and persist within macrophages2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although macrophages are not always a permissive environment for Chlamydia, their capacity to infect macrophages varies between strains, the source and subtype of macrophages and the multiplicity of infection (MOI) used for infection6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Chlamydia does not grow in inflammatory M1 macrophages but grows well in M2 and M0 (resting) macrophages7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Consequently, macrophages play critical roles in defence against chlamydial infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, upon recruitment to sites of infection, the ability of macrophages to phagocytose and kill Chlamydia is crucial to limiting the progression of the infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the infiltration of macrophages into infected tissues can lead to inflammation, a phenotype commonly associated with Chlamydia infections1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, chlamydial persistence in macrophages can also contribute to chronic inflammation and delays in the efficacy of antibiotic treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, an understanding of the mechanisms that control chlamydial survival in human macrophages could have major implications for the development of therapeutic strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite the importance of human genetics in the complex interactions between Chlamydia and human macrophages, the availability of cell-based human systems to study this interplay is limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most in vitro models currently used to study Chlamydiamacrophage interactions involve macrophages derived from other mammals, immortalized macrophage-lineage cell lines or primary monocytes/macrophages, predominantly from mice9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aside from clear differences in the bacterial response of macrophages from humans and mice, immortalized cell lines are also far removed from the normal genetic state, including harbouring extensive genome rearrangements11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, primary monocytes and macrophages are inherently difficult to genetically manipulate, thus limiting the ability to study how macrophage genetics impact on Chlamydia pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Induced pluripotent stem-cell (iPSC) derived macrophages (iPSdMs) can potentially overcome some of the drawbacks of classical cell lines and can be used as an alternative source of primary human macrophages, providing a more personalised and tractable genetic approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human iPSCs can be readily genetically manipulated, using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, or isolated from individuals with common or rare disease-associated genotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we differentiated human iPSCs into macrophages and showed, through a combination of flow cytometric analyses, microscopy, transcriptomic and proteomic profiling that human iPSdMs respond to C. trachomatis in a similar manner to macrophages derived from human blood monocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing approach12, we generated human iPSC mutations in candidate genes identified from the functional genomic studies, to validate and identify novel mechanisms involved in limiting Chlamydia growth in macrophages.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

resources to its own growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pathway analysis also revealed the downregulation of other cellular processes during macrophage infection related to tubulin, and gap junction trafficking

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Due to the inherent difficulty in genetically manipulating primary monocytes/macrophages, the existing model systems for studying macrophage genetics are largely limited to immortalized cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, immortalized cells are far removed from the normal genetic state, whereas iPSdMs can be generated from diverse human genetic sources (HipSci project)27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We overcame this challenge by using human iPSCs in combination with CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we reported that macrophages derived from human iPSCs support the entire life cycle of C. trachomatis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show, through a combination of flow cytometry analyses, microscopy and transcriptomic/proteomic profiling, that human iPSC-derived macrophages (iPSdMs) respond to C. trachomatis in a similar manner to macrophages derived from human blood monocytes, when both are differentiated in such a way as to yield permissive7,8 M0/M2-like macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the diverse omic-analyses led us to the identification of a number of host factors potentially involved in macrophageChlamydia interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Macrophages can mediate protection against Chlamydia infections by phagocytosis, leading to the destruction of the bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, some pathogenic Chlamydia can infect and avoid lysosomal fusion to survive in macrophages6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we showed in vitro infection of human iPSdM with C. trachomatis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those bacteria that managed to evade lysosomal fusion continued to replicate and developed mature inclusions inside the human iPSdM (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the chlamydial progeny released from infected iPSdM were highly infectious (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results thus support the capability of Chlamydia to exploit circulating monocytes/macrophages as vehicles for dissemination of infection from the primary infection site to distant sites in the body28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless our functional genomics studies revealed insights into factors and pathways that may be involved in Chlamydia growth in macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We and others have shown that Chlamydia infection induces a Type I interferon (IFN) response in macrophages29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of the IFN regulatory factors (IRF)s play crucial roles in transcriptional activity of Type I IFN genes and numerous IFN-stimulated genes31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IRF family of transcription factors comprises nine members (IRF1-9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three of the transcription factors, namely IRF1, 3 and 7 have been characterized as crucial contributors in the regulation of type I IFNs during Chlamydia infection32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we explored the contribution of another key member of the IRF family, IRF5, a critical immune regulator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, it has been shown that during viral infection, IRF5 induces overlapping and distinct sets of genes compared to IRF7 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IRF5 not only induces the transcription of IFN and IFN, but also plays a key role in polarizing macrophages towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype and has been associated with susceptibility to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the role of this transcription factor in Chlamydia infection has not been investigated to date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'After generation of a human iPS knockout mutant in the IRF5 gene, it was demonstrated that the IRF5/ mutant human iPSdMs showed increased susceptibility to C. trachomatis infection compared to the parent KOLF2 human iPSdMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA-Seq analysis of the IRF5/ mutant versus KOLF2 human iPSdMs revealed the dysregulation of a variety of other factors involved in interferon signalling, including STAT1, IRF7 and IFITs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provides additional evidence that elements of the Type I interferon pathway are essential for anti-chlamydial defence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall we can conclude that IRF5 likely controls critical mechanisms that limit the excessive growth of Chlamydia in macrophages, enabling macrophages more time to exert their role in defence against Chlamydia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, in infected IRF5/ macrophages, we observed substantial downregulation of cytoskeleton

of IL-10RA in human iPSdMs led to increased susceptibility to C. trachomatis infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This supports a role for IL-10 in limiting Chlamydia infections of macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chlamydiae have evolved a number of strategies to promote their survival inside host cells, one of which is modulation of programmed cell death pathways in infected host cells40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A previous study showed that Chlamydia inhibits apoptosis in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells through induction of IL-10 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we speculate that the absence of IL-10/IL-10R signalling might inhibit apoptosis in macrophages to promote growth of Chlamydia in these cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are currently investigating this mechanism experimentally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we have provided evidence that we can use the human iPSdM Chlamydia infection model to study the complex interplay beween the host and the pathogen.'
