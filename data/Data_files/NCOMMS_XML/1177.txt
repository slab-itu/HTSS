Terahertz saturable absorbers from liquid phase exfoliation of graphite  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Saturable absorbers (SA) operating at terahertz (THz) frequencies can open new frontiers in the development of passively mode-locked THz micro-sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the fabrication of THz SAs by transfer coating and inkjet printing single and few-layer graphene films prepared by liquid phase exfoliation of graphite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Open-aperture z-scan measurements with a 3.5 THz quantum cascade laser show a transparency modulation 80%, almost one order of magnitude larger than that reported to date at THz frequencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy provides evidence of intraband-controlled absorption bleaching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results pave the way to the integration of graphene-based SA with electrically pumped THz semiconductor micro-sources, with prospects for applications where excitation of specific transitions on short time scales is essential, such as time-of-flight tomography, coherent manipulation of quantum systems, time-resolved spectroscopy of gases, complex molecules and cold samples and ultra-high speed communications, providing unprecedented compactness and resolution.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Ultra-short laser pulses in the terahertz (THz) frequency range have great potential for information and communication technologies1, security and spectroscopy applications2, and as tools to probe lightmatter interaction phenomena3 across the engineering, physical and biological sciences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Existing technologies for ultra-short THz pulse generation include the near-infrared ultrafast excitation of photoconductive switches4 and nonlinear crystals4, which provide broadband emission albeit with poor spectral bandwidth control and low output powers (W)4, free electron lasers4 and large table-top optical ultrafast lasers4, which can provide intense (1 MV cm1 electric field) picosecond-pulses with controlled frequencies, but at the expense of a large footprint which hinders practical applications5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) are solid state semiconductor sources with superior performances, in terms of compactness and spectral purity, with respect to any other technology for light generation at THz frequencies6, but presently do not operate passively in the ultra-short pulse regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to their Watt-range power7 and small intrinsic linewidth (100 Hz)8, their bandstructure-by-design6 allows one to tailor their frequency, bandwidth and pulse width independently6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It would thus be beneficial to develop techniques for generating ultra-short pulses directly from THz QCLs, such as passive mode-locking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This requires the development of appropriate saturable absorbers (SAs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'SAs operating in either transmission or reflection are routinely used to mode-lock lasers9, enabling a train of short pulses to be derived from continuous-wave operation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The key SA parameters include operation wavelength range9, dynamic response (recovery time)9 and saturation fluence (i.e., the pulse energy density required to achieve saturation)9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Semiconductors can be used as SAs over a wide frequency range (from visible to mid-infrared, MIR)10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their recovery time and saturation fluence can be tuned by altering the growth parameters and/or the device geometry11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, due to the limited tuning range/bandwidth in reflection (tens nm)9 and the inherent free-carrier absorption losses in transmission12, they are poorly suited for applications in the 110 THz range, hindering the corresponding development of passively mode-locked semiconductor lasers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the THz range, the photon energy (450 meV) is smaller than any semiconductor band-gap and the free-carrier absorption, fr, significantly increases as a function of wavelength, following a square law wavelength-dependence (fr2) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several n-doped semiconductors, such as GaAs, GaP and Ge, have been used as THz SAs, at electric fields of tens of kVcm1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, intra-cavity integration in the sub-wavelength (1014 m deep) cavities of available THz semiconductor lasers cannot be achieved without a significant increase of intra-cavity losses13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although active mode-locking of THz QCLs has been achieved by exploiting injection seeding14, phase synchronization15, and by modulating the QCL driving current with an external RF synthesizer16, enabling the generation of laser pulses of a few ps duration14, passive mode-locking has not been achieved, due to the absence of suitable SAs in the THz region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a further constraint, the inherently strong6,7,8 electronphonon interaction in the QCL polar semiconductor gain medium leads to population inversion relaxation times as short as a few ps (refs 6, 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Graphene17,18 and carbon nanotubes19 are potential SAs for ultrafast lasers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carbon nanotubes can deliver broadband operation by exploiting a distribution of diameters19, while broadband operation is intrinsic to graphene17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This, along with its ultrafast recovery time20, low saturation fluence17, and ease of fabrication21 and integration22,23, makes graphene a useful SA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mode-locked lasers exploiting graphene SAs (GSAs) have been demonstrated at frequencies from the visible to the IR24,25,26,27,28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To the best of our knowledge, the only reported THz SA using multi-layer graphene grown on the carbon-face of silicon carbide30 showed a maximum absorption modulation10%, too low to alter the intra-cavity field of existing THz QCLs30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, its intracavity integration within the 1014 m active region of THz semiconductor sources is hindered by the device architecture/material geometry6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It would, therefore, be desirable to develop a THz SA with a much higher absorption modulation, as well as one that can be deposited, as required, on any substrate, including on small (etched) trenches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) of graphite in a water/surfactant solution18,31 and organic solvents31,32,33 (for example, n-methylpyrrolidone; n-dimethylformamide; ortho-dichlorobenzene) is ideally suited for the mass-production of graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Graphene from LPE can be mixed or combined in dry or liquid form with a host polymer matrix, and can be used to produce both SAs18,33 and printable inks34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inkjet printing then allows for the deposition of films at low temperatures ( less_than 60 °C), with 1200 dpi resolution36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GSA films operating at 1 m have been made by vacuum filtration26, while polymer composite GSAs have been demonstrated at 875 nm (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24), 1.5 m (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23) and 2 m (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both inkjet printing and vacuum filtration are promising techniques to fabricate GSAs for QCLs, because they can be used to deposit films on a wide range of materials, ranging from Si wafers to flexible plastic substrates34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inkjet printing also enables the deposition of films conforming to the substrate features34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To date, water-based inks prepared by LPE of graphite require post-processing to remove the surfactant/polymer37, while the high boiling point of the resulting inks in n-methylpyrrolidone, n-dimethylformamide and ortho-dichlorobenzene hinders solvent removal by evaporation after the coating/printing process38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surfactants (for example, sodium deoxycholate, sodium cholate, Triton X-100) and solvents can have absorption coefficients larger than a few cm1 in the THz region39, and may adversely affect the absorption of THz radiation in GSAs40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, surfactant-free and low boiling point ( less_than 80 °C) printable inks must be engineered in order to enable low-temperature ( less_than 100 °C) solvent removal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we use LPE of graphite to formulate both a water-based ink and also a surfactant-free, low boiling point, ethanol-based ink, and demonstrate THz saturable absorption from films produced by both vacuum filtration and inkjet printing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through the combination of open-aperture z-scan experiments, transport analysis of field effect transistors (FETs) embedding these inks and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, we demonstrate 80% transparency modulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This paves the way for the integration of graphene with existing sources to realize ultrafast, mode-locked lasers and passive ultrafast components across the THz frequency range.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

prepared as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first, W-GSA, is made with the GW ink.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 250 l is vacuum filtered using 100 nm pore-size nitrocellulose filters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This blocks the flakes, while water passes through, leading to a film on the surface of the filter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is then placed on an intrinsic Si/SiO2 wafer and annealed at 80 °C for 2 h, to improve adhesion, followed by dissolution of the filter in acetone overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting film is 65 nm thick, as determined by AFM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the procedure reported in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27, we estimate a density0.72 g cm3 for the W-GSA, derived from the weight (measured with a microbalance) of the filter before and after film deposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is 1/3 of the density of bulk graphite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the graphene flakes27 in W-GSA films are, on average, stacked with the direction parallel to the SiO2 surface, we can assume an interflake distance 3 times larger than that of graphite (0.33 nm), which results in 1 nm; thus the film thickness corresponds to an equivalent number of layers N65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The second, Eth-GSA, is

#@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, once the droplets land on the substrate, they spread according to Youngs equation46,47 SVSLLVcosc=0, where SV mJ m2 is the solidvapour surface energy, SL is the solidliquid interfacial tension, and LV is the liquidvapour surface tension48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When inkjet printing the GW ink, the high surface tension (W47.8 mN m1) results in de-wetting (that is, isolated droplets caused by high c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the lower surface tension of the GEth ink (GEth30.7 mN m1) offers a lower c, which causes the droplets to spread and join, enabling morphologically uniform films on Si/SiO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The boiling point of GEth (78 °C) and low surface tension (30.7 mN m1) minimize the effect of the cohesion forces responsible for the transport of material inside and around a coffee ring49,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Raman spectroscopy is used to monitor the quality of the flakes at each step of the GSA preparation process for both

high frequency E2g phonon at , while the D peak, due to the breathing modes of six-atom rings, requires a defect for its activation51,52,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This arises from the transverse optical phonons around the Brillouin zone edge of the K point51,53, it is activated by a double resonance (DR) process54, and is dispersive with the energy of excitation owing to a Kohn anomaly at the K point55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Double resonance can also occur through an intra-valley process, that is, connecting two points belonging to the same cone around K or K, which gives rise to the D peak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2D peak and the 2D peak are the second-order resonances of the D and D peaks, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2D and 2D are generated from the momentum conservation by two phonons having opposite wave vectors, meaning that for their activation no defects are required, and thus these modes are always active56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2D peak is a single Lorentzian in SLG, whereas it

intensity of the D and G peaks, I(D)/I(G), analysed in combination with FWHM(G) and Disp(G), allows one to discriminate between disorder at the edges of the flakes and in the bulk, where a higher I(D)/I(G) implies a higher FWHM(G) and Disp(G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figures 4a,b show that the film preparation process does not change the structural properties of the flakes significantly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, Figs 4cf indicate a difference between the GW-based and the GEth-based films, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GEth shows a more pronounced and wider D peak, as well as a wider G peak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies a more defective nature of these flakes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the higher Disp(G) and FWHM(G) indicate that, unlike the GW flakes, the defects
