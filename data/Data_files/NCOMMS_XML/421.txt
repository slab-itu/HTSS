Synergetic electrode architecture for efficient graphene-based flexible organic light-emitting diodes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Graphene-based organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have recently emerged as a key element essential in next-generation displays and lighting, mainly due to their promise for highly flexible light sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, their efficiency has been, at best, similar to that of conventional, indium tin oxide-based counterparts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We here propose an ideal electrode structure based on a synergetic interplay of high-index TiO2 layers and low-index hole-injection layers sandwiching graphene electrodes, which results in an ideal situation where enhancement by cavity resonance is maximized yet loss to surface plasmon polariton is mitigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proposed approach leads to OLEDs exhibiting ultrahigh external quantum efficiency of 40.8 and 62.1% (64.7 and 103% with a half-ball lens) for single- and multi-junction devices, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OLEDs made on plastics with those electrodes are repeatedly bendable at a radius of 2.3 mm, partly due to the TiO2 layers withstanding flexural strain up to 4% via crack-deflection toughening.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Form-factor advantages such as flexibility and stretchability have brought organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) great attention for use in emerging devices like wearable, roll-type or foldable displays that call for mobility, deformability and/or expandability1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full realization of such potential, however, is non-trivial and requires significant effort in various aspects such as development of low-temperature thin-film transistor technologies and/or flexible encapsulation3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another important aspect to consider for highly flexible displays is to find transparent electrodes (TEs) that can replace indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes, which typically suffer from limited flexibility and potential cost issues associated with high demand and/or unstable supply4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, several kinds of flexible transparent electrodes such as metal nanowires, carbon-based materials (for example, carbon nanotubes or graphene) and metal grids coupled with other types of TEs were proposed for OLEDs4,5,6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among them, graphenean atomically thin sheet of sp2-hybridized carbon atomshas been regarded as promising because the unique combination of its inherent thinness and superior electrical characteristics is expected to allow for ideal transparent electrodes that have low or no optical haze, smooth surface topology preventing roughness-induced electrical short and degradation, high transmittance, low sheet resistance and a high degree of flexibility all at the same time10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Facile preparation of high-quality graphene on large-scale plastic substrates has recently been demonstrated for transparent electrodes with mass-production-compatible methods by industrial sectors, demonstrating their practical viability11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both single-layer graphene (SLG) and multi-layer graphene (MLG) were shown to have performance adequate for TEs in OLEDs13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, efficient graphene-based OLEDs were achieved with the help of hole injection layers (HILs) used to overcome their relatively low work function, which is known to be around 4.5 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such injection layers include conducting polymers with gradient electronic properties called a self-organized gradient HIL (GraHIL)13, and thin MoO3 buffer layers coupled with conducting polymers of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the power efficiency and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of these state-of-the-art graphene-based OLEDs were still on a par with those of ITO-based OLEDs, unless a bulky hemispherical lens was used for outcoupling enhancement14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Securing the highest possible efficiency is particularly important for flexible displays applied to highly portable or wearable applications, as they often have to rely on batteries with a fairly limited energy capacity due to constraints in size, weight or form factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This calls for the development of a device architecture that can maximize the efficiency of graphene-based OLEDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A key challenge is to develop a structure or methodology to unlock their full optical potential yet retains graphenes merits in form factors as much as possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To this end, we here explore a simple electrode architecture based on high-index TiO2 layers and low-index HILs sandwiching graphene electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the optical design that takes a full advantage of the synergetic collaboration between the high- and low-index layers controlling both cavity resonance enhancement and loss to surface plasmon polariton (SPP), the proposed graphene-based OLEDs exhibit ultrahigh EQE that is unprecedented in those using graphene as a transparent electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, unusually high resistance of TiO2 to flexural strain is revealed that enables plastic OLEDs that are not only efficient but also highly flexible.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Optical design of high-efficiency graphene-based OLEDs', 'The efficiency of OLEDs is limited ultimately by a finite outcoupling efficiency that is typically around 20% at best for devices with isotropic emitters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among various outcoupling enhancing schemes proposed to date15, a method based on microcavity resonance has advantages in that it maintains a planar geometry without using any micro/nano structuring or lenticular structure so that the OLEDs made thereof are not subject to electrical shorts and optical artefacts unfavourable for display application (for example, blurring, diffraction and so on) yet can exhibit highly pure, saturated red (R), green (G), blue (B) primary colours with the enhanced efficiency16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a weak but still significant microcavity effect, ITO-based OLEDs can also be optimized for maximum efficiency, without incurring any optical haze or blurring, simply by adjusting the thickness of ITO layers; in this scheme, first-order, 3/4 cavity design, where  refers to wavelength, is achieved with the open end of the cavity mode placed at the ITO/substrate interface18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of ITO-free, graphene-based OLEDs, however, graphene electrodes cannot be made thick enough to control the cavity length, which makes it challenging to enhance efficiency by the resonance effect20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As an alternative measure, one may place a thin layer with high refractive index (nH) underneath graphene layers as shown in Fig 1a in a way similar to dielectric capped thin-metal electrodes17,20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because light can pass through the graphene with little phase difference due to the inherent thinness of a graphene electrode, 3/4 cavity design can be achieved conveniently, for example, with the optical thickness of the organic plus injection layers and the high refractive index layer set at approximately 2/4 and /4, respectively (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the /4-thick high-index layer functions also as a metal-free, dielectric mirror that enables significant reflectance from bottom electrode assembly (Rbot) for light incident from organic layers, as can be confirmed in the graphs shown at the bottom of Fig 1c,d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provides graphene-based OLEDs with opportunities to enhance their efficiency via the resonance effect, which would not be possible otherwise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is shown that Rbot and concomitant resonance enhancement increase with nH (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high refractive index is also beneficial in terms of flexibility because the target optical thickness (nHdH) can be achieved with low physical thickness dH, and because bending-induced crack of a given film generally forms at a lower onset strain with a larger physical thickness23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A successful high-index layer in this scheme should thus have as large nH as possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it should be transparent, and, most of all, should not be damaged by a given graphene transfer process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among various candidates, a sputtered TiO2 layer is transparent in a visible spectral range and has a relatively high refractive index (n=2.5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike other high-index layers we tried, the TiO2 layer turns out to have chemical endurance robust against graphene transfer processes that use solvent, such as acetone or isopropyl alcohol (IPA), allowing for formation of a high-quality graphene electrode on its top (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Design overview of proposed high-efficiency graphene-based OLEDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic device structure of the proposed OLEDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Electromagnetic field intensity distribution (dashed lines) of the OLEDs under study for their respective first-order cavity design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The field-intensity distribution of the graphene-based OLED without TiO2 is also shown for comparison for the case where the thickness values of organic layers are same as the OLEDs with TiO2 but without low-index HILs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c,d) Calculated maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of graphene-based OLEDs with TiO2 under-layer as a function of TiO2 and organic layer thickness (dTiO2 and dorg, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dashed lines represent contour lines for EQE of 10, 20, 30 or 40% as indicated in the graph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Without a low-index HIL;

Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Note 1 for examples).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results indicate that the use of GraHIL redistributes the relative power contents among various modes towards smaller in-plane wave vectors such that the power coupled to SPP modes is reduced and the outcoupled portions are further enhanced (Supplementary Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can also be seen in Supplementary Table 2 that use of the TiO2 layer underneath graphene effectively suppresses the amount of the power coupled to waveguided and substrate modes via resonance enhancement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This leads to a significant increase in outcoupling efficiency, although loss to evanescent modes is also shown to increase due to the shift of transverse-electric waveguided modes towards higher normalized in-plane wave vectors (Supplementary Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combined use of high-index (H) TiO2 and low-index (L) GraHIL layers, results in an ideal situation where resonance enhancement is large, yet loss to SPP/evanescent modes is mitigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the combined use creates a situation similar to HL-stacks, typically used for multilayer thin-film coating30, and even further enhances Rbot (Fig 1d), allowing for additional enhancement in the FabryPerot resonance effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What makes the proposed technology unique and advanced with respect to conventional technologies is indeed the synergetic collaboration of these high- and low-index layers that enable optical management of both resonance effect and SPP loss to the advantage of maximal outcoupling; and additional resonance enhancement via HL stacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with their native compatibility with desired electrical properties (for example, efficient hole injection), all these optical benefits allow one to fully unlock even the hidden potential of what planar OLEDs can truly offer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contour plots obtained for optically available maximum EQE (EQE (max)) as a function of organic (dorg) and TiO2 thickness (dTiO2) presented in Fig 1c,d show that EQE (max) can be as high as 44% in devices with both GraHIL and TiO2 layers while it would be limited to 38% without GraHIL or to 31% without TiO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optimal conditions do correspond to a situation where dH (with H being TiO2) gets close to /(4nH) (55 nm for =550 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can also be noted that EQE (max) of 44% is higher than those expected for optimized, conventional thin-metal based cavity OLEDs with the same emitter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be attributed to the fact that the proposed architecture is less subject to the loss due to photon absorption and/or SPP mode excitation within semi-transparent electrodes (see Supplementary Fig 6 and Supplementary Table 3 for comparison with those of conventional thin-metal based cavity OLEDs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Synergetic optical effect of TiO2 as a high-index layer and GraHIL as a low-index HIL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) Calculated power dissipation spectra weighted with the emitter spectrum in arbitrary units (mapped as a colour defined in the colour bars.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  versus in-plane wave vector: (a) with TiO2 but without GraHIL;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'One may note that the proposed technology works in principle for a specific target wavelength and may accompany unwanted side effects such as angular colour shift, as it is based on resonance phenomena.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, it can be shown that it is applicable to all red (R), green (G) and blue (B) pixels simultaneously with a common TiO2 layer having the same thickness and can still lead to efficiency enhancement (see Supplementary Fig 10, Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Note 3 for more discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within this scheme, angular colour shift, typical for cavity-based OLEDs, can also be significantly suppressed for individual R, G, B as well as RGB-synthesized white with an only slight compromise in efficiency enhancement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, an ideal optical structure was proposed for graphene-based OLEDs, which leads to maximized efficiency while retaining their advantages in flexibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inherent thinness of graphene electrodes being considered, high-index TiO2 layers were placed underneath graphene to enable cavity resonance enhancement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the optical thickness of TiO2 layers set at /4, the first-order 3/4 cavity design was realized with the thickness of other layers falling within a range practical for electrical properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TiO2 layer with the optical thickness of /4 played a role as a high-reflectance coating and thus improved the resonance enhancement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conducting polymers of PEDOT:PSS or GraHIL adopted as hole-injection layers plays an additional yet substantial role as a low-index layer that further enhance the EQE by redistributing the optical power gained from reduction of SPP loss that limits the performance of first-order cavity OLEDs; and by increasing the reflectance from the bottom electrode assembly and thus leading to an additional improvement in FabryPerot resonance effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the proposed synergetic interplay between high- and low-index layers, the optimized OLEDs exhibited ultrahigh EQE and power efficiency of 40.8% and 160 lm W1; and 62.1% and 120 lm W1 for single- and multi-junction structures, respectively (64.7% and 250 lm W1; and 103% and 184 lm W1 with a half-ball lens attached), which are unprecedented for graphene-based OLEDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, efficient flexible OLEDs were demonstrated that can be bent to a radius of 2.3 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Independent study revealed that the TiO2 layer has an excellent flexural strain resistance unusual for most ceramic materials due to its crack deflection toughening mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When combined with its high refractive index, this unique property enabled highly flexible OLEDs with significantly enhanced efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the level of efficiency and bendability realized in this work, we believe the proposed method can pave the way for graphene-based OLEDs to become a next-generation light source balanced with both efficiency and form factor advantages.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
