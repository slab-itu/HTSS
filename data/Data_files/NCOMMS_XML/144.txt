RCAN1 links impaired neurotrophin trafficking to aberrant development of the sympathetic nervous system in Down syndrome  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal disorder affecting the nervous system in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, investigations of neural anomalies in Down syndrome have focused on the central nervous system, although dysfunction of the peripheral nervous system is a common manifestation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecular and cellular bases underlying peripheral abnormalities have remained undefined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report the developmental loss of sympathetic innervation in human Down syndrome organs and in a mouse model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that excess regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1), an endogenous inhibitor of the calcineurin phosphatase that is triplicated in Down syndrome, impairs neurotrophic support of sympathetic neurons by inhibiting endocytosis of the nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor, TrkA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetically correcting RCAN1 levels in Down syndrome mice markedly improves NGF-dependent receptor trafficking, neuronal survival and innervation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results uncover a critical link between calcineurin signalling, impaired neurotrophin trafficking and neurodevelopmental deficits in the peripheral nervous system in Down syndrome.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Down syndrome, a disorder that affects multiple tissues and results in delayed development and intellectual disability, is thought to originate from increased dosage of gene products encoded by human chromosome 21 (refs 1, 2, 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, investigations of anomalies in the nervous system in Down syndrome have predominantly focused on the central nervous system (CNS) where cognitive impairment has been proposed to stem, in part, from abnormal brain development and an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, individuals with Down syndrome also exhibit marked dysfunction of the peripheral nervous system5,6,7,8, the molecular and cellular bases of which remain undefined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sympathetic nervous system is a branch of the autonomic nervous system that is essential for organ homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Postganglionic sympathetic neurons innervate diverse peripheral organs and tissues to govern fundamental physiological processes including regulation of blood glucose levels, cardiac output and body temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An emergent concept is that a dysfunctional sympathetic nervous system might be an instigating factor in the pathogenesis of congestive heart failure and diabetes9,10, diseases that are more prevalent in individuals with Down syndrome than in the general population11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, individuals with Down syndrome have blunted cardiovascular responses to autonomic tasks including stress and exercise tests, and reduced secretion of the sympathetic neurotransmitter, norepinephrine12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, impaired autonomic regulation of heart rate and blood pressure in the absence of congenital heart defects has been observed in Down syndrome6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Autonomic dysfunction in Down syndrome has been associated with reduced physical work capacity and chronic incompetence, manifested as attenuated heart rate responses to exercise8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, chronotropic incompetence has been postulated to be predictive of coronary heart disease and early mortality14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although impaired autonomic functions are manifested in infants and young children with Down syndrome13, it remains unknown whether functional deficits originate, in part, from aberrant development of the sympathetic nervous system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Based on animal studies, the best characterized molecular player in sympathetic nervous system development is nerve growth factor (NGF), a neurotrophin that is secreted by peripheral tissues16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In newborn mice, genetic ablation of NGF or its cognate receptor, TrkA, results in diminished innervation of peripheral targets and loss of post-mitotic sympathetic neurons17,18,19, whereas transgenic overexpression of NGF in target tissues enhances sympathetic growth into final target fields20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As NGF is released by neuronal targets, a salient feature of NGF signalling in polarized neurons is the regulation of endocytic trafficking of its TrkA receptors and intracellular signalling from internalized receptors22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NGF promotes endocytosis of TrkA receptors in distal axons into NGF:TrkA-containing signalling endosomes that are retrogradely transported back to cell bodies to exert transcriptional control of neuronal survival and long-term growth23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the functional relevance of neurotrophin trafficking has been most appreciated during normal development, a corollary view is that dysregulation of endocytic trafficking could be the basis for decreased neurotrophic support in developmental disorders and late-onset neurodegenerative diseases22,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, little is known about molecular mechanisms that impair neurotrophin trafficking in a disease state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we report a pronounced loss of sympathetic innervation in a mouse model of Down syndrome and human Down syndrome tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify an underlying mechanism that links perturbed endocytic trafficking of NGF receptors to developmental defects in neuronal survival and axon growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings implicate deficient calcineurin phosphatase signalling through overexpression of regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1), an endogenous calcineurin inhibitor that is triplicated in Down syndrome, in contributing to aberrant development by interfering with receptor endocytosis and retrograde trophic signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, using transgenic mice trisomic for RCAN1 alone as well as genetically correcting RCAN1 levels in Down syndrome mice, we establish a causal link between increased RCAN1 dosage, impaired neurotrophin receptor trafficking and developmental abnormalities in the sympathetic nervous system in Down syndrome.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Sympathetic innervation is reduced in down syndrome tissues', 'To investigate the sympathetic nervous system in Down syndrome, we employed a mouse model of Down syndrome, Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice, that harbour a 22.9-Mb duplication spanning the entire region of mouse chromosome 16 syntenic with human chromosome 21 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice are trisomic solely for the human 21q11-q22.3 syntenic region compared with the widely used Ts65Dn model, and exhibit cognitive, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal phenotypes recapitulating that observed in humans with Down syndrome26,27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed whole-mount immunostaining for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a marker for noradrenergic neurons, to examine the formation of the entire sympathetic chain ganglia and their axonal projections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined mice at embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5), a stage when neurogenesis, migration and noradrenergic specification are completed in the murine sympathetic nervous system18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that sympathetic chain ganglia had coalesced into discrete condensations, with axonal projections coursing along the intercostal arteries in both Dp(16)1Yey/+ and litter-mate embryos (Supplementary Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, TH immunohistochemistry and quantification of cell numbers using Nissl staining in tissue sections revealed no significant differences in size, shape and neuronal numbers in the superior cervical ganglia (SCG), the rostral-most ganglia in the sympathetic chain, between E16.5 Dp(16)1Yey/+ and wild-type embryos (Supplementary Fig 1ce).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, early developmental processes including neuronal production, migration and specification in the sympathetic nervous system are unaffected in Down syndrome mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Examination of innervation of distal target fields, however, revealed a marked impairment in E16.5 Dp(16)1Yey/+ embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sympathetic fibres reached and innervated end-organs such as the spleen, heart and nasal epithelium in Dp(16)1Yey/+ embryos, but the axons were shorter, sparser and less branched within the target fields (Fig 1af and Supplementary Fig 1fh).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further examination of innervation at post-natal day 0.5 (P0.5) revealed fewer sympathetic fibres in the nasal epithelium (Fig 1gi) and salivary glands (Supplementary Fig 1ik) in Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice, compared with control litter-mates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of SCG neuronal numbers revealed a substantial 45% decrease in Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice at P0.5 (Fig 1jl), and a concomitant increase in apoptotic profiles (Fig 1mo).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Decreased sympathetic innervation in Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice and human Down syndrome tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (af) Sympathetic innervation of target organs is decreased in Dp(16)1Yey/+ embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whole-mount tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunostaining of the spleen (a,b) and heart (c,d) reveals that axons are shorter, thinner and less branched in E16.5 Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice compared with litter-mate controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher magnification images of the heart are shown in e,f.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Terminal extension and branching within the target fields are indicated by arrowheads and arrows, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Representative images are shown from at least three animals per genotype that were analysed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 200 m for a,b, 500 m for c,d and 200 m for e,f.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (gi) Reduced sympathetic innervation of nasal epithelium in Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice compared with wild-type litter-mates at birth (P0.5), determined by TH immunohistochemistry of tissue sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DAPI staining is included to reveal the cellular material in the entire tissue section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values are the mean±s.e.m., n=3 for each genotype, **P less_than 0.01, Scale bar, 50 m.

'Given these developmental abnormalities in the mouse model of Down syndrome, we then assessed sympathetic innervation of peripheral organs from Down syndrome infants (see Supplementary Table 1 for specimen details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human spleen and pancreatic tissues were subjected to TH immunostaining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with control tissues, we observed a pronounced decrease of TH-positive fibres in the Down syndrome spleen (Fig 1pr) and pancreatic (Fig 1su) tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification revealed a significant reduction in TH immunoreactivity in the Down syndrome tissues compared with controls (P=0.01 for spleen, P=0.026 for pancreas, t-test, n=3 each for Down syndrome and normal donor tissues).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-labelling with antibodies against smooth muscle actin to mark the spleen vasculature (Fig 1p,q and Supplementary Fig 2a,b), and insulin and glucagon to identify pancreatic islets (Fig 1s,t and Supplementary Fig 2f,g), showed no overall disruptions in tissue morphology in the Down syndrome samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, haematoxylin and eosin staining revealed intact tissue structure and similar histology between the Down syndrome and control tissues (Supplementary Fig 2d,e,i,j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address if the innervation defect in Down syndrome tissues was specific to sympathetic axons, we performed immunostaining for neurofilament, a pan-neuronal marker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a trend towards decreased neurofilament immunoreactivity in the Down syndrome spleen (Supplementary Fig 2ac) and pancreas (Supplementary Fig 2fh), although these deficits were not as severe as the decreases in TH immunoreactivity, and were not statistically different from control tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is likely due to sympathetic nerves constituting only a fraction of total peripheral innervation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Double labelling revealed that 30% of the neurofilament-immunoreactive fibres innervating the human spleen and pancreatic tissues are TH positive (Supplementary Fig 2q,x).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, we observed a significant reduction in the amount of TH/neurofilament-double-positive axons in Down syndrome tissues (Supplementary Fig 2kx).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these findings provide evidence of aberrant sympathetic nervous system development in human Down syndrome tissues, analogous to that in Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Trk endocytosis is attenuated in Dp(16)1Yey/+ neurons', 'The deficits in sympathetic innervation in Dp(16)1Yey/+ embryos at E16.5 were reminiscent of phenotypes observed in mice lacking the target-derived neurotrophin, NGF19,29, which is known to control axonal extension and arborization when sympathetic axons have reached their final destinations16,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The neuronal loss observed at P0.5, when sympathetic axons are actively engaged in a developmental survival competition for limiting amounts of NGF16, and the magnitude of the loss, similar to that in new-born TrkA/ mice18, further implicate a failure in NGF signalling in Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using an ELISA-based immunoassay, we found a significant 43.5% decrease in NGF protein levels in SCG lysates from Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, NGF levels in the salivary glands were similar to that in wild-type mice (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The salivary glands are the primary source of NGF for the SCG30; NGF produced in the salivary glands binds to TrkA receptors on sympathetic axons, and following endocytosis, is retrogradely transported to cell bodies located within the SCG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to salivary glands, normal NGF levels were also found in another sympathetic target organ, the heart, in Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that diminished innervation and neuronal loss in Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice arise from deficits in NGF uptake and/or retrograde transport in sympathetic neurons rather than decreased NGF production in target tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Impaired ligand-dependent endocytosis of Trk receptors in Dp(16)1Yey/+ neurons.

protein accumulation in sympathetic neuron cell bodies in Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice, we examined endocytic trafficking of Trk receptors using a chimeric Trk receptor-based, live-cell antibody feeding assay in cultured neurons33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cultured sympathetic neurons isolated from P0.5 Dp(16)1Yey/+ and wild-type mice were infected with an adenoviral vector expressing FLAG-tagged chimeric receptors that have the extracellular domain of TrkB and the transmembrane and intracellular domains of TrkA (FLAG-TrkB:A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sympathetic neurons do not normally express TrkB receptors, and the chimeric Trk receptors respond to the TrkB ligand, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), but retain the signalling properties of TrkA33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using live-cell immunocytochemistry with an antibody directed against the extracellular FLAG epitope, we observed prominent receptor internalization in response to neurotrophin stimulation in both the cell bodies (Fig 2c,d) and axons (Fig 2g,h) in wild-type neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, ligand-dependent internalization was markedly attenuated in Dp(16)1Yey/+ neurons (Fig 2e,f,i,j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although neurotrophin treatment enhanced Trk receptor internalization by 2.2±0.2-fold in cell bodies, and 1.6±0.15-fold in axons in wild-type neurons, there were no significant differences between the un-stimulated and ligand-treated conditions in Dp(16)1Yey/+ neurons (Fig 2k,l).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results indicate that ligand-dependent endocytosis of Trk receptors is attenuated in Dp(16)1Yey/+ sympathetic neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Excess RCAN1 inhibits TrkA endocytosis', 'Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice are trisomic for 113 genes orthologous to human chromosome 21 (refs 26, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased dosage of one or more of these genes could serve as the molecular locus for impaired Trk receptor trafficking and the aberrant development of the sympathetic nervous system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A clue to the identity of the responsible gene came from our previous observations that the calcium-calmodulin-activated phosphatase, calcineurin, is necessary for NGF-dependent endocytosis of TrkA receptors, and for sympathetic innervation of target tissues34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the 113 trisomic genes in Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice is RCAN1, originally named Downs syndrome candidate region 1 (DSCR1) because of the gene locus within human chromosome 21 (refs 35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RCAN1 belongs to a family of endogenous calcineurin inhibitors that are highly conserved from yeast to humans37,38,39,40,41,42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RCAN1 expression is enriched in tissues that are particularly vulnerable in Down syndrome, including the nervous system, heart and skeletal muscle, and its levels are significantly elevated in individuals with Down syndrome and mouse models35,36,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a significant (58%) decrease in calcineurin phosphatase activity in SCG lysates from P0.5 Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice (see Fig 7b for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we hypothesized that dysfunctional calcineurin signalling through increased RCAN1 dosage is a potential link between

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this study, we report the aberrant development of the sympathetic nervous system in Down syndrome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding provides an anatomical basis for the reported autonomic dysfunction in the disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Down syndrome is a complex genetic disorder believed to arise from the trisomy of many genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we define that increased dosage of a single gene, RCAN1, exerts pronounced effects on the development of sympathetic neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further show that excess RCAN1, a genetic inhibitor of calcineurin phosphatase activity, interferes with phosphoregulation of dynamin1, internalization of TrkA receptors and retrograde trophic signalling by NGF (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our findings provide new insight into the poorly understood cellular pathways that are aberrant in Down syndrome, and define a framework for further investigations into the role of sympathetic innervation in the pathogenesis of the disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A key question is whether, in the context of trisomy of 113 genes in the Dp(16)1Yey/+ mouse model of Down syndrome, increased expression of RCAN1 is primarily responsible for the sympathetic nervous system phenotypes that we observed?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that triplication of RCAN1 alone was sufficient to mimic the loss of neurons and diminished sympathetic innervation in Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also showed that deleting a single copy of RCAN1 in the Dp(16)1Yey/+ mouse model led to marked improvements in the sympathetic nervous system phenotypes, although reducing RCAN1 dosage did not fully restore neuronal numbers and innervation in Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, calcineurin activity, although significantly improved by reducing RCAN1 levels in Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice, was also not completely restored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice, decreased calcineurin activity may not simply be attributable to increased RCAN1 expression but may also result from an imbalance of RCAN1 activity, perhaps mediated by interactions with other trisomic gene products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RCAN1 phosphorylation by dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (Dyrk1a), a trisomic gene product also known to regulate calcineurin signalling and implicated in Down syndrome phenotypes, has been reported to augment RCAN1s inhibitory activity towards calcineurin49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, increased gene dosage of Dyrk1a could act together with RCAN1 overexpression to suppress calcineurin activity and contribute to the observed sympathetic nervous system phenotypes in Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results, therefore, do not preclude the contribution of other trisomic genes to the disruptions in sympathetic nervous system development in Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice, either by impinging on RCAN1 regulation as exemplified above for Dyrk1a, or via RCAN1-independent mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, based on our findings that RCAN1 gene triplication alone is sufficient to substantially disrupt NGF-dependent development of sympathetic neurons, and importantly, that these defects in Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice are significantly ameliorated by normalizing RCAN1 levels, we conclude that an imbalance in RCAN1 gene dosage is a key contributing mechanism to the sympathetic phenotypes in Down syndrome mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our findings support the view that sympathetic defects in Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice arise from a failure in target-derived NGF signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice, we observed attenuated innervation of end-organs and loss of post-mitotic neurons during a developmental period (E16.5 to P0.5) of known dependence on NGF trophic signalling16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sympathetic deficits in Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice are reminiscent of phenotypes observed in mice lacking NGF or TrkA17,18,19,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although several cellular processes could potentially contribute to enhanced apoptosis and diminished innervation in Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice, our findings support excess RCAN1-mediated disruption of TrkA endocytosis as a key mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The retrograde accumulation of NGF protein was decreased in Dp(16)1Yey/+ sympathetic ganglia, despite normal NGF production in targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TrkA receptor endocytosis in nerve terminals is an essential step in retrograde NGF trophic signalling23,29,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, ligand-dependent TrkA endocytosis was abolished in Dp(16)1Yey/+ and RCAN1 overexpressing sympathetic neurons, whereas deleting a copy of RCAN1 in Dp(16)1Yey/+ sympathetic neurons normalized receptor internalization, which correlated with improved neuronal survival and target innervation in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, RCAN1 overexpression in compartmentalized neurons markedly compromised the ability of NGF to support retrograde trophic signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these findings provide evidence in support of a relationship between excess RCAN1, impaired TrkA endocytosis and decreased neurotrophic support of NGF-responsive sympathetic neurons in Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During endocytic trafficking in neurons, neurotrophin receptors are not passive passengers being carried along by a constitutively operating endocytic machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, Trk receptor tyrosine kinase-initiated signals actively modulate the endocytic machinery to drive their own trafficking31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously demonstrated that TrkA signalling drives its own internalization by recruiting PLC-, which then stimulates calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation of neuron-specific splicing isoforms of dynamin1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that excess RCAN1 interferes with this TrkA-initiated endocytic signalling pathway, but does not generally impede clathrin-mediated endocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we found that RCAN1 overexpression uniquely compromises neuronal survival when NGF is present on distal axons, but that RCAN1 overexpressing neurons are healthy and viable with NGF added directly to cell bodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these findings support the view that excess RCAN1 does not elicit non-specific endocytic deficits in sympathetic neurons, but interferes with the propagation of long-distance NGF endosomal signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Intriguingly, similar to Down syndrome individuals, RCAN1 mRNA levels are elevated two- to threefold in the brains of Alzheimers disease patients50.

to human chromosome 21 genes, indicative of common pathogenetic mechanisms51,52,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings raise a question of whether RCAN1 accumulation could underlie decreased neurotrophic support and ultimate degeneration of NGF-responsive adult CNS neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons are a TrkA-expressing CNS population that undergo age-dependent atrophy in humans with Downs syndrome and Alzheimers disease54,55,56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As mouse models of Down syndrome and Alzheimers disease exhibit decreased retrograde transport of NGF from hippocampal and cortical target regions of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, disturbed trophic support has been suggested to underlie neuronal atrophy24,57,58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the well-established trophic dependence of developing peripheral neurons on NGF:TrkA signalling and trafficking, genetic deletion of NGF or TrkA in mice does not compromise the survival of the majority of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons17,59,60,61,62, but results in defects in cholinergic input to the cortex and hippocampus and the downregulation of cholinergic neurotransmitter synthesizing enzymes59,60,61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When tested in behavioral tasks, conditional mutant mice lacking NGF:TrkA signalling showed either no cognitive impairment62 or mild cognitive decline61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike sympathetic neurons that rely on a single neurotrophin, NGF, for neuronal survival and target innervation during development, basal forebrain cholinergic neurons are responsive to multiple neurotrophins63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, although the requirement of TrkA trafficking in promoting sympathetic neuron development is well-documented31,32, there is less evidence to support a role for TrkA trafficking in basal forebrain cholinergic neuron development and maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, further studies are warranted to clarify the relationship between TrkA trafficking and neurotrophic support of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, and to define a possible contribution of excess RCAN1 to neurodegeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previously, we found that genetic ablation
