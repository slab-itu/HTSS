Seepage from an arctic shallow marine gas hydrate reservoir is insensitive to momentary ocean warming  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Arctic gas hydrate reservoirs located in shallow water and proximal to the sediment-water interface are thought to be sensitive to bottom water warming that may trigger gas hydrate dissociation and the release of methane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we evaluate bottom water temperature as a potential driver for hydrate dissociation and methane release from a recently discovered, gas-hydrate-bearing system south of Spitsbergen (Storfjordrenna, 380 m water depth).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modelling of the non-steady-state porewater profiles and observations of distinct layers of methane-derived authigenic carbonate nodules in the sediments indicate centurial to millennial methane emissions in the region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results of temperature modelling suggest limited impact of short-term warming on gas hydrates deeper than a few metres in the sediments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that the ongoing and past methane emission episodes at the investigated sites are likely due to the episodic ventilation of deep reservoirs rather than warming-induced gas hydrate dissociation in this shallow water seep site.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Gas hydrate is an ice-like compound that is stable under high pressure and low temperature conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dissociating 1 litre of fully saturated gas hydrate releases 169 of methane under atmospheric pressure1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arctic gas hydrate reservoirs are estimated to hold 100500 gigatons of carbon2,3, more than 10% of the carbon in global gas hydrate reservoirs2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current models predict a high potential of Arctic gas hydrate dissociation if bottom water temperatures increase by two degrees during the next century3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, gas hydrate dissociation due to a 1 °C warming of bottom water has been hypothesized to explain hydroacoustic flares observed in water depths shallower than 400 m west of Prins Karls Forland (PKF)4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the recent recovery of carbonate crusts from PKF points to a longer history of gas venting5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Excluding the permafrost area in the Arctic Ocean, gas hydrate recovery has been achieved in water depth at 740 m in the Canadian Beaufort Sea6 and of 1,200 m water depth at Vestnesa Ridge in Fram Strait7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, there has been no recovery of gas hydrates in the shelf/slope region of the Arctic, such as PKF4,5, the shelf area of the Beaufort Sea8 and the Barents Sea9,10, regions where increasing bottom water temperatures are thought to have the largest influence on gas hydrate stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gas hydrates have only been inferred from the presence of bottom simulating reflectors in seismic data from these areas8,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hypothesis that Arctic methane seepage is enhanced by warming-triggered gas hydrate dissociation cannot be fully evaluated without direct evidence for the presence of gas hydrates in these warming-sensitive regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we present and model the porewater data from a recently discovered shallow water cold seep south of Svalbard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The porewater profiles exhibit concave-up shapes, an indication of an evolving and non-steady-state environment11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sulfate profiles are used as a proxy for the activity of anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM)14, which in turn responds to methane ascending from deeper sediment towards the sediment-water interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using transport-reaction models to simulate the temporal development of the porewater system, we investigate the potential mechanisms leading to the concave-up sulfate profiles, and conclude that these are due to increases in methane flux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model results also indicate that the timing for the latest methane pulse varies significantly among the investigated sites, suggesting that such events do not respond to regional perturbations such as bottom water warming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, we examine whether bottom water warming can be a plausible mechanism as proposed by previous studies2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present evidence to show that short-term warming has limited impact on the gas hydrate stability at the investigated area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our results indicate that the ongoing and past methane emission events in this region likely reflect the natural state of a fluid system that is controlled by the state properties of gas reservoirs, the episodic opening of fluid conduits and potential self-sealing by gas hydrate and/or carbonate concretions, as shown in gas hydrate provinces elsewhere15,16,17,18.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Description of sediment and porewater profiles', 'Here, we describe a group of gas-hydrate-bearing mounds in the slope area south of Svalbard (Storfjordrenna, 380 m water depth, Fig 1a and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mounds are 500 m in diameter and extend 10 m in height above the seafloor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydroacoustic imaging of bubble plumes in the water column, commonly referred to hydroacoustic flares (Fig 1b), and visual observations of bubble streams rising from the seafloor confirm active methane seepage in this area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reported the sediment and porewater data from seven gravity cores and one multi core recovered during two expeditions in May and October 2015 (Fig 1c, Table 1 and Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Core IDs will be abbreviated throughout the text ignoring the cruise number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gas hydrates were observed in three of the cores (911GC, 912GC and 1520GC) with the shallow-most recovery at 0.85 m below seafloor (mbsf).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore term these mound-like structures, Gas Hydrate Mounds (GHMs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microfractures, commonly attributed to gas expansion during core recovery, were observed in the three cores with gas hydrate as well as in cores 940GC and 1521GC (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Basic information and the available data from these sediment cores can be found in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In five of the cores, we observed discrete authigenic carbonate nodules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their mineralogy and carbon isotopic composition are listed in Supplementary Table

core scanning for stratigraphic correlation (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zr/Rb ratio is a proxy for sediment grain size19, which is not affected by methane-derived diagenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of oxidized layers in cores 920GC, 940GC and 1522GC (as shown in Fig 2 and Supplementary Fig 1) adds additional constraints to this age model using literature attributions to these changes described

 On the basis of our stratigraphic correlation, we conclude that, between ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9 and 16 kyrBP, at least four of the sites experienced similar sedimentation rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The short recovery in other four sites precludes correlations with the rest of the cores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, based on Zr/Rb profiles, we speculate that sediment in these sites (911GC, 912GC, 1521GC and 904MC) is younger than Pleistocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also notice that, some of the sites may experience more intensive erosion than the others as their upper sediments (920GC, 1520GC and 1522GC) are apparently older relative to the top of 940GC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notwithstanding, the slightly varied but similar depositional characteristics among the sites exclude the influence of major sedimentation events, such as mass transport deposits (MTDs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Age model for the studied sediment cores.We compiled Zr/Rb ratio from XRF core scanning, the observations of oxidized layers, and two 14C dating from planktonic foraminifera to establish the age model for our coring sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A sedimentation rate of 2.21(±0.009) × 104 m yr1 was estimated between 0.71 and 2.21 mbsf at 1522GC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxidized layers observed in cores 920GC, 940GC and 1522GC provide an additional constraint for our stratigraphic correlation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The four

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'There are many published explanations for the presence of non-steady-state porewater profiles in marine sediments worldwide21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To find the most plausible explanation for our observations, we simulated five different scenarios with a comprehensive transport-reaction model that considers 15 primary porewater species, seven mineral phases and six redox reactions (Fig 4; see Methods for modelling details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model is constrained by the measurements of seven key porewater species (SO42,HS, TA, Fe2+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and NH4+).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scenarios we considered are: irrigation and seawater intrusion due to biological, physical and hydrological processes12,22 (Scen1); changes in sedimentary properties, such as sedimentation rate11,13 (Scen2) and porosity (Scen3); and changes in methane flux23 (Scen4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although strong upwards advection of fluid is unlikely to result in the observed curvatures in our porewater profiles, we still considered a scenario with an advection component to simulate its impact on the porewater profiles (Scen5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Simulation results from five scenarios that may explain the non-steady-state profiles.We applied a comprehensive model to investigate the cause of the non-steady-state profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first two scenarios (Scen1 and Scen2) can reproduce the kinks in some porewater data but fail to fit the ammonium and iron profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scen3 is dedicated to simulate the porewater profiles with significant porosity contrast which is not expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model results fail to fit the observed profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only with an increase in methane flux (Scen4), we can fit all porewater profiles with the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aqueous advection (Scen5) will result in concave-downwards profiles for sulfate, calcium and magnesium, which were not observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore conclude that advection is not significant at the investigated sites.Full size image', 'In Scen1, we initiated the model with a shallow SMTZ (grey lines of Scen1 in Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluid with bottom seawater composition intrudes into surficial sediments by advection, which results in the observed concave-up sulfate profile (blue lines of Scen1 in Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model can reproduce the observed sulfate profile with a downwards fluid advection rate of 1 m yr1 in 3 months, a similar rate and timescale to what were reported elsewhere12,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the modelled NH4+ profile is significantly lower than what is measured due to the dilution from seawater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such results help us exclude this explanation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In Scen2, we assumed the top 30 cm of the sediments was initially a layer of MTD with homogenized porewater and sediment composition, which are identical to the composition of bottom seawater and seafloor sediments (grey lines in Scen2 of Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six months after the initial condition, diffusion gradually smoothes the profile to the currently observed sulfate profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this scenario, we can reproduce most of the porewater profiles but not Fe2+, NH4+ and HS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we assumed that the MTD was composed of oxidized sediments with abundant iron hydroxide, the oxidized iron is soon reduced to Fe2+ that precipitates as pyrite with hydrogen sulfide, a different scenario from what we have observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, within the 6-month period of simulation, organic matter degradation is not rapid enough to release the observed level of NH4+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not only this model scenario fails to explain the porewater profiles, our age model (Fig 2) indicates no such abrupt sedimentation event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In Scen3, we evaluated the case with contrasting low porosity in the sediments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assumed sediments with very low porosity (50%) were deposited for nine centuries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such deposition results in a 27.5-cm layer of low porosity barrier with the sedimentation rate we assigned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The grey lines of Scen3 in Fig 4 show the simulation results without such low porosity layer on top, while the blue lines show the results with a low porosity barrier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that such low porosity barrier results in concave-downwards porewater profiles that are different from what we observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such porosity contrast is also not expected based on the Cl ratio obtained from XRF core scanning from our sites, which was used as a proxy for water content26,27 (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results exclude such explanation for our profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In Scen4, we simulated the case with an increasing methane flux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulation results show that an elevated methane flux can deflect the porewater profiles of SO42,HS, TA, Fe2+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ while not affecting the profile of NH4+, in agreement with our observations (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore conclude this is the most likely scenario to explain the observed profiles among the four scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although such model assessment was only performed on the data from 911GC/904MC, we can attribute the same conclusion to 940GC and 1520GC based on the similarity in their porewater profiles (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In our last scenario (Scen5), we assumed an upwards aqueous advection rate of 1 m yr1 to investigate how the porewater profiles will be impacted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A high methane flux was also assigned to this scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To fit the measured NH4+ profile, we assigned a lower concentration for the initial condition of NH4+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a S-shaped sulfate profile due to both the high methane flux and advection rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concaved downwards profiles were observed from Ca2+, and Mg2+ (only Ca2+ profile is shown), which are different from the measured profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By adding such advective component to our model, we are not able to fit most of our porewater profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore conclude that aqueous advection is a less significant process compared to diffusion at our study sites and cannot explain our observations in porewater profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As a step further, we aim to estimate the relative timing of changes in methane flux as this information will be valuable for determining its triggering mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the flux of methane increases at the same time across the investigated GHM, then the system must be responding to regional forcing, such as bottom seawater warming-triggered gas hydrate dissociation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, if the timing of methane pulses varies among the investigated sites that are only a few hundred metres apart, then we can conclude that the triggering mechanism must have high geographical heterogeneity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To estimate the timing of the methane pulses, we simulated the evolution of sulfate profiles at the three coring sites with non-steady-state profiles as they evolve from an initial steady-state situation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As this simulation has to include the entire sediment column above the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ), it is computationally too challenging to implement our comprehensive model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore use a reduced model that focuses exclusively on sulfate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reduced model assumes that sulfate profiles above the kinks are relics of the profiles when the methane supply was weak, for example, 00.65 mbsf at 1520GC (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We derived the initial conditions for each site by executing the same reduced model and adjusting the methane supply from the base of the GHSZ until the results fit the shallow part of the sulfate profile (see Methods section for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assume a purely diffusional porewater system with AOM as the only reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By matching our simulations with the observed sulfate profiles, we find that the latest increase in methane supply at the GHM summit was initiated fairly recent (160340 years at 911GC), and is later than the pulses at its southern (290630 years at 1520GC) and eastern (19004100 years at 940GC) flanks (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the modelled methane concentration profiles, we can also infer the depths where methane concentration exceeds its saturation in porewater (as calculated by CSMGem1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These depths, as shown in Fig 5, are above the shallowest occurrence of gas hydrates (from cores 911GC to 1520GC) and correspond to the shallowest depth where microfractures were observed in the sediments (Supplementary Fig 1), a feature that reflects gas expansion during core recovery of sediments with high methane content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such results suggest that not only does the currently observed Storfjordrenna GHM seepage began before the onset of the Anthropocene but the seepage timing differs by orders of magnitude among sites located only a few hundred metres apart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such results point to triggering mechanisms that are heterogeneous in space and may operate over geological timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Simulation of non-steady-state porewater profiles for the timing of methane seepages.We applied the reduced model on 911GC (a,b), 940GC (c,d) and 1520GC (e,f) to estimate the timing of seepage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Orange lines in a, (c,e) are initial sulfate concentrations used in the model which are identical to the black lines in b, (d,f) for the corresponding depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These initial conditions were constrained by the shallow part of the measured sulfate profiles (orange dots in all panels) where concentration gradients are small.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blue lines in a, (c,e) are initial profiles for methane whereas the blue lines in b, (d,f) are model output for methane, which were also constrained by the first appearance of gas hydrates (yellow bars).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evolution of the modelled sulfate profiles (tortuosity equals to 1.5) at each site were presented in b, (d,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rate of evolution largely depends on the rate of sulfate consumption through anaerobic oxidation of methane, which is fastest at 911GC and slowest at 940GC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model results reflect differences in the timescales of methane seepage among the three coring sites that are in geographical vicinity.Full size image', 'Our time estimates may be compromised by not including an advective component in the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Advection will accelerate the ascending of methane and shorten the time required to achieve the observed concave-up sulfate profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the measured porewater profiles do not correspond to those simulated with advection (Scen5 in Fig 4), we conclude that whereas methane gas is clearly migrating upwards, there is no significant component of aqueous advection at our sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the observation that the solute profiles in sites with gas discharge (911GC) and those without any evidence of active bubbling (for example, 940GC and 1520GC) can both be simulated with a diffusion-based approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decoupling between a gas phase transport dominated by advection concurrent with solute distributions that are dominated by diffusion have been documented in other gas hydrate systems28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our time estimates based on the assumption of a solute diffusion is therefore reasonable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'From our time estimates based on porewater simulations, we infer that the triggering mechanism for a methane flux increase cannot be explained by warming-induced gas hydrate dissociation due to the contrasting timescales within a small region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, as ocean warming has been postulated to drive gas hydrate dissociation along the Svalbard slope region4, we simulated the propagation of bottom water temperature into the sediments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We aim to elucidate both the depth and the time duration of sediment exposure to temperatures exceeding the gas hydrate phase boundary (see Methods section for model details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For the past century, the Storfjordrenna area experienced seasonal fluctuations in bottom water temperature from 1.8 to 4.6 °C with occasional anomalies up to 5.5 °C (Fig 6a, data from World Ocean Database29; see Supplementary Table 3 for different data choosing criteria) in response to the dynamic interaction between the warmer Atlantic water and colder Arctic water along the polar front30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No apparent warming is observed from Fig 6a although we acknowledge the scarcity of temperature measurements in the past two decades.

entire sediment column (Fig 6k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gas hydrates were recovered from 0.85 (911GC) to 2.9 mbsf (1520GC) during these 2 months suggesting that gas hydrate dynamics do not respond quickly to the seasonal temperature fluctuations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our exercise shows that gas hydrates present in sediments deeper than 1.65 mbsf will stay within the stability field throughout the year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation again rules out warming-induced gas hydrate dissociation as the cause for the methane flux increase at the investigated coring sites, since our simulations show that the methane pulse responsible for the observed non-steady-state sulfate profiles originates below the current SMZT (0.52.2 mbsf, Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We also examined the temperature sensitivity of the system with two different warming trends (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this model exercise, in addition to the sinusoidal fluctuations in seasonal temperature, a steady increase in mean temperature was assigned to account for the warming in bottom water temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assume an annual warming of 0.033 °C for 30 years in our fast warming case4 (Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparing the assigned temperature fluctuations with the compiled temperature data between 1951 and 1981, the assigned temperatures in summer are comparable to the record temperature

authigenic carbonates from Barents Sea31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accurate dating of their formation using U/Th dating technique is not possible due to extensive clay particle incorporation within the carbonate matrix31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, we interpret these carbonates as indicators of a prolonged and episodic methane seepage history at the GHMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the bicarbonate ion produced from AOM at the horizon of SMTZ diffuses both upwards and downwards, authigenic carbonates typically form around the prevailing SMTZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, carbonates nodules immediately above and below the current depth of SMTZ likely originate from recent episodes of methane discharge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carbonates nodules recovered deeper in the cores suggest prior seepage events such

explained by the natural ventilation of a methane reservoir primarily modulated by pressure conditions at and beneath the GHSZ, and the opening/sealing of conduits in the sediments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar mechanisms for episodic methane venting events have been demonstrated to be plausible by modelling16 and field observations17 at other gas-hydrate-bearing margins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, it is also likely that gas supply from the reservoir has always been strong but is continuously being redirected due to obstacles in the sediment or near the seafloor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

to future warming scenarios have augmented this concern2, lending more urgency to the search for methane bubbles entering the ocean at the seafloor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to this perspective, our
