Replication stress caused by low MCM expression limits fetal erythropoiesis and hematopoietic stem cell functionality  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Replicative stress during embryonic development influences ageing and predisposition to disease in adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A protective mechanism against replicative stress is provided by the licensing of thousands of origins in G1 that are not necessarily activated in the subsequent S-phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These dormant origins provide a backup in the presence of stalled forks and may confer flexibility to the replication program in specific cell types during differentiation, a role that has remained unexplored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show, using a mouse strain with hypomorphic expression of the origin licensing factor mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM)3 that limiting origin licensing in vivo affects the functionality of hematopoietic stem cells and the differentiation of rapidly-dividing erythrocyte precursors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mcm3-deficient erythroblasts display aberrant DNA replication patterns and fail to complete maturation, causing lethal anemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that hematopoietic progenitors are particularly sensitive to replication stress, and full origin licensing ensures their correct differentiation and functionality.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The process of genomic duplication starts at replication origins, which are licensed in the G1 phase of the cell division cycle, several hours before their activation in S phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The licensing process is led by the origin recognition complex (ORC), cell division cycle 6 (CDC6) and Cdc10-dependent transcript 1 (CDT1) proteins, which cooperate to engage the mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) complex with the DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MCM, composed by essential subunits MCM2-7, displays DNA helicase activity and becomes part of the replisome machinery (reviewed in references1,2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Defective control of DNA replication causes replicative stress (RS), which is the underlying cause of several developmental diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations in ORC, CDC6 and CDT1 genes are related to Meier-Gorlin syndrome, a type of dwarfism3,4,5, and mutations in MCM4 are linked to growth retardation, adrenal insufficiency and natural killer cell deficiency6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Impaired MCM function also increases cancer susceptibility7,8,9,10,11,12,13 (reviewed in references14,15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'MCM complexes are normally loaded onto DNA in excess relative to the number of origins that fire during the S phase (reviewed in reference16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One function of the surplus of MCM is to license dormant origins that may be activated in response to stalled or collapsed forks, providing a rescue mechanism under RS17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another possible function for the high number of licensed origins, which remains largely underexplored, is to provide flexibility to the replication process during early embryonic development20,21 or in cell differentiation contexts that require the activation or shut-off of specific origins22,23,24 (reviewed in references25,26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To investigate the protective effects of MCM against RS in vivo, a new Mcm3 conditional knockout (KO) mouse model was designed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The targeted allele, Mcm3-Lox, was hypomorphically expressed and caused embryonic lethality in homozygosity, which could be partially alleviated in a genetic background with enhanced resistance to RS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show how a full complement of MCM proteins is specifically required to preserve the functionality of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and the proper differentiation and maturation of erythrocytes in the developing embryo.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'A hypomorphic Mcm3 allele causes embryonic lethality', 'A modified mouse Mcm3 allele was designed with loxP sites flanking exons 1417 and a luciferase reporter inserted at the 3 UTR under the control of an IRES element.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resultant allele (Mcm3-Lox) was intended as a conditional KO, as Mcm3 expression could be ablated with Cre recombinase (Fig 1a and Supplementary Fig 1A,B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, expression of Mcm3-Lox could be monitored by the bioluminescence activity associated to luciferase expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mcm3+/Lox mice were born at Mendelian rates, and Mcm3-Lox expression in the skin and several internal organs was confirmed by luciferase activity after the administration of luciferin (Fig 1b and Supplementary Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, virtually no Mcm3Lox/Lox individuals were born after extensive breeding of Mcm3+/Lox mice (1 in 314;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mcm2-7 are essential genes that encode key components of the main DNA helicase involved in genome replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mcm2-7 are highly expressed in proliferating cells, and DNA replication can still occur in cell lines after a significant reduction ( greater than 90% in some cases) in the cellular concentration of MCM protein complexes17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This tolerance to MCM downregulation is related to the fact that MCM complexes are engaged with DNA in large excess relative to the number of replication forks normally established during S phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The surplus of MCM complexes license dormant origins that are activated only as a rescue mechanism when DNA replication is disrupted (reviewed in reference34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of dormant origins in vivo is well documented in the mouse, and MCM downregulation beyond 2/3 of its physiological levels causes embryonic lethality or promotes tumorigenesis in adults7,8,9,10,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is likely that certain cell types in the developing embryo, such as stem and progenitor cells, are particularly sensitive to RS induced by low MCM levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have tested the hypothesis that different cell types may have different requirements for MCM concentration using a novel strain with hypomorphic Mcm3 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While Mcm3Lox/Lox MEFs proliferated and replicated DNA with approximately 1/3 of the normal concentration of MCM3 protein, a similar reduction severely impaired hematopoietic progenitors, indicating a stricter requirement for origin licensing in the latter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mid-gestation, hematopoiesis in the fetal liver is largely geared towards the production of RBCs to guarantee oxygen delivery to the rapidly growing embryo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, erythroid precursors undergo several rounds of DNA replication and cell division during terminal differentiation, and genetic models that ablate cell cycle regulators such as Rb, E2F4, E2F8 or D-cyclins frequently result in embryonic anemia35,36,37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While D-Cyclin/CDK and Rb/E2F constitute the axis of a large transcriptional pathway regulating multiple genes, here we report for the first time that downregulation of a single MCM gene is sufficient to impair hematopoietic progenitor cells, causing anemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cytological analyses of embryonic blood revealed lower counts of RBCs and abundance of immature nucleated erythroblasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, transplantation of Mcm3-deficient fetal liver cells into lethally irradiated mice reconstituted the adult RBC population with much lower efficiency than Mcm3-competent cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that a full complement of MCM is required for erythrocyte maturation in steady-state conditions and in response to erythropoietic stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If MCM levels drop to approximately 1/3 of its normal concentration, the severity of the anemia causes embryonic lethality in the C57BL/6 genetic background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As reported in other mouse models such as the Mcm4-chaos mutant8,11,12 or the Rif1 KO mouse39, Mcm3Lox/Lox embryonic lethality was partially alleviated in a mixed C57BL/6-CD1 background and it was further rescued by overexpression of CHK1 kinase, reinforcing the connection between RS and the phenotypes observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To our knowledge, the single-molecule analyses of DNA replication in EB precursors isolated from the fetal liver provide the first evidence that the program of DNA replication undergoes active changes during the physiological maturation of mammalian erythrocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As pro-EBs proliferate and differentiate into mature reticulocytes, their replication program requires the progressive activation of more origins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation has interesting antecedents: chicken erythrocytic progenitors forced to differentiate ex vivo display a broadening in origin usage in the -globin locus23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, origin firing is enhanced in murine erythroleukemia cells derived from transformed pro-EBs and forced to differentiate in culture40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is conceivable that rapid DNA replication, driven from an increasingly high number of origins, is related to the rapid loss of DNA methylation marks observed during mouse erythropoiesis41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These patterns of DNA replication were altered in Mcm3-deficient pro-EBs, which displayed a higher frequency of origin activation and asymmetric forks from the start of their differentiation program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Later in differentiation, baso-EBs and chr-EBs were not capable of completing DNA replication, accumulated in S phase and activated the apoptotic program, thus preventing erythrocyte maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This likely triggers a compensation mechanism that pressures pro-EBs to replicate and proliferate, contributing to the aberrant replication patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fork asymmetry reflects improper coordination between fork pairs42 and may also trigger the activation of compensatory origins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that pro-EBs were capable of activating extra origins after Mcm3 downregulation underscores the fact that a very large excess of MCM proteins associate with DNA during G1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mid gestation is also the time of HSCs expansion in the fetal liver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this stage, HSCs divide very rapidly (reviewed in reference43), which could also make them vulnerable to RS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The capacity of Mcm3Lox/Lox fetal HSCs to reconstitute the immune system upon transplantation into irradiated recipients was compromised but not completely impaired, and a population of donor-derived adult HSCs was generated in recipient mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of engraftment potential was strikingly exacerbated when Mcm3Lox/Lox HSCs were re-isolated from the bone marrow of recipient mice and tested in secondary transplantations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations are in line with the emerging concept that RS affects HSC functionality in older individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With age, HSCs lose reconstitution potential for causes that have been debated44,45,46,47,48 (reviewed in references49,50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, a comparison of gene expression profiles of young versus old adult HSCs revealed that Mcm2-7 are downregulated in old HSCs, suggesting a new mechanistic link between faulty DNA replication and functional impairment32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The work presented here with a new mouse model with hypomorphic MCM expression provides direct genetic evidence that RS is a driving force behind HSC loss of functionality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, Mcm3 downregulation during embryonic development caused RS in hematopoietic progenitors leading to fetal anemia; in adults, it reduced life expectancy and promoted lymphomagenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, future therapies designed to modulate RS are a promising way to fight ageing and hematopoietic malignancies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
