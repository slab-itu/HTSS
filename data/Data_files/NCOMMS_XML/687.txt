Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The use of electric fields for signalling and control in liquids is widespread, spanning bioelectric activity in cells to electrical manipulation of microstructures in lab-on-a-chip devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, an appropriate tool to resolve the spatio-temporal distribution of electric fields over a large dynamic range has yet to be developed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present a label-free method to image local electric fields in real time and under ambient conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our technique combines the unique gate-variable optical transitions of graphene with a critically coupled planar waveguide platform that enables highly sensitive detection of local electric fields with a voltage sensitivity of a few microvolts, a spatial resolution of tens of micrometres and a frequency response over tens of kilohertz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our imaging platform enables parallel detection of electric fields over a large field of view and can be tailored to broad applications spanning lab-on-a-chip device engineering to analysis of bioelectric phenomena.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Signalling and manipulation through the control of electric field distributions is ubiquitous to both biological and physical systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, intercellular electrical activity is central to the signalling and computation of excitable cells such as cardiac and neuronal cells1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The voltages generated by bio-electric fields span three orders of magnitude and can fluctuate on the scale of microseconds to hours4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, the generation and manipulation of electric fields inside microscopic channels is the backbone of microfluidics and lab-on-a-chip diagnostics6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the latter applications, electric field gradients are intentionally designed to create strong dielectrophoretic forces, which permit the trapping and control of individual chemical droplets or biological samples along programmable pathways covering hundreds of microns10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Over the past decade, there has been a concerted effort to develop new techniques to observe and analyse the dynamic field fluctuations in liquids, such as the development of multitransistorarrays12,13, voltage-sensitive dyes14,15,16,17,18 and new computational paradigms to model10,19,20 electric field behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it remains an outstanding challenge to achieve label-free, non-perturbative detection with high field sensitivity and high spatio-temporal resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the study of network-scale biological activity requires the ability to non-perturbatively record single-cell signals over a large field of view and with sub-millisecond temporal sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The predominant label-free method of detecting local electric fields across cellular networks are multielectrode and multitransistor arrays19,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These techniques require prefabricated electrode arrays that are difficult to scale up, are individually amplified, and do not provide the flexibility to measure electrical fields at arbitrary spatial positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with electrical techniques, optical imaging permits high throughput detection that is compatible with simultaneous complementary measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these advantages, there is little research into label-free optical platforms that permit the spatio-temporal detection of electric field22 distributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we address this subset of problems with a critically coupled waveguide-amplified graphene electric field (CAGE) imaging platform, which permits label-free imaging of the dynamics of electric fields in solutions under non-equilibrium conditions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Design of the CAGE imaging platform', 'Atomically thin materials like graphene offer exceptional opportunities for electric field sensing due to their unique physical properties and intrinsic sensitivity to their environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the past decade, graphenes optoelectronic properties have been studied extensively23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to its distinctive electronic transport properties, graphene couples strongly to light across the visible and the infrared frequency range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A pristine sheet of graphene has a constant absorption of 2.3% at all frequencies25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, this absorption can be modulated through electrostatic gating: a gate-induced shift of the Fermi energy that forbids specific optical transitions in graphene due to Pauli blocking (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We employ this field-dependent optical absorption to achieve highly sensitive and parallel optical detection of local electrical fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Graphene optoelectronics and CAGE imaging device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Graphene interband transitions wherein EF shifts upon gating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optical modulation is strongest for electronic transitions near the Fermi surface, 2|EF|=, wherein the presence of an external field can shift the Fermi energy and prohibit optical absorption due to Pauli blocking

#@NEW_LINE#@#  Through the waveguide, the beam probes the graphene/solution interface (grey).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The critical coupling condition is achieved by varying the incident light angle and by electrostatic gating of graphene through the saline solution (blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The out-coupled signal is detected by an InGaAs photodiode and/or camera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Cross section of the CAGE imaging platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interface 1 and interface 2 form a Fabry-Perot cavity in which we obtain the critical coupling condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The waveguide-amplified critical coupling condition sets the ratio of light coupling into the waveguide and light absorption at the graphene interface to unity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optical contrast of local field fluctuations is maximized close to the critical coupling condition, which permits localized and sensitive electric field detection.Full size image', 'Realizing this goal requires new optical designs that optimize the detection sensitivity and parallel readout simultaneously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, simple transmission mode imaging of gated monolayer graphene yields a 1% change of transmitted light over a gate voltage change of 200 mV around the Pauli blocking region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This results in a voltage sensitivity of only 2 mV, accounting for a typical laser with noise levels of 104.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, physical and biological applications require orders of magnitude improvement in voltage sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To increase the light-matter interaction in graphene, researchers have explored different approaches such as coupling graphene to silicon waveguides26,27,28, photonic crystal cavities28,29,30, plasmon resonances31,32,33 and metamaterials34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These existing methods can improve the voltage sensitivity of optical detection, but are incompatible with parallel detection and imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we demonstrate highly sensitive, high-speed optical imaging of local electric field dynamics in solutions using graphene and a critical-coupled planar waveguide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a custom numerical simulation, we designed the critically coupled waveguide amplified platform to obtain the so-called critical coupling condition35 where the effective absorption of monolayer graphene approaches 100%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Close to the critical-coupling point, the voltage sensitivity can be enhanced by orders of magnitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the planar waveguide permits two-dimensional (2D) time-resolved imaging of the electric field distribution in the solution above graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This CAGE imaging achieves a voltage sensitivity down to a few microvolts, a response speed of microseconds, spatial resolution of several microns and highly parallel readout of the dynamics of electrical field distributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1b schematically illustrates the structure of the CAGE imaging platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large-area graphene is grown by chemical vapour deposition and transferred to a prism coated with 150 nm of Ta2O5 (n=2.0856), forming a high refractive index waveguide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use an equilateral SCHOTT SF-11 glass (SF-11) prism (n=1.743) with a 1,000 nm top layer of SiO2 (n=1.444) to evanescently couple a collimated 1.55 m beam to and from the CAGE sensor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reflected light is then collected by an infrared objective and imaged onto an InGaAs camera and photodiode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The concept of waveguide critical coupling is illustrated in Fig 1c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A collimated s-polarized 1.55 m incident beam is coupled into the transverse electric (TE) mode of the waveguide at an oblique angle so that condition for total internal reflection is satisfied at the SF-11/SiO2 and Ta2O5/solution interfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under this framework, we can describe the waveguide as a Fabry-Perot cavity with high reflection coefficients |r1| and |r2| at the two interfaces, where |r1| and |r2| deviate from unity due to the frustrated total internal reflection from the finite SiO2 thickness at the first interface and the absorption of graphene at the second interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At resonance coupling, the total reflection R from the Fabry-Perot cavity is described by  (Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The value of |r2| can be varied in situ by electrostatic gating of graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To attain the highest sensitivity to local electric fields, we gate the graphene to a specific Fermi energy that generates the largest relative change in optical reflection for a given local electric field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the critical-coupling condition, |r1|=|r2| and the total reflection, R, equals zero, at which point all of the light is absorbed by graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, close to the critical coupling condition, the light-graphene interaction is strongly enhanced and the background reflection is very weak contributing to the high voltage sensitivity of CAGE imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'High sensitivity via critical coupling', 'Figure 2a shows the gate-dependent reflectivity response of a typical CAGE detector in a saline solution (blue solid line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incident 1.55 m beam is collimated and TE polarized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resonance condition of the waveguide determines the angle of incident light inside the SF-11 coupling prism to be 60° from normal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a 1,000 nm SiO2 layer, the frustrated total internal reflection |r1|=98.2%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reflection coefficient at the Ta2O5/solution |r2| is 97.5% at the charge neutral point (Vg=0.14 V) due to graphene absorption, which leads to a total reflection of R 1.5%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Graphene absorption can be set subsequently by electrostatic gating through the solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The critical coupling condition |r1|=|r2| is realized at Vg=+0.41 V (electron doped) and Vg=0.69 V (hole doped), resulting the lowest total reflectivity, R (the residual value of R=0.63% at critical coupling is due in part to a slight divergence in the incident beam and in part due to defects in the CVD-grown graphene and the waveguide thin film deposition).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further increase of carrier doping leads to a decrease of graphene absorption corresponding to |r1| less_than |r2| and one obtains an increase in total reflectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The grey dashed line in Fig 2a shows the simulated optical response of our device using graphene absorption determined experimentally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (see Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Fig 2 for graphene absorption and Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Fig 3 for simulation details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

relative reflectivity change R/R caused by a change in voltage induced by the local electric field, V. Figure 2b shows the calculated (R/R)/V as a function of the gate voltage from Fig 2a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CAGE detection is most sensitive close to the critical coupling condition, where we achieve the greatest optical modulation for a given change in local electric field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, a single millivolt of field-induced voltage produces a 1.2% change in reflection at Vg=0.53 V. This sensitivity is over 200 times higher than that of the direct transmission configuration (1% optical change per 200 mV, Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The root-mean-square (RMS) noise of the commercially available 15 mW 1.55 m butterfly diode lasers is around 0.01% across a 10 Hz10 kHz bandwidth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the CAGE detection permits optical readout of electrical voltages smaller than 10 V across a wide field of view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Noise floor and bandwidth', 'CAGE optical detection of small electric field fluctuations is demonstrated in Fig 3a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gate voltage at graphene was set at the highest sensitivity point (0.53 V).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied periodic rectangular pulse sequences with peak voltages ranging from 500 to 100 V and recorded the optical readout with a wide band-pass filter from 10 Hz to 10 kHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative reflectivity change is 0.58%, 0.23%, and 0.11% for 500, 200, and 100 V voltage pulses, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are consistent with the (R/R)/V=1.2% per mV reported in Fig 2b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clear periodic modulation is observed at Vpp=100 V with a signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 6.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This measurement reflects optical detection capabilities of 15 V or, equivalently, a change of carrier concentration of 2.3 × 108 electrons per cm2 in graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The noise level at 0.017% in Fig 3a is due to a combination of laser intensity fluctuations and vibrations of optical components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Much higher SNR and therefore higher voltage sensitivity would be possible by improving the optomechanical and laser source stabilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Voltage sensitivity and temporal bandwidth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Optical detection of an applied modulating voltage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A periodic rectangular waveform is applied with peak-to-peak voltages of 500 Vpp (green), 200 Vpp (purple) and 100 Vpp (orange) with a 10 Hz10 kHz bandpass filter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optical response from the 100 V applied modulation demonstrates a SNR of 6.5 corresponding to an experimental detection limit of 15 V.
