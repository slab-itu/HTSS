Crystal structures of the NO sensor NsrR reveal how its iron-sulfur cluster modulates DNA binding  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'NsrR from Streptomyces coelicolor (Sc) regulates the expression of three genes through the progressive degradation of its 4Fe4S cluster on nitric oxide (NO) exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report the 1.95 Å resolution crystal structure of dimeric holo-ScNsrR and show that the cluster is coordinated by the three invariant Cys residues from one monomer and, unexpectedly, Asp8 from the other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A cavity map suggests that NO displaces Asp8 as a cluster ligand and, while D8A and D8C variants remain NO sensitive, DNA binding is affected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A structural comparison of holo-ScNsrR with an apo-IscR-DNA complex shows that the 4Fe4S cluster stabilizes a turn between ScNsrR Cys93 and Cys99 properly oriented to interact with the DNA backbone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, an apo ScNsrR structure suggests that Asn97 from this turn, along with Arg12, which forms a salt-bridge with Asp8, are instrumental in modulating the position of the DNA recognition helix region relative to its major groove.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'To counter the deleterious effects of the cytotoxin nitric oxide (NO), many bacteria, including several pathogens, have evolved mechanisms by which NO is sensed and a cellular response mounted1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most widespread dedicated NO sensor regulator in bacteria is NsrR, a member of the Rrf2 superfamily of homodimeric transcriptional regulators3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NsrR from Escherichia coli (Ec) is known to regulate at least 60 genes5 including hmp, which encodes an NO detoxifying flavohaemoglobin (Hmp)6 that converts NO to nitrate (or nitrous oxide under anaerobic conditions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NsrR proteins from Bacillus subtilis (Bs) and Streptomyces coelicolor (Sc) have been shown to bind a 4Fe4S cluster, which functions as the NO sensing module3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ScNsrR, reaction with NO was shown to result in loss of the ironsulfur (FeS) cluster and formation of iron-nitrosyl species7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process led to loss of high affinity DNA-binding and activation of genes that were previously repressed by 4Fe4S (holo-)ScNsrR, including those encoding Hmp-type NO detoxifying enzymes3,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The Rrf2 family of bacterial regulatory transcription factors is a functionally varied group, including, in addition to NsrR, regulators of iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis (IscR)9,10, cysteine metabolism (CymR)11, iron metabolism (RirA)12 and the newly-explored redox-sensitive regulator RsrR13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While CymR represents Rrf2 family regulators that do not have a co-factor, many contain three conserved Cys residues that have been shown, or are predicted, to bind either a 2Fe2S or a 4Fe4S cluster, dependent on the particular regulator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all examples where data are available, the cluster functions as the sensory module and, therefore, plays a central role in the regulatory process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'EcIscR is known to contain a 2Fe2S cluster in its holo form9, and regulates transcription of more than 40 genes associated with iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IscR binds two different operator sequences termed type 1 and type 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While only 2Fe2S IscR binds at type 1 sites, both holo- and apo-IscR can bind at type 2 sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, X-ray structures of apo-IscR from E. coli16 and Thermincola potens17 have been reported, together with apo-EcIscR in complex with DNA containing a type 2 site16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These structures reveal important information about the nature of the protein-DNA interaction, but a full understanding of the regulatory mechanism is currently hindered by the lack of structural information for the FeS cluster bound form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We report here the 1.95 Å resolution crystal structure of holo-ScNsrR, the first for an FeS cluster-bound form of any Rrf2 superfamily regulator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, Asp8 from one monomer of the ScNsrR homodimer is the fourth ligand to the 4Fe4S cluster further coordinated by three invariant Cys residues from the other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we find a connection between the cluster and a region next to the DNA-binding helix 3 mediated by a salt bridge between Asp8 and Arg12 with implications for NO-induced NsrR DNA binding modulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NO binding studies of D8C and D8A ScNsrR variants and their comparison to wild type provide a rationale for the cluster Asp ligation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also present the structure of a three-Cys-to-Ala (3CA) apo ScNsrR variant at 3.9 Å resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our structures provide a solid basis to understand how this unusual cluster coordination conditions its degradation on NO exposure and how DNA-binding specificity is modulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, because of the similarity between NsrR and IscR (Fig 1) our structural results also shed light on apo- versus holo-IscR structure/function relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Amino acid alignment of S. coelicolor NsrR with related proteins.Other shown NsrRs are from E. coli (EcNsrR), Salmonella enterica typhimurium (StNsrR) and B. subtilis (BsNsrR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IscR proteins are from E. coli (EcIscR) and P. aeruginosa (PaIscR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The alignment was carried out using Clustal Omega45 and presented using Genedoc46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondary structural elements of ScNsrR are indicated above the sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residues that serve as cluster ligands in NsrR and IscR are indicated by boxes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Black colour indicates totally conserved residues, grey indicates highly conserved residues, and light grey indicates residues that are either well conserved or conservatively substituted.Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Structure of the holo-ScNsrR homodimer', 'ScNsrR crystallized as a dimer spanning a distance of about 80 Å, with monomers being related by a crystallographic twofold axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It shows an elongated fold that is typical of the Rrf2 family of transcriptional regulators, comprising eight -helices and two anti-parallel -strands (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The X-ray structure parameters reveal high-temperature factors suggestive of a flexible and dynamic structure (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the polypeptide chain was resolved for 137 of its 148 amino acid residues and forms two loosely interacting domains (residues 185 and 86144, see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Structure of holo ScNsrR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Ribbon depiction of the functional

DNA-binding N-terminal domain is the most conserved one its conformation is highly variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In terms of similarity, Thermincola potens apo-IscR17 is the closest one to the ScNsrR functional dimer giving a root-mean-square deviation of 2.22 Å for 214 out of a total of 274 superposed C atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another similarity to other Rrf2 superfamily members is the highly hydrophobic nature of the ScNsrR dimerization interface (Supplementary Fig 1), which buries a surface of about 2,050 Å2 per monomer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Putative DNA-binding regions in the two ScNsrR domains are discussed below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Unique to the holo-ScNsrR structure is the presence of a 4Fe4S cluster that is ligated by three cysteine residues (Cys93, Cys99 and Cys105) from one monomer and Asp8 from the other (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter forms a salt bridge with Arg12 from the same 1 helix, which also interacts with the carbonyl oxygen of Val36 of the DNA-binding helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the opposite side of the cluster Cys93 is exposed to solvent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The more buried Cys99 and Cys105 S atoms are hydrogen-bonded to the main chain N atoms of Leu101 and Arg108, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The position of Cys105-S is further stabilized by the positive dipole moment of the 6 helix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Otherwise, the cluster environment is mainly hydrophobic, without H-bonds to the inorganic S atoms of the cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anisotropic temperature factor analysis of the 4Fe4S cluster binding region at the dimer interface shows that the two monomers display orthogonally oriented agitation/disorder at this region (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Holo-ScNsrR appears to be the first structurally characterized protein with a 4Fe4S cluster that is asymmetrically bound by ligands from two different subunits as indicated by our examination of all the other 4Fe4S cluster-containing protein structures found in the Protein Data Bank18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observation of Asp8 as a ligand explains previous data from resonance Raman spectroscopy that revealed the presence of an oxygenic ligand in addition to three Cys residues3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, data consistent with Glu85 being a cluster ligand3 can now be rationalized by its role in stabilizing the N-terminal region of ScNsrR (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Structural changes induced by the loss of the FeS cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) In holo ScNsrR Arg12 connects the Asp8 4Fe4S cluster ligand with Val36 located next to the DNA-recognition helix (3 RH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Asn97 from the other monomer establishes an H-bond with the carbonyl oxygen from Gly37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) The absence of the cluster in apo 3CA-ScNsrR causes the disruption of the Arg12-Val36 and Asn97-Gly37 H-bonds, which results in a shift of about 2.0 Å of each of the ScNsrR homodimer RHs.Full size image', 'Structures of apo-ScNsrR homodimers', 'To better understand the role of the 4Fe4S cluster in DNA binding modulation we prepared and crystallized the 3CA apo-ScNsrR variant, analogous to the 3CA variants used previously for structural studies of EcIscR16 (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trigonal crystals of the variant displayed contact twinning with a h k l twin axis operator resulting in apparent hexagonal symmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also had 62% solvent content and only diffracted to 3.9 Å resolution at the microfocus ID30-A3 beam line of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Table 1 and Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In spite of these limitations and because there were five ScNsrR monomers per asymmetric unit, we were able to solve its structure thereby gaining precious information about cluster-dependent DNA-binding modulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, a comparison of the structures of wild-type holo and 3CA apo-ScNsrR shows that the 4Fe4S cluster conditions the conformation of two relevant regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of them is the C93EGDNPC99 sequence that forms a well-defined turn in the holo structure, but is less ordered in the apo structure where it adopts a different conformation (Fig 2a and Supplementary Fig 4); based on the superposition of the holo structure with that of the apo-IscR-DNA complex, the tip of this turn should contact the DNA backbone of the ScNsrR-binding site (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Asn97 from the C93EGDNPC99 turn forms a H-bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Gly37, a residue situated in a turn next to the N terminus of the DNA recognition helix (RH) (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the apo structure this interaction is no longer possible (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other relevant change between the apo and holo ScNsrR structures is the disruption of the Fe-Asp8-Arg12-Val36 connection of the latter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the apo structure the salt bridge between Asp8 and Arg12 appears to be preserved but the absence of the cluster changes the orientation of these residues causing the break of the H-bond between Arg12 and the carbonyl oxygen of Val36 (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The disruption of the Asn97-Gly37 and Arg12-Val36 H-bonds in apo-ScNsrR, indicated by the different conformation of the main chain in the medium-resolution apo structure (Fig 3), results in the displacement of the RH by over 2 Å, which may be enough to prevent its binding to DNA, as observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Properties of the ScNsrR D8A and D8C variants', 'Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to test the importance of the Asp8 carboxylate 4Fe4S cluster ligand for DNA binding and, therefore, biological activity (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D8A and D8C ScNsrR variants were prepared and isolated and were stable over a few weeks at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both variants were homodimeric.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The D8C variant was almost fully loaded with a 4Fe4S cluster, as judged from its ultravioletvisible absorbance spectrum (Supplementary Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the cofactor loading of the D8A mutant was lower (40%), UV-visible absorbance properties were also consistent with the presence of a 4Fe4S cluster (Supplementary Fig 7c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm the nature of the clusters bound in D8C and D8A variants, ESI-mass spectrometry under non-denaturing conditions was used3,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deconvoluted spectra (Supplementary Fig 7b and d) revealed the presence of a 4Fe4S cluster, and minor amounts of other cluster species in both, demonstrating that, despite the loss of the natural aspartate ligand, a 4Fe4S cluster can still be assembled in the D8A and D8C variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The capacity of the variant proteins to bind the ScNsrR-regulated hmpA1 promoter was tested by electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments (Fig 4 and Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For D8C ScNsrR, 50% binding of the DNA was observed at an approximately 20:1 cluster-bound protein to DNA strand ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For wild type ScNsrR, 50% binding was observed at a ratio less_than 2:1 (Fig 4 and ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3), demonstrating that replacement of Asp8 with Cys significantly reduced the affinity of ScNsrR for DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For D8A, there was no sign of DNA binding up to a ratio of 20:1 (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, replacement of Asp8 with Ala abolished the regulators affinity for DNA at physiologically relevant concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: EMSA analysis of DNA

absorbance spectral changes to those for wild type when titrated with NO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cases nitrosylation resulted in loss of the 412 nm band and emergence of a new band at 357 nm, as previously reported for wild type ScNsrR8, indicating similarity in the final iron nitrosyl products formed7 (Supplementary Fig 10a and b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Product formation was effectively complete at between 8 and 12 NO molecules per cluster, similar to that previously reported for the non His-tagged protein8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD spectroscopy is particularly sensitive to differences in the cluster environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CD spectra of wild type and D8A 4Fe4S ScNsrR and the changes due to nitrosylation (Supplementary Fig 10c) were similar to those previously reported for non-tagged ScNsrR8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the initial CD spectrum of D8C 4Fe4S ScNsrR and the changes observed on nitrosylation were significantly different, with the greatest deviation observed at 2 NO per cluster (Supplementary Fig 10c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, though, the final spectrum closely resembled that of the other proteins, suggesting that the final nitrosylation product has a similar protein conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could be interpreted as indicative of a different initial nitrosylation site on the cluster, consistent with the presumed similar lability of the four cysteine ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall reaction of the three 4Fe4S ScNsrR proteins with NO under pseudo-first order conditions was followed using stopped-flow absorbance spectroscopy, monitoring A357 nm as a function of time (Supplementary Fig 10d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While a full kinetic analysis will be reported elsewhere, a simple comparison of A357 nm data over the first 10 s provides a means to assess the relative reactivity of the variants towards NO (Supplementary Fig 10d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data clearly show that the order of reactivity is D8A greater than wild type greater than D8C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fourth iron of the D8A 4Fe4S cluster is likely bound by a labile solvent molecule, or some other loosely-associated small molecule anion, in the absence of a coordinating amino acid residue within binding distance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a ligand would be more labile than protein-bound thiolate or carboxylate ligands, and more readily displaced by NO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The greater sensitivity of wild type ScNsrR compared to D8C is also consistent with the greater lability of the coordinating carboxylate compared to a Cys residue19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Possible initial NO-binding site at the ironsulfur cluster', 'Figure 5 shows a cavity map with a possible access path for NO, which is consistent with the data presented above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This path points at Asp8, the non-cysteinyl ligand to the 4Fe4S cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that the same access pathway at the dimer interface (Fig 5) is used by exogenous DTT and CN to react with the unique iron ion of the 4Fe4S cluster while displacing Asp8 (refs 3, 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, glutathione is too big to access via this channel and so does not bind the cluster3.

weaken the carboxylate OFe bond thereby facilitating its cleavage, as required to form the first NO bond to this Fe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, in ferredoxins containing an FeS cluster Asp ligand, loss of the carboxylate-bound Fe is rather easily achieved19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Asp8-Arg12 salt-bridge may also stabilize the 1 helix after dissociation of Asp8 from the cluster, as suggested by the likely preservation of this interaction in the apo-ScNsrR structure (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Structural basis for IscR binding to type 1 or type 2 sites', 'The regulator IscR connects the ISC (for iron-sulfur cluster) and SUF (for sulfur assimilation) pathways of iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IscR can bind a 2Fe2S cluster and in its holo state, under iron sufficiency conditions, it represses the expression of the isc operon by binding to DNA at the type 1 IscR operator sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the concentration of FeS clusters in the cell decreases, IscR loses its 2Fe2S cluster and it dissociates from the type 1 site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This derepresses the isc operon and stimulates FeS cluster biogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IscR then reacquires a cluster and re-binds to the type 1 site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, if low iron levels are coupled to oxidative stress (aerobic) conditions the resulting apo form of IscR binds to a different DNA site called type 2 where it elicits FeS cluster biogenesis by activating the suf operon which encodes the SUF pathway, a process that is also influenced by other regulators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, IscR is capable of regulating DNA expression in both its holo and apo forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Crystal structures of apo IscR dimers alone and in complex with the type 2 regulatory site are available (Fig 6a)16,17.

of the C7C8 and C7C8 bases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the E43A mutation did not have a major influence in the DNA binding affinity of IscR it had a marked effect on the specificity for type 1 and 2 sites: native apo-IscR does not bind to type 1 sites while its E43A variant does16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ScNsrR the counterparts of EcIscR Ser40, Glu43 and Gln44 are Thr41, Ala44 and Lys45.

Both these bases could form a monodentate H-bond with Glu43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 3CA-ScNsrR apo structure shows that the conformation of the C93EGDNPC99 loop depends on the presence or absence of the FeS cluster (Figs 2a and Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Similar conformations and positions of the ScNsrR C93-C99 and the EcIscR C92-C98 turns require similar ligation of the two Cys thiolates to the corresponding FeS clusters within an equivalent protein cavity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because holo-ScNsrR contains a cuboid 4Fe4S cluster and holo-IscR a rhomboid 2Fe2S cluster, maintaining these two thiolate ligations at equivalent positions would require different orientations for the remaining two ligands (Cys105 and Asp8 in ScNsrR and Cys104 and His107 in EcIscR; Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examination of the IscR structure indicates that a shift in the 105123 helix to a position similar to the one occupied by its counterpart in holo-ScNsrR would allow for 2Fe2S cluster coordination while keeping Cys92 and Cys98 in positions similar to the ones occupied by ScNsrR Cys93 and Cys99.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preservation of two Cys positions in the conversion of a 2Fe2S cluster to a 4Fe4S cluster was observed with the non-conserved cluster of the FeFe-hydrogenase maturase HydE23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of the flexible and long His107 side chain in EcIscR is likely to allow for 2Fe2S cluster coordination because of its adaptability as a ligand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the H107C mutation resulted in only partial anaerobic repression of PiscR-lacZ and no formation of holo-IscR was observed in vitro for this variant24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the ScNsrR D8C variant reported here was isolated almost replete with a 4Fe4S cluster.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have succeeded in solving the crystal structures of (i) holo ScNsrR, the first for a member of the Rrf2 family of transcription regulators with a bound FeS cluster and (ii) the apo 3CA-variant of ScNsrR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of holo-ScNsrR with apo IscR shows that one of the consequences of FeS cluster binding is the structuration of the sequence contained between Cys93 and Cys99 (ScNsrR numbering), which then forms a well-defined turn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This region is disordered in apo IscR and adopts a different conformation in apo 3CA-ScNsrR (Fig 2a and Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C93EGDNPC99 turn includes Asn97, a residue that in holo ScNsrR interacts with the carbonyl oxygen of Gly37 (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Fig 1 shows that the most variable sequence region when comparing this family of regulators corresponds to this turn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the superposition of apo IscR with holo ScNsrR (Fig 6c and Supplementary Fig 5) shows that EcIscR Lys95 could also be a DNA backbone ligand22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another interesting case is BsNsrR, whose turn sequence contains a two-residue insertion relative to its S. coelicolor counterpart, and has one Lys residue as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like IscR, BsNsrR can bind DNA in both its dimeric apo and holo forms4,25, while ScNsrR was shown to bind to different gene promoters depending on the extent of the cluster reaction with NO8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three-dimensional superposition of holo-ScNsrR with IscR-DNA complexes and our 3CA-ScNsrR variant, along with amino acid sequence comparisons, suggest that Asn97 from the turn between Cys93 and Cys99 helps to position the RH region when bound to the major groove of its cognate DNA sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that the structural factors that control IscR binding to type 1 and 2 sites in DNA play an equivalent role in ScNsrR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these findings provide a rationale for the modulation of DNA binding as a function of cluster integrity in both NsrRs and IscRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Specific to ScNsrR function is the inter-monomer ligation to the 4Fe4S cluster by Asp8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It not only represents a novel structural motif for FeS proteins in general, with a cluster coordinated by a non-cysteinyl ligand from another monomer, it also sheds considerable light on the NO-based mechanism of cluster degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the ScNsrR structure is consistent with the idea that the breaking of both inter-monomer Asp8-4Fe4S bonds, caused by their substitution with NO, will initiate both cluster degradation and structural changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes are very likely responsible for the observed modulation of promoter binding affinity by the gas8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, NO binding studies indicate that the nature of the ligand, either Asp or Cys, or its absence in the D8A variant, conditions the reaction of the cluster with the gas (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is consistent with a cavity map that suggests the existence of a path for NO diffusion at the ScNsrR surface, next to the Asp8 position between the two monomers (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Site-directed replacement of ScNsrR Asp8 with either Ala or Cys had a clear impact on DNA binding affinity (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The alanine side chain cannot bind the 4Fe4S cluster, which consequently generates a large proportion of ScNsrR lacking this cofactor; this notion is reinforced by the fact that neither the Ala variant nor the apo protein bind DNA at physiologically relevant concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, an inter-monomer bridging Cys ligand like in the D8C variant should form a strong bond with the unique iron of the cluster, which accounts for the high proportion of holo-ScNsrR obtained with this variant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the very significant drop in DNA binding affinity observed for the D8C variant can be explained by the absence of a bonding interaction between Cys8 and Arg12, which, in turn, disrupts the connection of the 4Fe4S cluster with the short turn preceding the 3 RH discussed above for the native protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The question as to why IscR and NsrR, two FeS cluster-binding members of the Rrf2 family, do not coordinate the same type of cluster in vivo might be answered by considering the nature of their effectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sensing and responding to either cluster availability/ROS or NO may require dissimilar cluster degradation/reaction processes7 which will also cause different modifications in protein structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a structural point of view, accommodating a 4Fe4S cluster rather than a 2Fe2S cluster within a similar protein cavity is possibly also facilitated by the provision in ScNsrR of ligation from the other monomer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, our structures of ScNsrR strongly suggest that one of the main effects of cluster binding is the stabilization of an inter-cysteine turn that binds to the DNA backbone modifying in the process the orientation of the 3 RH at the major groove of the nucleic acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other major determinant of the 3 RH orientation is Arg12 which, along with Asp8, significantly changes its position after cluster loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies will involve the preparation and structural and functional analyses of variants at the ScNsrR C93EGDNPC99 sequence as well as complexes of both native and variant proteins with cognate DNA sites.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
