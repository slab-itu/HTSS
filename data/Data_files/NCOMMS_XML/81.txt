Immunological biomarkers predict HIV-1 viral rebound after treatment interruption  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Treatment of HIV-1 infection with antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the weeks following transmission may induce a state of post-treatment control (PTC) in some patients, in whom viraemia remains undetectable when ART is stopped.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Explaining PTC could help our understanding of the processes that maintain viral persistence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that immunological biomarkers can predict time to viral rebound after stopping ART by analysing data from a randomized study of primary HIV-1 infection incorporating a treatment interruption (TI) after 48 weeks of ART (the SPARTAC trial).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T-cell exhaustion markers PD-1, Tim-3 and Lag-3 measured prior to ART strongly predict time to the return of viraemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that T-cell exhaustion markers may identify those latently infected cells with a higher proclivity to viral transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results may open new avenues for understanding the mechanisms underlying PTC, and eventually HIV-1 eradication.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) infection has dramatically improved survival1,2,3, but is not a curea consequence of a reservoir of latently infected cells4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary HIV-1 infection (PHI)the period within weeks to months of seroconversionmay provide insights into how this reservoir is activated and whether it can be suppressed, as stopping ART initiated in this early stage has in certain patients been associated with periods of aviraemic remission5in some cases for over 10 years6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Post hoc analyses of other larger PHI cohorts support this phenomenon of sustained post-treatment control (PTC)7,8, as well as periods of transient aviraemic remission5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The mechanisms that induce and maintain this remissive state of PTC remain unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is debate over whether the timing of viral rebound after stopping ART is a random, stochastic process based on the spontaneous re-awakening of HIV-1 in latently infected T lymphocytes, or whether the hostfor example, through HIV-1-specific or innate immunityis the determining factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the best characterized cohort to date (VISCONTI), PTC was associated with low (but detectable) reservoirs, almost non-existent HIV-specific immune responses, an absence of protective HLA Class I alleles and highly symptomatic seroconversion illnesses6a distinct phenotype from the more widely recognised examples of spontaneous viraemic control shown by elite controllers9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SPARTAC trial10 was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing ART for either 48 or 12 weeks relative to standard of care in adults with PHI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reported prolonged periods of aviraemia post-treatment interruption (TI) in participants allocated to receive ART for 48 weeks14% had undetectable plasma viral loads 1 year after stopping ART5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total HIV-1 DNA level at baseline and week 48 was associated with shorter time to viral rebound11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report an analysis of immunological and virological factors from SPARTAC to explore those that either associate with HIV-1 DNA levels or independently predict viral rebound on stopping ART.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that pre-therapy measures of T-cell exhaustion (PD-1, Tim-3 and Lag-3) were statistically significant predictors of virological rebound, suggesting that these markers should be considered in future algorithms used to detect PTC.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'ART in PHI can, in some cases, induce a state of virological remission or PTC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the search for a cure for HIV-1 infection, it is important to understand the underlying mechanisms that produce PTC and assess the possibility of identifying patients most likely to achieve PTC using an algorithm of biomarkers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The SPARTAC RCT was not designed to identify biomarkers that predict remission, yet the incorporation of a randomly allocated TI after 48 weeks of ART provided a unique opportunity due to the numerous virological and immunological studies undertaken within the protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TI studies have been set back by the increased mortality witnessed in the SMART study17, yet newer study designs in which ART is recommenced based on viral detection in plasma rather than CD4 decline may provide a safer option.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, a number of studies are currently being planned to assess the impact of ART on virological remission through intensively monitored TIs, with the assessment of biomarkers being a key endpoint.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis of SPARTAC therefore provides preliminary critical data to help inform future larger clinical studies and cohorts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although no long-term PTC was seen in this group of patients, we did find a prolonged period of aviraemia post TI1 year after stopping ART 14% of participants were still undetectable5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In SPARTAC, Total (but not Integrated) HIV-1 DNA measurements at baseline and week 48 helped stratify patients according to their viral-rebound kinetics11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We now show thatprior to ARTnumerous measures of T-cell immunity (both HIV-1 specific and non-specific) measured in over 150 individuals with PHI correlated closely with Total HIV-1 DNA levels, and we speculated that these might also be predictors of time to viral rebound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, T-cell immunity and HIV-1 DNA are predictors of clinical progression, as determined by CD4 T-cell count decline and viraemia11,18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these associations did not persist in relation to predicting VL rebound, suggesting that these two processestime to rebound and time to clinical progressionhave different mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, in SPARTAC, these two time intervals after TI did not correlate (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While there is plenty of evidence to suggest that the progression is immune mediated, it is increasingly proposedand supported by mathematical modelling21,22that rebound is stochastic, or random23, that is, the initiation of viral transcription in a latently infected cell at levels adequate to result in plasma viraemia may not be initially governed by the immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These data suggest that the size of the reservoir is determined by T-cell-mediated immunity in early HIV-1 infection, reflected in the number of associations between HIV-1 DNA and immune biomarkers at baseline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once ART is commenced and viral replication is suppressed, the CD4 T-cell count recovers and the HIV-1 reservoir (in reality, an unknown entity for which we have limited surrogate measures) declines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the point of TI, two events can occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (i) viraemia returns; and (ii) absolute CD4 T-cell numbers fall until a point at which ART needs to be reintroduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that these two processes are determined by different mechanisms: (i) stochastic and dependent on the size of the reservoir size; and (ii) mediated by HIV-1-specific immune responses after viraemia has returned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, it is possible that studies describing T-cell-mediated mechanisms driving elite controllers may have little to offer our understanding of how to induce PTC or HIV-1 cure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model may be supported by our finding that T-cell exhaustion markers at baseline (48 weeks prior to TI) predict time to viral rebound, whereas the same markers measured at the time of TI do not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A caveat to this finding is that different antibody clones were used for the surface fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) staining at baseline and at week 48 and, due to the possibility of different affinities, this is a possible confounder which needs to be explored in future studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  )', 'The highly significant impact of the markers PD-1, Tim-3 and Lag-3 is intriguing, especially in view of the lack of association for markers of activation (HLA-DR, CD38), which might be expected to associate with rebound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PD-1 has been widely reported to be upregulated on exhausted T cells in chronic viral infections such as cytomegalovirus, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and HIV, in a process that is reversible through blockade of PD-1 with its ligand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, some investigators have suggested that PD-1 is a marker of early exhaustion or even activationthe latter being supported by its clustering with HLA-DR and CD38 in the correlogram.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the identification of PD-1, Tim-3 and Lag-3 as potential biomarkers for viral rebound, this does not in itself prove that they are mechanistic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is much interest in the therapeutic potential of blocking PD-1 (either directly or by antagonizing the PD-1 ligand), and even in the context of targeting the HIV-1 reservoir.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, the combination of anti-PD-1 (Nivolumab) and anti-CTLA-4 (Ipilimumab) monoclonal antibodies have shown encouraging results in clinical trials in untreated melanoma24, and one might speculate that this enhancement in T-cell function may also be applicable for targeting the HIV-1 reservoir.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Tim-3 has been associated with T-cell exhaustion (loss of functionality and decreased proliferation) in the context of HIV-1 infection25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tim-3 expression on both CD4 and CD8 T cells is elevated in HIV+ve individuals compared with controls, correlates with VL and is associated with disease progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As for PD-1, blocking the interaction of Tim-3 with its ligand can restore functionality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, in the same study it was shown that PD-1 and Tim-3 identify distinct populations of cells, rather than being co-expressed on the same dysfunctional T cells, which we also found in our patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might help explain why they both predict time to rebound and yet both are not associated with HIV-1 DNA levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased understanding of which cells express these markers and how they contribute to the HIV-1 reservoir could be important in developing new HIV-1 cure strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This will need to be addressed in larger studies carefully designed for this purpose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The role of Lag-3 (CD223) in HIV-1 infection is less clear, although its upregulation has been associated with disease progression and functional T-cell exhaustion26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lag-3 is structurally similar to the CD4 receptor and is a ligand for MHC Class II, and part of the Ig superfamily on memory T cells27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse models have suggested some synergy between PD-1 and Lag-3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28), although it is interesting that we only find limited co-expression in our data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, now that the proof-of-efficacy has been demonstrated in cancer trials for combination immune checkpoint blockade24, it will be important to conduct further studies to explore how this applies to HIV latency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, this analysis of SPARTAC participants undergoing TI after 48 weeks of ART reveals potential new biomarkers that should be considered in larger studies exploring PTC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correlations between measures of T-cell-mediated immunity and HIV-1 DNA prior to therapy make a case for the reservoir size being determined by T-cell function early in infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relationship between immune responses and the duration of PTC at TI is much less clear, but the association with high levels of T-cell exhaustion might help shed light on why some latently infected cells reactivate and others do not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The work should help in future studies to stratify patients for PTC, with the ultimate aim to determine the mechanism of PTC, and identify new targets for HIV-1 cure research.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
