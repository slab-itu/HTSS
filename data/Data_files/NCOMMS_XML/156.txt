Endogenous opioids contribute to insensitivity to pain in humans and mice lacking sodium channel Nav1.7  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Loss-of-function mutations in the SCN9A gene encoding voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7 cause congenital insensitivity to pain in humans and mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, many potent selective antagonists of Nav1.7 are weak analgesics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigated whether Nav1.7, as well as contributing to electrical signalling, may have additional functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that Nav1.7 deletion has profound effects on gene expression, leading to an upregulation of enkephalin precursor Penk mRNA and met-enkephalin protein in sensory neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Nav1.8-null mutant sensory neurons show no upregulated Penk mRNA expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Application of the opioid antagonist naloxone potentiates noxious peripheral input into the spinal cord and dramatically reduces analgesia in both female and male Nav1.7-null mutant mice, as well as in a human Nav1.7-null mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that Nav1.7 channel blockers alone may not replicate the analgesic phenotype of null mutant humans and mice, but may be potentiated with exogenous opioids.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The problem of pain continues to grow as populations age; about one in five are victims, with 7% suffering debilitating, poorly treated chronic pain1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this vast clinical problem, little progress has been made in developing new therapeutic agents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sensory neurons that respond to tissue damage and drive central pain pathways have been a focus of analgesic drug development, because nerve block relieves most pains, and a unique repertoire of sodium channels are found in peripheral sensory neurons2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SCN9A encodes a voltage-gated sodium channel, Nav1.7, which is found in the peripheral sensory and sympathetic neurons, as well as in olfactory neurons, the hypothalamus and some non-neural tissue such as the pancreas2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of Nav1.7 in sensory and sympathetic neurons of mice leads to a pain-free congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP) phenotype similar to that described in humans5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apart from anosmia, human and mouse Nav1.7-null mutants are apparently normal, suggesting that this channel is an excellent analgesic drug target for acute, inflammatory and neuropathic pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One caveat to this conclusion is that loss of Nav1.7 has also been associated with peripheral neuropathy in humans and this could potentially contribute to peripheral analgesia3,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in Nav1.7-null mutant mouse models that recapitulate the human CIP phenotype, there is no evidence for any sensory neuronal cell loss10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of Nav1.7 does result in some mouse sensory neurons becoming electrically silenced at normal resting potentials, consistent with a role for Nav1.7 in action potential propagation in nociceptive neurons11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nerve block through the use of broad-spectrum sodium channel antagonists as local anaesthetics is a very effective way to treat pain, but inhibition of innocuous sensation makes this approach impractical for most indications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Nav1.7 antagonists are not local anaesthetics and, if selective, should show none of the side effects such as cardiotoxicity that are associated with broad-spectrum sodium channel blockers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite considerable efforts, no evidence for the dramatic analgesia found in Nav1.7-null mutants has been obtained for compounds such as Protoxin II, which selectively and potently target Nav1.7, whilst neutralizing monoclonal antibodies evoke only partial analgesia that lasts for  less_than 24â€‰h (refs 12, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe experiments that help explain this apparent anomaly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report that Nav1.7 deletion leads to increased transcription of Penk messenger RNA and higher levels of enkephalins in sensory neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analgesia associated with loss of Nav1.7 in both mice and humans is substantially reversed by the opioid antagonist naloxone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, Nav1.7 deletion increases endogenous opioid-dependent analgesia as well as diminishing peripheral nociceptive drive in pain states.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Many proteins have several, quite distinct functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, some chromatin proteins such as high-mobility group box 1 protein are also extracellular signalling molecules14, whereas the 4-subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels has been shown to have a role as a transcription factor15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We wondered whether Nav1.7 had an additional role to that of propagating action potentials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore analysed the patterns of gene expression in the sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) from Nav1.7, Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 knockout (KO) mice16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whole dorsal root ganglia were included in the analysis, but as the sodium channels are neuronal proteins, alterations in gene expression can be ascribed to changes in the sensory neuron transcriptome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three channels are all expressed at high levels in peripheral damage-sensing neurons and have been linked to human loss- or gain-of-function pain conditions2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nav1.9 seems to play a role in setting thresholds of activation, whereas Nav1.7, which is expressed in most DRG neurons, transmits action potentials that are generated by noxious stimuli that depolarize the neurons18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nav1.8, which is specifically expressed in the same subset of sensory neurons that express Nav1.9, is responsible for much of the nociceptive electrical input into the central nervous system and is activated at more negative potentials than Nav1.7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nav1.8 seems to be particularly important for nociceptive signalling at low temperatures2,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Nav1.7 plays an essential role in neurotransmitter release, whereas Nav1.8 does not2,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, some functions of these sodium channels, both associated with action potential propagation, are distinct, and this may reflect different biophysical properties, subcellular locations or association with different protein complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite the significant role of all three sensory neuron-associated sodium channels in peripheral pain pathways, we found a much more dramatic alteration in gene expression in DRG from mice in which Nav1.7 has been conditionally deleted from all sensory neurons using Advillin-Cre7 (194 genes greater than 1.5 fold dysregulated; Fig 1a) than in global Nav1.8 (17 genes)- or Nav1.9 (64 genes)-null mutant mice (Gene Expression Omnibus accession number GSE61373).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Nav1.7 conditional KO mice, a number of transcription factors associated with sensory neuron subsets were dysregulated including Brn3B, Runx1 and HoxB5 (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most strikingly, the levels of Penk mRNA, the precursor of Leu- and Met-enkephalin19, were upregulated in Nav1.7, but not in Nav1.8- or Nav1.9-null mutant mice (Fig 1b and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2), whereas the transcript of the little characterized gene Ceacam10 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20) was dramatically downregulated in both Nav1.7- and Nav1.8-null mice (Fig 1b and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This raised the possibility that enkephalin-mediated analgesia could contribute to the CIP phenotype of Nav1.7-null mutant mice and humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Deletion of Nav1.7 leads to altered gene expression in DRG neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The pie

both null mutant mouse lines (Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overexpression of Penk mRNA was replicated at the protein level in the central terminals of primary afferents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

in sensory neurons could be linked to altered gene expression through effects on second messengers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in sodium levels could have an indirect effect through altered intracellular calcium levels driven by pumps or the sodium/calcium exchangers found in sensory neurons21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, evidence of a direct role for sodium as a transcriptional regulator has come from studies of atrial myocytes and kidney medullary cells where intracellular sodium acting through a salt-dependent kinase can influence gene expression through regulation of the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T-cells 5 (NFAT5; refs 22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A doubling of intracellular sodium levels in response to carbachol has been described in early studies of sympathetic neurons24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined the consequences of altering intracellular sodium and calcium levels on Penk and Ceacam10 mRNA expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested the effects of monensin, a sodium ionophore that can elevate intracellular sodium levels, and found that monensin (0.5â€‰M) could downregulate the expression of Penk mRNA with no effects on the housekeeping gene Gapdh in DRG neurons derived from wild-type mice (Fig 3a), whereas Ceacam10 expression was enhanced a few-fold by monensin treatment (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests a potential role for sodium as a second messenger in sensory neurons in terms of regulation of gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Intracellular sodium concentration regulates Penk expression.Time-course reverse transcriptasePCR (RTPCR) experiments were performed to quantify expression of Penk and Ceacam10 mRNA in cultured DRG neurons in response to intracellular changes in cation concentration (n=6 per group).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Penk expression was not altered by intracellular calcium rise induced by ionomycin, (d) whereas Ceacam10 mRNA was significantly upregulated after 1â€‰h of incubation with the calcium ionophore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Exposure (6â€‰h) to the voltage-gated sodium channel blocker TTX induces a dose-dependent upregulation of Penk expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) At the highest TTX concentration,

interaction with a range of enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altered levels of intracellular sodium ions may result in changes in intracellular calcium through effects on pumps and exchangers21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, at high concentrations, monensin is able to increase intracellular calcium levels in some cells25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the calcium ionophore ionomycin to explore the potential link between altered calcium levels and gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ionomycin (0.2â€‰M), unlike monensin, had no effect on Penk mRNA levels measured using qPCR in DRG neurons (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the increase in intracellular calcium caused by ionomycin led, as with monensin treatment, to enhanced expression of Ceacam10 mRNA, showing that calcium-mediated second messenger regulatory events are at play in sensory neurons in these experiments (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as the increase in levels of intracellular calcium had no effect on Penk mRNA levels, sodium rather than calcium seems to be a key second messenger in the regulation of opioid peptide expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore the mechanism of Penk mRNA regulation further, we used the sodium channel-specific pore blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) to explore changes in gene expression26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for TTX is 30â€‰nM for Nav1.7; however, Nav1.8 is defined as TTX insensitive with an IC50 of 60â€‰M (refs 16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using TTX at concentrations up to 500â€‰nM, we could completely block the activity of Nav1.7 and other TTX-sensitive sodium channels all known to be present in DRG, whereas Nav1.8 would retain activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, channel block with TTX leads to an enhanced expression of Penk, slightly lower in magnitude to that caused by the deletion of Nav1.7 (Fig 3e), but is without effect on Ceacam10 expression (Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This supports the notion that sodium ingress through Nav1.7 channels downregulates Penk mRNA, although the regulation of Ceacam10 expression requires further investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The present data demonstrate that enkephalins are upregulated in Nav1.7-null mutant mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore used the opioid antagonist naloxone to examine the role of endogenous opioids in pain behaviour in Nav1.7-null mutant mice27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mice were generated by means of an Advillin-Cre mouse that only expresses recombinase activity in sensory neurons7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent RNA sequencing data highlights the significance of the -opioid receptor in nociceptive Nav1.8-expressing neurons that do not contain mRNA for - or -opioid receptors28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The target of naloxone on sensory neurons is thus likely to be the -opioid receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used measures of both thermal and mechanical pain29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When naloxone was administered to floxed Nav1.7Advillin-Cre-null mutant mice, there was a dramatic reversal of analgesia and restoration of thermal and mechanical pain thresholds in the Hargreaves and Randall-Selitto tests respectively, to levels close to that found in littermate controls (Fig 4a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dose of naloxone used had no effect on pain thresholds of littermate controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both female and male Nav1.7-null mutants showed substantial reversal of analgesia with naloxone (Fig 4c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Mechanical and thermal sensory deficits in Nav1.7-null mice are reversed with the opioid antagonist

complemented the behavioural tests with electrophysiological studies of nociceptive input into wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons in the spinal cord of mice, adapting a published method30 (Fig 4e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these experiments, polysynaptic input from peripheral neurons drives activity of deep dorsal horn neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Action potentials elicited in second-order neurons of the dorsal horn can then be used to quantify innocuous and noxious input into the central nervous system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such data are useful in that they complement behavioural studies with numerical data on electrical activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Baseline evoked activity to mechanical and thermal stimulation was lower in Nav1.7 KOs than in littermates and naloxone enhanced WDR firing in KO but not in littermate mice in response to mechanical and thermal stimuli (Fig 4e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Innocuous input evoked by brush stimulation was little affected (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both male and female null mutant Nav1.7 mice showed enhanced dorsal horn firing to noxious mechanical and thermal input in the presence of naloxone, consistent with the behavioural studies of naloxone action (Fig 4e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, opioid action in Nav1.7-null mutant mice appears target nociceptive input from the peripheral nervous system, consistent with expression of -opioid receptors on small nociceptive afferents, as well as the cellular specificity of Nav1.7 deletion in the advillin-Cre Nav1.7 KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Ceacam10 was the most downregulated transcript in the Nav1.7 microarray analysis and thus we examined the effects of gene deletion on pain behaviour as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ceacam10-null mutant mice have a limited analgesic phenotype to thermal stimuli in the Hargreaves test and the heterozygous null mutant mice also show partial analgesia (Fig 4g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Naloxone does not reverse the analgesic phenotype of Ceacam10-null mice (Fig 4g), suggesting that a non-opioid-dependent mechanism may also make a small contribution to the CIP analgesic phenotype associated with loss of Nav1.7 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, we examined the effect of naloxone on pain thresholds in a rare human Nav1.7-null CIP individual described and genotyped in detail in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the KO mouse data, there was a dramatic reversal of analgesia on infusion of naloxone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of the Nav1.7-null CIP individual to detect a single noxious heat stimulus in the presence of naloxone rose from 0 to 80% (Fig 5a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In normal conditions, the Nav1.7-null subject was completely unaware of the stimulus (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ongoing thermal pain could also be detected by the Nav1.7-null individual only in the presence of naloxone (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As well as a response to specific brief noxious stimuli, the CIP patient mentioned general pain in one leg that had suffered several fractures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It would be useful to examine larger numbers of the extremely rare CIP individuals to extend these studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the mechanistic

image', 'In summary, the loss of Nav1.7 expression in SCN9A-null mice and humans leads to the upregulation of an endogenous opioid system that contributes substantially to the CIP pain-free state

#@NEW_LINE#@#  If a complete loss of Nav1.7-mediated sodium flux is required to upregulate the opioid system, then even potent antagonists are likely to fail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that TTX levels  greater than 10-fold higher than the IC50 for Nav1.7 were required to partially recapitulate the upregulation of Penk mRNA found in Nav1.7-null mutant sensory neurons, suggesting that a complete block of sodium flux through Nav1.7 is necessary for Penk mRNA upregulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ongoing opioid-dependent analgesia throughout the lifetime of the CIP individual is consistent with recent

also found in sensory neurons28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several copies of the NFAT5 consensus sequence 5-TGGAAANYNY-3 are also found upstream of the human PENK gene, so that the molecular apparatus defined in the kidney and heart for salt or tonicity regulation of gene expression are also present in DRG sensory neurons22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a potential mechanism for sodium regulation of opioid peptide expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The A-type G protein-coupled receptors that mediate the actions of opioid peptides are also regulated by a sodium-binding pocket that is linked to agonist binding and G protein coupled receptor activity35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, sodium downregulates both the expression of opioid peptides and the activity of their cognate receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A possible link between the electrical activity of the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7 and the expression and activity of opioid peptides on their cognate receptors is suggested by the present study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sodium channels have been implicated in a range of physiological functions other than action potential propagation, including hormone secretion and tumour metastases4,36, although the molecular mechanisms underlying these events are incompletely understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that sodium plays a regulatory role in some of these events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present observations provide a molecular rationale for the use of selective Nav1.7 channel blockers that are likely to have few side effects, in combination with presently available opioid drugs (or
