Metal-induced rapid transformation of diamond into single and multilayer graphene on wafer scale  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The degradation of intrinsic properties of graphene during the transfer process constitutes a major challenge in graphene device fabrication, stimulating the need for direct growth of graphene on dielectric substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous attempts of metal-induced transformation of diamond and silicon carbide into graphene suffers from metal contamination and inability to scale graphene growth over large area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we introduce a direct approach to transform polycrystalline diamond into high-quality graphene layers on wafer scale (4 inch in diameter) using a rapid thermal annealing process facilitated by a nickel, Ni thin film catalyst on top.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the process can be tuned to grow single or multilayer graphene with good electronic properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular dynamics simulations elucidate the mechanism of graphene growth on polycrystalline diamond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we demonstrate the lateral growth of free-standing graphene over micron-sized pre-fabricated holes, opening exciting opportunities for future graphene/diamond-based electronics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The exceptional electrical, thermal chemical, mechanical and optical properties of graphene are continuing to make strides in many fields1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fabrication of devices5 at the wafer scale for applications particularly related to the electrical and optical properties of graphene relies on a method that can produce large-area single-crystal graphene directly on dielectric substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existing methods based on silicon carbide (SiC)6,7,8,9 and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)10,11 provide direct means of growing high-quality single-crystal graphene on these substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another recently demonstrated method of wafer-scale growth of single-crystal graphene on germanium Ge (111) (refs 12, 13) is also promising.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The use of diamond as a substrate for supporting graphene is very appealing, as it offers several advantages and unique properties such as low trap density for charges, high energy for optical phonons, chemical inertness and high thermal conductivity14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our previous studies on exfoliated graphene transferred onto ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) thin films and single-crystal diamond16, we demonstrated that diamond offers an excellent platform for graphene by displaying a breakdown current density reaching up to 109 A cm2 due to the excellent heat dissipation provided by the diamond under layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was demonstrated that replacing silicon dioxide (SiO2) with diamond-like carbon allows one to improve radio-frequency characteristics on graphene transistors17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, diamond-like carbon is an amorphous material with thermal conductivity K=0.23.5 Wm1 K1 at room temperature4, which is a very low value even when compared with SiO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synthetic diamond would be an ideal substrate for graphene devices in terms of its thermal properties, radio-frequency characteristics and compatibility with silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor technology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the technological benefits of having active materialgraphene and substratediamond channels consisting of the same element (carbon) are tremendous, achieving this in practice remains a major synthesis and fabrication challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Transition metals, such as nickel18 and iron19, have been used to demonstrate growth of multilayer and single-layer graphene on diamond (001) and (111) surfaces, respectively, by annealing them at high temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in both cases, the resulting film still contains metals at the graphenediamond interface, therefore not suitable for direct device fabrication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the size of graphene is limited by the size of the single-crystal diamond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this letter, we report on a process for graphene synthesis, based on rapid thermal annealing of a UNCD film in the presence of a metal catalyst, such as Ni.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A distinguishing feature of our process is the elimination of the need for any transfer process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, we also demonstrate interesting features of lateral growth of suspended graphene over micron-sized holes where graphene appears to be single domain as demonstrated later with selected area electron diffraction technique performed on the graphene transferred from various places onto transmission electron microscope (TEM) grid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is very important for practical applications, where devices could be fabricated over suspended graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the graphene can be grown selectively just by patterning the deposition of metal at micron scale.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Graphene on UNCD films and their properties', 'The rapid thermal annealing process (Fig 1a) presented here is capable of producing graphene on polycrystalline diamond sample and Raman spectroscopy analysis carried out at different locations clearly indicates graphene coverage all over the 4-inch diameter wafer (Fig 1bg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We choose UNCD as a substrate as it offers unique properties that no other diamond film provides due to its small grain size (25 nm) and high-volume fraction of grain boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 50-nm Nickel film was deposited on the UNCD surface by e-beam evaporation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, during thermal annealing process (Fig 1a), nickel diffuses rapidly through the UNCD grain boundaries as compared with through UNCD grains and sits at the bottom of the UNCD/Si interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the rapid diffusion of Ni during the temperature ramp, only a small amount of Ni is left over on the top in the form of islands (which also eventually diffuses in diamond), which act as nucleation centres for the graphene growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The continuous supply of carbon from the UNCD underneath enables the rapid lateral growth of graphene at the wafer scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The graphene films produced by this method were characterized using X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) demonstrating its high-quality nature through the clear carbon signature without any indication of the presence of nickel on the surface after the annealing process (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cross-section scanning electron microscopy (SEM) corroborates the complete nickel segregation to the bottom of the UNCD layer (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, detailed analysis of the carbon peak in the XPS high-resolution scan (Fig 2b) demonstrates the presence of only sp2 bonded carbon on the surface, hence indicating the high-purity nature of the obtained graphene, without any modification (such as oxidation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Wafer-scale growth of graphene on diamond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Recipe for the thermal annealing process shows rapid heating of the samples temperature up to 1,000 °C, keeping the system at high temperature for 60 s followed by rapid cooling down to room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) A photograph of the 4-inch diameter wafer covered with graphene after the annealing process is shown and the Raman analysis of the sample at five random spots is presented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Corresponds to spot 1, (d) to spot 2, (e) to spot 3, (f) to spot 4 and (g) to spot 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 2 cm (b).Full size image', 'Figure 2: XPS analysis of the graphene on diamond sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The full survey XPS scan of the sample demonstrates the presence of prominent carbon C 1s peak on the surface, indicating absence of residual nickel on the surface as well as no oxygen presence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) detailed carbon C 1s peak confirms sp2 hybridization of graphene through presence of CC bond peak highlighted in green.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Black colour indicates the collected XPS data and brown highlights the background spectra.Full size image', 'Surface analysis of the produced wafer indicates growth of a continuous graphene film (Supplementary Figs 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SEM (Fig 3a) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig 3b) images demonstrate the surface morphology of the as-grown film, displaying a smooth surface (root mean square roughness Rq=0.8 nm) with only occasional folds of the graphene layer (areal density, defined as the area under the wrinkles divided by the total scanning area, is  less_than 0.5%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe that these folds as seen on the AFM image (Fig 3b) may also contribute to the defect peak D (at 1,335 cm1) in the Raman signature20 (Fig 3c) along with underlying UNCD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of the folds could be attributed to uneven distribution of stress as a consequence of the fast annealing process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Characterization of graphene on UNCD sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The SEM and (b) AFM images of grown graphene indicate the formation of the continuous uniform film with occasional folds occurring;

such an understanding is crucial to gain precise control over synthesis of monolayer/few-layer graphene from Ni/UNCD films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate these phenomena, we performed two sets of simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we anneal Ni (111) slab placed on top of a typical grain boundary (GB), namely, 13 twist (100) in UNCD at various temperatures 1,2001,600 K (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we focus on the counter-diffusion of carbon (C) and Ni at the Ni/UNCD interface, and the evolution of the structure at the interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concurrence of these events eventually leads to the nucleation of graphene islands on the free surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the second set, we investigate the diffusion of C atoms on free Ni surface, which assists rapid lateral growth of the formed graphene nuclei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this set, we deposited several C atoms at random locations on Ni (111) and Ni (001) surfaces ensuring identical C coverage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two sets of simulations provide a holistic picture of the atomic-scale events leading to the nucleation and growth of graphene on annealing of Ni/UNCD films (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: Schematic of the Ni (111)-facilitated graphene growth.Subsequent growth procedure of graphene starting from initial Ni/UNCD (a) configuration with following nucleation (b) and increase in domain size (c) of graphene up to full coverage (d).Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our first set of simulations on Ni (111)/UNCD interface capture the sequence of atomic scale events leading to graphene nucleation on Ni (111).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially, Ni atoms penetrate into the UNCD GB, which, in turn, introduces structural disorder near the GB, and eventually leads to rapid amorphization of UNCD (Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concurrently, the C atoms from the amorphous region dissolve into the Ni thin film; this dissolution continues until the Ni film gets saturated with C atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the annealing temperatures employed in this study (1,2001,800 K), the solubility of C in Ni is known to be 12% (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34), which is well described by the reactive force field (ReaxFF) used in this study (Supplementary Note 2)35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond the solubility limit, the C atoms proximal to the free Ni surface precipitate out, and eventually result in graphene-like C-rings (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once these rings (nuclei) form, they grow rapidly in the lateral dimensions through diffusion of C atoms over the free Ni surface (Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These events involving C super-saturation of Ni films, and precipitation of C on Ni surfaces are analogous to earlier MD reports on formation of graphene on transition metal surfaces during CVD synthesis16,36,37,38,39,40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the rate of nucleation of these graphene-like C rings is governed mainly by the concurrent counter-diffusion of Ni and C, and the consequent amorphization of the Ni/UNCD interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

single-crystal diamond (Supplementary Fig 8) conclusively showed that the kinetics of Ni dissolution into the UNCD is severely impaired in the absence of GB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This, in turn, restricts the amorphization of the UNCD within 12 layers of the Ni/UNCD interface within MD timescales (2 ns), and limits the C flux into Ni slab to a few atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in the absence of UNCD GB, the transport of C to the free Ni surface is negligible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our MD simulations (Supplementary Note 4) of surface diffusion of C atoms from random locations on Ni surfaces (Fig 9) indicate that the diffusion of C over a Ni surface occurs over timescales (in the order of tens of ps) that are much faster than those for nucleating graphene islands (in the order of ns).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is valid irrespective of the crystallographic orientation of Ni surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a distinct difference between the kinetics of nucleation and growth phases is ideal for forming single-domain graphene sheets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The growth kinetics of graphene is particularly favourable on the Ni (111) surface (Supplementary Fig 9) owing to low diffusion barrier for C on Ni (111) of 0.5 eV (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the Ni atoms on (111) plane are arranged on a close-packed triangular lattice (Fig 9c), which closely imitates the honeycomb structure of graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This commensurability between Ni (111) substrate and graphene enables the growth of graphene nuclei into large domains, which are mostly uniform and defect-free.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our simulations suggest that the diffusivity of C through the Ni film is much faster than the rate of depletion of Ni at the NiGB interface, thereby ensuring that the (111) preferred orientation of the free surface is preserved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On the Ni (111) surface, we observe another interesting behaviour exhibited by the C atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially, the C atoms diffuse rapidly on the Ni (111) surface and bind to neighbouring C atoms in the form of rings, which may either be graphitic (six-membered) or defective (non six-membered, for example, in StoneWaals defects).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once a continuous largely planar network of the C atoms is formed, the re-arrangement of C atoms continues, which results in healing of defects (that is, conversion of defective rings into graphitic ones).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This re-arrangement can be attributed to the template provided by the underlying Ni (111), and does not occur over Ni (001) (Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the monolayer graphene that forms on Ni (111) surface features the least number of defects, and covers nearly the entire substrate (Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that these results are robust; the effect of the Ni surface orientation on graphene growth is unaffected by the temperature schedule and the highest temperature achieved during the annealing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The kinetics of re-organization of C-atoms to reduce the defects, as expected, is slow at lower temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These simulation results are in good qualitative agreement with experimental observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the general picture that emerges from our experimental results and well-supported by simulations is that graphene nucleation and growth occurs on Ni (111) surface and is much faster than Ni diffusion into UNCD GBs, therefore graphene growth occurs first followed by complete diffusion of Ni into the UNCD bottom leaving intact a uniform graphene layer on top of the UNCD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we have demonstrated a process of growing high-quality wafer-scale graphene film directly onto an insulating substrate by rapid thermal annealing of diamond film in the presence of a metal catalyst.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is very promising as our process does not involve transferring of graphene over other substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tuning of the graphene thickness is achieved through the variation of the annealing temperature such that, at lower temperatures (800 °C) the obtained graphene film consists of a single layer, while increasing the annealing temperature to up to 1,000 °C results in multilayer graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reactive MD simulations elucidate an intriguing kinetically controlled mechanism of graphene nucleation and growth facilitated by Ni-induced amorphization of diamond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fabrication scheme can be easily extended to form suspended graphene membranes directly on diamond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This opens up more avenues to exploit full advantages of intrinsic properties of suspended graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the graphene-on-diamond platform is promising for the development of high performance, energy-efficient nanoelectronic devices.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
