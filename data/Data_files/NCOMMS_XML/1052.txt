Central and peripheral clocks are coupled by a neuropeptide pathway in Drosophila  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Animal circadian clocks consist of central and peripheral pacemakers, which are coordinated to produce daily rhythms in physiology and behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite its importance for optimal performance and health, the mechanism of clock coordination is poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we dissect the pathway through which the circadian clock of Drosophila imposes daily rhythmicity to the pattern of adult emergence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rhythmicity depends on the coupling between the brain clock and a peripheral clock in the prothoracic gland (PG), which produces the steroid hormone, ecdysone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Time information from the central clock is transmitted via the neuropeptide, sNPF, to non-clock neurons that produce the neuropeptide, PTTH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These secretory neurons then forward time information to the PG clock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show that the central clock exerts a dominant role on the peripheral clock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This use of two coupled clocks could serve as a paradigm to understand how daily steroid hormone rhythms are generated in animals.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Circadian clocks impose daily periodicities to many behaviours and physiological processes in a wide variety of organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In animals, many tissues are known to contain circadian pacemakers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas much is currently known about the molecular mechanisms that produce rhythmicity within circadian pacemakers, less is known about how the activity of these pacemakers is coordinated within an animal, even though loss of synchronization between pacemakers can contribute to circadian rhythm and sleep disorders, as well as metabolic and cardiovascular diseases1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mammals, coordination is effected by the central pacemaker of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)4 through poorly understood pathways, but which include neural, endocrine5,6 and even thermal signals7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In insects, by contrast, most peripheral pacemakers are autonomous, and their synchronization is accomplished through exposure to common entraining signals such as light, which can penetrate the translucid exoskeleton, or temperature8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, more complex relationships between central and peripheral clocks have also been reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Drosophila, for example, the clock in the peripheral pheromone-producing oenocyte cells can be set by pigment dispersing factor (PDF), the principal neuropeptide produced by the central clock in the brain9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An even more complex relationship has recently been reported for the fat body, where the cycling of some genes depends on the fat body clock whereas that of other genes occurs in response to peptidergic central brain signals mediated by the neuropeptide F (NPF) neuropeptide10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we investigated the mechanism that couples the central brain clock to the peripheral clock of the prothoracic gland (PG), which underlies the circadian control of adult emergence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PG is the endocrine gland that produces the steroid moulting hormone, ecdysone (E), and previous work in Drosophila12,13 and other insects14,15 has shown that the activity of the PG clock depends on the brain clock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together these two clocks restrict the time of adult emergence to a species-specific window within the day16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A long-standing presumption has been that the brain clock communicates with the PG clock via PDF16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the larval brain of Drosophila, the PDF-expressing clock neurons known as lateral neurons (LNs) project to the dorsal region of the brain and terminate in close proximity to the dendritic arbours of neurons that produce the prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), which controls ecdysone production by the PG19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we show that a similar anatomical relationship between the small ventral LNs (sLNvs), a critical subclass of central pacemaker neurons, and the PTTH neurons also exists in the pharate adult brain of the fruit fly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, this connection is not effected by PDF but by short NPF (sNPF), a second neuropeptide produced by sLNv neurons22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show that PTTH neurons transmit the central brain timing information to the PG via the neuropeptide PTTH, acting on its receptor encoded by the torso gene23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, by examining the consequences on the rhythmicity of emergence of separately altering the speed of the central versus the peripheral PG clock we show that the brain clock exerts a dominant influence on the PG clock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our findings identify the peptidergic pathway that connects the brain clock to the peripheral PG clock to regulate the timing of this critical behaviour, and demonstrate the hierarchical relationship between these two clocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results are reminiscent of the control of the circadian rhythm of glucocorticoid (GC) production in mammals, which depends on functional clocks in the SCN and in the adrenal gland.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, the mechanisms through which central and peripheral clocks are coordinated to time steroid hormone action are still incompletely understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The control of emergence in Drosophila may provide a genetically tractable model to uncover general mechanisms behind such daily endocrine rhythms.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'sLNv clock neurons are connected to PTTH neurons via sNPF', 'The central clock of Drosophila includes around 150 clock neurons24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these, 8 pairs of ventral LNs (LNvs) express the neuropeptide PDF, which is key for the expression of behavioural circadian rhythmicity25,26, including rhythmic adult emergence16,17, and is one of the intercellular signals that coordinates the phase of the various clock neurons27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the prominent projections from the small LNvs (sLNvs) to the superior protocerebrum occur in close proximity to neurons known to control specific behaviours, suggesting that PDF may also be a clock output signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the pharate adult brain in particular, it overlaps with the dendritic field of the PTTH producing neurons (Fig 1ac), which regulate the timing of every insect moult29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PTTH neurons project to the PG (Fig 1d,e), where local release of PTTH causes the synthesis of E (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the levels of ecdysone must fall below threshold levels in order for emergence to occur30,31, this anatomical arrangement suggests that PDF, acting on PTTH neurons, could provide a pathway through which the central clock could influence the PG clock and gate the time of adult emergence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, despite these auspicious observations, we found that PTTH neurons did not respond to PDF application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PDF receptor (PDFR) is a secretin receptor-like G protein-coupled receptor32 and signals through cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Challenging with PDF larval or pharate adult brains expressing the genetically encoded cAMP sensor, Epac1-camps33, did not cause a decrease in FRET signal in PTTH neurons (Fig 2a,c), which is expected33,34 in response to an increase in cAMP, except when PDFR was ectopically expressed in these neurons (Fig 2b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this observation, downregulating PDFR in PTTH neurons did not affect the rhythmicity of emergence (Fig 3b,f; compare with control, Fig 3d,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the aberrant timing of eclosion expressed by pdf null mutants16 occurs because the lack of this neuropeptide causes the brain clock itself to become arrhythmic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, residual rhythmicity in pdf null mutants is apparent in the first 2 days of DD (Supplementary Fig 1a, asterisks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This situation mirrors the one observed for locomotor activity35 and suggests that PDFs role in the control of eclosion is limited to the coordination of the various pacemakers in the fly brain27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, we found that sNPF, a second neuropeptide produced by the PDF-positive sLNvs (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22), caused a rapid decrease in the fluctuations in free calcium in PTTH neurons (Fig 2df; Supplementary Movie 1), reminiscent of sNPF-induced suppression of spontaneous calcium waves in larval motoneurons34; no response was observed when we monitored changes in cAMP levels in PTTH neurons (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, optogenetic activation of PDF neurons using the orthogonal LexA/LexAop expression system mimicked the reduction in cytosolic calcium levels induced by sNPF in the PTTH neurons (Fig 2gi; Supplementary Movie 2), suggesting that sLNv neurons could inhibit PTTH neurons via sNPF; no such response was obtained in flies lacking the pdf-LexA driver (ptth-Gal4 greater than GCaMP6m,  greater than LexAop-ChR-XXL; Supplementary Movie 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, RNAi-mediated knockdown of the sNPF receptor specifically in PTTH neurons abolished the circadian rhythmicity of emergence (Fig 3c,f; compare with control, Fig 3d,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the sNPF peptide is the principal circadian signal to PTTH neurons, and that this signal could be provided directly by sLNv neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Anatomical relationship between PDF- and PTTH-positive neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) PDF and ptth-gal4 expression in the fly brain before emergence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PDF-positive (magenta) and PTTH neurons (green) arborize in the superior protocerebrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Arborization pattern of PTTH neurons shown alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Higher magnification of a 1 m Z-stack of the superior lateral protocerebrum boxed in a, showing the close proximity between the arborizations of PTTH neurons and the endings of the PDF-expressing sLNvs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Sagittal view of the medial region of a pharate fly head and anterior thorax.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Confocal projection of the white box shown in d.

compare with control, Fig 3d,f); the same phenotype was obtained following targeted killing (Supplementary Fig 3a,e) or electrical silencing of PTTH neurons (Supplementary Fig 3be).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that the PTTH neurons provide, via the PTTH neuropeptide, the brain signal that gates the time of adult emergence following light entrainment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This signal is likely required for circadian rhythmicity itself versus simply coupling the activity of the brain clock to the output pathway, since cultures entrained using a warm/cold (WC) temperature regime then also showed an arrhythmic pattern of emergence under conditions of constant darkness and temperature (DD+CC regime; Fig 4a,j; compare with controls, Fig 4b,c,j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, such cultures eclosed rhythmically under DD+WC (Fig 4d,j) and LD+CC (Fig 4g,j) conditions (as did the corresponding controls, Fig 4e,f,j and Fig 4h,i,j, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could occur because the clock in the PG (see below) is directly entrained by light and temperature cycles; indeed, the PG of other insects has been shown to contain a light-entrainable and temperature compensated clock36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although PTTH is required for circadian rhythmicity of emergence, the PTTH timing signal seems to be independent of rhythmic gene expression, as we were unable to detect circadian or ultradian fluctuations of Ptth messenger RNA levels in pharate heads (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the timing information from the central clock may be encoded in the PTTH neurons by a different mechanism, such as rhythmic peptide release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: PTTH neurons are required for entrainment by temperature cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ac) Left: pattern of emergence in DD from cultures entrained in DD with a 12 h:12 h 25 °C/16 °C (WC) temperature cycle in which PTTH neurons were selectively killed (a) and in controls (b,c);

compare with control, Fig 3k,l).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, no residual rhythmicity was observed when torso was knocked down in the PG (Supplementary Fig 1b), suggesting that the PG clock is stopped when PTTH signalling to the PG is disrupted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, knockdown of torso in the PG also eliminated the molecular oscillations in the PG monitored using the cre-luciferase reporter38 (Fig 3m) as well as a period-luciferase reporter (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, knockdown of torso using the timeless-gal4 driver, which is expressed in brain pacemaker neurons as well as in the PG (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The emergence of the adult fly is controlled by the circadian clock, which restricts the time of eclosion to a species-specific time window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This control depends on the presence of a functional clock in the brain and in the PG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we have identified the pathway through which the central brain clock exerts its influence on the peripheral PG clock (cf., Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PDF neuropeptide plays a key role in coordinating the activity of the network of pacemaker neurons of the central clock26,43 and also plays a role in setting the phase of some peripheral clocks9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, although it has long been assumed that the brain would influence the PG clock via PDF, we show here that the PTTH neurons receive central clock input via the inhibitory sNPF neuropeptide; PTTH neurons then transmit this time information to the PG via the PTTH neuropeptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This arrangement joins other cases where LN clock neurons communicate with the periphery using neuropeptides other than PDF, as occurs for some cycling genes in the flys fat body10, which is mediated through NPF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with sNPFs inhibitory action on calcium activity of the PTTH neurons in pharate adults, ablation of PDF neurons allows a stronger and faster response to light stimulation in larval PTTH neurons19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will be interesting to establish whether the use of sNPF-mediated inhibition as a clock-to-PTTH neuron signal is a general feature throughout the insects, as close proximity of clock and PTTH neuronal termini has been found in many hemi- and holometabolous insects44,45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By selectively speeding up the brain or the PG clock we show that the brain clock exerts a dominant action on the PG clock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming that sNPF is temporally co-released with PDF, our findings imply that the central clocks contribution to the gating of eclosion would be mediated through an inhibition of steroidogenesis starting in the early morning, when PDF release is believed to be maximal47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This signal would then cause the ecdysone titer to drop below the required threshold30,31, resulting in the commitment to emerge during the next gate to be made around lights-off48 and causing the gate to open starting at dawn of the following day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the bug, Rhodnius, moulting is accompanied by dramatic circadian oscillations in ecdysone titers31,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, whereas these titers in general rise during the dark phase of the light:dark cycle, they drop during the final night before emergence; this final drop would then lead to the opening of the emergence gate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, injections of 20E destroy the gating of emergence31, consistent with the notion that gating is regulated by ecdysone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, this picture differs from that obtained in other insects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, ecdysone titers show at most shallow circadian oscillations in the moth, Manduca sexta30, and injections of 20E do not destroy the gating of adult emergence but instead cause animals to emerge later during the same gate or to eclose during a later gate50; likewise, no circadian oscillations in 20E titers have been described during Drosophila metamorphosis51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the specific mechanism may differ among insect species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the entirety of metamorphosis of Drosophila lasts only about 100 h, which may be too short a duration for timing of emergence to be controlled through a circadian regulation of ecdysone titers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, it could be that in all insects the time when the circadian clock exerts its critical influence is during the final day of the moult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, regardless of whether ecdysteroids express circadian oscillations in titers, the commitment to emerge occurs during the last day before emergence (Rhodnius53, Manduca30 and Drosophila48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although we have identified the neuropeptides that connect the brain clock to the PG clock, many questions remain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we do not understand the relationship between PTTH signalling and 20E production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, although PTTH synthesis is under clock control (at least in the adult54), its messenger RNA does not cycle with circadian periodicity in the pharate adult (Supplementary Fig 5), the larva21 or the adult54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will also be important to determine how PTTH signalling affects the PG clock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is especially intriguing that both brain and PG clocks are necessary for a circadian rhythmicity of emergence (Fig 7, Supplementary Figs 1 and 9), yet interfering with PTTH signalling in the PG eliminates PG clock cycling (Fig 3m; Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is reminiscent of the situation described for the clock control of GC production by the mammalian adrenal gland.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case circadian cycling in GC titers also depends on a functional central clock (housed in the SCN) as well as a functional peripheral clock in the adrenal gland3, which gate the sensitivity to corticotropin-releasing hormone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood but involve the regulation of cholesterol transport via clock control of Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory protein (StAR) expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the GC rhythms affect the cycling of clock genes in other peripheral clocks, revealing that the adrenal gland clock may play a more dominant role among peripheral clocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By analogy, and especially considering that 20E is also a steroid hormone with potent genomic effects55, it is possible that the PG clock could exert a similarly dominant influence on other peripheral clocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Ecdysone feeds into the molecular clockwork by modulating clockwork orange and clock/period expression via the ecdysone receptor and the downstream targets, Eip75 (ecdysone-induced protein 75) and microRNA let-7 (refs 54, 56, 57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Eip75B is the fly homologue of REV-ERB  and REV-ERB , which are key regulatory elements of the core molecular clock of mammals6,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This notable conservation between mammals and Drosophila in the functioning and steroid feedback of the circadian clock extends the previously noted conservation at the level of the pacemaker itself58 and at the level of the intra-pacemaker coordination by peptides activating the same Family B1 GPCR signalling pathway vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and PDF, in mice and flies, respectively26,59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could mean that the genetically tractable circadian system of the fly could also be used to understand how the different mammalian clocks are coordinated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will also be interesting to determine whether similar deep homologies extend to the actions of the sNPF signalling pathway and those of its vertebrate homologue, prolactin-releasing peptide60, which has been implicated in the control of mammalian circadian rhythmicity and/or sleep regulation61.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
