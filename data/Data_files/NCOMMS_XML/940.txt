Pathways for balancing CO2 emissions and sinks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In December 2015 in Paris, leaders committed to achieve global, net decarbonization of human activities before 2100.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This achievement would halt and even reverse anthropogenic climate change through the net removal of carbon from the atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the Paris documents contain few specific prescriptions for emissions mitigation, leaving various countries to pursue their own agendas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this analysis, we project energy and land-use emissions mitigation pathways through 2100, subject to best-available parameterization of carbon-climate feedbacks and interdependencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that, barring unforeseen and transformative technological advancement, anthropogenic emissions need to peak within the next 10 years, to maintain realistic pathways to meeting the COP21 emissions and warming targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fossil fuel consumption will probably need to be reduced below a quarter of primary energy supply by 2100 and the allowable consumption rate drops even further if negative emissions technologies remain technologically or economically unfeasible at the global scale.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'At the Conference of Parties in Paris (COP21), in December 2015, negotiators from 195 countries agreed to pursue efforts to limit the (global average) temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The text of the Paris Agreement further specifies Parties aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible...and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with best available science, so as to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With these parallel goals, the agreement requires complete decarbonization of both the energy and land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sectors before the end of the century, but the pace of this transition is left to nationally determined contributions in accordance with the best available science.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Integrated assessment models can be used to link the emissions and climate targets of the Paris Agreement to necessary transitions in the energy and LULUCF sectors2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The continuation of recent trends in global land, energy and carbon systems defines a baseline scenario, or business-as-usual (BAU).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disregarding the possibility of transformative policy and technological shifts, BAU projects global carbon emissions, atmospheric carbon concentration (CA) and average surface temperature relative to preindustrial (T) through the end of the century.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternative emissions pathways, differentiated from the baseline in terms of the development of the energy or LULUCF sectors, can be used together with BAU to define a probable carbon budget for the achievement of the COP targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this analysis, we use the FeliX model to derive emissions, CA, and T projections for a Fossil Fuels scenario, in which the primary energy market share of fossil fuels remains near constant through 2100 and for two scenarios in which reliance on renewable energies (RE) accelerates modestly (RE-Low) and rapidly (RE-High) relative to the baseline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with BAU, these scenarios are defined by their respective primary energy profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we examine the potential impact of additional emissions mitigation in the RE-Low and RE-High scenarios through carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) or utilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that, barring unforeseen and transformative technological advancement, anthropogenic emissions need to peak within the next 10 years, to maintain realistic pathways to meeting the COP21 emissions and warming targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fossil fuel consumption will probably need to be reduced below a quarter of primary energy supply by 2100 and the allowable consumption rate drops even further if negative emissions technologies remain technologically or economically unfeasible at the global scale.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Atmospheric flux ratio', 'The concept of a carbon budget involves multiple dynamic, interrelated components of the global carbon cycle and can be defined in a number of ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a figure of merit, we define an atmospheric flux ratio (RAF) as the ratio of net CO2 emissions (anthropogenic sources minus artificial sinks) to net CO2 uptake by natural sinks (that is, plant, soil and ocean systems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The atmospheric flux ratio characterizes annual changes in the atmospheric carbon burden.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atmospheric flux ratios greater than unity (RAF greater than 1) indicate increasing atmospheric carbon concentrations, associated radiative forcing and temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ratio values between zero and unity (0 less_than RAF less_than 1) indicate net negative atmospheric carbon flux due to net ocean and land sink uptake, an important milestone on the path to climate stabilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, values below zero (RAF less_than 0) indicate net negative anthropogenic emissionsthat is, the achievement of the COP carbon emissions target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculate recent historical values of RAF on the basis of data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)3 and use the FeliX model to project RAF through 2100 for all scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Based on the most recent available IPCC data for global atmospheric carbon flux, we calculate RAF=1.9±0.2 for the period 20022011 (cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This value is in good agreement with FeliX model results, which estimate RAF=2.1±0.2, indicating that net anthropogenic carbon emissions are roughly double the combined net uptake by plants, soil and oceans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Looking in more detail at year 2015 of the FeliX

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Before proceeding, we offer a few remarks about RAF and its aptness as a figure of merit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we acknowledge that the roles of the ocean and land sinks are often left implicit in carbon budget analyses and the text of the Paris Agreement itself leaves ambiguous the definition of net zero emissions insofar as it does not specify whether sinks need be directly anthropogenic (that is, deliberately created as a result of mitigation policy) or natural (that is, caused inadvertently by the human perturbation of the carbon cycle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have included natural sinks in this analysis to present a complete accounting of global carbon flows and because the carbon flux from the atmosphere into other parts of the Earth system (that is, biomass, soil and the oceans) will be essential to the magnitude and timing of economic and technological interventions necessary to realize the COP targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Second, carbon emissions pathways have an impact on natural sinks through carbon and temperature couplings in the FeliX model, but the sinks do not feed back into anthropogenic emissions from either the energy or LULUCF sectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although some mechanisms could complete this feedback loop (for example, permafrost thaw or carbon credits in a hypothetical global cap and trade market), they are not included in this analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, RAF separates the external, prescribed drivers of each scenario (that is, anthropogenic emissions) from the internal, dynamic responses (that is, natural sinks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'With its global scope, this analysis provides a physical science foundation for consideration of the more technically challenging and politically sensitive adaptation and finance goals of the Paris Agreement1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the four RCPs established as benchmarks by the IPCC, the scenarios included in this analysis cover a broad range of emissions pathways and can be used to generate insights into the magnitude and timing of the transitions needed to realize the COP emissions and warming targets6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, our results show that the achievement of the COP emissions target (RAF0.0) before 2100 will also be sufficient to limit warming below 2 °C, even after accounting for the diminishing magnitudes of ocean and land sinks along decarbonizing pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This confirms that the COP emissions target should be regarded as the concrete benchmark for Intended Nationally Determined Contributions and subsequent negotiations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our analysis extends beyond the IPCC benchmarks in that the RCPs are not fully integrated scenarios of socio-economic, energy and LULUCF emission, and climate projections, but rather internally consistent pathways of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the RCPs are intended as inputs to coupled emissionscarbon cycleclimate models such as FeliX6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although the scenarios in this analysis are not exogenously linked with specific RCPs, our reasons for drawing attention to points of comparison between the two sets are twofold: first, comparisons across multiple indicators (that is, emissions, radiative forcing and warming) serve to establish the internal consistency of the FeliX model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, comparisons between FeliX scenarios and the RCPs serve to link detailed, particular energy and LULUCF transitions with representative pathways and mark progress towards the COP target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The timing of peak energy sector emissions is a critical parameter for climate mitigation strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even before the superposition of CCS, the RE-High
