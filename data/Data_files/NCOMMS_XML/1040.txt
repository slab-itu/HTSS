Optical determination of crystal phase in semiconductor nanocrystals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Optical, electronic and structural properties of nanocrystals fundamentally derive from crystal phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is especially important for polymorphic IIVI, IIIV and I-III-VI2 semiconductor materials such as cadmium selenide, which exist as two stable phases, cubic and hexagonal, each with distinct properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, standard crystallographic characterization through diffraction yields ambiguous phase signatures when nanocrystals are small or polytypic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, diffraction methods are low-throughput, incompatible with solution samples and require large sample quantities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the identification of unambiguous optical signatures of cubic and hexagonal phases in IIVI nanocrystals using absorption spectroscopy and first-principles electronic-structure theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-energy spectral features allow rapid identification of phase, even in small nanocrystals (2 nm), and may help predict polytypic nanocrystals from differential phase contributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These theoretical and experimental insights provide simple and accurate optical crystallographic analysis for liquid-dispersed nanomaterials, to improve the precision of nanocrystal engineering and improve our understanding of nanocrystal reactions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) are light-absorbing, light-emitting materials with diverse applications that span bioimaging1,2,3,4, light-emitting devices5,6,7, solar cells8,9,10 and consumer electronics11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These nanoparticles exhibit unique optical and electronic properties that derive from the crystalline nature of electronic bonding, tunable by composition, size, shape and crystal phase12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In recent years, solution-based syntheses have generated diverse and complex NC structures incorporating multiple chemical and crystalline domains within single particles, providing new and useful emergent properties13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To predict and understand the electronic and optical properties of these complex materials, a critical initial step is structural analysis using materials science techniques such as electron microscopy for morphology and diffractometry for crystal structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these low-throughput methods are a significant bottleneck in the synthesis pipeline that limits the capacity to explore synthesis conditions in high-throughput and to monitor NC growth in real-time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, a major advance was the discovery that NC size and concentration quantitatively correlate with features of steady-state absorption spectra that can be measured rapidly in solution17,18,19,20,21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Unfortunately, crystal phase remains challenging to measure in high-throughput.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron diffraction require pure materials fixed on a solid substrate and are not compatible with NCs dispersed in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hinders analysis for colloidal samples and may also introduce structural changes due to purification-mediated removal of surface adatoms and ligands needed to prevent aggregation or fusion24,25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, diffraction patterns become less clear as the NC size decreases, because reduced atomic periodicity broadens scattering peaks28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is especially important for NCs composed of IIVI compounds (for example, CdS, CdSe), IIIV compounds (InAs, GaP) and IIIIVI2 compounds (CuInS2, CuInSe2) that exist in two distinct crystal structures, zinc blende (ZB) and wurtzite (WZ), which can both be present in the same NC (polytypism)30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diffraction patterns of ZB and WZ phases only subtly differ and can be nearly indistinguishable when NCs are very small or polytypic28,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Distinguishing ZB and WZ is critically important, because phase is a key design parameter for tuning NC structure and optical properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phase-specific synthesis methods now allow growth of size-tunable NCs with either ZB or WZ phases for CdS32,33, CdSe33,34 and CdTe35 (CdE) compositions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A major outcome is that NC shape is determined by phase, as the high symmetry of ZB tends to yield spheres, tetrahedrons or cubes, whereas the WZ phase tends to yield rod and disk-shaped NCs13,36,37,38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two phases can be combined to yield structures like tetrapods with ZB cores from which four WZ rods extend outward in a tetrahedral geometry and different chemical components can be incorporated in the different domains33,40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phase also has an important impact on the types and spatial arrangement of crystalline facets on the NC surface, as ZB facets tend to be isotropic, whereas the hexagonal structure of WZ requires a multi-faceted surface with different electrostatic charges, anisotropic reactivity and an intrinsic electrostatic polarization42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The anisotropic WZ structure can also exhibit anisotropic optical properties and unique interactions with polarized light44,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we introduce a new methodology for NC crystallography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that polymorphic ZB and WZ NCs can be reliably distinguished based on optical signatures measured through steady-state absorption spectroscopy from samples dispersed in liquids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Focusing on CdSe and using a combination of experiment and parameter-free electronic-structure theory, we demonstrate that distinct absorption features (E1 transitions) at energies much higher than band-edge E0 transitions clearly distinguish WZ from ZB crystal structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allows high-throughput optical assessment of crystal phase from E1 transitions, independently from E0 features that provide size and concentration information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore phase characterization can be performed in liquid suspension and the high sensitivity of absorption spectroscopy allows the use of small quantities of material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This technique also provides unambiguous signatures for NCs with very small sizes (2 nm) for which XRD patterns provide vague phase information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show evidence that E1 transition features enable a semi-quantitative classification of polytypic structures by differential contributions from WZ and ZB phase-specific transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, substantial nonlinearity is observed with polytypism, an effect that derives from differences in electronic band sharing between different phase domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further demonstrate that this procedure allows monitoring of crystal phase during dynamic NC processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we describe the photophysical origins of E1 and E0 transitions, and discuss the applicability of these findings to other polymorphic NC materials.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Phase-dependent absorption spectra of CdSe NCs', 'We synthesized a size series of CdSe NCs using high-temperature organic-phase procedures that yield quasi-spherical particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZB NCs were synthesized from cadmium carboxylates and selenium dioxide at 220230 °C, and WZ NCs were prepared from cadmium phosphonates and trioctylphosphine selenide at 300365 °C (detailed methods are in Supplementary Notes 1 and 2)33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We prepared and rigorously purified monodisperse sets of WZ and ZB NCs with matched band-edge transitions, which we call E0 peaks, synonymous with the first exciton peaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1a,b, distinctive signatures of WZ and ZB crystal phases were evident from powder XRD by comparison with bulk standards, although distinctive features were not apparent for the smallest NCs with E0 near 2.7 eV (2.0 nm NC diameter).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1c shows ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra of these NCs dispersed in hexane in the 1.556.20 eV region (200800 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Well-known features of quantum confinement are apparent for both ZB and WZ, including a shift of E0 transitions to higher energies with decreasing NC size, discrete transitions near the band-edge and a featureless, monotonic rise in absorbance with increasing energy12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, band-edge spectral regions are similar when comparing ZB and WZ particles46, but large deviations are present in high-energy spectral regions between 4 and 6 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We designate peaks in this spectral region as E1 in convention with their bulk origins (see below)47 and demonstrate that their energies uniquely correlate with crystal phase: E1,ZB is 4.9 eV and E1,WZ is 5.1 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that these peaks are not readily apparent when spectra are plotted in wavelength scale due to compression of spectral features at short wavelengths (Supplementary Fig 1)48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1:

through the second derivative of each spectrum (Supplementary Fig 2)49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two phases are highly distinguishable by E1 peak energy for all NCs, even for small NCs with E0 transitions near 2.7 eV (460 nm), for which broad scattering bands in XRD spectra wash out distinguishing features (Fig 1a,b and Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E1 peak energies have little dependence on NC size compared with E0 transitions, which we evaluate in detail below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1e shows CdSe NC spectra simulated using density functional theory (DFT) that clearly show transitions in the 5.05.5 eV range that are similar to those in experimental spectra, with the ZB peak at lower energy than the WZ peak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these simulations, we used a semi-local PerdewBurkeErnzerhof exchange-correlation functional50,51 for which quasiparticle energies were approximated using a scissors operator (also used for bulk CdSe below) and optical transition-matrix elements were computed within the longitudinal approximation52 using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package53,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These quasi-spherical WZ or ZB CdSe NCs were composed of 147174 atoms and passivated by pseudo-hydrogen atoms to saturate dangling bonds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NCs are smaller than those tested experimentally, due to the large computational cost of DFT for large numbers of atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this causes the computed spectra to be blue-shifted compared with experiments, the relative trend between WZ and ZB is reliable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also note that excitonic effects are not included due to large computational costs of many-body perturbation theory for NCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we verify (see below) that excitonic effects are small for bulk CdSe and do not substantially impact the trends our conclusions are based on.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Relation to band-edge features and ligands', 'Previous reports suggested that CdSe NCs exhibit absorption features near the band edge that distinguish different phases55,56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared many sets of NCs with matched E0 transitions and observed that E1 absorption transitions were a much more reliable indicator of phase than any band-edge feature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was previously observed that the difference in energy between the two lowest energy absorption transitions, the first and second exciton peaks, is smaller for WZ NCs compared with ZB NCs56; however, no theoretical model or systematic empirical data has substantiated this correlation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the contrary, we find that band-edge transitions are highly sensitive to surface effects and ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, as shown in Fig 2, we found surface conditions that reverse the previously observed band-edge energy trend for ZB and WZ CdSe NCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2a shows XRD patterns of WZ and ZB NCs grown using standard methods described above, in addition to a third NC that clearly demonstrates a ZB crystal structure, denoted as ZB*.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These NCs were synthesized using the typical synthetic protocol for ZB NCs, but with the addition of sodium oleate, which we experimentally observed shifted the second exciton peak, but had little other impact on the NC structure or absorption spectrum shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2b shows that E1 absorption features for ZB* remained accurately indicative of the ZB phase; however, the E0 absorption transitions looked similar to those of WZ in terms of the first and second exciton peaks (see second derivatives of spectra in inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, E1 transitions are more accurate probes for phase than band-edge transitions, which are sensitive to changes in surface structure, shape and adatoms25,49,57,58,59,60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Relationships between absorption features and ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Powder XRD patterns of three CdSe NCs with standard ZB (red) and WZ

peaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The E1 peaks accurately reflect the underlying crystal structure, but the band-edge transitions of ZB* look the same as an E0-matched WZ nanocrystal rather than ZB.

oxide; TPP, triphenylphosphine.Full size image', 'We further analysed the impact of ligands on E1 transition features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We exchanged native hydrophobic ligands on as-synthesized ZB and WZ NCs with hydrophilic thiols (mercaptopropionic acid, MPA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2c, E1 transition features were conserved after this process, even in a solvent with a 42-fold larger dielectric constant than hexane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also evaluated the impact of hydrophobic ligands with diverse chemistries by measuring E0 and E1 energies for ZB and WZ NCs in hexane after ligand exchange (Supplementary Note 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We only evaluated ligands which colloidally stabilized the NCs and simultaneously prevented oxidative etching (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared oleic acid (OAc), octylphosphonic acid, octanethiol (OT), oleylamine (OLA) with tributylphosphine (TBP) and trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) with triphenylphosphine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed that MPA and OT completely replaced ligands on both NC phases, and phosphonates completely replaced carboxylates on ZB NCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exchange was less efficient in other cases, yielding mixed ligand coatings (Supplementary Figs 5 and 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, three different pairs of NCs with ZB or WZ phases had equivalent ligands (MPA, OT and phosphonates) and, in all cases, E1 remained in its phase-specific spectral window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2d, some ligands induced little shift ( less_than 100 meV) of E1 (OAc, MPA, OLA/TBP and TOPO/triphenylphosphine), but OT and octylphosphonic acid yielded substantial red shifts for both E0 and E1, especially for ZB NCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, E1 shifts were not always proportional to E0 shifts, which may be due to how the electronic energy levels of ligands align with NC electronic energy bands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We further note that ligands and solvents had only minor contributions to extinction near E1 peaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was necessary to acquire spectra with proper background subtraction to eliminate solvent impacts, and hexane and water were found to be optimal due to high transparency in the critical range of 4.65.2 eV (240270 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although their impact could not be equivalently subtracted, the primary ligands used had molar extinction coefficients less than 400 M1 cm1 in this range, which is much smaller than the 106107 M1 cm1 values for NCs (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming that approximately 100 ligands bind to 2.3 nm NCs and approximately 350 bind to 4.2 nm NCs, ligand absorption should contribute  less_than 3% of the total absorption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, spectra can be substantially skewed if NCs are not properly purified from their reaction solutions, which contain high concentrations of ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purification was simple, but methods must be validated for specific ligand classes (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, complete removal of phosphonate ligands required liquidliquid extraction at 60 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we used multi-step procedures for purification to exhaustively eliminate free ligands in this work, a single non-solvent precipitation was normally sufficient for accurate E1-based phase identification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Polytypic NCs', 'We further evaluated spectral features of polytypic CdSe NCs with mixed WZ and ZB domains separated by stacking faults, synthesized by established reaction conditions using primary amine ligands61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3a shows an example XRD pattern for a 3.6 nm polytypic NC, showing a structure intermediate between phase-pure ZB and WZ patterns (see Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantitatively determine the underlying phase contributions to this polytypic sample, we used the Debye equation to simulate 1,024 XRD patterns of 3.6 nm NCs with different polytypic structures (see Methods for details)28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then fit the empirical pattern with these simulated basis patterns using the least squares method to calculate the average polytypism from the averaged contribution of each structure to the final fitting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This yielded an average 65% contribution from WZ phase and 35% contribution from ZB phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3b shows the optical spectrum of this polytypic NC together with phase-pure, E0-matched ZB and WZ NCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As would be expected, the general shape of the E1 peak is intermediate between that of WZ and ZB, with a flat feature spanning the range of E1 energies of both WZ and ZB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that each WZ and ZB crystal domain individually contributes to the high-energy absorption features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the polytypic spectrum is clearly not a linear combination of the two phase-pure spectra, with lower total oscillator strength in this spectral region compared with the pure phase spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Spectral trends of polytypic CdSe NCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Powder XRD pattern of a polytypic CdSe

thus, comprehensive corroboration of these findings for polytypic materials is still ongoing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is further important to note that experimental spectra of polytypic NCs derive from heterogeneous populations of NCs in which stacking fault number and location may be randomly or non-randomly distributed, which can complicate correlations with simulations of individual NCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our simulated NCs were prepared to resemble what we believe are prevalent materials in the distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Monitoring dynamic structural changes', 'We demonstrate the capacity to easily monitor NC phase during chemical reactions with this optical methodology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured spectral changes arising from photochemical etching of ZB CdSe NCs that reduce the NC size and blue-shift the E0 peak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 4a shows NC spectra (normalized at 4 eV), measured by removing aliquots during the etching process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 4b shows the trends in E0 and E1 over the etching reaction coordinate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E0 increased by 0.4 eV as the NCs etched from 3 to 2 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison, E1 exhibited little change ( less_than  0.1 eV) indicating the absence of a phase change, as would be expected from a reaction mechanism that degrades the NC from the outside62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Process monitoring with E1 transition assessment of phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Absorption spectra of ZB CdSe NCs subject to photochemical etching, normalized by intensity at 4 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Curves are colour-coded to indicate the continuous shift in E0 to higher energy, with little shift in E1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Trends in E0 (black solid circles) and E1 (blue open circles) transitions as the NC size decreases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Energy regions for E1,ZB and E1,WZ are indicated by red and green shading, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lines connecting data points are guides to the eye.Full size image', 'Structural origin of phase-dependent absorption features', 'To understand the origin of the phase sensitivity of E1 transitions and phase insensitivity of E0 transitions, we first describe the two crystal structures and then evaluate the electronic wavefunctions, focusing on bulk crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 5a,b, ZB and WZ structures of CdSe have identical tetrahedral coordination between nearest neighbour atoms, with four CdSe bonds per atom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between the two structures, there is only a small difference in bonding energy and bond length resulting from interactions with second nearest neighbours due to how bonds are arranged in either staggered or eclipsed geometries31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ZB, all bonds are in the staggered conformation, resulting in a high degree of three-dimensional symmetry (Td point group) with four equivalent lattice directions parallel to each bond direction, denoted 111ZB, ,  and  using cubic unit cell notation (see Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In WZ, one of the four bonds connected to each atom is in an eclipsed conformation and all such eclipsed bonds are parallel in the lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This single conformational difference gives the WZ structure a less symmetric lattice (C3v point group) in which the direction of eclipsed bonds constitutes a unique 0001WZ axis (the c axis) in a hexagonal unit cell (see Fig 5d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The WZ structure thus lacks additional directions of bond axis symmetry, resulting in substantial differences in bonding electron energy levels compared to ZB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This leads to crystal-field splitting, for example, of the uppermost valence-band energy states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we describe next, the magnitude in differences due to phase depends on the energy and momentum of the electron undergoing an optical transition in the crystal, and thus determines how E0 and E1 peaks depend on phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Structures and calculated absorption spectra of bulk CdSe in ZB and WZ crystal phases.Bonding in (a) ZB and (b) WZ crystal phases, showing staggered (ZB) and eclipsed (WZ) conformations between two adjacent tetrahedral centres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Schematic drawings of (c) ZB and (d) WZ crystals with tetrahedral (Td) and hexagonal (C3v) symmetries, respectively, showing the spatial orientations of the analogous  and  lattice directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e,f) DFT-simulated absorption spectra and imaginary part of dielectric function (Im()) for bulk CdSe with (e) ZB and (f) WZ crystal phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Im() spectra are decomposed into two components indicated in g and h.

were calculated within the independent quasiparticle approximation (neglecting excitonic effects).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also calculated the spectra with excitonic effects and observed that spectral features were similar, although with slightly red-shifted energies (Supplementary Fig 9), justifying our use of exciton-free simulations of NCs, for which including excitons in calculations is still intractable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also noteworthy that accurate quasiparticle energies can be computed using many-body perturbation theory65; however, due to large computational costs, we simulated those here using a scissor operator that corrects the fundamental bandgap to the experimental value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To determine the E1 peak origin, we decomposed spectra based on reciprocal space contributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first Brillouin zone (BZ) is the primitive unit cell for the entire crystal in reciprocal space, shown for each polymorph in Fig 5g,h.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yellow cylinders indicate directions of high crystalline symmetry that are structural analogues between ZB and WZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For ZB the four 111ZB directions correspond to the ZB direction ( to L) and for WZ the single 0001WZ direction corresponds to the WZ direction ( to A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this breakdown, peak origins are clear in decomposed spectra, shown in Fig 5e,f.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E0 transitions, and almost all spectral features at energies less than 4 eV for both structures, derive from analogous ZB and WZ directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E0 transitions arise entirely from the BZ zone centre ( point) in direct bandgap semiconductors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The yellow region, corresponding to 28% of the ZB and WZ BZs, yields similar decomposed spectra for both phases at all energies, except in the E1,ZB energy region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The E1,ZB peak clearly arises from this shared symmetry and this peak is also present at the same energy in WZ, but it is substantially attenuated and contributes just a minor shoulder in the spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the distinguishable E1,WZ peak has a different origin deriving from the rest of the BZ, independent from ZB and WZ directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZB also has high energy peaks arising from these other directions of symmetry; however, they are at energies higher than what can be measured with ultravioletvisible absorption spectroscopy due to overlap with solvent absorption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are largely consistent with previous spectroscopic ellipsometry studies of bulk CdSe in ZB and WZ phases47, as well as representations of electronic band structures along high-symmetry directions and the corresponding joint density of states (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These origins are also helpful for explaining why E1 transitions exhibit less size dependence compared with E0 transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The E0 peak derives from the  point, which exhibits high curvature in the electronic band dispersion curve (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High curvature causes the charge carriers involved in the transition to have small effective masses and therefore large sizes that are susceptible to energy shifts due to crystal size (quantum confinement).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both types of E1 transitions derive from higher energy dispersion bands, which are relatively flat, leading to smaller charge carriers and weaker quantum confinement66.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the E1,ZB peak derives from bands in ZB directions that are more curved than the higher energy bands contributing to the E1,WZ peak, explaining why the E1,ZB peak exhibits some size dependence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, E1,ZB peak energies in Fig 1d arise from many more electronic transitions compared with band-edge transitions, so their values cannot be explained as a single transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, higher energy E1,WZ peaks derive from bands over a broader range of energies; thus, quantum confinement effects that pare away contributing transitions may be less evident compared with those for ZB, for which contributing bands have closer energies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional contribution may come from mathematical extraction of the E1 transition values through second derivative spectra, which loses accuracy when evaluating highly convolved peaks49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Wavefunction analysis', 'To depict the origins of these two transitions at the atomic scale, rather than crystalline scale, we used DFT to calculate KohnSham wavefunctions of different electronic energy bands of ZB and WZ CdSe in bulk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All E0 and E1 peaks derive primarily from electronic transitions from valence bands composed of Se (4p) bonding orbitals to conduction bands derived from Cd (5s) anti-bonding orbitals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that valence band-edge states are primarily localized on selenium atoms and conduction band states are primarily localized on cadmium atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 6a,b show wavefunctions of the band-edge ( point) valence and conduction band for ZB and WZ, respectively, with red colours indicating high wavefunction localization (95th percentile) and blue colours indicating near-zero wavefunction localization (5th percentile; nodes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is clear that selenium atoms are the primary location for the valence band and cadmium atoms are the primary location for the conduction band states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, despite differences in bonding geometry, the wavefunctions for both phases appear nearly identical at band-edge  points, meaning that there is little interaction beyond the nearest neighbor atoms underlying these electronic energy levels, explaining why the E0 transitions are similar for WZ and ZB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at other analogous locations of the two BZs, the wavefunctions are highly dissimilar, as depicted in Fig 6c,d for analogous K points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For WZ, these wavefunctions show strong polarization along the c axis that arises from more distant interactions that shift the transition energies and oscillator strengths.

Isosurfaces are shown for the top 95% of the squared wavefunction in red to depict high localization and the lowest 5% in blue to depict nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images are shown for the E0 transition wavefunctions which are (a) ZB valence and conduction bands at the  point and (b) WZ valence and conduction bands at the  point, showing that the two are nearly identical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the WZ valence band includes the split-off energy band to equalize the number of energy states to that of ZB, which intrinsically has higher degeneracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wavefunctions are also shown for higher energy analogous points in the BZ: (c) ZB and (d) WZ valence and conduction bands at K points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these latter two examples, drastically different wavefunction localizations yield drastically different transition energies.Full size image', 'Origins of E1 depletion in polytypic NCs', 'The lattice periodicity difference may explain the observed trend of reduction in total E1,WZ oscillator strength for polytypic NCs compared with pure-phase NCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The E0 transitions and the region up to 4 eV were relatively unaffected by polytypism (Fig 3b), which should be expected due to the nearly identical wavefunctions contributed by both ZB and WZ in the low energy electronic energy levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the E1,ZB peak should likewise be unaffected, because it arises from similar transitions in both ZB and WZ from their analogous ZB and WZ directions (Fig 5e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with our experimental results, as we find that E1,ZB was not depleted in polytypic NCs (Fig 3f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the E1,WZ peak was extensively depleted in both the experimental and theoretical spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is logical because the E1,WZ peak derives from non-analogous regions of the two phases, so a smaller number of atoms contribute to its total oscillator strength in a mixed phase NC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the E1,WZ peak effectively derives from a smaller NC compared with the E1,ZB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result of this should be an attenuation of WZ-specific oscillator strength because the relative strength of the E1 peaks in the spectrum strongly depend on size (shown in Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Other materials', 'All results shown above are for quasi-spherical CdSe NCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we also observed that phase-specific E1 energy trends hold for rod-like WZ NCs and flat nanoplatelets with WZ or ZB crystal structures (Supplementary Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the absolute values of E1 energies can be shifted from those of spherical NCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are further investigating these shape-specific trends to determine the quantitative impact of aspect ratio and confinement dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if these findings can be similarly used for optical crystallography of other polymorphic materials, we synthesized additional NC compositions and performed DFT analysis on other materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DFT spectra of bulk CdS and CdTe similarly show phase-distinguishing E1 peaks that arise from transitions analogous to those in CdSe, but with shifted energies depending on the chalcogen (Supplementary Fig 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also verified experimentally that E1 transitions differ for E0-matched WZ and ZB CdS (Supplementary Fig 13), but syntheses of phase-pure CdS are not as advanced as those for CdSe, yielding different degrees of inhomogeneous broadening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, we were only able to synthesize CdTe in pure-ZB or polytypic phases using literature methods and could not obtain pure-WZ NCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is further likely that E1 transitions will not only allow solution-based phase distinction of CdE materials, but also ZnE and HgE materials, which show robust E1 critical point peaks in spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements of NCs on solid substrates67,68.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will also be interesting to evaluate higher energy transitions in IIIIVI2 materials such as CuInS2 and CuInSe2, which similarly exhibit polymorphism and polytypism between hexagonal and cubic phases69.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the cubic phase of these materials, Cu+ and In+ ions can either be ordered or disordered in the unit cell, yielding XRD patterns that are difficult to distinguish, such that complementary crystallographic methodologies may be of great value.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Through both theoretical and experimental evidence, we established that high-energy absorption features (E1 peaks) in IIVI NCs can unambiguously distinguish crystal phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This confers the new capability to analyse and characterize the phase of very small NCs and polytypic NCs where powder XRD cannot provide clear crystal phase information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, this provides a new and powerful ability to continuously measure phase during synthesis or processing in solution by absorption spectroscopy, which can be more simple, rapid, high-throughput and potentially more accurate for structural characterization compared with solid-phase diffractometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, optical absorption spectra of NCs are rich in information when samples are homogeneous, exhibiting discrete atom-like electronic transitions, which is the source of their moniker artificial atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These spectra may thus contain more information than size and phase, and may be used to further reconstruct NC shape, surface facets and defects.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

illumination with a 4W lamp (UVP UVGL-25 hand-held UV lamp) with rapid stirring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction was monitored by measuring absorption spectra every 510 min to observe a continuous spectral blue-shift and a broadening of the band-edge absorption transitions, indicative of an increase in size distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the absorption spectrum reached the desired wavelength, aliquots were removed and NCs were purified by precipitation with excess methanol (10 × excess of aliquot volume) with a few drops of OAc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purified NCs were redispersed in
