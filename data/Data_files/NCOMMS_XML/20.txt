Entropy-stabilized oxides  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Configurational disorder can be compositionally engineered into mixed oxide by populating a single sublattice with many distinct cations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The formulations promote novel and entropy-stabilized forms of crystalline matter where metal cations are incorporated in new ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, through rigorous experiments, a simple thermodynamic model, and a five-component oxide formulation, we demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt that entropy predominates the thermodynamic landscape, and drives a reversible solid-state transformation between a multiphase and single-phase state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the latter, cation distributions are proven to be random and homogeneous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The findings validate the hypothesis that deliberate configurational disorder provides an orthogonal strategy to imagine and discover new phases of crystalline matter and untapped opportunities for property engineering.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A grand challenge facing materials science is the continuous hunt for advanced materials with properties that satisfy the demands of rapidly evolving technology needs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The materials research community has been addressing this problem since the early 1900s when Goldschmidt reported the the method of chemical substitution1 that combined a tabulation of cationic and anionic radii with geometric principles of ion packing and ion radius ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite its simplicity, this model enabled a surprising capability to predict stable phases and structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As early as 1926 many of the technologically important materials that remain subjects of contemporary research were identified (though their properties were not known); BaTiO3, AlN, GaP, ZnO and GaAs are among that list.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These methods are based on overarching natural tendencies for binary, ternary and quaternary structures to minimize polyhedral distortions, maximize space filling and adopt polyhedral linkages that preserve electroneutrality1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure-field maps compiled by Muller and Roy catalogue the crystallographic diversity in the context of these largely geometry-based predictions4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are, however, limitations to the predictive power, particularly when factors like partial covalency and heterodesmic bonding are considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To further expand the library of advanced materials and property opportunities, our community explores possibilities based on mechanical strain5, artificial layering6, external fields7, combinatorial screening8, interface engineering9,10 and structuring at the nanoscale6,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In many of these efforts, computation and experiment are important companions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Most recently, high-throughput methods emerged as a powerful engine to assess huge sections of composition space12,13,14,15,16,17 and identified rapidly new Heusler alloys, extensive ion substitution schemes18,19, new 18-electron ABX compounds20 and new ferroic semiconductors21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While these methods offer tremendous predictive power and an assessment of composition space intractable to experiment, they often utilize density functional theory calculations conducted at 0 K. Consequently, the predicted stabilities are based on enthalpies of formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, there remains a potential section of discovery space at elevated temperatures where entropy predominates the free-energy landscape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This landscape was explored recently by incorporating deliberately five or more elemental species into a single lattice with random occupancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In such crystals, entropic contributions to the free energy, rather than the cohesive energy, promote thermodynamic stability at finite temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The approach is being explored within the high-entropy-alloy family of materials (HEAs)22, in which extremely attractive properties continue to be found23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In HEAs, however, discussion remains regarding the true role of configurational entropy25,26,27,28, as samples often contain second phases, and there are uncertainties regarding short-range order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In response to these open discussions, HEAs have been referred to recently as multiple-principle-element alloys29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is compelling to consider similar phenomena in non-metallic systems, particularly considering existing information from entropy studies in mixed oxides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 1967 Navrotsky and Kleppa showed how configurational entropy regulates the normal-to-inverse transformation in spinels, where cations transition between ordered and disordered site occupancy among the available sublattices30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These fundamental thermodynamic studies lead one to hypothesize that in principle, sufficient temperature would promote an additional transition to a structure containing only one sublattice with random cation occupancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From experiment we know that before such transitions, normal materials melt, however, it is conceivable that synthetic formulations exist, which exhibit them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Inspired by research activities in the metal alloy communities and fundamental principles of thermodynamics we extend the entropy concept to five-component oxides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With unambiguous experiments we demonstrate the existence of a new class of mixed oxides that not only contains high configurational entropy but also is indeed truly entropy stabilized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we present a hypothesis suggesting that entropy stabilization is particularly effective in a compound with ionic character.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Choosing an appropriate experimental candidate', 'The candidate system is an equimolar mixture of MgO, CoO, NiO, CuO and ZnO, (which we label as E1) so chosen to provide the appropriate diversity in structures, coordination and cationic radii to test directly the entropic ansatz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rationale for selection is as follows: the ensemble of binary oxides should not exhibit uniform crystal structure, electronegativity or cation coordination, and there should exist pairs, for example, MgOZnO and CuONiO, that do not exhibit extensive solubility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the entire collection should be isovalent such that relative cation ratios can be varied continuously with electroneutrality preserved at the net cation to anion ration of unity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tabulated reference data for each component, including structure and ionic radius, can be found in Supplementary Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Testing reversibility', 'In the first experiment, ceramic pellets of E1 are equilibrated in an air furnace and quenched to room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temperature spanned a range from 700 to 1,100 °C, in 50-°C increments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  X-ray diffraction patterns showing the phase evolution are depicted in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 700 °C, two prominent phases are observed, rocksalt and tenorite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tenorite phase fraction reduces with increasing equilibration temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full conversion to single-phase rocksalt occurs between 850 and 900 °C, after which there are no additional peaks, the background is low and flat, and peak widths are narrow in two-theta (2) space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: X-ray diffraction patterns for entropy-stabilized oxide formulation E1.E1 consists of an equimolar mixture of MgO, NiO, ZnO, CuO and CoO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The patterns were collected from a single pellet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pellet was equilibrated for 2 h at each temperature in air, then air quenched to room temperature by direct extraction from the furnace.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  X-ray intensity is plotted on a logarthimic scale and arrows indicate peaks associated with non-rocksalt phases, peaks indexed with (T) and with (RS) correspond to tenorite and rocksalt phases, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two X-ray patterns for 1,000 °C annealed samples are offset in 2 for clarity.Full size image', 'Reversibility is a requirement of entropy-driven transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, low-temperature equilibration should transform homogeneous 1,000 °C-equilibrated E1 back to its multiphase state (and vice versa on heating).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1 also shows a sequence of X-ray diffraction patterns for such a thermal excursion;

a single-phase material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The second experiment uses five individual phase diagrams to explore the configurational entropy versus composition trend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each, the composition of a single component is varied by ±2, ±6 and ±10% increments about the equimolar composition while the others are kept even.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since any departure from equimolarity reduces

(1.5%) at the endothermic transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mass loss results from the conversion of some spinel (an intermediate phase seen by X-ray diffraction) to rocksalt, which requires reduction of 3+ to 2+ cations and release of oxygen to maintain stoichiometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address concerns regarding CuO reduction, Supplementary Fig 2 shows a differential scanning calorimetry and

experimental results shown so far support the entropic stabilization hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, all assume that homogeneous cation mixing occurs above the transition temperature.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The set of experimental outcomes show that the transition from multiple-phase to single phase in E1 is driven by configurational entropy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To complete our thermodynamic understanding of this system, it is important to understand and appreciate the enthalpic penalties that establish the transition temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In so doing, the data set can be tested for self-consistency, and the present data are brought into the context of prior research on oxide solubility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'First, we consider an equation relating the initial and final states of the proposed phase transition:', '', 'For MgO, NiO and CoO, the crystal structures of the initial and final states are identical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we assume that solution of each into the E1 rocksalt phase is ideal, the enthalpy for mixing is zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For CuO and ZnO, there must be a structural transition to rocksalt on dissolution from tenorite and wurtzite, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we again assume (for simplicity) that the solution is ideal, the mixing energy is zero, but there is an enthalpic penalty associated with the structure transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From Davies et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and Bularzik et al., we know the reference chemical potential changes for the wurtzite-to-rocksalt and the tenorite-to-rocksalt transitions of ZnO and CuO; they are 25 and 22 kJ mol1, respectively36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we make the assumption that the transition enthalpies of ZnO(wurtzite) to ZnO(rocksalt E1) and CuO(tenorite) to CuO(rocksalt E1) are comparable, then the enthalpic penalty for solution into E1 can be estimated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For ZnO and CuO, the transition to solid solution in a rocksalt structure involves an enthalpy change of (0.2)·(25 kJ mol1)+(0.2)·(22 kJ mol1), a total of +10 kJ mol1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This calculation is based on the product of the mol fraction of each multiplied by the reference transition enthalpy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This assumption is consistent with the report of Davies et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  who showed that the chemical potential of a particular cation in a particular structure is associated with the molar volume of that structure36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the rocksalt phases of ZnO and CuO have molar volumes comparable to E1, their reference transition enthalpy values are considered suitable proxies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In comparison, the maximum theoretically expected configurational entropy difference at 875 °C (the temperature were we observe the transition experimentally) between the single species and the random five-species solid solution is 15 kJ mol1, 5 kJ mol1 larger than the calculated enthalpy of transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that the origins of this difference are related to mixing energy as the reference energy values for structural transitions to rocksalt do not capture that aspect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While the present phase diagrams that monitor Ttrans as a function of composition demonstrate rather symmetric behaviour about the temperature minima, it is unlikely that mixing enthalpies are zero for all constituents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, literature reports show that enthalpies of mixing between the constituent oxides in E1 are finite and of mixed sign, and their magnitudes are on the same order as the 5 kJ mol1 difference between our calculated predictions36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This energy difference may be accounted for by finite and positive mixing enthalpies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Following this argument, we can achieve a self-consistent appreciation for the entropic driving force and the enthalpic penalties for solution formation in E1 by considering enthalpies of the associated structural transitions and expected entropy values for ideal cation mixing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As a final test, these predictions can be compared with experiment, specifically by calculating the magnitude of the endotherm observed by DSC at the transition from multiple-phase to single-phase states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Doing so we find a value 12 kJ mol1 (with an uncertainty of ±2 kJ mol1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While we acknowledge the challenge of quantitative calorimetry, we note that this experimental result is intermediate to and in close agreement with the predicted values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Compared with metallic alloys, the pronounced impact of entropy in oxides may be surprising given that on a per-atom basis the total disorder per volume of an oxide seems be lower than in a high-entropy alloy, as the anion sublattice is ordered (apart from point defects).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chemically uniform sublattice is perhaps the key factor that retains cation configurational entropy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an illustration, consider a comparison between random metal alloys and random metal oxide alloys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Begin by reviewing the case of a two-component metallic mixture AB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the mixture is ideal, the energy of interaction EAB=(EAA+EBB)/2, there is no enthalpic preference for bonding, and entropy regulates solution formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this scenario, all lattice sites are equivalent and configurational entropy is maximized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This situation, however, never occurs as no two elements have identical electronegativity and radii values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 6a illustrates a two-component alloy scenario AB where species B is more electronegative than A.
