Nanometric holograms based on a topological insulator material  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Holography has extremely extensive applications in conventional optical instruments spanning optical microscopy and imaging, three-dimensional displays and metrology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To integrate holography with modern low-dimensional electronic devices, holograms need to be thinned to a nanometric scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to keep a pronounced phase shift modulation, the thickness of holograms has been generally limited to the optical wavelength scale, which hinders their integration with ultrathin electronic devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we break this limit and achieve 60 nm holograms using a topological insulator material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discover that nanometric topological insulator thin films act as an intrinsic optical resonant cavity due to the unequal refractive indices in their metallic surfaces and bulk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resonant cavity leads to enhancement of phase shifts and thus the holographic imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work paves a way towards integrating holography with flat electronic devices for optical imaging, data storage and information security.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Holography has been widely used in optical microscopy, imaging, data storage, metrology as well as information security since it was invented by Dennis Gabor in 1940s (refs 1, 2, 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rapid developments of laser and computer technologies leaded to the advent of computer-generated holography (CGH) in 1960s (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CGH holds a distinct superiority over the conventional optical holograms because real objects are not required for holographic imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It enables generating holographic interference patterns of virtual objects by digitally computing optical wavefronts5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this advantage, CGH has a great potential to be integrated with modern electronic devices, such as smartphone and smart watch for imaging and display6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To realize these devices, holograms are required to be thinned to a nanometre scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, conventional holograms modulate the phase of light based on the propagation retardation in three-dimensional (3D) bulky materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phase modulation capability relies on the propagating distance through the materials, which requires the thickness of holograms within optical wavelength ranges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This drawback impedes the development of nanometric holograms and their integration with modern electronic devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The recent development of emerging flat optics demonstrates the potential to break the thickness limit7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultrathin holograms have been designed using various metasurfaces that consist of nanostructure arrays with alterable geometric parameters3,10,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, limited by the fundamental mechanism of Mie resonances (scattering), dielectric metasurface holograms are unlikely to reach a deep sub-wavelength scale (much less than the optical wavelength).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the nanofabrication of metasurface holograms requires quite complex facilities, such as focused ion beam lithography and electron-beam lithography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, using the complex focused ion beam lithography or electron-beam lithography techniques, it is also hard to realize large area holograms for practical applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Two-dimensional (2D) materials that have attracted a great attention nowadays can provide an excellent platform for realizing ultrathin optical devices14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Topological insulators are unique quantum materials that have topologically protected 1D edge states on 2D insulating bulk states, or 2D metallic surface states on 3D insulating bulk states16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They demonstrate a number of fascinating electronic and optical properties, such as spin-momentum locking, near-infrared transparency and ultra-broadband plasmon excitations18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has also been discovered that topological insulator materials hold the low refractive index in the surface layer but the ultrahigh refractive index in the bulk21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This unique property makes them promising for designing novel optoelectronic devices including nanometric holograms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we propose the concept and the experimental realization of nanometric holograms using a topological insulator material Sb2Te3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe that the Sb2Te3 thin film holds unequal refractive indices in the surface layer and bulk, which makes the thin film acting as an intrinsic resonant cavity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optical path length and phase shifts of an output light beam from the cavity can be enhanced through internal multi-reflections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on this new mechanism, we achieve 60 nm binary holograms of 3 mm × 3 mm in size using a simple and fast direct laser writing (DLW) system2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Holographic images are successfully realized with the nanometric holograms.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

elsewhere24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both n and k values are unequal in the bulk and the surface layers from visible to near-infrared wavelength ranges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the unequal refractive indices, an Sb2Te3 thin film acts as an intrinsic optical resonant cavity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two surface layers serve as two reflectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bulk behaves as an optical resonant cavity.

The conversion efficiency is defined as the ratio of the power of the holographic image and the input power.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison, the efficiency of topological insulator holograms is lower than dielectric metasurface holograms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One main reason is that the hologram we have used is a binary one which causes more noises than multiple-level holograms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another reason is that the phase shift for a 60 nm hologram (0/2) is still smaller than a metasurface modulated phase shift (02).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through increasing the thickness and the phase modulation levels, the topological insulator hologram efficiency can be further improved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the light absorption in the Sb2Te3 thin film is higher than dielectric metasurface in the

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The performance of the nanometric holograms is determined by several parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, in the nanofabrication process, the power density of the fs-laser beam affects the hologram morphology and resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our experiments, the laser beam fluence of 0.1 J cm2 is optimal for obtaining high quality hologram patterns and holographic images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the thickness of the Sb2Te3 thin films plays a key role in the quality and efficiency of holographic images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In principle, the thicker holograms generate a larger phase shift and thus higher quality holographic images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the images noise is lower for thicker holograms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These can be found through comparing the 60 nm thick hologram with a 25 nm-thick hologram in Supplementary Fig 4c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, in the holographic imaging process, the laser wavelengths affect the holographic images and the hologram efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have found that the shorter wavelength produces the higher efficiency due to the larger phase shift.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the light absorption is enhanced in the ultraviolet frequency range, which limits the further improvement of the hologram quality and efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, to achieve the best holographic image, these parameters need to be balanced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Compared with the fabrication methods of metasurface holograms, the DLW method does not require the complicated substrate treatment and the mask preparation process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the DLW fabricated nanometric holograms are more suitable for large-scale practical applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are promising to be integrated into flat electronic devices for optical imaging, data storage and security.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They can also be used as anti-fake stamps for credit cards and currencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, with the unique function of enhancing phase shifts, a topological insulator cavity can also be used to design nanometric photo-detectors and lenses.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
