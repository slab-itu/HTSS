Learning from data to design functional materials without inversion symmetry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Accelerating the search for functional materials is a challenging problem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we develop an informatics-guided ab initio approach to accelerate the design and discovery of noncentrosymmetric materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The workflow integrates group theory, informatics and density-functional theory to uncover design guidelines for predicting noncentrosymmetric compounds, which we apply to layered Ruddlesden-Popper oxides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Group theory identifies how configurations of oxygen octahedral rotation patterns, ordered cation arrangements and their interplay break inversion symmetry, while informatics tools learn from available data to select candidate compositions that fulfil the group-theoretical postulates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our key outcome is the identification of 242 compositions after screening 3,200 that show potential for noncentrosymmetric structures, a 25-fold increase in the projected number of known noncentrosymmetric Ruddlesden-Popper oxides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We validate our predictions for 19 compounds using phonon calculations, among which 17 have noncentrosymmetric ground states including two potential multiferroics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach enables rational design of materials with targeted crystal symmetries and functionalities.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Noncentrosymmetric (NCS) oxide ceramics that break all improper rotations and centres of symmetry are challenging to discover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Materials with polar, piezoelectric, chiral and those exhibiting circular dichroism (collectively referred to as NCS materials) are defined by the absence of inversion symmetry and are present everywherein the form of organic amino acids, sugars and other biological molecules1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inorganic NCS materials containing oxide anions are also not uncommon2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quartz crystals with a helical arrangement of corner-connected SiO4 tetrahedral units maintain the punctuality of our mechanical timepieces3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At inorganic crystalline surfaces, chirality plays a crucial role in corrosion processes, heterogeneous catalysis and the fidelity of enantioselective-based production or separation of industrial solvents, plastics and pharmaceutical drugs4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pb(Zr,Ti)O3, BaTiO3 and BiFeO3 are some of the archetypal polar oxides that have impacted many critical technologies5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Often inorganic polar and chiral basic building units (BBUs) are selected and assembled together, but acentric organization of BBUs within a unit cell are difficult to predict due to the complex interplay of chemistry and structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the context of inorganic oxides, which is the focus of this work, the design of NCS materials has relied mainly on BBUs with metal centres that have d0 electronic configurations or lone-pair cations, where the acentricity arises from an electronic origin due to the pseudo- or second-order JahnTeller (SOJT) effect6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A majority of inorganic oxides, however, strongly prefer close-packed arrangements of ions and highly symmetric cation coordination environments (for example, octahedra).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is mainly due to the dominant electrostatic effects that are optimized by favouring likeunlike interactions (that is, positive and negative dipoles align equally and oppositely), which stabilize atomic arrangements with inversion symmetry8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the presence of BBUs with d0 metal centres alone is not a sufficient condition for designing NCS materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the perovskite SrTiO3 is a quantum paraelectric or incipient ferroelectric9, whereas the isoelectronic layered Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) Sr2TiO4 is a centric dielectric10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, it is the complex interplay between structure and chemistry that determines the formation of NCS inorganic oxides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Alternative to pseudo-JT or SOJT effects, the trilinear coupling, hybrid improper or geometric ferroelectricity mechanism, where two nonpolar lattice distortions (octahedral rotations or tilting) couple to a polar lattice mode, have also been shown to break the inversion symmetry with interesting technological consequences11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even in this case, no a priori rules exist that guide the design of new hybrid improper ferroelectric materials, unless exhaustive calculations are carried out to map the chemical and energy landscape that subsequently inform experiments12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, NCS inorganic oxides are challenging to discover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although high-throughput first principles-based methods have shown promise in the design of NCS half-Heusler alloys13, exhaustive calculations for more complex crystal structures with numerous polymorphs (such as the RPs) and thousands of unexplored chemical compositions have not (yet) been demonstrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is partly because the potential energy surface of complex oxides is difficult to navigate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phonon instabilities at high-symmetry points away from the -point in the irreducible Brillouin zones cause the primitive unit cell to multiply several fold, resulting in large system sizes and vast numbers of unique atomic arrangements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is challenging to rigorously evaluate the energetics of all structures in a high-throughput manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, chemistries with partially filled d (and/or f) orbitals and the existence of energetically competing ground states complicate the structure prediction process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, novel approaches are desired to guide the first principles calculations in an effective manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Materials informatics, a growing field at the intersections of many scientific disciplines including data and information science, statistics, machine learning (ML) and optimization, has the potential to accomplish this objective14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we develop a predictive data-driven computational framework that unites applied group theory, informatics techniques and ab initio electronic structure calculations for designing novel NCS materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We apply it to the two-dimensional n=1 RP structure family (Fig 1a), for which to date few compositions exist in NCS crystal classes15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the chemical search space is (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use informatics-based methods to screen the chemical space and downselect 242 compositions that show greater promise for NCS ground states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The potential for discovering novel NCS n=1 RP compounds has key implications in technological applications that require a broad range of functionalities including high-temperature piezoelectricity, tunable bandgaps, improper ferroelectricity, multiferroicity and thermoelectricity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focus in detail on the design of NaRSnO4 stannates and NaRRuO4 ruthenates (where R=La, Pr, Nd, Gd or Y) that were predicted to have NCS ground state structures from informatics and subsequently validated by density-functional theory (DFT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the stannates, which are candidate materials for sensors and transparent conducting oxides18, we find two energetically competing NCS ground state phases: P21m (piezo-active) and P21212 (chiral and piezo-active).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculate their electronic bandgaps in the P21m crystal symmetry using hybrid exchange-correlation functionals, finding optical transparency in the visible light regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also compute their piezoelectric responses that show a dependence on R-cation size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In sharp contrast, the NCS NaRRuO4 are magnetic with metallic, half-metallic or insulating electronic structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their ground state is determined to be either piezo-active with P21m symmetry when R=La, Pr and Nd or polar with Pca21 symmetry when R=Gd and Y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, there is a transition from ferromagnetic metallic (R=La) or half-metallic (R=Pr, Nd) to antiferromagnetic insulating (R=Gd, Y) character as a function of R-cation size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, these bulk ruthenates are predicted to belong to the intriguing class of NCS metals19,20 and half-metals with piezo-active symmetries or antiferromagnetic insulators with polar symmetry (that is, multiferroics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Last, we also test our predictions for an additional nine new compounds with different cations occupying the B-sublattice of the RP structure (shown in Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among them, seven were validated to have an NCS ground state structureNaLaZrO4, NaLaHfO4, KBaNbO4, NaLaIrO4, NaCaTaO4, SrYGaO4 and SrLaInO4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results establish our computational framework as a powerful tool for crystal symmetry classification, structure-based property design and control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Octahedral connectivity of n=1 RP oxides and the chemical search space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The n=1 RP phase

'Approach', 'Our search for NCS oxides relies on a multifaceted theoretical approach, which reformulates the discovery objective into identifying structurechemistry interrelationships (as shown in Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The design strategy focuses on three key criteria obtained by subdividing the design process into unique objectives with specific tasks: ', '

Structural: How can the atomic structure, or configuration of oxygen octahedra BBUs, be designed to support the desired interaction?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemical: Which combinations of chemistries will promote that structural configuration?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stability: Is the proposed composition the global ground state?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Predictive materials discovery framework.Synergistic integration of applied group theory, materials informatics and ab initio electronic structure calculations for designing novel functional materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Applied Group Theory determines the geometric rules, uncovers the crystallographic symmetry restrictions and then subsequently shows how to lift them to achieve NCS structures for a given crystal structure topology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Materials informatics uses the data from experiments, features (such as orbital radii) that capture the chemical trends in the constructed data set and statistical inference tools to extract QCSR that guides selection of chemical compositions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DFT calculations validate the predictions from materials informatics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then recommend the validated chemical compositions for experimental synthesis and characterization, eventually leading to its discovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimentally synthesized compositions augment the training set for a second materials informatics iteration and the process repeats until desired materials are discovered14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this paper, we focus on computational tasks 2 and 3 (boxed).Full size image', 'Following classification learning from informatics and evaluation of the energetic stability from first principles methods, the final design relies on response optimization by leveraging additional degrees of freedom to further promote the targeted behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of the strategies include searching for microscopic mechanisms and external conditions (such as epitaxial strain) to energetically stabilize those geometries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that this paper is a significant advancement from the earlier work of Balachandran et al.15 where the emphasis was on enumerating symmetry guidelines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Group theory', 'In an earlier work, Balachandran et al.15 formulated symmetry guidelines for exploring and designing NCS phases in the n=1 RP structures based on group theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we discuss only the key results here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starting from the centrosymmetric (CS) aristotype structure (shown in Fig 3a), various symmetry-allowed cooperative atomic displacements (also referred to as shuffles) were enumerated that transform the aristotype CS structure to a NCS structure of lower symmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particularly, the focus was on CSNCS phase transitions that are second order or weakly first order, where the symmetry-lowering distortions arise from (i) non-polar octahedral distortions (tilting or rotations) due to phonon softening at the zone boundaries in the BZ of the I4/mmm space group, (ii) A/A cation ordering, (iii) the interplay between two or more octahedral distortions and (iv) the interplay between octahedral distortions and A/A cation ordering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The necessity to search for alternative routes to breaking inversion symmetry was motivated by the fact that NCS phases are seldom seen in n=1 RPs, which has been explained by the disconnected octahedral layers destroying the coherency required for cooperative off-centring displacements, and thus ferroelectricity21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: A/A cation ordering and octahedral tilting in the n=1 RPs for NCS materials design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) High-symmetry aristotype structure (, I4/mmm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) One of the A/A cation ordering schemes (irrep:  (1);

Some RP compounds also undergo structural transformation at a much lower temperature (for example, La2NiO4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under such circumstances, we take the lower temperature crystal structure to be our label for informatics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This simplification was necessary because 0 K DFT calculations are used to validate the informatics-based predictions.

shows that 45% of the compositions are undistorted (denoted as  in Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, there are also a significant number of compositions that undergo symmetry-lowering distortions, albeit preserving the spatial inversion symmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the key observations from Fig 4 is that there are only nine compounds with NCS space groups that conform with our chemical search space (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the literature, the family of cation-ordered NaRTiO4 and LiRTiO4 (found only recently), where R=La, Nd, Dy, Gd, Sm, Ho, Eu and Y, have been experimentally shown16,17 to have the piezoelectric P21m space group  (1,1;1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nominal electronic configuration of Ti4+ in these compounds is d0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coupling between TiO6 octahedral tilting (that transform as irrep  (1,1) as shown in Fig 3c) and Li/R or Na/R cation ordering (that transform as irrep  (1) as shown in Fig 3b) lifts the inversion symmetryin accordance with Route 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only other experimentally known polar n=1 RP oxide is the A- and B-site-ordered (LaSr)(Li0.5Ru0.5)O4 compound, which is reported in the NCS Imm2 space group23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this compound, a combination of A-site and B-site cation ordering work in concert to lift the inversion symmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to these compounds, Pb2TiO4, Ca2IrO4, Sn2SnO4, cation-ordered LaANiO4 (A=Sr, Ca and Ba) LaSrAlO4 and LaSrMnO4 have also been theoretically predicted to have NCS structures15,24,25,26,27,28; however, these results have not been experimentally verified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, the metastable Ca2IrO4 was epitaxially grown on a YAlO3 substrate in the n=1 RP phase using pulsed laser deposition29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the authors did not report its crystal symmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we do not consider these chemistries in our informatics analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the family of n=1 RPs with relatively simple stoichiometries such as AABO4, where A and A are two chemical species (similar or dissimilar) occupying the A-site and B is a cation with 6-fold octahedral coordination, there are 3,200 potential chemical compositions that satisfy crystal chemistry and stoichiometric guidelines (for example, charge neutrality), and therefore are, in principle, amenable for experimental synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, only 3% have been experimentally synthesized, and among these, only nine have NCS phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The objective of our informatics analysis is to utilize statistical inference and machine learning (ML) methods for establishing quantitative chemistry-symmetry relationships (QCSR) of known materials in Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These QCSRs, in turn, serve as a guide to rapidly screen the vast chemical space and identify new, previously unexplored compositions that favour the distortions given in the Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data set', 'In our ML approach, we build a data set of experimentally known materials that includes both CS and NCS structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though our computational design focuses on AABO4 stoichiometries, our training data set includes RP compositions that deviate from the AABO4 stoichiometry (see data set in the Supplementary Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We describe each n=1 RP composition uniquely in terms of its crystal symmetry or irrep (referred to as class label in the ML jargon) and a set of features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use WaberCromer orbital radii as features for ML30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Orbital radii and distortion modes have been utilized in the past for predicting structures and formabilities of complex oxides31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our ML objective is to build a classification model that predicts crystal symmetries or irrep labels from orbital radii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All 83 experimentally known RP chemical compositions (after removing (LaSr)(Li0.5Ru0.5)O4, because we do not consider the element Li in our chemical space, see Fig 1b) were written in the simplified A2BO4 stoichiometric form, where the A- and B-sites can have two or more elements with partial site occupancies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a total of 12 and 10 orbital radii features to describe the A- and B-sites, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If there were two or more elements occupying either the A- or B-sites, then linear combinations weighted by their relative stoichiometric proportions were used to build the features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We constructed two data sets for classification learning that uses: (i) space groups as class labels (an obvious choice) and (ii) irreps corresponding to octahedral tilting, rotations, or lack thereof as class labels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we focus mainly on the ML results from the latter data set (case (ii)) that uses irreps as class labels, which allows us to elegantly isolate octahedral rotations or tilting from cation ordering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, we can group or combine two space groups under the same label.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, we combine compositions with the I4/mmm and P4/nmm space group together (under the label, ), because in both cases there are no octahedral rotations or tilting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the key differences between I4/mmm and P4/nmm is that in P4/nmm the A-site Wyckoff orbit is split into two unique crystallographic sites15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, we can combine space groups P21m and P42/ncm into a single irrep,  (1,1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such data transformation reduces the number of unique class labels from 9 to 7 (see inset in Fig 4) for classification learning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main disadvantage with such grouping is that our QCSR model now cannot distinguish between ordered and disordered structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This should not affect our NCS materials design goal because of advancements in the nonequilibrium synthesis and processing of these oxides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, there have been experimental demonstrations of layer-by-layer growth of A/A cation-ordered n=1 RPs using molecular beam epitaxy with unprecedented control33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also tested the predictive power of our ML models by intentionally leaving out 14 compounds during training (which reduces the size of our training set from 83 to 69 compounds).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of our informatics goals is to validate whether our classification learning can identify the labels correctly for the left out compounds, before using them for making new predictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Even after reducing the number of unique class labels from 9 to 6 (since there is only one chemical composition with irrep , which we do not consider for ML), we must still address the problem of class imbalance, where some irrep class labels are found more frequently than others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This kind of class imbalance is problematic for ML.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the implications of class imbalance, we trained a decision tree classification model using the imbalanced data set and found that compositions with space group Pccn or (1,2) were 100% misclassified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Table 1 and Fig 3, Pccn or (1,2) is one of the desired class labels for designing NCS materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the class-imbalance problem must be addressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A number of methods have been developed in the computer science and artificial intelligence literature to overcome the class-imbalance problem34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of them include: oversampling (that is, randomly duplicating instances of the under-represented class category), undersampling (random removal of instances of the most frequently occurring class) and interpolation schemes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, we utilize an oversampling scheme referred to as synthetic minority class oversampling technique (or SMOTE)34, in which the under-represented class labels are oversampled by creating synthetic examples of extra or fictitious training data points from the original imbalanced data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is based on a k-nearest-neighbour analysis and one of its main advantages (relative to other algorithms) is that the extra data points, in principle, informs the ML models to create larger and less specific decision regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional details about the algorithm are described in the Methods section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We took the data set that contained irreps as class labels and applied SMOTE to construct synthetic data points for the two irrep labels, P4 and  (1,2).

dimensionality and constructs physically meaningful linear combinations of orbital radii (see Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, principal components (PCs) are also independent of one another (assuming Gaussian or Normal distribution).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After PCA, we reduced the dimensionality of our data set from 22 orbital radii features to 8 PCs, which together capture  greater

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We developed a computational strategy built on the foundations of applied group theory, ML and DFT to design NCS RP compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In terms of the novelty of our informatics approach, we note that the use of irreps as class labels for ML is new to materials science.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Normally, space groups are utilized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of group theory in our framework was to transform the space groups into irreps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From using irreps as class labels for ML, we were able to reduce the complexity of our classification problem from 9 to 6 class labels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even after reducing the complexity, we found that our data set suffered from class imbalance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this deficiency, we applied the SMOTE algorithm to generate synthetic data points and then constructed an ensemble of decision trees for irrep classification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our decision trees identified 242 new compositions (from screening 3,200 compositions) that show potential for NCS ground state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested our prediction for 19 compositions using DFT, among which 17 were validated to have an NCS ground state structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus find good agreement between our informatics-based predictions and DFT ground state structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the major design outcomes is the identification of two new multiferroics (NaGdRuO4 and NaYRuO4), which were also determined to be thermodynamically stable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is also important to recognize that not all our ML predictions agreed with the DFT calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, KLaIrO4 and BaLaGaO4 were predicted to be NCS but our frozen-phonon calculations and full structural relaxations from DFT indicate disagreement (Table 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the inconsistencies are found to be pronounced when both A/A cations have relatively large ionic sizes (for example, K, Ba or La).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our DFT calculations reveal that the presence of large A/A cations significantly reduces the amplitude of octahedral tilting, which we ascribe to the steric effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our ML models appear to incorrectly classify them as NCS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'There are several ways to reduce such misclassification errors and improve our ML prediction accuracies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We list some of them here: First, one of the most promising directions is to synthesize the predicted materials and determine the crystal structure for each compound, which will allow us to augment our data set with new data points and retrain our ML models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We anticipate our ML models to learn rapidly from these new data points and improve their prediction accuracy in subsequent iterations32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, our current ML models are based on five decision tree classifiers; one of the natural extensions would be to construct more than five bootstrapped samples and generate additional decision trees (or apply a random forest algorithm with hundreds of classifiers) that could, in principle, reduce the misclassification errors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, exploring kernel-based ML algorithms, such as support vector machines and semisupervised learning schemes represent alternative informatics-based avenues to gain confidence or reduce uncertainties in our predictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Furthermore, we demonstrated the use of the SMOTE algorithm for the first time in materials design problems; recently, a number of new algorithms35 have been developed for addressing similar class-imbalance problems, which could also be explored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that class-imbalance problems are ubiquitous in materials design and remains an unchartered territory in materials informatics54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the choice of more robust features could also improve the prediction accuracies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further computational efforts aimed at exhaustively evaluating the potential energy surface of related phases55 or alternatively, data-driven approaches56 involving inference models could further refine the predictions by addressing issues related to compound formability and order-disorder transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Notwithstanding the limitations, our approach provides a rational framework for structure-based design of novel functional materials with implications beyond the layered RP oxides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, our methodology can be extended to explore NCS structures in DionJacobson, Aurivillius, Brownmillerite or any crystal family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In principle, our strategy could also guide the search for materials with intriguing functionalities such as ferroaxiality57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The key component to realize such predictions will be the database construction process and more importantly, the nature of available data (including features) would determine the type of questions that can be addressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In terms of ML methods, off-the-shelf classification learning with class-imbalance algorithms (such as those demonstrated in this work) has the potential to provide insights necessary for guiding the accelerated search of new materials with targeted crystal symmetry or functionality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Advanced learning strategies (for example, semisupervised learning, algorithms beyond SMOTE and Bayesian methods) may be necessary, but the choice and its formulation will hinge critically on the available databases and/or prior domain knowledge.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
