Extremely durable biofouling-resistant metallic surfaces based on electrodeposited nanoporous tungstite films on steel  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Formation of unwanted deposits on steels during their interaction with liquids is an inherent problem that often leads to corrosion, biofouling and results in reduction in durability and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report a new route to form anti-fouling steel surfaces by electrodeposition of nanoporous tungsten oxide (TO) films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TO-modified steels are as mechanically durable as bare steel and highly tolerant to compressive and tensile stresses due to chemical bonding to the substrate and island-like morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When inherently superhydrophilic TO coatings are converted to superhydrophobic, they remain non-wetting even after impingement with yttria-stabilized-zirconia particles, or exposure to ultraviolet light and extreme temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon lubrication, these surfaces display omniphobicity against highly contaminating media retaining hitherto unseen mechanical durability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To illustrate the applicability of such a durable coating in biofouling conditions, we modified naval construction steels and surgical instruments and demonstrated significantly reduced marine algal film adhesion, Escherichia coli attachment and blood staining.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Steels are used almost everywhere from biomedical devices and surgical instruments, household and industrial equipment, to military, transport and architecture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is due to their superior mechanical propertiesstrength, ductility, elasticity and high corrosion resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Various steel alloys have been engineered to meet different application requirements allowing their incorporation into infrastructure in nearly all environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, corrosion-resistant austenitic steels are used in cutlery, medical implants, chemical industry, and construction and aquatic environment, to name a few1,2; ferritic steels combine good corrosion resistance with excellent formability and ductility and are mostly used for indoor applications; surgical-grade steels are used in biomedical applications3; ultra-light steels were developed to reduce the overall weight of vehicles4; high-yield steels are used in military and naval applications5,6; and duplex alloys (a mixture of austenite and ferrite) were designed for high strength, pitting corrosion resistance applications, such as heat exchangers, pressure vessels and chemical processing industries7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interaction of steel with various liquids, often aggressive and highly fouling, is common in most applications, and it generally leads to significant reduction in function, corrosion and contamination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, a variety of industries worldwide are plagued by biofouling8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, marine biofouling introduces surface roughness that causes increased frictional resistance and fuel consumption and decreased top speed and range of the ships9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prevent it, anti-fouling coatings have been widely applied; however, most successful coatings incorporate environmentally toxic biocides that impact non-target species9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The costs of microbiologically influenced corrosion of industrial water systemsa phenomenon whereby steel surfaces in contact with water or humid atmosphere are colonized by microorganisms10account for 23% of the GDP in developed countries11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, surgical site infectionthe most common infection acquired during hospitalization12,13is caused by microorganisms derived either from the patient skin or from surgical instruments that contaminate a traumatic wound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These postoperative complications dramatically increase hospital length of stay, costs and mortality12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'There are numerous approaches in the design of anti-biofouling materials: coating with intrinsically or artificially loaded antimicrobial materials, antibiotic or cationic polymer grafting, micro-nano structuring and photoactivation of surfaces14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of these approaches have substantial limitations, such as mechanical weakness, poor adhesion to substrate, non-uniform coating, leaching of toxic chemicals, lack of long-term stability and biocompatibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, a simple, non-hazardous and inexpensive method to prepare durable, non-wetting steel surfaces with uncompromised mechanical properties, which repel a variety of contaminants, has immediate relevance in applications that suffer from the above-mentioned issues16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In recent decades, superhydrophobic surfaces (SHS)17, which imitate the lotus architecture where water droplets roll off the nanoscopically rough leaf surface18, emerged as a potential solution to creating non-fouling materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many techniques have been reported to fabricate non-wetting SHS using large variety of materials18,19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the Achilles heel of SHS is poor mechanical and pressure stability of the hierarchical micro/nano surface topography that is essential for obtaining very high contact angles (CAs)18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the technological importance of SHS, it is noteworthy that neither natural SHS nor their artificial analogues have good mechanical stability17,22, and therefore cannot be effectively used in demanding, abrasion-heavy applications, especially to modify metal surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even more challenging is to create SHS that resist wetting by low-surface-tension liquids and biological fluids or minimize organisms attachment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recently, slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) were introduced as an alternative approach to anti-fouling materials23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SLIPS function under high-pressure conditions23, self-heal imperfections23, provide optical transparency24, reduce ice nucleation25 and are ultra-repellent to complex fluids such as crude oil and brine23,24, as well as repel highly contaminating biological materials such as blood or biofilms23,24,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These surfaces can be constructed from a broad range of inexpensive materials; however, approaches described so far do not result in materials that can be applied to steel without significant reduction in durability and are not therefore, suitable for demanding applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, of particular importance is to extend the SLIPS technology to mechanically robust systems that will match or even improve the mechanical performance of metals and alloys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To face the durability challenge, transition27 and rare earth28 metal oxides are emerging as important materials due to their versatile chemical, physical and mechanical properties29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metal oxide films are conventionally grown by vapour deposition under reduced pressure; however, the high cost of equipment, a small coverage area and the difficulty of producing porous films have limited their potential applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, solution-based deposition techniques, such as solgel or hydrothermal synthesis, are inexpensive, but limited to particular metal oxides, which commonly have poor adhesion to metallic substrates, and require expensive post-deposition treatments to achieve desired resilience30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, tungsten oxides (TO) have been studied extensively in the last few decades due to their unique electro- and photo-chromic properties31,32, electrocatalytic activity33,34, excellent resistance to corrosive chemicals under both acidic and basic conditions35 and high mechanical durability29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemical36 and electrochemical32,37 methods have been applied to create tungsten trioxide films for electrochromic devices32,38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this work, we report exceptionally robust nanoporous TO coatings directly formed on various grade steel surfaces via a facile, room-temperature electrochemical deposition technique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Durability and adhesion of TO films are characterized by nanoindentation, adhesive tape peeling, bending and particle abrasion tests40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TO coatings are as mechanically durable as the bare steel substrates and maintain their integrity after applying significant abrasive force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show the use of nanoporous TO films in fabrication of superhydrophobic and liquid-infused surfaces with unique mechanical durability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that our omniphobic-slippery TO coatings are able to retain their morphology and wetting characteristics under high-friction conditions and, at the same time, to completely repel blood and significantly reduce attachment of Escherichia coli to medical-grade steel devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, when this coating is constructed on an austenitic-grade stainless steel, a commonly used steel in marine environment42, the omniphobic-slippery TO films almost completely repel algae fouling without showing any sign of morphology degradation or environmental toxicity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

non-hardenable ferritic AISI 430, surgical (Fig 1c) and naval construction HY-100 grade steels (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Application of this approach to large-scale objects may require additional technological improvements, for example, the use of a pulsed DC rectifier in a standard two-electrode electrochemical cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Electrodeposited TO films on a variety of

the terminal W=O bond (947 cm1) is clearly observed in both Raman and the FTIR spectra characteristic of hydrated TO (e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Raman spectrum exhibits a single broadband centred at 695 cm1 associated with the OWO stretching modes of the bridging oxygen atoms and a band at 370 cm1 is assigned to the WOH2 translational motion (e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OH stretching and HOH bending vibrations of the water molecules are clearly identified in the FTIR spectrum around 3,340 and 1,620 cm1, respectively (f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The XPS spectra (g) consist of a single doublet at binding energies 35.7 eV for the W 4f7/2 and 37.8 eV for the W 4f5/2 corresponding to the W(VI) oxidation state (see also Supplementary Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The O 1s broad peak of bare stainless steel (h) is associated with the O2 (530.2 eV) and the OH (531.4 eV) from the native oxides and hydroxides formed on stainless-steel surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The O 1s spectrum of deposited films shows slightly asymmetric peak centred at 530.9 eV (H) that has been deconvoluted into three components: 530.8 eV (69.4%), 531.8 eV (29.0%) and 532.7 eV (1.6%) corresponding to the O2, OH and H2O, respectively, in the hydrated TO (see Supplementary Fig 3B).Full size image', 'Tungsten trioxide and its hydrates have various allotropic modifications, in which W(VI) metal centres hexacoordinated by oxygen atoms are linked in different ways owing to the distortions and easy hydration of WO3 by substitution of one oxygen of the octahedra by water molecules and/or by intercalation of water molecules between the sheets of the layered structure43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The golden-yellow colour of the deposits indicates the formation of hydrated TO of the type WO3·xH2O (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The degree of hydration was characterized by Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) techniques (Fig 2e,f)44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Appearance of the single broadband at 695 cm1 in the Raman spectrum and OH stretching and HOH bending vibrations of the water molecules in the FTIR spectrum suggest that deposited films are monohydrated TO with amorphous structure43,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-resolution XPS spectra of W 4f and O 1s electrons (Fig 2g,h and Supplementary Fig 3) show signatures of the W(VI) oxidation state and O2, OH and H2O in the hydrated TO (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  46), further confirming that the electrodeposited films consist of WO3·H2O (tungstite).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar observations were made when molybdenum oxide, which has strong chemical similarity to TO (refs 43, 47), was electrodeposited from alkali solutions48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has also been shown that WO3·H2O films adopt flake-like morphology during hydrothermal treatment49, and island-like structures are distinctive of pulsed-electrodeposited oxide films50,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Initially hydrophilic TO-modified steel surfaces were rendered superhydrophobic (TO-SHS) by surface modification with perfluoroalkyl-bearing phosphate52 and further converted to omniphobic-slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces (TO-SLIPS) by infiltration of fluorinated TO-SHS with perfluoropolyether lubricants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mechanical properties of nanoporous TO films on steel', 'Metallic tungsten is well known for its exceptional mechanical characteristics such as high hardness and Youngs modulus, melting point and resistance against oxidation and corrosion53, however the increase in oxygen content during oxidation and development of porosity is expected to affect and generally reduce its mechanical strength29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While majority of the research on thin TO films has been focused on probing chromic effects, only few studies have addressed their mechanical stability29,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have applied various techniques to characterize mechanical properties of hydrated porous TO films54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (i) Nanoindentation was used to determine the Youngs modulus and hardness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) Scotch tape and bending tests were performed to characterize adhesion of the deposited films to the underlying substrate55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iii) Water and hard particle abrasion tests were performed to demonstrate the resistance of the TO surfaces to massive mechanical damage over a large area40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Nanoporous TO coating electrodeposited on AISI 304 substrate was tested by nanoindentation and compared with a bare stainless-steel control (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During first hour of deposition, TO-coated steel exhibits a significant increase in both Youngs modulus and hardness compared with bare steel substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Formation of a thin ceramic film strongly adhered to the substrate explains this improvement (Supplementary Fig 4B,C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With increase in the deposition time, mechanical properties gradually decrease mainly due to the development of film porosity (Supplementary Fig 4DH)56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surface roughening is required to increase its hydrophobicity; however, many of the superhydrophobic coatings fail mechanically at this stage57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current system, no significant decrease in either Youngs modulus (E=39.2±17.2 GPa versus 56.2±16.4 GPa) or hardness (H=0.87±0.47 GPa versus 0.98±0.41 GPa) was observed for the most porous TO-coated films (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While nanoporous WO3·H2O shows lower values than previously reported for thick and dense sputtered WOx films on steel29,53, the porous nature of nanocoating, critical for the formation of wetting-resistant surfaces, does not compromise the mechanical properties of the underlying steel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Mechanical resistance of

100-m-thick stainless-steel sheets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As-deposited TO films show strong adhesion to the substrates passing Scotch tape tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, samples were repeatedly bent up to an angle of 180° and examined visually (Fig 3b) and by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No sign of delamination or peeling of the coating was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 10 repeated bending cycles, no fracturing, blistering or cracking occurred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemical and structural characterization of the coatings discussed above suggests that the excellent adhesion of TO films to steel surfaces is due to the formation of MOW bonds during the first few cycles of deposition (where M=Fe, Cr, Ni), while high durability under compressive and tensile stresses arises from the island morphology of the films, with energy dissipation occurring at the 100-nm-wide crevices separating the islands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Traditional abrasion tests employ water drops or solid particles to impact the surface and characterize the resulting surface damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Continuous bombardment of the nanostructured TO surfaces with water droplets (volume: 20 l, droplet rate: 1 droplet per second, impinging height: 5 cm) was performed and no mechanical damage of even the finest nanofeatures was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a typical particle abrasion experiment, superhydrophobic TO surfaces were impinged with yttria-stabilized-zirconia (YSZ) particles with diameters of 0.8 mm (2.1 mg) and 2 mm (28 mg) from a height of 40 cm over 2 × 2 cm area, corresponding to an impinging energy densities of 7.8 × 106 and 1.1 × 104 J per particle, and an impinging velocity of 10.1 km h1 (Fig 3c and Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such impinging energy densities are three orders of magnitude higher than the highest reported values for the most durable, abrasion-resistant superhydrophobic coatings40,58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that the estimated impact energy of a natural 50 m sand particle during real wind-storm conditions (according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) is just 108 J per particle58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3d shows an optical microscope image of a sample after 10 particle abrasion tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two types of damaged areas were identified: pale, hardly observable spots from 0.8 mm particles (indicated as I) and bright spots from 2 mm particles (indicated as II).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-resolution SEM images (Fig 3e,f) highlight the impact produced by 0.8 mm particles and show that it removes some of the fine nanoscale structure from the islands (Fig 3e, inset), while 2 mm particles push aside parts of the islands, likely exposing unmodified hydrophilic TO fragments (Fig 3f, inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Still, from the images it is clear that even after 10 particle abrasion tests, the produced dents are confined to the directly impinged area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of strong adhesion of the TO to the substrate together with the island-like morphology minimizes the propagation of the damage over a larger area.

the basis of the geometrical changes owing to the formation of well-defined dents, the increase in liquidsolid contact area of droplets sitting on the damaged surface was calculated and was found to be negligible, emphasizing again that the exposure of the hydrophilic TO fragments was insignificant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These calculations can explain such a minor decrease of the CA values even after significant surface abrasion.Full size image', 'In addition, the crystal structure of TO is temperature dependent62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, to determine the morphological and, consequently, wetting stability of the deposited films, samples were either annealed at temperatures up to +300 °C in air, or cooled in liquid N2 (196 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No noticeable morphological change of the deposits was observed after low- and high-temperature exposure (Fig 4cf).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the TO samples did not show mechanical degradation, when heated or submerged in liquid nitrogen and

minor and wetting characteristics of the surface will be preserved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CA of the superhydrophobic TO samples was measured before and immediately after particle abrasion experiments (Fig

lubricant, the resultant TO-SLIPS samples were resistant to wetting under all the above conditions, simultaneously repelling water, ethanol and silicone oil (Supplementary Movie 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to high chemical affinity of the fluorinated lubricant to the fluorinated porous solid, the lubricant is stably held in and on the nanostructured surface replacing air trapped inside porous structure and forming a conformal, molecularly smooth liquid overlayer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Liquids that are immiscible with the infused lubricant do not penetrate this layer and experience liquidliquid interaction at the interface with the lubricant, thus effectively avoiding pinning on the solid and leading to extremely low values of CAH and sliding angles and therefore high droplet mobility (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, thick and wide interconnected crevices in the TO coating serve as an additional reservoir to hold the lubricant, and help maintain constant lubricant overlayer on the surface under operation conditions as well as self-heal damaged areas due to high mobility of the liquid lubricant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, as we show in Supplementary Movie 3, even after intense

the scalpel blade surface experiences significant friction during incisions made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, these instruments are exposed to pathogens on the patients skin and to blood, potentially leading to infection65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Performance of the omniphobic TO coating was evaluated first by making an incision with the treated blades into viscoelastic silicone rubber slabs of various softness and stickiness (polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) base/curing agent ratios of 30:1, 20:1 and 10:1) chosen to mimic skin tissues66.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was followed by submersion into blood and a concentrated culture of E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'When the control, untreated scalpel was used, the softest slab (30:1 PDMS) stuck to the scalpel surface and moved along the direction of cutting creating uneven incision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the hardest slab (10:1 PDMS), it was almost impossible to cut through because of the friction, occasionally resulting in breaking of the plastic handle of the scalpel blade (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cases, incisions produced by untreated scalpels tended to have non-uniform cuts and fractures due to the stick-slip-like, jerking motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the TO-SLIPS blades produced smooth, nearly identical incisions on all slabs tested (Fig 5b), despite the presence of the nanoscale rough film on both blade edges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Repellent properties of TO films constructed on surgical-grade stainless-steel scalpels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) Incisions

5ce and Supplementary Movie 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TO-SHS scalpel lost its repellent property immediately after submersion in blood as evidenced by the adherent blood remaining on its surface and the pinned water film after the wash (Fig 5d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Qualitatively, the amount of blood was significantly lower on the TO-SHS scalpel than on the control as indicated by water colour after washing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TO-SLIPS scalpel showed neither blood adhesion nor loss of the slipperiness after multiple submersions in blood (Fig 5e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter result is in good accordance with previously reported blood-repellent properties of SLIPS under static or flow conditions23,24,64, but this important anti-fouling characteristic can now be displayed by a durable material after mechanical contact or damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Following these experiments, the control and TO-SLIPS scalpel blades were tested against concentrated culture of E. coli.

cells per millilitre (Fig 5f, insets).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of the colony-forming units (c.f.u.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  counts for the bacteria remaining on the blades are shown in Fig 5f.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TO-SLIPS scalpel blades yielded a significantly lower remaining c.f.u.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  count compared with the control (P=0.025).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work examining bacteria in contact with SLIPS, made from Teflon membranes, has shown that the presence of the immobilized liquid layer can prevent bacterial biofilm formation in several species, even after 7 days of incubation in a concentrated solution of the organism67.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was attributed to the inability of the bacteria to attach to the lubricant surface, as any toxic effects of the lubricant on the bacteria have been ruled out26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Another important application of steel is in the marine environment, where corrosion resistance to seawater and mechanical durability are critical, but marine fouling induces corrosion and drag, reduces speeds and significantly increases fuel costs8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we used the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as a model organism for aquatic fouling to explore the growth and adhesion of algal biofilms on TO-coated austenitic AISI 304 grade stainless-steel substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Untreated control, TO-SHS and TO-SLIPS stainless-steel samples were immersed in growth media with C. reinhardtii for 8 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over this growth period, there was a notable increase of algae density with no sign of

allowing easy shedding of the attached algae during airwater interface transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, biofilm was firmly attached to both TO-SHS and untreated steel surfaces during this

TO-SHS and TO-SLIPS can be explained by the instability of the air layer trapped in the superhydrophobic surface under submerged conditions, especially when in contact with biological organisms, as compared to the stability of the lubricant layer in the slippery surface under the same conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacteria, for example, have been shown to use their flagella to displace the trapped air layer from the SHS, providing a new surface for attachment68.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exact mechanism by which the shedding of the biofilm occurs from the TO-SLIPS is still under investigation; however, a current hypothesis is that the algae form a film atop the lubricant overlayer, and therefore, have weak adhesion to the underlying solid surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When transitioning through the airwater interface, the interfacial tension between the lubricant and water is sufficient to cause delamination of the biofilm26.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'An electrochemical approach to deposit mechanically durable, hierarchically structured TO coating composed of randomly oriented nanoscale flakes on sub-microscale islands has been developed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TO coatings were deposited on steel from aqueous solution of sodium tungstate by pulsed electrochemical deposition at room temperature without use of any post-deposition treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Steels of various grades, including austenitic, ferritic, surgical stainless and naval ship building were modified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intrinsically superhydrophilic, as-deposited TO coatings were converted to superhydrophobic by surface functionalization using fluorinated alkylphosphate ester.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After fluorination of the structured surface, omniphobic-slippery surfaces were formed by infiltration of a fluorinated lubricant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Chemical composition, structure, wetting and mechanical properties of the deposited TO films were analysed in detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we summarize the main advantages of the TO deposits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (1) A facile and environmentally friendly electrodeposition method produces thin mechanically durable TO films on steel electrodes of various shapes, such as thin sheets, plates, meshes, molds, small inner diameter tubes, needles and so on.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the TO films can be deposited in arbitrary microscale patterns by masking specific areas to enable spatially patterned durable repellent coatings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2) The TO films made using our method are chemically attached to the underlying substrate through metaloxygentungsten bonds that form during initial deposition cycles; further deposition develops island-like nanostructures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A combination of a chemically bonded coating with island-like morphology allows for excellent resistance to compressive, tensile and texture stresses, demonstrating unmatched mechanical durability and resistance to impact with hard and heavy particles (Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (3) Using convenient wet chemistry, the deposited hierarchical films were converted to robust superhydrophobic (TO-SHS) coatings with water CA of 170°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our TO-SHS surfaces show no decrease in their wetting characteristics after impacted with tens of thousands of YSZ particles with an impinging energy of 104 J per particle, which is three orders of magnitude higher than previously used in the sand abrasion experiments in which most mechanically durable SHS were tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (4) As-deposited TO films are amorphous and oxygen-saturated, making the TO-SHS surfaces insensitive to the ultraviolet irradiation, which is extremely important for the stability and long-lasting anti-wetting performance in outdoor applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (5) The TO-SHS coatings maintain their water-repelling performance after exposure to extreme temperatures in the range between 196 and +200 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exposure to temperatures 200 °C does not change the TO surface morphology, but partially decomposes the fluorinated layer, which can be effectively restored by re-functionalization in the same surface modification solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, when the TO-SHS surfaces were contaminated, annealing of these samples for 1 h at 200 °C restores completely their non-wetting performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (6) When converted to the omniphobic-slippery TO surfaces, TO-SLIPS repel simple high- and low-surface-tension liquids (Supplementary Movie 2), complex fluids such as blood (Supplementary Movie 4), and significantly reduce adhesion of biological species such as bacteria and algae without toxic effects (Supplementary Movie 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (7) The TO-SLIPS coatings retain their repellent properties and self-heal due to continuous self-lubrication even when surface is significantly damaged with highly abrasive materials, such as stainless-steel tweezers, a screw driver and a diamond scriber (Supplementary Movie 3) or after undergoing an intimate contact with or incision through soft, sticky materials, such as silicone elastomers or soft tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These results suggest that omniphobic TO-SLIPS surfaces provide unmatched combination of extreme mechanical durability and anti-fouling properties, which could be particularly useful in applications that require mechanical operation under harsh environmental and fouling conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As described in the paper, one important area where such coatings can offer superior advantages is in the medical field where metals are broadly used as implants, surgical instruments, needles, to name a few.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A mechanically durable, modified implant stainless-steel surface that prevents biofilm formation, without cytotoxic effects or risk of resistance development, would provide the desired protection against periprosthetic or device-associated infections that remain as a common and serious consequence of using indwelling implants in medical practice13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surgical-grade stainless-steel instruments and devices with wear-resistive coating that sustain soft tissue incisions, improve incision edge smoothness, reduce shear and stickiness-related inaccuracies and, simultaneously, impede biofouling adhesion and blood clotting will be beneficial in prevention of the surgical site infections in either conventional or minimally invasive laparoscopic surgeries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We also expect that our mechanically durable, temperature-stable omniphobic TO-SLIPS surfaces will find potential use in flow channels carrying viscous fluids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, three-dimensional printing is emerging as one of the most promising fabrication technologies; however, since high pressure and heating are applied to melt and flow viscous inks, such as PDMS, polymeric gels or thick particle suspensions, through a sub-millimeter-scale steel nozzle, the process is highly energy consuming and surface contamination with the transported inks decreases the feature resolution and precision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to semiconducting nature of the TO, the nozzles modified with TO-SHS and TO-SLIPS can be subjected to E-field-assisted droplet or jetting formation applications in which both conductivity and superhydrophobicity are required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the larger scale, a mechanically durable TO-SLIPS coating that is stable under high temperature and pressure can be also applied in stainless-steel chemical reactors, to keep lubricant overlayer on internal reactor parts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will prevent their clogging by the synthetic products and, therefore, will decrease energy losses and emission and increase the maintenance service period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'And finally, last but not least, we have demonstrated that TO-SLIPS can inhibit the attachment of aquatic microorganisms preventing bio-corrosion and fouling of steels broadly used in marine construction and maritime vessels, highlighting the possibility to apply these substrates as a novel type of non-toxic fouling-release coatings23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is important to further investigate the seawater corrosion resistance according to seawater quality, temperature and oxygen content, and stability of the TO-SLIPS under dynamic flow conditions and field studies, in the case it is considered as a fouling-release coating in marine environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While recent studies reported (a) the high stability of the lubricant layer in SLIPS constructed on aluminium modified with Al(O)(OH) nanostructures and subjected to high acceleration52, (b) retention of the lubricant on typical SLIPS surfaces in the flow-cell experiments performed at various flow rates69 and (c) biocompatibility of perfluorinated oils used as SLIPS lubricants64, a separate study specific to the performance of TO-SLIPS under various liquid flow conditions, its dependence on the viscosity and composition of the lubricant, feature size and shape of the tungsten oxide film as a function of the steel type and composition, as well as its biocompatibility, will be necessary.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
