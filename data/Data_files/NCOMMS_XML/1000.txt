Large scale meta-analysis characterizes genetic architecture for common psoriasis associated variants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Psoriasis is a complex disease of skin with a prevalence of about 2%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conducted the largest meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for psoriasis to date, including data from eight different Caucasian cohorts, with a combined effective sample size  greater than 39,000 individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified 16 additional psoriasis susceptibility loci achieving genome-wide significance, increasing the number of identified loci to 63 for European-origin individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional analysis highlighted the roles of interferon signalling and the NFB cascade, and we showed that the psoriasis signals are enriched in regulatory elements from different T cells (CD8+ T-cells and CD4+ T-cells including TH0, TH1 and TH17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identified loci explain 28% of the genetic heritability and generate a discriminatory genetic risk score (AUC=0.76 in our sample) that is significantly correlated with age at onset (p=2 × 1089).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study provides a comprehensive layout for the genetic architecture of common variants for psoriasis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Psoriasis is a chronic and complex multi-genic immune-mediated skin disease1 affecting around 2% of European-origin individuals2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous association studies of psoriasis have identified over 60 psoriasis susceptibility loci3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18, 47 of which are associated with the risk of psoriasis in European-origin populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings have greatly advanced the understanding of disease mechanisms and associated pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the IL23R, IL12B, IL23A and TRAF3IP2 loci suggest a prominent role of the IL23 signalling pathway and promotion of TH17 responses; whereas the TNFAIP3, NFKBIA, NFKBIZ, TNIP1 and RELA loci suggest dysregulation of the NFB pathway in disease pathogenesis19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately half (22) of the 47 European-origin loci were identified in cohorts containing a large proportion (50%) of samples genotyped using the Immunochip9,16,17,18, a platform that focuses on genetic variants from promising signals identified in previous association studies of autoimmune diseases18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, restricting analysis to markers genotyped (110,000)9 or well-imputed (700,000)17 on the Immunochip limits exploration of the full genome for susceptibility loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis for psoriasis to date in European-origin individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified 16 new disease susceptibility regions, and we also revealed various functional networks and gene regulatory signals associated with psoriasis, providing novel insights into the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Meta-analysis of GWAS studies', "We gathered genotype data from both published5,6,7,8,9,17,18 and new cohorts, consisting of seven genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and one Immunochip data set (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effective sample size of the combined data set (that is, the size of a sample with equal numbers of cases and controls that possesses equivalent statistical power to the meta-analysis) is 40,000 samples (Supplementary Table 1); with  greater than 30,000 individuals for the GWAS component, it is about three times larger than the previous meta-analysis with the biggest GWAS component3,9,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After quality control, we performed genotype phasing21 and imputation22 using haplotypes from the 1,000 Genomes project23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then carried out logistic regression on each data set to determine genetic associations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genomic inflation factors were below 1.05 for all data sets (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the case definition for one of the GWAS cohorts (23andMe) was based on self-reported information, we used the risk allele frequencies for known loci in cases and controls in other cohorts to estimate the proportion of misclassified phenotypes (Supplementary Figs 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, our results indicated that around 4% of the unaffected controls in the 23andMe cohort reported that they had psoriasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this issue, we implemented a statistical approach24 to adjust the summary statistics in this dataset for bias caused by response misclassification in logistic regression25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Supplementary Fig 3, this adjustment could correct for the downward bias of the estimated ORs and s.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  's, at the cost of a substantial decrease in effective sample size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ", 'We performed meta-analysis of 9,113,515 markers with good imputation quality22 (r20.7) in at least four data sets, using the inverse-variance approach26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of 47 known psoriasis susceptibility loci, 42 (89%) achieved genome-wide significance (p5 × 10-8) (the remaining five yielded p2 × 10-4; Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, we identified 16 new psoriasis susceptibility loci achieving genome-wide significance (Table 1 and Fig 1; Supplementary Note; Supplementary Figs 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meta-analysis using all but the 23andMe dataset showed suggestive evidence (p2 × 105) for all new loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, inclusion of the 23andMe data led to genome-wide significant findings for 14 of the 16 new loci, as only two loci achieved significance without the 23andMe data (Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the novel loci, the 19q13.33 region has been reported to reach genome-wide significance in a joint analysis of GWAS for Crohns disease and psoriasis15, and in a contemporary analysis of exome array data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The adjusted ORs from the 23andMe cohort did not differ significantly from those of the other seven data sets (p=0.2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found no significant heterogeneity of ORs among studies for all new loci (Cochrans Q p values  greater than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, all new loci reached genome-wide significance under a random effects model27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Newly identified psoriasis associated loci.Full size table', 'Figure 1: Meta-analysis results.The Manhattan plot shows the negative log p values of the meta-analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The known loci are coloured in blue;

p=2 × 108) with the risk allele effect sizes of the disease loci (Fig 2a; Supplementary Table 4; Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, rs76959677 has the largest effect size (OR=1.28) and the smallest MAF (=0.04) among the new loci (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, the 63 loci account for over 28% of the estimated heritability30,31, as compared to 26% using only known loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our estimations are very similar to those obtained using other approaches, as shown in Supplementary Table 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate whether the susceptibility loci could be used to discriminate between affected and unaffected individuals in our sample, we used the effect sizes and imputed dosages from our cohorts to compute genetic risk scores (GRS), and associated them with the disease status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2b shows receiver operating curves (ROC) plotting the true positive rate versus false positive rate under different GRS thresholds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The area under the curve (AUC) is 0.76, suggesting GRS has discriminative power for predicting disease status among individuals in these cohorts5,6,7,8,9,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Age-at-onset has emerged as a key clinical and stratification feature for psoriasis32,33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the correlation between age-at-onset and the GRS, we analysed 6,251 psoriatic patients for whom this information was available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that the GRS is inversely correlated with age-at-onset (Spearman =0.25; p=2 × 1089); mean age-at-onset was 34.9 years for psoriatic patients in the lowest fifth percentile of GRS, compared to 20.4 in those in the highest fifth percentile (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This correlation remains significant after removing the MHC signal from the calculation (=0.08;

Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the enriched functions, Regulation of I-B kinase/NF-B cascade (Supplementary Fig 9) contains genes from 11 associated loci, and three of them are novel (CHUK in 10q24.31, IKBKE in 1q32.1 and FASLG in 1q24.3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When taken together with genes (that is, TNIP1, TNFAIP3 and NFKBIA) mapping to known psoriasis loci that are well-appreciated as components of NF-B signalling, our results further implicate this pathway in the pathophysiology of psoriasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other novel loci containing genes involved in the enriched functions identified by MEAGA include KLRK1 (12p13.2) (regulation of leukocyte mediated cytotoxicity) and PTEN (10q23.31) (regulation of response to external stimulus).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next asked whether the observed association signals are enriched among gene regulatory regions that have been mapped to different immune cell subsets in publicly-available databases36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results (Fig 3b;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Rather than relying on following up promising signals, here we show that the utilization of newer, less costly GWAS assays to interrogate the entire genome in follow-up samples is a cost-effective approach capable of revealing subtle genetic signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we have implemented an approach used in epidemiology studies to adjust a misclassified binary outcome24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, this is the first large genetic association study to compare outcomes using specialist-diagnosed versus self-reported affectation and to adjust for response misclassification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, we observed that disease allele frequencies and ORs were underestimated in an independent study that defined psoriasis status based on the electronic health records44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be because psoriatic lesions appear similar to other common skin diseases, including atopic eczema and seborrhoeic dermatitis, leading to misdiagnosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results illustrate the importance of correcting misclassification of disease outcome as large-scale data-mining of phenotypes becomes more common.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The disease-associated loci define a GRS that is capable of discriminating case-control status in our sample (AUC=0.76).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results have been reported in the Chinese population45 as well as a smaller European-origin sample46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In concordance with previous studies45,46, we found that the GRS is also strongly inversely correlated with age-at-onset of psoriasis, with the MHC comprising much of this effect (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strong association between HLA-Cw6 and streptococcal infection in juvenile-onset psoriasis may explain part of this association47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, correlations between genetic risk allele load and age-at-onset are not universal in complex genetic disorders 48,49, and the relationship between GRS and age-at-onset needs to be explored on a disease-by-disease basis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While we did not find any disease-associated variants that alter protein structure in new loci, we demonstrated significant enrichment for genes involved in immune system function among the known and novel genetic signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found significant enrichment of psoriasis genetic signals in active chromatin domains in Th1 and Th17 cells (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the individual candidates (Supplementary Note), FASLG encoding Fas ligand, IKBKE encoding IKK-, CHUK encoding IKK-, IL31 encoding the cytokine IL-31, KLRK1 encoding NKG2D, a killer cell lectin-like receptor and PTPN2 encoding T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase, all play prominent roles in T-cell activation, signalling and/or effector function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By guiding further functional investigation into the roles of these variants in the regulation of their target genes, as well as further functional investigation of these targets, these results will serve as an important framework guiding future research into the pathogenesis and treatment of psoriasis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Data sets', 'The collection of samples for the five GWAS (PsA, CASP, Kiel, Genizon and WTCCC2) and the Immunochip dataset were described previously5,6,7,9,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new Exomechip cohort, consisting of 6,463 genetically independent psoriasis cases and 6,096 unrelated controls of European Caucasian descent collected in North America and Sweden, was genotyped using the Affymetrix Axiom Biobank Plus Genotyping Array at the Affymetrix facility (Santa Clara, CA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All human subjects provided written informed consent and were enrolled according to the protocols approved by the institutional review board for human subject research of each institution, in adherence with the Declaration of Helsinki principles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The basic array contains 246,000 genome-wide markers, 265,000 exome coding SNPs and indels, and 95,000 eQTL, pharmacogenomic and novel loss-of-function variants, which was supplemented by addition of 77,000 custom markers consisting of (1) 50,000 novel rare variants identified in targeted sequencing of known psoriasis loci, (2) 15,000 additional evenly distributed markers to enhance GWAS coverage, (3) 10,000 1,000 Genome variants in ENCODE-predicted regulatory regions for normal human epidermal keratinocyte (NHK) cell lines, (4) 1,000 markers associated with other autoimmune diseases and (5) 1,000 markers representing skin eQTLs identified from our analyses of the psoriatic skin transcriptome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Psoriasis cases in these cohorts were dermatologist-diagnosed, and all studies were approved by the ethical committees of their respective institutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we did not segregate psoriasis subphenotypes (that is, psoriatic arthritis, cutaneous-only psoriasis18); therefore our cohorts include psoriasis cases that might have developed psoriatic arthritis, and this is especially true for the PsA GWAS, in which all included cases have psoriatic arthritis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Quality control', 'For each dataset, we removed samples with high missingness ( greater than 2%) or a high inbreeding coefficient (|F| greater than 0.03), and we also removed markers with low call rate ( less_than 95%), with more than two alleles, or that failed Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (p less_than 1 × 10-6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified duplicated or highly related pairs (that is, first and second degree relatives) of individuals among our data sets using independent markers outside of the known psoriasis susceptibility loci (null markers)9; this includes samples that were genotyped in multiple cohorts (for example, the same sample might be genotyped in both the CASP GWAS or Exomechip cohorts).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When related or identical pairs were identified in different data sets, we preferentially kept the sample from the genotyping platform with the higher number of markers with genome-wide coverage (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the independent (that is, ld-r2 less_than 0.2) markers that are outside the known psoriasis loci to compute the principal components for each data set; and for the Immunochip data set, since the platform is enriched with markers from the immune-associated regions, we first conducted a meta-analysis using the CASP, Kiel, and WTCCC2 cohorts and identified independent markers which have meta-analysis P values  greater than 0.5 as null markers to compute the principal components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then used principal components to remove the population outliers to ensure all analysed individuals were of European ancestry9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', '23andMe cohort', 'The 23andMe cohort was drawn from the customer base of 23andMe, Inc., a personal genetics company.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples from this cohort were genotyped on one of four platforms: the V1 and V2 platforms were variants of the Illumina HumanHap550 BeadChip with additional custom content; the V3 platform is a variant of the Illumina OmniExpress+ BeadChip, with custom content; the V4 platform is a fully custom design, including lower redundancy subsets of V2 and V3 SNPs with coverage of low allele frequency coding variants, as well as 570,000 additional SNPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Research participants included in the cohort provided informed consent and answered surveys online according to the 23andMe human subject protocol, which was reviewed and approved by Ethical & Independent Review Services, a private institutional review board.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The psoriasis phenotype combines self-reported psoriasis diagnoses from several sources available on the 23andMe website: (i) Medical History Survey; (ii) Roots into the future intake form; (iii) research snippet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are three choices (yes, no, not sure) for each psoriasis-related question from each source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We merged the yes/no responses from these questions, with inconsistent responses scored as missing: cases have at least one positive response and no negative responses, and controls have at least one negative response and no positive responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also derived responses from two additional questions derived from the IBD Community Survey and Health Intake Form, regarding whether the individual has been diagnosed with psoriasis to define cases (when any response is a yes) and controls (when it is not a case and at least one response is control).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Imputation and association', 'We performed haplotype phasing21 and imputation22 for each dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For imputation, we used haplotypes from all populations in the 1,000 Genomes Project phase 1 (release 3) as a reference panel23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then analysed markers with imputation quality greater than 0.7 in at least half (that is, 4) of the data sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each data set, we performed logistic regression using top principal components and data collection center indicator variables as covariates to correct for population stratification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We computed the inflation factor () using the null markers for the genomic control analysis (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Proportion of true positives among 23andMe psoriasis cases', 'For each of the previously identified signals from the known psoriasis loci, we compared the risk allele frequencies in cases and controls estimated from our dermatologist diagnosed-based data9 with those estimated by the 23andMe cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RAFs in cases from the dermatologist-diagnosed cohorts are systematically higher than those in the 23andMe cohort (34 out of 36 loci listed in Tsoi et al.9 manifested RAFcase_Tsoi(2012) higher than those estimated in RAFcase_23andMe);
