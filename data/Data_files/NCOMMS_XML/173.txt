Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Disrupted organ growth leads to disease development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypertrophy underlies postnatal heart growth and is triggered after stress, but the molecular mechanisms involved in these processes are largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that cardiac activation of p38 and p38 increases during postnatal development and by hypertrophy-inducing stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  p38/ promote cardiac hypertrophy by phosphorylating the mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibitor DEPTOR, which leads to its degradation and mTOR activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hearts from mice lacking one or both kinases are below normal size, have high levels of DEPTOR, low activity of the mTOR pathway and reduced protein synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phenotype of p38// mice is reverted by overactivation of mTOR with amino acids, shRNA-mediated knockdown of Deptor, or cardiomyocyte overexpression of active p38 and p38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in WT mice, heart weight is reduced by cardiac overexpression of DEPTOR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate that p38/ control heart growth by modulating mTOR pathway through DEPTOR phosphorylation and subsequent degradation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cardiac growth is tightly regulated to ensure that the heart reaches its appropriate size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cardiomyocytes rapidly proliferate during fetal life, but soon after birth differentiated cardiomyocytes enter a postmitotic state and the ability to proliferate is lost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Postnatal cardiac growth is therefore mainly achieved through increases in cell size (physiological hypertrophy) associated with increased protein synthesis1 together with the expansion of non-myocyte populations2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypertrophic growth is also the adaptive response of cardiomyocytes to stress stimuli, including cardiac pressure or volume overload, cytoskeletal abnormalities and intrinsic contractility defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although cardiomyocyte hypertrophy initially enhances cardiac output in stress situations, prolonged hypertrophy, known as pathological hypertrophy, is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular diseases such as diastolic and systolic heart failure and arrhythmia3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding the mechanism of cardiac growth thus has important clinical implications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The key unanswered questions are how cells perceive extracellular hypertrophic stimuli and convert them into intracellular signals, and how these signals lead to cardiac hypertrophy4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Several studies identified mammalian TOR (mTOR) as a key regulator of cardiac hypertrophy; for example, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin prevents heart-weight gain in an overload model of hypertrophy5 and blocks cardiomyocyte size increases induced by AngII6 and phenylephrine7, likely by inhibiting protein synthesis7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mTOR is a conserved serine/threonine kinase with a key regulatory function in cardiovascular physiology and pathology8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mTOR integrates signals from growth factors, nutrients and stresses to regulate multiple processes, including translation, cell cycle progression, autophagy and cell survival9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mTOR function is regulated by the formation of two multi-protein complexes: mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mTORC1 is composed of the mTOR catalytic subunit and five associated proteins: Raptor, PRAS40, mLST8/GL, DEPTOR and Tti1/Tel2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mTORC2, the mTOR catalytic subunit is associated with six proteins: mLST8/GL, DEPTOR, Tti1/Tel2 (in common with mTORC1) and Rictor, mSin1 and Protor10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activities of the mTORC1 and mTORC2 pathways are regulated by the common inhibitory component DEPTOR11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Stress-inducing stimuli in the heart activate several mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), which are known to participate in hypertrophy, remodelling, contractility and heart failure12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MAPKs are key regulators of cell stress responses, including cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MAPK family consists of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK), the c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinases (JNK) and the p38 MAP kinases16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several studies have proposed that ERK cascade is involved in the hypertrophic response17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The p38 MAPKs are activated in response to proinflammatory cytokines, hormones and stress signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four p38 MAPK isoforms have been identified, and can be grouped into two subsets based on sequence homology, substrate specificity and sensitivity to chemical inhibitors: p38 and p38, and p38 and p38 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MKK3 and MKK6, the kinases acting upstream of p38 MAPKs, appear to play a role in cardiac hypertrophy18, and susceptibility to cardiac hypertrophy is promoted by cardiac-specific overexpression of dominant-negative p38 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, findings in mice lacking p38 in cardiomyocytes indicate that this effect is p38 independent20, whereas heart development requires endogenous p38 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the p38 isoform is highly abundant in the heart22 and p38 is also expressed in cardiomyocytes23, little is known about the role of these isoforms in cardiac hypertrophy24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we report that p38 and the closely related kinase p38 are activated by pathological and physiological hypertrophic stimuli and are required for cardiac physiological and pathological hypertrophy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using p38/ null mice, we show that p38 and p38 interact with and phosphorylate the inhibitory mTOR complex component DEPTOR, inducing its degradation and thus promoting cell growth.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'p38 and p38 modulate postnatal cardiac hypertrophic growth', 'Stress stimuli in the heart activate several MAPKs, which have been implicated in mechanisms of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and survival13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  p38 is abundant in heart tissue, and the closely related isoform p38 is also well expressed23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stress-induced hypertrophy appears to modulate the levels of both kinases23, but their function and activation in the heart remain unsolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of wild-type (WT) mice showed that expression of both kinases increases during postnatal growth and that they become activated, p38 activity peaking on postnatal week 2 coinciding with the transition to hypertrophic growth25, and p38 activity peaking on postnatal week 6 (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the role of p38 and p38 in cardiac growth, we used knockout mice lacking p38, p38 or both kinases, confirming the deletion of these kinases in the heart by western blot (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ventricular mass between postnatal weeks 4 and 11 was monitored relative to tibia length in WT mice and mice lacking one or both of the kinases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ventricular mass was notably lower in p38/, p38/ and p38// mice (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lower heart mass in the knockout animals correlated with the presence of cardiomyocytes of below-normal size, determined from cell cross-sectional area on histological sections, suggesting a defect in postnatal hypertrophic growth (Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar analysis conducted at postnatal day 1 showed no differences between genotypes in heart or body size (Supplementary Fig 1b,c), indicating that p38/ kinases modulate hypertrophic heart growth in the postnatal period, and not in the fetus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: p38 and p38 modulate postnatal cardiac hypertrophic growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Immunoblot analysis of p38 and p38 activation and expression in heart extracts prepared from wild-type (WT) mice at different ages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b,c) WT, p38/, p38/ and p38// mice were killed at 4, 6, 9 and 11 weeks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Heart-weight-to-tibia-length ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area quantified in wheatgerm agglutinin (WGA)-stained hearts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are means±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (n=513).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  **P less_than 0.01;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this study, we provide evidence that two stress kinases, p38 and p38, promote the activity of mTOR, a critical sensor of metabolic and nutrient stresses, by targeting the mTOR inhibitory partner DEPTOR for proteasome degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finding that DEPTOR is a physiological p38/ substrate is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of DEPTOR interaction with a non-mTOR complex protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, our results show that p38 or p38 are both able to phosphorylate DEPTOR and induce its subsequent proteasomal degradation, contrary to the proposal that DEPTOR phosphorylation was only mTOR dependent11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The p38/-mTOR signalling pathway controls protein synthesis and cell growth, and molecular and functional evidence indicates that this pathway plays an important physiological role in the regulation of ventricular cardiac hypertrophy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our conclusion is supported by several lines of evidence: (1) mTOR activity is below-normal in hearts and cells from mice deficient in p38 and p38; (2) low mTOR activation in cells lacking p38 and p38 leads to reduced cell size and protein synthesis; (3) p38 and p38 co-immunoprecipitate with mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes; (4) p38 and p38 bind to DEPTOR; (5) DEPTOR is phosphorylated by p38 and p38; (6) DEPTOR protein half-life is shortened by active p38 and p38 mutants, but extended by knockout of p38 and p38; (7) DEPTOR levels are elevated in hearts lacking p38 or p38/; (8) reduction of DEPTOR levels correlates with p38 and p38 activation; (9) silencing of DEPTOR in cells lacking p38 and p38 increases their protein content and size; (10) rapamycin treatment in the postnatal period equalizes heart size in WT and KO animals; (11) mTOR activation by aa injection into p38// mice results in heart growth; (12) cardiac-specific overexpression of active p38/ reduces DEPTOR levels, increasing mTOR activity and cardiomyocyte growth; (13) cardiac overexpression of DEPTOR phenocopies the p38// phenotype; (14) cardiac-specific silencing DEPTOR in p38// mice increases their heart size and cardiomyocyte growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite the physiological and pathological importance of cell-size regulation, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains very limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the heart, the regulation of cell size is a key process that modulates the organs response to external stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identifying molecular mechanisms through which hypertrophy can be suppressed without provoking circulatory insufficiency is a major challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data strongly indicate that lack of p38 and p38 reduces the capacity for cardiomyocyte growth without having functional implications: cardiac function remained normal in these mice even in the presence of AngII-induced hypertrophy, and they showed no increase in fibrosis with respect to WT mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Surprisingly, although mTOR is necessary for embryonic cardiovascular development and for the postnatal maintenance of cardiac function8, inhibition of mTOR as a result of the lack of p38 and p38 does not have a deleterious effect on heart physiology in basal condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is likely because p38 and p38 act through the mTOR modulator DEPTOR, so that the lack of p38 and p38 results only in partial inhibition of mTOR activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is of great interest because other models in which the heart is incapable of growing display signs of cardiac pathology such as cardiac dilation or heart failure36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that the modulation of these kinases results in reduced heart hypertrophy without obvious secondary effects makes p38 and p38 potential targets for therapeutic intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it would be interesting to further study whether modulation of these kinases could have functional implication after a stronger challenge such as myocardial infarction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our findings provide definition of the previously uncharacterized role of p38 and p38 in cardiac hypertrophy38, demonstrating that p38 and p38 are activated during postnatal growth and by stress stimuli in the heart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This activation correlates with DEPTOR phosphorylation, ubiquitination and degradation, modulating cardiac growth in tissue culture and animal models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice deficient in these kinases presented reduced DEPTOR phosphorylation and degradation, correlating with impaired postnatal and pathologically induced cardiac hypertrophy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The finding that lack of just one of these kinases produces the defect is quite surprising because each normally compensates the loss of the other in other biological processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The non-redundancy of these isoforms in the induction of cardiac hypertrophy is likely explained by their interaction in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both kinases cooperate in the binding to the mTOR complex and in the modulation of its activity through the phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of DEPTOR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although p38 interacts with DEPTOR through the PDZ domain, the exact interaction between DEPTOR and p38 remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, our experiments with single-point mutants indicated that both kinases are needed to induce DEPTOR degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lack of phosphorylation on S293 or T321, residues respectively phosphorylated by p38 and p38, are sufficient to abolish DEPTOR degradation, indicating a requirement for cooperation between both kinases to induce DEPTOR degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, mTOR induces DEPTOR phosphorylation on other residues, which are also necessary for DEPTOR ubiquitination and degradation11,32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional studies will be needed to clarify how these kinases cooperate to phosphorylate DEPTOR and to determine whether p38  and  act as a heterodimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover it would be interesting to study whether this mechanism acts in other tissues and in response to other stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cell autonomous control of cell hypertrophy by p38 and p38 was validated by several independent approaches, including the use of mice lacking p38 in myocytes, and immortalized fibroblasts from p38// mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, hearts from p38/ null animals are able to grow after AAV-mediated cardiomyocyte overexpression of p38 and p38, and AAV-mediated DEPTOR overexpression in WT hearts reduces cardiomyocyte size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, reduction of DEPTOR levels in cardiomyocytes from p38/ null animals increased heart growth to the level seen in WT mice, indicating that the phenotype found in p38/ null animals is mediated by DEPTOR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results identify p38 and p38 signalling as a key regulator of mTOR activity, promoting protein synthesis and cell hypertrophy by phosphorylating the mTOR inhibitor DEPTOR and inducing its ubiquitination and degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  p38/ signalling through mTOR complexes is an important mediator of cardiac hypertrophy, and this pathway may also be important in other physiological processes mediated by mTOR, such as cancer and autophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results reveal a new avenue in the control of
