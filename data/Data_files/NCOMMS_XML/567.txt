Hazardous thunderstorm intensification over Lake Victoria  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Weather extremes have harmful impacts on communities around Lake Victoria, where thousands of fishermen die every year because of intense night-time thunderstorms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet how these thunderstorms will evolve in a future warmer climate is still unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that Lake Victoria is projected to be a hotspot of future extreme precipitation intensification by using new satellite-based observations, a high-resolution climate projection for the African Great Lakes and coarser-scale ensemble projections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Land precipitation on the previous day exerts a control on night-time occurrence of extremes on the lake by enhancing atmospheric convergence (74%) and moisture availability (26%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The future increase in extremes over Lake Victoria is about twice as large relative to surrounding land under a high-emission scenario, as only over-lake moisture advection is high enough to sustain ClausiusClapeyron scaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results highlight a major hazard associated with climate change over East Africa and underline the need for high-resolution projections to assess local climate change.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Severe thunderstorms and associated high waves represent a constant threat to the 200,000 fishermen operating on Lake Victoria1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The International Red Cross assumes that 3,0005,000 fishermen die every year on the lake2, by which it substantially contributes to the global death toll from natural disasters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each perished fisherman leaves on average eight relatives without an income, underlining the vulnerability of East African fishing communities to these natural hazards1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the long-known bad reputation of Lake Victoria4, the understanding of the drivers of these extreme thunderstorms remains limited5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, anthropogenic climate change may significantly affect these hazardous weather systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In many parts of the world, future climate simulations project an intensification of precipitation extremes and associated weather conditions6,7,8,9,10,11, but the potential future changes in extremes over Lake Victoria are still unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we use a unique combination of state-of-the-art satellite remote sensing, a high-resolution regional climate model and coarser-scale ensemble simulations to project changes in extreme precipitation over Lake Victoria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We project a strong and robust increase in precipitation extremes over Lake Victoria and show that this increase is about double over the lake compared with surrounding land.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the occurrence of extreme precipitation in the present-day climate is mostly controlled by atmospheric dynamics, its future intensification can be entirely attributed to the advection of more humid air over the lake.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Satellite data analysis', 'Satellite observations enable the recognition of severe weather by detecting overshooting tops (OTs), that is, dome-like protrusions atop a cumulonimbus anvil induced by intense updrafts12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OTs mark the presence of vigorous thunderstorms and are tightly linked to severe weather reports12,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By applying an OT detection algorithm to Meteosat Second Generation observations (Methods), we establish a new severe thunderstorm climatology for East Africa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results reveal a marked imprint of Lake Victoria on the diurnal thunderstorm cycle and confirm its status as one of the most convectively active regions on Earth5,13,16,17,18 (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From 2005 to 2013, 73% of all 1,400,000 OT pixels detected over the lake occurred at night (22:00 to 9:00 UTC), in contrast to the surrounding land where afternoon storms dominate (72% of all 4,200,000 OT pixels during 9:00 to 16:00 UTC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Local evaporation and mesoscale circulation have been identified as key drivers of the present-day diurnal cycle of precipitation over Lake Victoria5,17,18,19,20,21, but so far it is not known how mean and extreme precipitation over this lake respond to a temperature increase induced by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this question, we performed a high resolution (7 km grid spacing), coupled lakelandatmosphere climate projection for the African Great Lakes region with the regional climate model COSMO-CLM2, and analysed coarser-scale ensemble projections from the Coordinated Regional climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) for the end of the century under a high-emission scenario (RCP8.5; Methods, Supplementary Fig 1 and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Lake imprint on severe thunderstorm occurrence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) Satellite-based overshooting tops (OT) detections during 20052013 over the Lake Victoria region (red square in the inset panel), from 9:00 to 15:00 UTC and from 00:00 to 9:00 UTC, respectively, as derived from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI; Methods).Full size image', 'Extreme precipitation projections', 'The projections show a contrasting change of mean and extreme precipitation over Lake Victoria (Fig 2; Supplementary Fig 2), with mean precipitation decreasing while the intensity of extreme precipitation increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, by the end of the century the increase in extremes (precipitation above the 99th percentile) is 2.4±0.1 times higher over the lake than over its surrounding land in the high-resolution projection (1.8±1.0 times in the CORDEX ensemble).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Today convection initiates in the eastern part of the lake and intensifies while being advected westwards along the trade winds4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the future, storms are projected to release extreme precipitation more in the eastern part of the lake, leading to an eastward shift of intense precipitation (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Projected end-of-century changes in extreme precipitation over Lake Victoria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Night-time 99th percentile precipitation (P99%,night, 00:00 to 9:00 UTC) and (b) its projected future change from the high-resolution COSMO-CLM2 model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c,d) 24 h Lake (blue bars) and surrounding land (red bars) binned precipitation change (P bin) from COSMO-CLM2 and the ensemble mean of nine CORDEX-Africa members, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The red rectangle in Supplementary Fig 1 includes the land pixels considered as surrounding land.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All changes are between time periods 19812010 and 20712100 under RCP8.5.Full size image', 'In contrast to the increase in extremes, the annual mean precipitation projected by the high-resolution model declines over the lake by 6% (Supplementary Fig 2 and Supplementary Note 1)22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is also evident from changes in daily binned precipitation over the lake, which show an overall future drying except for precipitation above the 90th percentile (Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we correct for this average drying (Methods), the effect of Lake Victoria on future extremes is even more pronounced, with the increase being 3.2±0.3 times larger over Lake Victoria compared with surrounding land in COSMO-CLM2 and even 4.2±1.6 times larger in the CORDEX ensemble.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In other words, very intense storms are projected to become more frequent in the future over Lake Victoria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, by the end of the century a 1-in-15-year precipitation event over Lake Victoria becomes a 1-in-1.5-year event in the high-resolution projection (1-in-0.8-year event in the CORDEX ensemble).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases this exceeds the projected increase in storm frequency over land (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Assessing uncertainty', 'Based on a single high-resolution projection (7 km), we cannot assess modelling uncertainties or compare emission scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since this type of simulations are computationally very expensive, this is a recurrent limitation of studies investigating climate change at high resolution23,24,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By providing ensemble projections at coarser resolution (50 km), the CORDEX initiative enables uncertainty assessments within the constraints of the quality of both the downscaling tool and the lateral boundary conditions27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although some differences occur between the high- and coarse-resolution projections, it is clear that the lake effect on the future precipitation distribution is robust (Fig 2c,d; Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is further confirmed by the fact that the projected response in the coarse-resolution ensemble (Fig 2d) is to a large extent independent of the driving global model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, every CORDEX simulation projects a reduction in over-lake precipitation for all bins below the 90th percentile and an amplification of the increase in the highest bins, thereby corroborating the high-resolution model (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of the coarse-resolution RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 ensembles moreover demonstrates that the choice of the emission scenario does not influence Lake Victorias amplifying role on extreme precipitation changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'At the same time COSMO-CLM2 clearly outperforms all CORDEX models as well as a state-of-the-art reanalysis in terms of precipitation representation, underlining the benefits of enhanced resolution and use of a lake model for climate simulations over the region (Supplementary Figs 46 and Supplementary Note 2)5,28,29,30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decreasing the horizontal grid spacing to convection-permitting scales (below 4 km) would most likely improve the skill of our climate simulations even more, since the convection parameterization employed in the high-resolution model still entails a number of limitations25,26,32,33,34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall these findings highlight the need for running coordinated high-resolution projections to quantify local climate change in regions with a particular dynamical regime23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Driving mechanisms', 'To better understand the processes controlling present-day extreme precipitation occurrence and its future change, we analysed observations and a multi-year reanalysis downscaling with COSMO-CLM2 (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Satellite observations of OTs and precipitation reveal that increased night-time thunderstorm activity and rainfall amounts over Lake Victoria are preceded by intense storms and rainfall over land the prior afternoon (Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large-scale moisture availability contributes to this positive relationship, but alone it cannot explain the observed correlation (Supplementary Note 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Land storms therefore act as a positive feedback for the intensity of night-time lake storms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These severe land storms could impact storm intensity over the lake in two ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, they could enhance moisture convergence by increasing the near-surface-specific humidity (thermodynamic control; Fig 3c, Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, they could modify the lake/land breeze system5 by cooling the land surface (dynamic control).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In that case the cold pools of the afternoon storms act to reduce gradients in near-surface air temperature between lake and land (Fig 3d), thereby weakening the lake breeze and possibly also moisture transport away from the lake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the cold anomaly persists into the night, this could strengthen the land breeze and by that possibly stimulate moisture convergence and column instability36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, lake evaporation does not control the occurrence of extremes over Lake Victoria, despite its key role in the regional hydrological cycle5,17,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Afternoon controls on night-time extreme precipitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Afternoon SEVIRI overshooting tops (OT) pixel detections over land surrounding Lake Victoria versus night-time OT pixels over the lake (20052013;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our results emphasize a major hazard associated with climate change over East Africa with potential severe human impacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lake Victoria directly sustains the livelihood of 30 million people living at its coasts and its fishing industry is a leading natural resource for East African communities1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given the projected increase in extreme over-lake thunderstorms, the current vulnerability of local fishing communities2,3 and their growing exposure driven by rapid urbanization along the lakefront37, this lake is likely to remain the most dangerous stretch of water in the world.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, our findings mark an opportunity for developing a satellite-based early warning system for hazardous thunderstorms over Lake Victoria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Warning systems deriving predictions from the strong afternoon controls on night-time thunderstorms (Fig 3) have the potential to substantially reduce the vulnerability of local fishing communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would complement ongoing efforts, in particular by the UK Met Office18, to provide storm warnings for the region based on numerical weather prediction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This study finally underscores the need for high-resolution projections to assess local climate change, especially in regions with a particular dynamical regime where extreme precipitation responses to anthropogenic climate change may be very different from large-scale projections11,38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-resolution projections accounting for lakeatmosphere interactions are still very rare and may face challenges27,40, but adopting this approach is critical to assess future climate impacts in regions where lakes are abundant.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Overshooting top detections', 'We applied an overshooting top detection algorithm (OTDA)12,14 to the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) infrared satellite data for equatorial East Africa (23° E to 43° E; 11° S to 7° N).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SEVIRI instrument provides images at 15-min temporal and 4-km spatial resolution over the Lake Victoria region41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OTDA builds on the premise that OTs are composed of a small region of very cold infrared brightness temperatures surrounded by a warmer cirrus anvil cloud12,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As OTs penetrate through the level of neutral buoyancy (LNB), they continue to cool at a rate of 79 K km1 making them much colder than the anvil cloud which typically resides between the LNB and the tropopause42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OTDA first identifies candidate OT regions by selecting SEVIRI pixels with an infrared brightness temperatures 217.5 K and near to or colder than the tropopause temperature defined by the Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently the cirrus anvil cloud surrounding a candidate OT region is sampled, and if the candidate is substantially (6 K) colder than the anvil it is classified as an OT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detection thresholds for the OTDA were based on the analysis of a large sample of OT-producing storms depicted within 1-km spatial resolution Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery in combination with OT product user feedback from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) operational weather forecasting community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OTDA finally corrects for parallax errors when locating OT-producing storms, thereby assuming a cloud top height of 16 km.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this approach, more than 50 million OT pixels were detected from 2005 to 2013 over equatorial East Africa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single OT is on average composed of 11 OT pixels and typically does not exceed 15 km in diameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Climate simulations', 'All simulations were performed
