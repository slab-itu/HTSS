Surface single-molecule dynamics controlled by entropy at low temperatures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Configuration transitions of individual molecules and atoms on surfaces are traditionally described using an Arrhenius equation with energy barrier and pre-exponential factor (attempt rate) parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Characteristic parameters can vary even for identical systems, and pre-exponential factors sometimes differ by orders of magnitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) to measure an individual dibutyl sulfide molecule on Au(111), we show that the differences arise when the relative position of tip apex and molecule changes by a fraction of the molecule size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altering the tip position on that scale modifies the transitions barrier and attempt rate in a highly correlated fashion, which results in a single-molecular enthalpy-entropy compensation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, appropriately positioning the STM tip allows selecting the operating point on the compensation line and modifying the transition rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results highlight the need to consider entropy in transition rates of single molecules, even at low temperatures.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Observing transitions of molecules between metastable states provides insight into the dynamics underpinning many catalytic1,2 and biological processes3,4,5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can restrict the phase space of the molecules by adsorbing them on a surface such that their transition kinetics becomes accessible to STM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus for instance, it is possible to calculate hopping rates from series of images tracking the surface motion of Al atoms on Al(111)9, tetrapyridylporphyrin on Cu(111)10, tetraphenylporphyrin monomers and dimers on Cu(111)11 and cobalt(II) octaethylporphyrin on graphite12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Certain adsorbed molecules can also pivot around their bond to the substrate, and distinct rotational states can be imaged in sequence by STM, as shown for O2 on Pt(111)13, Cu phthalocyanine on C60 (refs 14, 15) and zinc tetra-(3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)porphyrin on Ag(100)16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these types of transitions the rate of occurrence can also be obtained by counting individual transitions from telegraph noise in the current signal13,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such rate data is the basis for studying the temperature dependent physics of the transition, most commonly described in terms of an Arrhenius equation19 when the process is thermally activated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context one can determine energy barriers to the transitions (E) and transition attempt rates (A)19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The latter parameter is formally a constant, yet in various instances the measured values of A depart from expected behaviour in two ways: first, A turns out to be consistently different from molecular vibration frequencies in realistic adsorption surface potentials20,21,22; Second, the values for the same system and experiment conditions can vary by orders of magnitude, notably in dibutyl sulfide (DBS) on Au(111)21,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work we look closer at the reasons for this puzzle, using an STM tip to modify and characterize transitions rates of a single-molecule model system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Over the area where the transitions are detected by the STM, we find from comparing tip position-dependent transition rate data at different temperatures that between equilibrium and transition states the enthalpy- and entropy-differences are not uniform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their values display a correlated structure as function of tip position that does not reproduce the symmetry of the substrate entirely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, enthalpy and entropy are compensated for the molecule, implying an isokinetic temperature of 9.1±0.2 K. In particular the variation of the transition entropy difference with the position of the tip can result in order of magnitude variations of the pre-exponential factor in Arrhenius-law descriptions of the process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work shows that entropic contributions to the dynamics of atoms and molecules during surface transitions and manipulation cannot be disregarded, even at low temperatures, and gives an example of how STM could be used to measure and modify the entropy of atomic or molecular-scale systems and their interactions with tip and substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The STM tip can be used at a level of interaction with the molecule where the molecular transitions are still thermally activated, but the barriers are modified by the tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus different regimes of the thermally activated dynamics of the transitions can be probed by appropriately selecting the tip position, but the compensation itself is independent of the means by which the barrier height is modified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore important that future models for describing the transition dynamics of surface-adsorbed molecules at low temperatures account for the details of the excitation process and their effect on entropy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Several observations are noteworthy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the effective energy barrier height E(x, y) spans an unexpectedly large range from a few meV to about 20 meV (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, as we found with the rate, also the energy barrier depends on tip-position, showing that the overall energy landscape probed by the adsorbed molecule is strongly influenced by the presence of the tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  And third, the attempt rate A(x, y) varies over 10 orders of magnitude over the scanned relative positions, but its map (Fig 3d) exhibits a close resemblance to that of E(x, y) (Fig 3c), suggesting a fundamental underlying connection between the two.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Taking all pairs of ln(A(x, y)) and E(x, y) and plotting them in Fig 3h reveals a clustering of the data blue diamonds on a straight line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hexagons indicate the location on the plot of data from literature for rotation of dibutyl sulfide on Au(111), and the striped markers correspond to the lines presented in Fig 3b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Taking A in Hz we can fit the data in Fig 3h with the line', '', 'where the parameters are the energy EMN=0.78±0.02 meV and ln A00=2.5±0.3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Equation (2) expresses for the single dibutyl sulfide molecule what is known for example, for families of related chemical reactions24 as the Cremer-Constable- or Meyer-Neldel rule (see refs 1, 2 for a review).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can see that the role of the STM tip is to modify the conditions in which the transitions take place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, for each relative tip-molecule position the DBS rotation transition encounters a different energy barrier height (which is connected to the attempt rate).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But the transition itself is not barrier-less and is thermally activated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Replacing A(x, y) in equation (1) by the expression in equation (2) reveals that at T=Tiso=EMN/kB=9.1±0.2 K the rates become position-independent, that is, k(x, y)=ln A00.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been pointed out by Boisvert et al.24 that the MeyerNeldel energy is expected to be of the order of the energy excitations available in the energy reservoir.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The variability of A(x, y) over orders of magnitude becomes explicitly apparent by writing equation (1) in terms the canonical multidimensional transition state theory result25,', '', 'where H(x, y) is the tip-position dependent enthalpy difference between the transition- (metastable) and ground state enthalpy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly S(x, y) is the entropy difference, which can be written in terms of the partition function Z(x, y) (Z0(x, y)):', '', 'In this context the exponential prefactor then takes the form', '', 'which accounts for the weak temperature dependence of A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equation (3) can be shown to be equivalent to a theory of the escape rate of a particle trapped in a one-dimensional potential and coupled bilinearly to a bath of an infinite set of harmonic oscillators25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically we can define an entropy difference between the metastable- and transition state as S(x, y)=kB ln(Z(x, y)/Z0(x, y)), of which the apparent attempt rate A(x, y) depends exponentially.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Thus, using the logarithmic form of equation (3) we can obtain the enthalpy map (Fig 4a) and entropy map (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that S(x, y) varies between 2.2 and 0 meV K1 and has the same pattern as H(x, y), which expresses an enthalpyentropy compensation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet a better point of comparison is the thermodynamic potential obtained by multiplying S(x, y) with a relevant temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this case we chose the isokinetic temperature Tiso:=EMN/kB=9.1±0.2 K.
