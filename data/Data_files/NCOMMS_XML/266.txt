Emerging roles of ARHGAP33 in intracellular trafficking of TrkB and pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Intracellular trafficking of receptor proteins is essential for neurons to detect various extracellular factors during the formation and refinement of neural circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the precise mechanisms underlying the trafficking of neurotrophin receptors to synapses remain elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that a brain-enriched sorting nexin, ARHGAP33, is a new type of regulator for the intracellular trafficking of TrkB, a high-affinity receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ARHGAP33 knockout (KO) mice exhibit reduced expression of synaptic TrkB, impaired spine development and neuropsychiatric disorder-related behavioural abnormalities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These deficits are rescued by specific pharmacological enhancement of TrkB signalling in ARHGAP33 KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistically, ARHGAP33 interacts with SORT1 to cooperatively regulate TrkB trafficking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human ARHGAP33 is associated with brain phenotypes and reduced SORT1 expression is found in patients with schizophrenia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that ARHGAP33/SORT1-mediated TrkB trafficking is essential for synapse development and that the dysfunction of this mechanism may be a new molecular pathology of neuropsychiatric disorders.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Intracellular protein trafficking is essential for cellular functions particularly in highly polarized cells such as neurons1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Membrane proteins are generally delivered in a polarized manner from the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus and the trans-Golgi network to synaptic sites2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple classes of proteins are responsible for ensuring the specificity of sorting and trafficking3, including proteins of the sorting nexin (SNX) family, a large group of proteins that contain a conserved phox homology (PX) domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through a conserved PX domain-mediated interaction with phosphoinositides, SNX proteins are often localized to the Golgi apparatus and endosomes, where they regulate the exiting and sorting of membrane proteins4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ARHGAP33 (also known as SNX26, TCGAP or NOMA-GAP; hereafter ARHGAP33)5,6,7,8,9 and ARHGAP32 (also known as p250GAP and PX-RICS; hereafter ARHGAP32)10,11,12 represent a unique subfamily of SNX proteins that have a RhoGTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) domain (for a review, see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These SNX proteins are highly enriched in the brain, but it remains unclear whether and how they are involved in protein sorting and trafficking in neurons and contribute to higher brain functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'TrkB is a high-affinity receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) that plays important roles in the neuronal development, establishment and maintenance of synapses, regulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity, and memory formation14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TrkB function is regulated by multiple steps, including transcriptional, translational and post-translational mechanisms14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among them, a critical step is the proper trafficking of TrkB from the soma to the distal compartments of axons and dendrites14,15, but the mechanisms of TrkB trafficking remain unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the present study, we show that ARHGAP33 regulates the trafficking of TrkB to synaptic sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the role of TrkB in synapse maintenance and function14,15,16, ARHGAP33 KO mice have impaired spine morphogenesis and exhibit behavioural deficits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistically, ARHGAP33 functions cooperatively with sortilin (SORT1), a modulator of intracellular protein trafficking17, to regulate TrkB trafficking to synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, correlated decreases in ARHGAP33 and SORT1 expression levels are observed in the peripheral lymphocytes of schizophrenia patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, human ARHGAP33 is associated with brain phenotypes of patients with schizophrenia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We argue that ARHGAP33/SORT1-mediated TrkB trafficking is crucial for synapse development and that its disruption may lead to pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Decreased surface expression of TrkB in ARHGAP33 KO mice', 'ARHGAP33 is a unique, multidomain protein containing the RhoGAP, SH3 and PX domains (Fig 1a) and is highly expressed in the brain, especially in the cortex, hippocampus, caudate-putamen and olfactory bulb (Supplementary Fig 1)7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine ARHGAP33 functions in vivo, we generated ARHGAP33 KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The KO mice were born according to Mendelian genetics, exhibited normal growth and did not show severe abnormalities (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gross anatomy and cytoarchitecture of the ARHGAP33 KO brains were apparently normal (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The roles of ARHGAP33 in the adult brain have not been investigated, but given that ARHGAP33 is an SNX protein, ARHGAP33 may regulate the trafficking of surface proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine this possibility, we performed a cell-surface biotinylation assay in dissociated hippocampal neurons from ARHGAP33 KO mice and analysed the cell-surface expression levels of various neural receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the expression level of cell-surface-localized TrkB, but not that of total TrkB, was significantly decreased in neurons from ARHGAP33 KO mice compared with those from wild-type (WT) mice (P=7.8 × 104; Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the cell-surface expression level of another Trk family member, TrkC, was unchanged (P greater than 0.05; Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As another control, we examined GAPDH expression in the cell-surface fraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it was hardly detectable (Fig 1b,c), presumably because of the dominant cytoplasmic localization of GAPDH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since TrkB localizes to the postsynaptic density (PSD) of excitatory synapses that contains receptors and their associated signalling and scaffolding proteins2,18, we then examined TrkB expression in the PSD fraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the expression of TrkB but not PSD-95 in the PSD fraction was also decreased in ARHGAP33 KO mice compared with WT mice (P=7.7 × 104; Fig 1d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed the same analyses for SORT1, a modulator of intracellular protein trafficking17 that regulates the sorting of TrkB at the Golgi apparatus19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although SORT1 was reported to be enriched in the Golgi apparatus17, we detected SORT1 in the cell-surface fraction (Fig 1b,c) and the PSD fraction (Fig 1d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found no significant differences in SORT1 expression in these cell fractions as well as in the total lysate between WT and ARHGAP33 KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Impaired TrkB trafficking to the cell surface at synapses in ARHGAP33 KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Protein structure of a brain-enriched SNX protein, ARHGAP33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ARHGAP33 has an N-terminal PX domain, an SH3 domain and a RhoGAP domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b,c) Decreased cell-surface expression of TrkB in ARHGAP33 KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biotinylated cell-surface proteins (upper) and total lysates (lower) of WT and ARHGAP33 KO neurons (14 DIV) were immunoblotted with anti-TrkB, anti-TrkC, anti-SORT1, anti-GAPDH and anti-ARHGAP33 antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Representative blots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Quantification of surface expression (each, n=8;

average, P=0.017; Fig 2d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that the mEPSC amplitude was slightly decreased in ARHGAP33 KO mice (cumulative, P=8.7 × 107; average, P greater than 0.05; Fig 2d,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant changes in the rise time or decay time constant were observed (P greater than 0.05;

Fig 2i), indicating that the observed decrease in the mEPSC frequency in ARHGAP33 KO mice results from a decrease in the number of functional synapses rather than a decrease in the probability of presynaptic release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the recordings may miss significant amounts of smaller synaptic events, particularly in ARHGAP33 KO neurons, these results demonstrate that ARHGAP33 regulates the number of functional excitatory synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Impaired spine development in ARHGAP33 KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ac) Decreased total and mature spine densities in ARHGAP33 KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examples of Golgi staining of granule cells in the hippocampal dentate gyri from 12-week-old ARHGAP33 KO and WT mice (a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars, 10 m.

Fig 3a), suggesting a spatial working memory deficit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PPI test provides an operational measure of sensorimotor gating, in which a weaker prepulse inhibits the reaction to a subsequent strong startling pulse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before the test, we measured the startle amplitude of control and ARHGAP33 KO mice and determined that the startle responses of the two groups of mice were not significantly different (P greater than 0.05;

corrected P=0.0014), which seems consistent with the decreased surface TrkB expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7,8-DHF administration (12.5 mg kg1) increased the level of phospho-TrkB in ARHGAP33 mice to the same extent as in WT mice (7,8-DHF-stimulated WT mice versus 7,8-DHF-stimulated ARHGAP33 KO mice, P greater than 0.05; Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that the administration of an exogenous agonist can activate TrkB-mediated signalling sufficiently in ARHGAP33 KO mice, although the surface TrkB expression levels were significantly decreased in ARHGAP33 KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the effect of 7,8-DHF on spine morphogenesis, we made a daily intraperitoneal injection of 12.5 mg kg1 of 7,8-DHF into mice for 14 days starting at 12 weeks of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that this chronic 7,8-DHF administration successfully restored the decreased spine density and decreased proportion of mature spines in the dentate gyrus granule cells of ARHGAP33 KO mice to the levels of WT mice (7,8-DHF WT mice versus 7,8-DHF ARHGAP33 KO mice, P greater than 0.05; Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the impaired spine morphogenesis in ARHGAP33 KO mice can be rescued in adulthood at 12 weeks of age, ARHGAP33 may be important for the maintenance rather than the formation of spines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then studied the behaviour of ARHGAP33 KO mice after administration of 7,8-DHF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chronic 7,8-DHF administration rescued the impaired working memory (that is, decreased spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze) of adult ARHGAP33 KO mice, restoring it to the level observed in WT mice (vehicle-WT mice versus vehicle-ARHGAP33 KO mice, P=4.6 × 103;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this study, we discover a unique role for ARHGAP33 as a brain-enriched SNX protein in the intracellular trafficking of TrkB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ARHGAP33 KO mice exhibited impaired spine morphogenesis and neuropsychiatric disorder-related behavioural abnormalities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, human ARHGAP33 was associated with the brain phenotypes exhibited by schizophrenia patients (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a correlated decrease in the ARHGAP33 and SORT1 expression levels was observed in the peripheral lymphocytes of schizophrenia patients (Fig 7d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our results suggest that ARHGAP33-mediated intracellular trafficking of TrkB is crucial for synapse development and that its dysfunction might be related to the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'TrkB is produced in the cell body and transported to synaptic sites via anterograde transport, but the mechanism of that transport is not well understood34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the possible involvement of SNX proteins in TrkB trafficking has not been investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study revealed that an ARHGAP33 deficiency resulted in the accumulation of TrkB in the Golgi apparatus (Fig 5c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because ARHGAP33 is enriched in the Golgi apparatus, this SNX protein is expected to be involved in TrkB trafficking at the Golgi apparatus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, SORT1 and Cdc42, a substrate for ARHGAP33, localize primarily at the Golgi apparatus and are involved in the exit of proteins from the Golgi apparatus19,20,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, ARHGAP33 may act as a scaffolding protein that facilitates the formation of Cdc42/SORT1-containing trafficking complexes to enhance TrkB exit from the Golgi apparatus (Fig 6g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although SORT1 has been shown to facilitate the intracellular sorting of BDNF into the regulated secretion pathway17, BDNF secretion into the medium was normal in the dissociated hippocampal neurons from ARHGAP33 KO mice (WT, 100±10.2%; ARHGAP33 KO, 95±9.5%; P greater than 0.05, MannWhitney U-test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found normal surface expression of another Trk family member, TrkC, in ARHGAP33 KO mice (Fig 1b,c), indicating the selective nature of the ARHGAP33-mediated regulation of protein transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We previously identified another ARHGAP33 family protein, ARHGAP32, that regulates spine morphogenesis11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two proteins share a common multi-domain architecture composed of an amino (N)-terminal PX domain, an SH3 domain and a RhoGAP domain4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ARHGAP32 has been reported to mediate endoplasmic reticulum to-Golgi transport of the N-cadherin/-catenin complex in fibroblasts10, although its functional significance in the brain remains to be clarified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we recently reported that the ARHGAP32 gene is associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia and schizotypal personality traits36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this previous finding, we discovered for the first time that human ARHGAP33 is associated with schizophrenia in the present study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also revealed that ARHGAP33 KO mice exhibited a clear impairment in PPI, working memory and habituation (Fig 3), which are symptoms that are often observed in both mouse models and human schizophrenia patients24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our present results suggest that both ARHGAP32 and ARHGAP33 may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, SORT1, a regulator of SNX-mediated intracellular protein trafficking, may also be involved in schizophrenia (Fig 8)17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have identified a number of susceptibility genes for schizophrenia, many of which regulate synapse formation, function and plasticity18,37,38,39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this respect, ARHGAP33 and ARHGAP32 as well as SORT1 are unique in that they are regulators of intracellular protein trafficking, highlighting a novel role of the SNX-related proteins in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, several important points related to this idea remain unclear, including the biological significance of the identified genetic variation of ARHGAP33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous studies have found that the impairment of multiple processes related to TrkB regulation at the stages of transcription, translation and post-translational regulation are involved in schizophrenia (for review, see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, post-mortem studies have revealed that both mRNA and protein levels of BDNF and TrkB are decreased in multiple cortical areas in schizophrenia patients41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A truncated TrkB lacking its kinase domain, which acts as a dominant-negative receptor for BDNF and prevents TrkB/BDNF signalling, has been reported to be increased in schizophrenia patients42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there has been no report thus far regarding the involvement of TrkB trafficking in schizophrenia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our current results suggest that impaired ARHGAP33-mediated TrkB trafficking is involved in neuropsychiatric disorder-related deficits in mice (Figs 2 and 3), although further studies are needed to establish convincing links among the ARHGAP33-mediated TrkB trafficking, mature brain function and neuropsychiatric disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to ARHGAP32 and ARHGAP33, other SNX proteins are involved in brain functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, SNX27 has been reported to regulate excitatory synaptic functions by regulating glutamate receptor trafficking and is involved in Downs syndrome43,44,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will be interesting to determine whether ARHGAP33, ARHGAP32 or other SNX proteins function differentially or in coordination in neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The odds ratio for the allelic variant of ARHGAP33 is small (1.14; Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be ascribed to polygenic inheritance in schizophrenia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Schizophrenia is likely to be caused by variations in multiple genes, each with a small impact on disease risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The general trend across many studies is that the schizophrenia-associated SNPs have small effects on the disease risk, with odds ratios generally ranging from 1.05 to 1.2 (for review, see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it seems reasonable that the odds ratio for the SNP rs231228 is small (1.14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SNP rs231228 might require additional mutations to result in the disease phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work is needed to determine the precise role of ARHGAP33 in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The most significant SNP of ARHGAP33 is localized in exon 3 and the cortex volume is reduced in the T/T carriers (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exon 3 of ARHGAP33 encodes the N-terminal region just upstream of the PX domain of ARHGAP33 in both human and mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not find any conserved functional domains in the region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the exact molecular mechanism for reduced brain volume in the risk T/T carriers is currently unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decreased expression of ARHGAP33 in patients with schizophrenia (Fig 8) may underlie the reduced brain volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found substantial changes in grey matter volume associated with the ARHGAP33 risk allele while complete absence of ARHGAP33 in the ARHGAP33 KO mice had no apparent effect on the brain structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discrepancy may be caused by methodological differences in the imaging experiments between human subjects and mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generally, technologies for whole-brain imaging in human subjects are much further along than those in rodents: in this study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images of human subjects were analysed using optimized voxel-based morphometry method, followed by segmenting the grey matter from spatially normalized images and smoothing the grey-matter segments for unbiased anatomical comparison across the whole brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With these well-established technologies, we can detect slight abnormalities in brain volume in human subjects (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, it is very difficult to apply the similar technology for the analysis of mouse brain because the brain size is too small for the voxel-based morphometry method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We might be able to find an abnormality in the brain structure of ARHGAP33 KO mice in future, if new technologies for whole-brain imaging are developed in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, abnormalities in mouse brains can be assessed post-mortem by examining the brain sections or by weighing the brain regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although previous studies have reported that ARHGAP/NOMA-GAP-KO mice exhibit decreased cortical thicknesses associated with oversimplification of dendritic arborization8, we did not detect these abnormalities in our KO mice (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discrepancy may be explained by several factors, such as a difference in targeted deletion region, LacZ insertion and strain difference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we report for the first time that ARHGAP33 regulates higher brain functions such as learning and memory and is likely involved in neuropsychiatric disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we identified ARHGAP33 as a new type of regulator for intracellular protein trafficking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the neuropsychiatric disorder-related deficits in ARHGAP33 KO mice could be reversed even in adulthood, ARHGAP33-mediated TrkB trafficking may be a unique target for pharmacological intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The adult ARHGAP33 KO mouse is an animal model of neuropsychiatric disorders in which compounds that target TrkB-mediated signalling can be evaluated.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
