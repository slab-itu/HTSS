Atomic and vibrational origins of mechanical toughness in bioactive cement during setting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Bioactive glass ionomer cements (GICs) have been in widespread use for 40 years in dentistry and medicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these composites fall short of the toughness needed for permanent implants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant impediment to improvement has been the requisite use of conventional destructive mechanical testing, which is necessarily retrospective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show quantitatively, through the novel use of calorimetry, terahertz (THz) spectroscopy and neutron scattering, how GICs developing fracture toughness during setting is related to interfacial THz dynamics, changing atomic cohesion and fluctuating interfacial configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to convention, we find setting is non-monotonic, characterized by abrupt features not previously detected, including a glasspolymer coupling point, an early setting point, where decreasing toughness unexpectedly recovers, followed by stress-induced weakening of interfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, toughness declines asymptotically to long-term fracture test values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect the insight afforded by these in situ non-destructive techniques will assist in raising understanding of the setting mechanisms and associated dynamics of cementitious materials.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Worldwide demand for durable biomaterials emanates from population ageing and from emergent developing countries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Historically, the implantation of foreign materials into the body has been dentistry led.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the optimisation of tooth replacements remains incomplete, problems stemming from conflicts between mechanical toughness, biocompatibility, adhesion and appearance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For commonly used mercurysilver amalgams, this is compounded by toxicity and disposal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The United Nations Environment Programme assesses mercury to be a global threat to human and environmental health, listing amalgams as a source1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With 125 million amalgam restorations carried out annually in Europe, the European Commission advocates atraumatic restorative treatment using mercury-free alternatives2, highlighting glass ionomer cements (GICs) (Fig 1a) as an excellent option.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Developed over 40 years3,4,5,6,7,8, GICs are the product of a basic fluoro-phospho-alumino-silicate glass powder and an aqueous poly(acrylic) acid (PAA) solution (Fig 1b; Methods)also known as glass polyalkenoate cements9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although cost-effective and environmentally friendly2, caries-resistant and bioactively mineralizing dentine10,11, GICs remain too brittle for permanent implants12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With exceptional bonding to the apatite phase of bone, GICs have also been considered for other aspects of surgery14,15,16, but necessarily confined to non-load-bearing applications with moderate durability requirements17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: GICs properties and glass nanoscopic structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) GIC restorative, including occlusal view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) G338 fluoro-alumino-silicate glass powder and dangling aqueous polymer (acrylic acid).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Fracture toughness KC versus strength Y for dental materials compiled as an Ashby plot19: dentin, glass and polymers20,21,45, GICs46,47 and amalgam60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Fracture energy Gc versus Poissons ratio  and the brittleductile transition22,23, expanded for a wide range of materials;

brittle materials such as glasses have KC values less than this.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed the yield strength Y of glassy materials covers many decades21 from 10 GPa (glass fibres) to 1 MPa (pre-damaged glass).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Respective KC and Y values of GICs cluster around those of dentine and amalgam, but clearly have less toughness and strength than either.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For composites in general, and GICs in particular, KC and Y develop during setting, starting out as highly deformable and incompressible slurries that subsequently harden to form rigid, inflexible cements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The compressibility  relates directly to the shape of the interatomic potentials of a given system22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The narrower and deeper the potential is, the stronger and more rigid the atomic cohesion and vice versa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More rigid materials have a higher shear modulus G and lower , but most importantly tend to have a higher G·, and to be brittle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, Poissons ratio  (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22), a function of G·, sharply differentiates between brittleness and ductility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If toughness is converted to fracture energy GC (fracture energy GC is related to fracture toughness KC by , where E is Youngs modulus and  is Poissons ratio), as a function of , this forms a clear sigmoid, with an inflection point (at 0.33)23 separating ductile ( greater than 0.33) from brittle ( less_than 0.33) materials (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Originally discovered for metals23, this important empirical relationship also holds for inorganic glasses and polymers, the ingredients of GICs and other non-metals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All these materials have been incorporated into Fig 1d to create a guide for assessing the extent of brittleness of dental materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, as setting advances,  must decrease significantly, from 0.5, when the cement is a virtually incompressible liquid to  less_than 0.33, as it solidifies into a brittle solid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is illustrated by the dashed arrow for GICs, which finally become too brittle, with 0.30 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24) compared with amalgam with 0.34 (refs 22, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ultimate aim is to modify GICs so that they are closer in toughness to amalgam and dentin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The initial setting mechanism of GICs is an acidbase reaction between the aqueous PAA and the glass component (Fig 1b; Methods)3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with alumina-silicate glasses, water corrosion ruptures bridging oxygens (BOs) to form SiOH (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26) and AlOH (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27) groups, initially creating an aqueous gel at the glass surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the G338 glass used in GICs, PO4 and F will also be released, along with Na+ cations, freeing Al3+ and Ca2+ cations to crosslink the polymer to form a strong polysalt matrix4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aluminium chelation by the polymer drives the conversion of Al(IV) tetrahedra to higher-coordinated sites28 at the interfaces between glass and the matrix, as well as those between crosslinked polymer chains within the matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher-coordinated sites include both pyramidal Al(V) as well as octahedral Al(VI) geometries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar changes in interfacial configuration in proteins, for example, are manifested by variations of orientation-dependent dynamics in the sub-THz range29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These low-frequency modes are known to modulate mechanical30, optical31 and biophysical properties32 of macromolecular systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have therefore turned to non-destructive techniques that record changing atomic structures, associated collective sub-THz dynamics and atomic cohesion during the first 3 days of setting, uncovering highly nonlinear behaviour over various stages, and providing indications of the sources of eventual brittleness and low strength.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Heterogeneous glass', 'To make our extended in situ experiments relevant to current dental practice, we have chosen the commercial G338 ionomer glass (Fig 1b), in regular use since the early 1980s.

phosphate and alumino-silicate), mineralization (phosphate and fluoride), dental caries resistance (fluoride) and opal appearance (Ca+F-rich particles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The network-forming ions are Si4+, P5+, with the majority being Al3+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Al3+ can be charge-compensated for tetrahedral configuration by P5+, and also by Na+ and Ca2+, which, as network-modifiers, can promote the formation of non-BOs within the BO alumina-silicate network4,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considerable fluorine content further depolymerizes the glass melt, leading to low liquidus temperatures28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the glass, Al3+ coordinates both to BOs and F (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36), while F complexes with Ca2+ and Na+ as well as with Al3+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SiO4 and PO4 tetrahedra principally link via BOs to Al polyhedra, and, while these are mainly tetrahedral, Al(V) and Al(VI) configurations also occur, particularly at the developing interfaces, with the proportions changing during cement setting28,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The as-received G338 glass powder (Methods) comprises micron-sized particles (Fig 2a) exhibiting extensive amorphous phase separation, as others have reported17,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our high-resolution TEM image includes a continuous matrix (GP1), in which are embedded 3050-nm spherical rosette domains (GP2), decorated by 510-nm droplets (GP3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GP2 and GP3 are highlighted by large and small dashed circles, respectively, and are generally seen throughout this image and those of other particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All three GPs are neutron amorphous (Fig 4a) and the three glassy states can be verified by DSC traces (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These reveal three glass transitions: Tg1 (701 K), Tg2 (732 K) and Tg3 (782 K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The small size of GPs and overlaying within TEM images prevents measurement of phase compositions to correlate with Tgs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as amorphous phase separation is the primary source for bulk crystalline nucleation in glass ceramics38, crystallographic studies of dental ceramics and devitrified GIC glasses37 identify possible glass-phase compositions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, G338 glass, which is a typical phosphate-containing fluoro-alumino-silicate glass, exhibits amorphous phase separation resembling the morphology in Fig 2a and at least two glass transitions at similar temperatures to those appearing in Fig 2b37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further annealing drives crystallization by bulk nucleation to a fluoro-phosphate phase and an alumino-silicate phase, the former emanating from amorphous phase-separated droplets and the latter from the surrounding matrix37,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we attribute the surrounding matrix seen in our TEM images to an alumino-silicate GP (GP1 Tg1) and the nanophase droplets to a Ca-F-P-rich GP (GP3 Tg3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the glass composition (see Materials in the Methods section) the remaining 3050-nm spherical domains suggest a Ca-F-rich GP (GP2 Tg2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These attributions to the phase-separated components have been confirmed in a recent parallel study40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Thermodynamically, the as-received G338 glass is far from equilibrium, as evidenced by the broad exothermic peak around 720 K that precedes the glass transitions (Fig 2b red curve).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shows the release of the enthalpy trapped during the very rapid quenching of the G338 melt41 and is absent on reheating (Fig 2b blue curve).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we expect each of the three separated amorphous phases GP1, GP2 and GP3 (Fig 2a) to be structurally and energetically heterogeneous in the as-received glass, as discovered in other hyperquenched glasses41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unstable phases will help drive the hydration process when PAA and glass are mixed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By heating the GIC cement above room temperature, DSC reveals, first the release of water and any organic impurities and then the decomposition of the polymer, which coincides with the three Tgs in the annealed glass (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The physical consequences of GIC setting are reflected in the altered glass-transition pattern of the residual glass (Fig 2b green curve) compared with the annealed G388 glass (Fig 2b blue curve).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most obviously, the boundaries between all three glass transitions in the GIC cement are less distinct, suggesting that all the phases have reacted with PAA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is most pronounced for GP2 Tg2 and GP3 Tg3, where the jump from glass to liquid is reduced, which will be partly due to their large surface area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reactions with PAA might promote a disorderorder transition41, or even partial mineralization, both of which would lower the glass-transition peaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the onset temperature of GP1 Tg1 is least affected by setting, indicating that the primary alumino-silicate network remains largely intact during setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cooperative interfacial dynamics', 'We observe time-dependent changes in the sub-THz range using CTS33 in the early stages as GIC cementation advances (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These occur between the separate CTS values of the glass and polymer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since bulk values will not vary, the changes that we see must relate directly to the low-frequency dynamics developing at the interfaces between glass and polymer, as well as those between crosslinked polymer chains within the matrix during setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vibrational modes in the sub-THz energy are centred around 0.5 THz and mainly involve collective motions of constituent atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These will be increasingly added to, during setting, by inter-component librational changes such as twisting, bending and flexing, with interfacial links serving as pivot points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As these encompassing motions modulate macroscopic interfacial and mechanical properties29,30,32, such as plasticity and elasticity31, the initial dip in CTS signal coincides with Ca2+ release from the glass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would appear to be due to the cationic effusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Governed by the Ca2+ rattling frequency in the glass (12 THz)42, this would initially outpace the polymers ability to deform rapidly enough to bind the excess ions, being limited by the polymers intrinsic low-frequency dynamics (0.5 THz).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once Ca2+ is released from the glass, however, subsequent signal recovery over the first 1 h traces the polymers progressive chelation of Ca2+ at the interface, until Al3+ emerges from the glass network at 1.5 h, initiated by a sharp drop in reflectance continuing to 5 h. As the polymer is increasingly localized into a percolating matrix around the glass powder13 and, with gel formation on the glass-particle surfaces4,5, we would expect an associated dampening of the CTS signal, approaching the values of the isolated polymer component (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This drop, however, is then followed by a sharp increase in THz reflectance, signalling increased activation of interfacial collective modes, and thus of increased coupling between polymer and alumino-silicate glass components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the minimum at 3 h, we propose, defines a coupling point (CP) in the reaction-setting mechanism, after the cement has lost its initial plasticity (Fig 1d), but before it has started to establish its mechanical strength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More generally, modulation of fluctuations in the sub-THz-regime generally has been linked to elasticity and shear-induced phase transitions43 and has also been associated with the stability of zeolite structures44, proteins32 and in general is typical of the librational dynamics of two-level systems in network structures42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Atomic cohesion and fracture toughness changes', 'The momentum peak widths pi of individual atom types i, measured by NCS (Supplementary Fig 3), quantify the depths of interatomic potentials, and these relate directly to atomic cohesion34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Marked oscillatory changes in pi occur during GIC setting (Supplementary Fig 3a), particularly over the first day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain the average momentum width pav representative of all elements in the setting cement, pi are combined as icipi, where ci is the element fraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that pav is bounded by ppolymer and pglass widths for respective polymer and glass components, measured separately (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As setting advances, pav starts close to the ppolymer width, and increases over 62 h, levelling off below the width of the starting mixture, which is dominated by glass pglass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During this time there is an inflection point at 5 h, which we have identified from CTS THz spectra as the CP between glass and polymer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is followed by a clear maximum at 8 h, where the atomic cohesion is greatest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We define this as the initial setting point (ISP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might be the desirable point for cementation to halt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there is then a minimum at 15 h, where atomic cohesion momentarily drops before recovering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We later identify this, from changes in S(Q) (Fig 4d), as an interfacial stress zone (ISZ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereafter, the average momentum width pav starts to level out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Since NCS probes atomic cohesion34, when pav is lower, average atomic cohesion is also lower, interatomic potentials shallower and wider and thus the material is tougher, and vice versa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we expect that pav and fracture toughness KC might be inversely related for groups of materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is demonstrated in Fig 3b for the GIC system studied, where pav values for this GIC composite measured at 24 h are plotted, together with ppolymer, pglass measured separately, as well as those of related compounds (see Supplementary Materials).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All are plotted directly as a function of values of fracture toughness KC reported in the literature21,45,46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These extend from single values for specific materials, such as SiO2 or CaF2, to ranges of values of KC for different systems such as glasses and polymers, which span different compositions and material treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The asterisked values relate to the particular components, compositions and preparation protocol used in this study (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spread of the KC values around these asterisked points for other glasses, GICs and polymer systems extend to smaller or larger values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are smallest for oxide glasses and largest for phosphate glasses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fracture toughness of the GIC glass falls midrange defining the value used in Fig 3b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with glasses, the span of KC is much larger for polymers, where KC is strongly governed by molecular weight Mn (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  45), which, for the polymer used for the present GIC, lies close to 22,000 (refs 7, 9) and determines the asterisked value in Fig 3b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The value of Mn in turn influences the mechanical properties not just of polymers but also of GICs48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, KC is greater for resin-modified GICs than for conventional GICs where the current GIC system falls midway, which determines the final asterisked value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these well-defined points result in our empirical relationship between pav and KC being also well-defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is not a reciprocal relationship, as the negative slope, dpav/dKC, decreases with increasing KC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3b provides a practical look-up table to calibrate pav widths in Å1 measured with NCS with fracture toughness in MPa m1/2, and is used to convert pav from Fig 3a into average fracture toughness values KCav at 300 K during setting (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Both atomic cohesion measured from pav using NCS and fracture toughness KCav are opposite sides of the same coin and reveal the same CP, ISP and ISZ features in monotonic setting observed early on (Fig 3a,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, KCav obtained from NCS observations offers a way to continuously access mechanical toughness in situ, otherwise complicated by the statistical averaging of multiple specimens inherent in retrospective destructive fracture testing18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, KCav drops sharply with setting time (Fig 3c), in line with the anticipated fall in  (Fig 1d), followed by the coupling (CP), setting (ISP) and stress (ISZ) points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereafter, KC levels out over the next 2 days, significantly above the baseline toughnessderived using the mixing ratio of the glass and polymer components KC values (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe similar progression in KCav at different setting temperatures over the first day (Fig 3d; Supplementary Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These reveal expected upward shifts in temperature with time for the features CP, ISP and ISZ, as the setting temperature increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The elemental momentum widths pi (Supplementary Fig 3a) analysed from the single-particle momentum distribution (Supplementary Fig 2b) can be converted into elemental fracture toughness values KCi using the same empirical relationship (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are shown for H, F, O and Al (Fig 3e,f) and share the same overall scale as KCav (Fig 3c), ranging from H with the highest fracture toughness values (1.3 MPa m1/2) to Al with the lowest (0.3 MPa m1/2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elemental values can be interpreted as imparting different degrees of fracture toughness at the atomistic level, with H and Al, for example, possibly contributing toughness and brittleness, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction points CP, ISP and ISZ are again evident.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, H, F and Al exhibit oscillatory changes in KCi (and pi) with setting time (Fig 3e,f; Supplementary Fig 3a), which are averaged out in KCav.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These may be associated with developments in hydration (KCH), fluorination (KCF) and chelation (KCAl), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This sensitivity to differing chemical bonding is illustrated by hydrogen (Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eventual pH for GICs reported here is 4.81 Å1, similar to water (4.84 Å1), but greater than ZrH2 (4.15 Å1) or NaH (3.32 Å1)34,50,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We consider that variable H cohesion during setting has two principal staggered sources: (A) hydration of the alumino-silicate GP GP1 (H2O+Si/AlOSi/AlSi/AlOH+OHSi/Al) binding OH; (B) PAA carboxylation at the interfaces (COOHCOO+H+) freeing H+ or H3O+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) is likely to be linked with gelation at CP, and (B) with subsequent chelation of Al at the ISP that follows at the interfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the first minima (binding of OH) and maxima (release of H3O+) in KCH with setting time (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, the subsequent maximum in KCF corresponds to low atomic cohesion, which can be associated with release of F. The considerable quantity of F in the glass substantiates reports of AlO3F centres charge balanced by FCa and FNa (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36), which in G338 probably originate from both GP2 and GP3 GPs (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we interpret oscillatory changes in KCF with setting time principally with the transformation of oxyfluorides into oxides at the interfaces, accompanied by the release of F when the atomic cohesion is least (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the similarity of KCF to KCAl (Fig 3e,f) points to F and Al3+ being partners in the same process, AlO3F converting to AlO4 at the ISP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The leaching of F during early setting provides caries resistance while actively stimulating tooth tissue remineralization, as is often claimed in the literature7,11,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It seems likely, too, that the compositional species from the Ca, F+P-rich GP (GP3), which assists tooth mineralization10, will be released during the corrosion of the glass at CP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, because oxygen is involved in hydration, fluorination and chelation, we expect setting variations in KCO will closely follow the overall fracture toughness KCav, which indeed appears to be the case, including the ISZ maximum close to 15 h (Fig 3c,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Atomic structure and interfacial stress', 'Time-averaged structure factors S(Q) (where Q is the neutron scattering vector) and total radial distribution functions G(r) (where r is the interatomic distance, with nearest-neighbour (NN) and next NN (NNN)) for the GIC, glass and polymer components measured separately are compared in Fig 4a,b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S(Q) for the GIC and polymer include artefacts in amplitude, relating to the featureless, but substantial, incoherent scattering of hydrogen (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peak positions on Q axis in S(Q) and in G(r), though are reliable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deuteration was avoided in this study, because this would have adversely affected diffusion and cement-setting processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Both GIC and glass S(Q)s exhibit an initial peakknown as the first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This directly reflects the average length of intermediate-range order domain rIRO in oxide glasses42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The position of the FSDP QFSDP (2/rIRO) is composition- and pressure dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluctuating position of the FSDP (Fig 4c,d) therefore indicates changes in composition and internal stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  QFSDP for G338 glass is located between 1.5 Å1 for silica and alumina-silicate glasses and 1.9 Å1 for phosphate glasses42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore attribute the initial decrease in QFSDP for GIC (Fig 4d) to the release of phosphate from the Ca, F+P-rich GP (GP3 Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond the ISP there is a sharp increase consistent with compression developing in the remaining glass, followed by decompression, defining the start and end of ISZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The internal pressure in the glass can be estimated by comparing the shift in QFSDP for silica with the permanent density change under pressure52, and points to 1 GPa being generated in the glass after the ISP at 8 h, then released by 24 h (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The integrated small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) from 0.5 to 1 Å1 () from Fig 4c is also shown in Fig 4d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SANS, which measures differential density at the nano-level, is dominated here (0.5 Å1) by Porod scattering from interfaces42, which in this case will be principally between the polymer and glass components (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the major amorphous phase separation structure in the glass (GP2) is 50 nm in size (Fig 2a), equivalent to 0.002 Å1, it is out of range for the present SANS experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead SANS intensity, which is proportional to interfacial density within the GIC, increases towards the ISZ and then drops sharply before recovering at 24 h;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Comparatively few materials have been measured to date using NCSGICs being the first complex and dynamic system to be studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Necessarily, there are differences in NCS profiles with temperature, pressure and interatomic bonding, the latter having provided the avenue to track changing atomic cohesion and dynamic interfacial configurations during cementation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparisons between elemental NCS peak widths pi (Supplementary Fig 3a) and overall p (Supplementary Fig 3b) and fracture toughness therefore need to relate to the specific materials studiedglass, GIC or polymerand for them to be measured under the same conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Such geometric switching, mainly dynamic configurations of Al ranging from four-coordinate tetrahedra originating in the glass to a five-coordinate pyramidal, is the likely initial GIC-setting sequence between CP and the ISP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coherent THz frequencies detected at the developing hybrid interface are in the collective mode range, comprised of twisting, rocking, flexing and compressing modespotentially at flexural Al pivots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, these fall among the collective modes reported for SiO2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  44), inorganic glasses and zeolite structures44, and typical of the dynamics of two-level systems42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The successful juxtaposition of in situ sub-THz spectroscopy and neutron methods with DSC herein has enabled the complex setting-reaction processes of GIC dental composites to be unravelled structurally, energetically and dynamically at the atomic level for the first time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our methods are equally applicable to studying fracture-toughness development in modified bioactive cement compositions53, where setting may be faster or slower, or in resin-modified GICs before and after curing, including the collective THz dynamics, which, in turn, are linked to inter-particle and interfacial dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect that this battery of techniques will also offer advantages more generally for studying mechanical toughness microscopically and non-destructively in other types of mercury-free cements during setting.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
