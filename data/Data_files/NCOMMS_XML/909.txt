Hippocampal and prefrontal processing of network topology to simulate the future  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Topological networks lie at the heart of our cities and social milieu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it remains unclear how and when the brain processes topological structures to guide future behaviour during everyday life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using fMRI in humans and a simulation of London (UK), here we show that, specifically when new streets are entered during navigation of the city, right posterior hippocampal activity indexes the change in the number of local topological connections available for future travel and right anterior hippocampal activity reflects global properties of the street entered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When forced detours require re-planning of the route to the goal, bilateral inferior lateral prefrontal activity scales with the planning demands of a breadth-first search of future paths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results help shape models of how hippocampal and prefrontal regions support navigation, planning and future simulation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Evidence from neuropsychology, neuroimaging and electrophysiology indicates that the hippocampus supports retrieval of the past to simulate the future1,2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, prior results have mainly come from tasks requiring cued mental simulation of the future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the conditions under which the hippocampus might naturally represent information needed for the future during continuous interaction with an environment remain unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One candidate moment is the transition between episodes, when new options for action arise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For all motile animals one transition is universally important: crossing spatial boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we enter a new territory, future possible paths become available, which are defined by the topology of the environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent evidence from rodents has shown that the connections between spaces are over-represented by the spatial localized firing of hippocampal place cells6, and it has been argued that hippocampal place cells may preferentially code the topology of an environment rather than its geometry7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During off-line hippocampal replay events, when hippocampal place cells show re-activation of spatial sequences, the topological structure of an environment may be re-capitulated8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such simulation of the topological structure of the environment would be useful during active navigation; however, so far little evidence for online representation of topological network properties of an environment has been observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While the hippocampus is thought to support retrieval of memory representations to simulate future possibilities, the role of evaluating possible future states for action is argued to be the preserve of the prefrontal cortex (PFC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is based on evidence that damage to the PFC specifically impairs planning and problem solving9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is not currently clear which regions of the PFC evaluate future paths or whether information contained in topological structures is searched to support navigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have recently proposed that the lateral frontopolar PFC is a suitable candidate region10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanism by which path evaluation may occur is not known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One potential mechanism is a tree-search of all the future branching choices in the network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, recent evidence indicates that humans plan their decisions based on evaluation of each level of the decision tree before proceeding to the next level11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a street network this would involve searching retrieved representations of all the possible path streets just beyond the next junction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a search mechanism is known as a breadth-first search (BFS)13, which steps through the sequences of possible future choices one level of the decision tree at a time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior evidence suggests that humans may use this mechanism when planning routes from cartographic maps14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we tested the hypotheses that the hippocampus retrieves representations of the topological structure of the environment when new paths are entered in order to support goal-directed navigation and the lateral PFC performs path-planning via a BFS mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We combined a graph-theoretic analysis of the city streets of London with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected from participants navigating a film simulation of Londons streets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis reveals that the right posterior hippocampus specifically tracks the changes in the local connections in the street network, the right anterior hippocampus tracks changes in the global properties of the streets and the bilateral lateral prefrontal activity scales with the demands of a BFS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These responses were only present when long-term memory of the environment was required to guide navigation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Experimental design', 'To test our hypotheses, we computed graph-theoretic measures of each street segment (Fig 1) in Londons (UK) Soho region and used these to interrogate fMRI data collected from participants navigating through a film simulation of Soho (Fig 2 (refs 15, 16, 17) and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One day after extensive in situ training (see Methods), the participants were scanned while watching 10 first-person-view movies of novel routes through Soho.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five movies required participants to make navigational decisions (Navigation routes), while the other five did not (Control routes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the start of each Navigation route, participants were oriented and then shown a destination (New Goal Events) and asked to indicate direction to the goal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They then viewed footage in which their viewpoint traversed the street (Travel Periods) until arriving near the junction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before entering new street segments (Street Entry) the participants pressed a button to indicate which direction at the upcoming junction provided the shortest path to the goal (Decision Points), after which the movie continued along the route.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Routes were predetermined such that they generally followed the optimal route but occasionally required a forced detour where the movie travelled along a suboptimal path.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control routes had the identical format to Navigation routes, except participants were instructed not to navigate and told which button to press at Decision Points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Route and task were counterbalanced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants were 84.82% (s.d.=10.96) correct at New Goal Events and 79.91% (s.d.=13.28) correct at Decision Points18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Illustration of the three centrality measures in a sample network.The network was chosen to illustrate how the three measures of centrality record different properties of the network.

connected to it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) The highest closeness centrality streets reflect the fact that these streets are topologically closest to all other streets in the network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) The highest betweenness centrality street indicates that this street would be travelled most frequently when travelling from any one street to another.Full size image', 'Figure 2: Graph-theoretic analysis

two segments are and betweenness measures the number of shortest paths from all segments to all other segments that pass through that segment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Supplementary Table 1 for the

(for example, the change in distance to the goal)18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we tested whether the hippocampal-processing demands might reflect the future simulation demands purely at Street Entry (raw values) or the change in demands that occurs at Street Entry (change in values).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Posterior hippocampus tracks change in degree centrality', 'Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that right posterior hippocampal activity was significantly positively correlated (n=24, general linear model (GLM) P less_than 0.05 family-wise error (FWE)-corrected for region of interest

response was observed whether the change in degree centrality was entered into our analysis as single parameter (n=24, GLM P less_than 0.05 FWE-corrected for ROI; Fig 3b), or when the changes in all three centrality measures were entered into an analysis (n=24, GLM P less_than 0.05 FWE-corrected for ROI; Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not observe a similar response in the posterior hippocampus to the changes in betweenness or closeness centrality (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3), or a response to any raw centrality measure (Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A significant

more positively correlated with the change in degree centrality during Navigation routes than Control routes (n=24, GLM P less_than 0.05 FWE-corrected for ROI; parameter estimates for the mean activity in the right posterior hippocampus ROI for Navigation greater than Control (t23=4.64, P=0.0001; Fig 3c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that the posterior hippocampus was significantly more correlated with the change in degree centrality than the change in closeness centrality and, at a lower threshold, more correlated with the change in degree centrality than the change in betweenness

changes in local path options (degree centrality) when new streets are entered and only when navigating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Posterior hippocampal activity is correlated with the change in

evidence that the anterior hippocampus was more correlated with the change in closeness centrality than the change in degree centrality or the change in betweenness centrality (Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We considered that the hippocampal responses to the changes in centrality measures might be driven by visual properties of the environment rather than purely by centrality measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we measured various visual properties of the environment that have been examined in prior studies examining graph-theoretic measurements of urban networks19: line of sight, street width, topological distance to edge of Soho, number of visible connecting streets, visible junctions and presence of shops, people or vehicles (Methods and Supplementary Tables 58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that, while none of our measures were significantly correlated with the change in degree centrality, the line of sight and the step depth to the boundary of Soho were correlated with the change in closeness centrality (nonparametric Spearmans correlation false discover rate-corrected n=24, step depth to boundary r=0.37, P=0.004, and line of sight r=0.60, P less_than 0.001; Supplementary Table 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we examined whether the anterior hippocampal response was selective to the change in closeness centrality or driven by these other factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that anterior hippocampal activity was not significantly correlated with the change in closeness when step depths to boundary or line of sight were included in the analysis (n=24, GLM P less_than 0.05 FWE-corrected for ROI; Supplementary Fig 4), nor was the anterior hippocampus significantly correlated with line of sight or step depth to boundary (n=24, GLM P less_than 0.05 FWE-corrected for ROI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the anterior hippocampal response at Street Entry Events appears to reflect a combination of environmental properties that relate to the more global importance of a street, for example, streets closer to the centre of the network and which have a long line of sight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Specificity of the posterior hippocampal response', 'While the change in degree centrality was not correlated with our measures of the visual properties of the environment, we nonetheless examined whether activity in the posterior hippocampus was selectively correlated with the change in degree centrality when accounting for the other measures of the visual properties of the environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When these variables were entered into analyses with the change in degree centrality, we found evidence of a significant response to the change in degree centrality in right posterior hippocampal activity across the models (n=24, GLM P less_than 0.005 uncorrected; Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the right posterior hippocampal response to the change in degree centrality is not explained either by other properties of the environment and appears to track the change in degree centrality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A previous analysis of this data set18 revealed that at Detours the change in the path distance to the goal was significantly correlated with activity in a slightly more posterior portion of the right hippocampus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we examined whether our observed hippocampal response at Street Entry Events was independent of changes in the path distance to the goal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found no significant correlation between change in the path distance and the change in degree centrality (nonparametric Spearmans correlation n=24, r=0.078, P=0.569).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When both parameters were entered into an fMRI analysis, we found that hippocampal activity remained significantly correlated with the change in the degree centrality during Navigation routes (n=24, GLM P less_than 0.005 uncorrected; Supplementary Fig 6 and Supplementary Table 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the right posterior hippocampal response to the change degree centrality is not simply explained either by changes in distance to the goal or by visual properties of the environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Posterior hippocampal response is driven by retrieval', 'Because it was difficult to observe all possible paths connected to a street segment at Street Entry Events (see examples in Fig 2c), and the posterior hippocampal response to degree centrality was absent in Control routes, it seems likely that the hippocampal response was associated with retrieval of the network topology, rather than in response to visual properties of the stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, we tested whether new participants (naive to Soho or trained experts) were able to detect changes in the degree centrality at each Street Entry Event purely by viewing our film simulation (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that naive participants could not reliably detect changes in degree centrality, whereas trained experts could (binomial test comparing the performance of the participants with chance level of 33.33% based on three possible choices at each decision point; P=0.243 for

these models the planning demands are calculated from the sum of the degree centrality in the future street segments to be travelled through to reach the goal (first level of the search tree), such that the more possible paths in the future streets, the greater the demands on planning (Fig 5a and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our post-scan debriefing (see Methods) we found that participants reported more planning at Detours than at Decision Points, often reporting that they had planned their choice before the Decision Point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this pattern, and with our theoretical prediction that lateral PFC regions might be responsible, we found that bilateral inferior lateral PFC was significantly correlated with our measure of BFS-planning demands in the first

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In summary, we show evidence that when entering a street during navigation the right posterior hippocampal activity tracks changes in the number of available path options (degree centrality), the right anterior hippocampus tracks changes related to the closeness centrality of the street and, at forced detours, lateral prefrontal activity scales with the planning demands consistent with a BFS of the street network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These discoveries will help shape models of how the hippocampus and PFC support navigation, memory and future simulation, which have hitherto generally neglected the importance of entering new regions of space and the processing of topology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our observation that posterior hippocampal activity was correlated with the change in degree centrality is consistent with the idea that the hippocampus re-activates representations of paths18,20, with the more paths requiring re-activation the more activity elicited in the hippocampus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such processing of the local streets is in agreement with the view that the hippocampus helps simulate future possible options to guide choices1,2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hippocampal replay or forward-sweeps8,21,22,23 in the dorsal hippocampus (homologue of the posterior hippocampus) may be the mechanism by which the paths are re-activated; indeed, hippocampal replay has been shown to reflect the topology of the environment8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pattern of our data helps clarify between two possible conceptual models of how the hippocampus might process future paths during navigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because we found that hippocampal activity reflected the change in degree centrality, not the raw degree centrality, a model in which the hippocampus only processes future paths the moment a street is entered is not consistent with our data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, our data agree with a model in which the hippocampus simulates possible paths throughout the journey, with the hippocampal activity we observed reflecting the increase or decrease in the number of potential future paths to be re-activated as each new street is entered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A right hippocampal locus dovetails with prior work highlighting the importance of the right hemisphere in spatial processing18,24,25,26,27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given recent evidence of social space coding in left hippocampus29, an intriguing possibility is that the left hippocampus may play an equivalent role in processing the complex topologies of the social networks humans are required to navigate in daily life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our data provide some fuel for the debate on the functional differentiation of long axis of the hippocampus25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Observation of a posterior hippocampal response to local spatial properties (degree centrality) and an anterior hippocampal response to more global spatial properties (closeness centrality, see Fig 1) is consistent with the proposal that the posterior region codes fine-grain detail and the anterior codes global information18,30,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the posterior hippocampal response is consistent with a local replay of the path representations, an anterior hippocampal response to the change in closeness centrality may reflect a different mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the anterior hippocampus may integrate information during learning about the transition structure across the street network to aid optimal navigation, for example, which streets will lead to the centre of the network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, recent evidence indicates that the anterior hippocampus may represent the graph community structure during learning the nature of transitions between a set of arbitrary stimuli33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, our analysis revealed that the anterior hippocampal response was not selective to closeness centrality, and may represent information more generally about the important streets in the environment, with important defined here by how central it is in the network both in relation to all streets (closeness), the edge of the space (step depth to boundary) and what can be seen from that street (line of sight).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results also have implications for city planning by showing, in line with previous studies16,19,34, that certain visual properties of the environment, especially how far one can see (line of sight), but also street width and presence of people, are related to centrality in the city.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future fMRI research with tailored virtual environments will be useful to understand what properties of the environment drive activity in the anterior hippocampus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Past research, for example, indicates that the contextual uncertainty of the environment may be important in eliciting anterior hippocampal responses35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A recent model exploring how state space should be optimally segmented for planning has revealed that degree centrality measures provide better optimality for planning, rather than segmentation of the state space by closeness or betweenness37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our finding of posterior hippocampal representations of the change in degree centrality, rather than betweenness or closeness, may relate to optimal retrieval of information for planning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the hippocampus appears to represent information about changes in topological properties, the lateral prefrontal activity reflected the demands of searching the network of possible future paths when re-planning was required at Detours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with prefrontal regions playing a role in spatial planning during navigation10,38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it has not been clear which regions of PFC are central to this function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously argued that lateral frontopolar regions may be important10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This proposal was based in part on the observation of increased lateral frontopolar activation in London taxi drivers during re-planning at forced detours when navigating a virtual simulation of London40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that activity in this same region, rather than simply being active at Detours, is correlated with the path-planning demands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the PFC is thought to be domain general in its processing9, it seems likely that the lateral PFC regions we have identified here would be engaged during other tasks that require searching a decision tree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we examined how brain regions support navigation by processing topological properties of a recently learned street network that lacked hierarchical structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that prolonged exposure to the environment would drive an increase in global processing of network topology in the hippocampus, or a switch to topological processing in cortical regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In light of recent discoveries of the brain regions that support navigation of subway networks38, it is possible that learning to exploit the hierarchical structure leads to the

This start image indicated the current location and heading direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The paths taken in the routes did not match the paths walked during training.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, to solve the navigation task participants could not simply recall a previously walked route or sequence of actions, but rather had to construct novel sequences through the space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Two events were included in the videos during which the video was paused: New Goal Events (NGE) and Decision Points (DP) with 9 and 5 s, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A colour photograph of the new goal was presented during NGE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This presentation contained an initial 4 s with a text describing its location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This followed with 5 s asking participants to indicate the location (goal L/R?)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  with regard to the current heading direction in Navigation condition and asking participants to indicate whether one can buy drink from that location in Control condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DP occurred a few seconds before each junction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Navigation condition participants were presented with the option to turn at the junction ahead or go straight (for example, turn L/R?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), while in the Control condition they were asked to press the button corresponding to the optimal path (for example, press left button).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of time between DP and the onset of the following turn or junction crossing (Street Entry Events) were temporally jittered to last between 3 and 9 s to allow separate measures of the BOLD signal at these two events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After each turn at the beginning of each new street section text appeared onscreen for 3 s describing the current location and general cardinal heading direction (for example, Broadwick St facing east).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For some of the Street Entry Events (46.15 or 51.85% depending on the combination of routes), the route was suboptimal for reaching the current goal and participants were thus forced to take a detour to the goal (Detours).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean duration of the routes was 266.60 s (s.d.=43.63, range=198325).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Routes were presented at walking speed (mean=1.6 m s1, s.d.=0.41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten routes and task (Navigation/Control) were counterbalanced across participants.

laptop (12 inch screen) in a similar manner to ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At each of the events (NGE, DP, Street Entry) the film was paused and participants were asked to describe whether they remembered planning or thinking about their future route.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Graph theory analysis', 'A set of formal analytic measures of the environmental layout, based on graph-theoretic measures used in the field of space syntax, were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These measures examine different properties of centrality in the street network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Space syntax methods relate human behaviour to the layout of the environment15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These methods provide a formal way of analysing the spatial properties of an environment, and can be applied to both indoor and outdoor spaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of different methods fall under the term space syntax, and can be applied at different scales (for example, local/global).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For space syntax analyses relating to the street network, the street network is represented as a graph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Graph-theoretic approaches have been adopted by a number of built environment disciplines as a way of analysing the relationship between spaces42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are two ways of translating information in the built environment into a graph, resulting in primal or dual graphs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The appropriate type of graph must be matched with the type of analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primal graphs are concerned with information at street intersections: street junctions are the nodes in the graph, and streets as the links between the nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This results in a graph that closely matches the geographic urban layout.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dual graphs focus on the streets themselves (as opposed to street junctions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This type of graph is relevant for street network analysis: street segments are the nodes in the graph, and the connections between street segments are the links between the nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dual graphs highlight the topological properties of the network and tend not to resemble the map of the physical location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Space syntax analysis is based on a dual graph representation of the street network, also known as a dual network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of different graph-theoretic measures can be applied to such a graph to examine properties of centrality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically, three graph-theoretic measures of centrality are used: degree centrality, closeness centrality and betweenness centrality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1 provides an illustration of how these three measures capture different properties of an example street network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the below, segments refer to the units of street sections that form the dual graph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Degree centrality measures the total number of edges connected to any node.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Applied to the urban network, degree

to all other segments that pass through that segment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is based on the measure defined in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  43:', '', 'where is the number of geodesics between node pj and pk

This has been shown for both for aggregate pedestrian movement44,45 and for the navigational decisions made by individuals19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The methodology is robust when compared to observed pedestrian flows across locations, scales, cities and cultures16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The approach is based solely on an analysis of the topological properties of the street network; no other information is included in the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been suggested that part of the reason why space syntax analyses are so successful is that these types of analyses pick up on elements that are naturally processed during cognition46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It would seem that people intuit how connected a particular street is within the street network as a whole46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On the basis of past research we considered that properties of the environment14,15,16,17,20 or the distance to the goal2 might correlate with our centrality measures or the change in centrality.

the actual number of visible path options from a given location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the degree centrality measure, which records the number of connecting streets irrespective of whether

as important for path planning37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined the parametric modulation of degree centrality at Street Entry Events and the categorical change in this parameter (degree centrality) as the degree centrality (models 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined the categorical change (1,0 or 1) in degree centrality because the range of variation in the change was highly limited.

greater than 0.8), and resulted in nearly identical SPM results to those from BFS using degree centrality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether lateral PFC was involved in this search we created a lateral

make the judgement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants were told that a street segment is the part of a street between any junctions; for example, Oxford street in London is one long street, but is made up of many segments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two training routes were used to familiarize them with the idea and confirm that they understood the task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants responses were recorded and marked based on the correct topological values to create a performance value for each participant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated that because participants who were uncertain would be likely to opt for a no change response, and because no change was more often correct in the street network (59% of events), participants who were uncertain would potentially perform above chance, despite no knowledge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we examined the responses of participants for only those events during which degree centrality increased or decreased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, to determine whether the right posterior hippocampal response was still correlated with the change in degree centrality in this subset of events we examined a GLM in which only events in which degree centrality increased
