Altered mGluR5-Homer scaffolds and corticostriatal connectivity in a Shank3 complete knockout model of autism  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Human neuroimaging studies suggest that aberrant neural connectivity underlies behavioural deficits in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), but the molecular and neural circuit mechanisms underlying ASDs remain elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we describe a complete knockout mouse model of the autism-associated Shank3 gene, with a deletion of exons 422 (e422).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both mGluR5-Homer scaffolds and mGluR5-mediated signalling are selectively altered in striatal neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes are associated with perturbed function at striatal synapses, abnormal brain morphology, aberrant structural connectivity and ASD-like behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo recording reveals that the cortico-striatal-thalamic circuit is tonically hyperactive in mutants, but becomes hypoactive during social behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Manipulation of mGluR5 activity attenuates excessive grooming and instrumental learning differentially, and rescues impaired striatal synaptic plasticity in e422/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings show that deficiency of Shank3 can impair mGluR5-Homer scaffolding, resulting in cortico-striatal circuit abnormalities that underlie deficits in learning and ASD-like behaviours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest causal links between genetic, molecular, and circuit mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of ASDs.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Despite significant progress in identifying genetic defects in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), the molecular and neural circuit mechanisms that underlie the behavioural impairments remain poorly defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic studies have consistently identified mutations in genes implicated in synaptic development and function1,2, although no clear consensus has emerged regarding the specific synapse types or brain regions whose dysfunction underlies ASDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies suggest that the pathophysiology of ASDs involves not only aberrant synaptic connections but also defective development of neural networks and abnormal neural synchronization3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neuroimaging investigations indicate that ASDs are associated with perturbed neural connectivity5; however, its exact nature remains uncertain6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early studies identified reduced functional connectivity8, whereas recent reports implicate hyper-connectivity in multiple brain regions9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further limiting their interpretability, these studies were conducted primarily in high-functioning ASD patients for whom etiologies are mostly unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mouse models can provide unique insights into the basic biological mechanisms underlying ASDs, but the development of these models is challenging because the biological basis for the majority of ASDs remains unknown11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, most animal models lack strong construct validity supported by human genetic studies12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SHANK3(PROSAP2)-related mutations represent a unique opportunity to address this challenge13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic defects of SHANK3 are one of the best replicated findings in autism genetics14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Point mutations typically lead to limited disruption of isoform-specific expression of SHANK3, due to multiple intragenic promoters and alternatively spliced coding exons within the gene17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the vast majority of SHANK3 mutations found in ASDs are deletions of the entire gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most patients carrying deletions of the entire SHANK3 gene in 22q13.3 deletion or Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS) have the diagnosis of ASDs16,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Eleven lines of Shank3 isoform-specific mutant mice, with deletions of different exons or point mutations e47, e49 (two lines), e9, e11, e1316, e21 (two lines) e21InsG3680 (two lines) and e21R1117X, have been reported20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These Shank3 mice show variable molecular, synaptic and behavioural phenotypes, likely because different sets of Shank3 isoforms were disrupted in each line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While these data support heterogeneity in the phenotypes of Shank3 mutations, most of them lack construct validity because the same exonic deletions have not been reported in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Accordingly, we generated Shank3 complete knockout mice, by deleting the protein-coding exons 422 (e422).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present results from molecular, ultrastructural and electrophysiological analyses, high-resolution magnetic resonance histology (MRH), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (structural connectomics), in vivo multi-circuit mapping (functional connectomics), behavioural testing and pharmacological analyses of the e422 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data support the significance of these mice as a particularly suitable model for SHANK3-related human neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Generation of Shank3 complete knockout mice', 'We and others have reported several isoform-specific Shank3 mutant mice (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To disrupt all murine Shank3 isoforms, we adopted a two-step gene targeting and a Cre/loxP strategy to flox exons 422 (e422floxed); these exons span 58 kb and include the coding sequences for all Shank3 protein isoforms (Fig 1a and Supplementary Fig 1be).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E422floxed mice were bred with CMV-Cre mice to generate mice with deletions of exons 422 (e422) (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of all known Shank3 mRNA and

testing (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  e422 mice were viable, without any gross developmental defects, although ear opening and paw position developmental milestones in e422/ pups on postnatal day 4 (P4) were delayed (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The body weights of e422/ mice were similar to the other genotypes regardless of sex (Supplementary Fig 1g), and we did not observe spontaneous seizures in these mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No genotype differences were found in preference for sniffing a social stimulus (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both genotypes demonstrated habituation-dishabituation to olfactory stimuli; however, responses were less robust for e422/ mice (Supplementary Fig 1h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'e422/ mice display core behavioural features of ASDs', 'More than half of e422/ mice (16/30) developed skin lesions by 5½ months of age (range: 47 months) across three cohorts; no such lesions were seen in e422+/ (0/30) or e422+/+ (0/29) mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lesions were observed around the eyes, on the ears, back of the head, and under the chin of mice on both C57BL/6J and mixed C57BL/6J-129R1 backgrounds (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These lesions appeared to be caused by excessive self-grooming (Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine this propensity in e422/ mice that had not developed lesions, we evaluated grooming in the home cage before and after misting with water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although all mice increased grooming after spraying, the e422/ mice engaged in significantly higher rates of grooming, relative to e422+/ and e422+/+ animals (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To examine another aspect of repetitive behaviour, mice were tested on the hole-board.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While e422/ and e422+/ mice engaged in fewer nose-pokes than e422+/+ mice, these differences were not significant (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, e422/ mice engaged significantly fewer of the 16 holes (Fig 1g) than the other genotypes; they also had a greater tendency to re-investigate the same hole (Fig 1h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, we find that e422/ mice display more repetitive behaviours and they sample their environment in a more restricted pattern than e422+/ and e422+/+ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To evaluate social preferences in neonates, we examined e422 juveniles (P15) in a nest-homing test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a one-way test, the latency to approach a sample of the home nest did not differ among the genotypes (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when given a choice between the home nest and an unfamiliar nest sample from a developmentally matched litters nest, the e422/mice failed to show a preference for home nests, unlike e422+/ and e422+/+ mice (Fig 1i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a further examination of social behaviour, we monitored the formation of dominance hierarchies over 6 days where three unfamiliar adults of the same genotype were placed into each cage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since no sex differences were found (Supplementary Table 2), the data were collapsed across sex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the number and direction of agonistic behaviours observed within each triad, a dominance ranking was calculated for each mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All e422+/+ mice established a hierarchy rank by day 1 and this remained stable through day 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, 75% of hierarchies of e422/ mice were unstable; either dominance was not maintained across days, or no dominant animal could be identified in the triad (2(1, N=30)=19.3, P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mice were next evaluated for sociability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar levels of preference for the novel social stimuli in the social affiliation and social preference tests were displayed by the three genotypes (Supplementary Fig 2a); no genotype differences were discerned in the duration or numbers of contacts with the non-social and social stimuli across all test phases (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate social behaviour in a novel environment more critically, we conducted social dyadic tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In pairings of e422 males with age-matched C3H males, the time spent in and the numbers of bidirectional interactions did not differ among the genotypes; the mice only displayed mild social investigations characterized by approach behaviours and sniffing of the head, face, anogenital and shoulder areas of the partner mouse (Fig 1j and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, e422/ mice engaged in longer and greater numbers of non-reciprocated behaviours (where the Shank3 mouse initiated the social interaction, but the C3H partner did not reciprocate and disengaged its partner by ignoring, leaving, or turning away from the target mouse) than the other genotypes (Fig 1j and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, e422/ animals engaged in more self-grooming during the social test than did e422+/+ or e422+/ mice (Fig 1k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus the e422/ mice have normal levels of social interest, but they persist in unsuccessful efforts to engage the social partner, and they engage in non-social behaviours that include repetitive self-grooming behaviours during social encounters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) were assessed in both pups and adults, as communication impairments represent a major feature of SHANK3-related disorders and ASDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The P4 e422/ pups emitted significantly fewer USVs that were of shorter duration than e422+/ and e422+/+ pups (Fig 2ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the frequencies and amplitudes of calls from e422/ mice were lower than the other two genotypes (Supplementary Fig 2b,c), all USVs were within a range appropriate for pup distress calls29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon exposure to oestrous females, e422/ adult males emitted fewer calls, and their calls were significantly shorter in duration and reduced in amplitude relative to the other genotypes (Fig 2df and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparison, no genotype differences were observed in the peak frequency of adult USVs

confirmed in the open field, where they showed reduced locomotion (Fig 2h) and a tendency towards decreased rearing (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  e422/ mice also displayed reduced locomotion and spent less time in the centre of the open field compared with the other genotypes (Supplementary Fig 2d and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the lightdark emergence test, e422/ mice delayed their entry into the lighted chamber (Supplementary Fig 2e) and made fewer transitions between chambers than the other genotypes (Supplementary Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

When mice were placed individually into clean home cages, no escape behaviour was observed (Fig 2i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when the mice were transferred to a novel larger arena, one-half of the e422/ mice escaped; no e422+/+ mice engaged in this response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, during testing in the Morris water maze, we found that e422/ mice leapt from the hidden platform and away from the experimenter on more trials than the other genotypes (Fig 2j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This behaviour may be similar to the enhanced reactivity to novel environments reported in SHANK3-related ASD patients15,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cognitive performance was examined using several different paradigms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pre-attentive function was unchanged when analysed by prepulse inhibition,

platform task, swim time did not differ among genotypes (Supplementary Table 2), indicating that sensory and motor function and motivation were intact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fear conditioning, no significant genotype differences were noted for cued conditioning, although e422/ mice showed a small enhancement in freezing during contextual testing (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since Shank3 is enriched in the striatum (Supplementary Fig 6a), e422 mice were examined in a striatal-dependent instrumental learning task30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each bar-press was reinforced with a food pellet across seven sessions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The e422/ mice were unable to learn this task, showing a dramatic deficit after the second training session (Fig 2k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, we find

local Shank3 disruption', 'The NAC firing deficit observed in the e422/ mice could result from developmental influences of Shank3 disruption on NAC function, changes in the function of NAC inputs from other brain regions (for example, hippocampus), or a direct change in the firing properties of NAC independent of development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine directly these possibilities, we used e422floxed mice (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We bilaterally infected the NAC of these e422floxed mice with an AAV10-Cre virus to selectively knockdown Shank3 in the NAC; an AAV10-GFP virus served as the control (Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four weeks after injections, these mice were surgically implanted with recording electrodes in NAC and unit activity was recorded during the baseline

#@NEW_LINE#@#  The decreased sEPSC frequency in e422/ MSNs, along with their reduced spine densities, suggests a loss of excitatory synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the striatum receives glutamatergic inputs from both cortex and thalamus41, it is unclear whether both corticostriatal and thalamostriatal synapses are affected by the Shank3 deletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We interpret the significantly increased excitability of striatal e422/ MSNs as a homoeostatic compensation for reduced glutamatergic transmission, allowing spikes to be generated with less synaptic input.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increased excitability is consistent with our in vivo recordings, which show enhanced baseline functional connectivity between the cortex and striatum, yet reduced coupling between these areas during social interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The e422/ mice also showed impaired striatal LTD, a form of synaptic plasticity associated with protein synthesis42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this impairment might reflect reduced overall excitatory transmission, it may also be attributed to impaired mGluR5 signalling due to the disrupted mGluR5-Homer1 scaffolds, previously shown to be critical for striatal LTD43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis is supported by the fact that impaired LTD in e422/ mice was completely rescued by CDPPB, a mGluR5 positive allosteric modulator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While CDPPB did not significantly alter the probability of PPR, it elevated levels of Homer1b/c in the e422/ PSD, implying that disrupted mGluR5-Homer scaffolds might be a major contributor to the impaired LTD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This deficit in LTD could be linked to the observed deficits in instrumental learning and other behavioural impairments, but not to the increased self-grooming in e422/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, striatal-dependent instrumental learning was nearly abolished.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since instrumental learning involves acquiring new responses based on reward feedback44,45, our findings suggest a role for Shank3 in reward-related processes in general, including social rewards, potentially relevant to the pathophysiology of ASDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Abnormal brain connectivity has been proposed to underlie human autistic behaviours3,4,6, but the evidence is inconsistent due to both limitations in experimental design and heterogeneity of ASD presentation in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutant mice provide an experimentally tractable model to dissect the role of Shank3 in ASD-like behaviours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall brain volume and ventricular size were increased, consistent with the increased head circumference reported in a subset of SHANK3 patients19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The abnormal neural circuit function and behaviours seen in our e422 mice are reminiscent of the alterations in grey matter content and the integrity of white matter reported in SHANK3 patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, enlargements in the basal ganglia found in e422/ mice correspond to reported enlargement in the neostriatum of human patients46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The e422/ mice have reduced cingulate cortices and enlarged deep mesencephalic nuclei, which receive inputs from the striatum and have projections to the ventral thalamus47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The changes in these structures may underlie the abnormal functional connectivity within the cortico-stiratial-thalamic circuit revealed from our in vivo recordings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Multi-site in vivo recordings allowed us to document hyperactivity in the cortico-striatal-thalamic axis in e422/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These recordings bear similarities to those in human ASD patients9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The altered pattern of oscillations in the 711 Hz frequency band in e422/ mice corresponds to the abnormalities at 811 Hz reported in human ASDs subjects31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with our mice, hyperactivity in the anterior cingulate-striatal-thalamic circuits has been observed also in human subjects with ASDs7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A study of functional connectivity focusing on SHANK3-deficient patients may yield important new insights.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The deficiency of Shank3 in e422 mice caused a redistribution of Homer and mGluR5 in striatal neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The drastic changes for Homer1b/c (decrease in the PSD but increase in the soma) are consistent with a putative role of Shank3 in the synaptic trafficking of Homer1b/c, as previously suggested by in vitro studies48,49,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increased mGluR5 but disrupted mGluR5-Homer scaffolds in the PSD (presumably secondary to the mislocalized Homer1b/c) suggest a bidirectional alteration in mGluR5-mediated functions at synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduced association of Homer1 and mGluR5 could result in the hypofunction of mGluR5-mediated signalling, whereas the increased PSD-localized mGluR5 could be associated with enhanced mGluR5 function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis of bidirectional change is supported by the elevation of basal p-ERK and p-S6K levels with a correspondingly blunted DHPG response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of differences in signalling between the striatum and hippocampus, it appears that mGluR5-mediated signalling could be synapse-and cell type-specific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future experiments will investigate these possibilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bidirectional changes in mGluR5 function may contribute to the differential striatal-related behavioural impairments observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That excessive grooming behaviour is moderated with the mGluR5 antagonist MPEP, but augmented with the positive allosteric modulator CDPPB, suggests that enhanced synaptic mGluR5 function underlies the excessive grooming seen in the e422/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, partial rescue of lever-press by CDPPB raises the possibility that decreased mGluR5 function may contribute to the impaired instrumental learning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Altered mGluR5 signalling has been documented in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome (FXS)51,52,53,54; recent work suggests that decreased association of mGluR5 with Homer1b/c contributes to the pathogenesis of this syndrome55,56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While our results are reminiscent of the disrupted mGluR5-Homer1 scaffolds in FXS mice, there are also important differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the mGluR5-Homer scaffolds in e422/ mice are disrupted by reduced synaptic Homer1b/c, while there is no evidence that Homer1 protein is reduced in FXS mice56; moreover, Homer1a-mediated function is enhanced in FXS mice55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, altered striatal mGluR5 function in e422/ mice may be bidirectional, with no apparent evidence of altered protein synthesis, whereas in the FXS mouse both mGluR5 signalling and protein synthesis at hippocampal synapses are enhanced52,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, the e422/mice show reduced striatal LTD, while FXS mice have enhanced hippocampal LTD54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences suggest that mGluR5 dysfunction may lead to distinct phenotypes in different brain regions and/or different genetic backgrounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phenotypic diversity has also been observed in other mouse models bearing mGluR5 dysfunction such as mouse models for TSC57,58 and human 16p11.2 deletion59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the mGluR5 dysfunction shared in these models suggests that the mGluR5-Homer scaffold may represent a convergent molecular pathway underlying ASDs pathophysiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, the present work suggests that many of the observed abnormalities in e422/ may be explained by disrupted mGluR5-Homer scaffolds and altered mGluR5 signalling in the striatum (Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deficiency of Shank3 protein leads to redistribution of Homer1b/c and mGluR5 protein at the synapse and soma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest this could be a pathophysiological mechanism for ASDs in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While our findings indicate that these processes could be linked to distinct behavioural phenotypes and synaptic dysfunction, further studies will be required to establish exact mechanistic links among these molecular changes, behavioural impairments and neural circuitry dysfunction in e422/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 9: A proposed model of the impairments in Shank3 completely deficient mice.In e422/ (/) mice, the deficiency in Shank3 resulted in an abnormal redistribution of Homer1b/c and mGluR5 in synapses and soma of MSNs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Abnormal Homer1b/c trafficking in striatum leads to a reduction at synapses and accumulation in the soma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decreased mGluR5-Homer association due to the reduced Homer1b/c at synapses perturbs mGluR5-mediated functions, and this contributes to the impaired instrumental learning and striatal synaptic plasticity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparison, the increased mGluR5 at the synapses may lead to enhanced mGluR5 signalling which contributes to the augmented self-grooming, and possibly the augmented functional connectivity in the cortical-striatal-thalamic axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The behavioural phenotypes found in the
