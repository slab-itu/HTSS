Superfluidity in topologically nontrivial flat bands  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Topological invariants built from the periodic Bloch functions characterize new phases of matter, such as topological insulators and topological superconductors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most important topological invariant is the Chern number that explains the quantized conductance of the quantum Hall effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we provide a general result for the superfluid weight Ds of a multiband superconductor that is applicable to topologically nontrivial bands with nonzero Chern number C. We find that the integral over the Brillouin-zone of the quantum metric, an invariant calculated from the Bloch functions, gives the superfluid weight in a flat band, with the bound Ds|C|.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, even a flat band can carry finite superfluid current, provided the Chern number is nonzero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an example, we provide Ds for the time-reversal invariant attractive HarperHubbard model that can be experimentally tested in ultracold gases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, our results establish that a topologically nontrivial flat band is a promising concept for increasing the critical temperature of the superconducting transition.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'An important result of BardeenCooperSchrieffer (BCS) theory is the relation , between the critical temperature of the superconducting transition and the microscopic parameters of a superconductor, such as the coupling constant U of the effective attractive interaction and the density of states at the Fermi energy n0(EF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is valid in the limit where the coupling constant U is much smaller than the bandwidth, which is roughly given in a tight-binding approximation by the hopping energy J between neighbouring atomic orbitals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BCS formula suggests two ways to increase the critical temperature, namely either to enhance the coupling constant U or the density of states n0(EF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the electronelectron attraction parametrized by U is the result of complicated many-body physics, not yet well understood in the case of unconventional superconductors, the density of states can be more easily obtained and engineered in a single-particle framework by means of band structure calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The density of states at the Fermi energy n0(EF) is maximal for vanishing bandwidth and so is the critical temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this limit, the energy dispersion as a function of lattice quasimomentum  k is constant  and the corresponding energy band is called a flat band.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exponential suppression of the critical temperature disappears in the flat-band limit U/J1 since BCS theory predicts1,2,3,4,5 TcUn0(EF)U/J.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might provide the way to reach the grand goal of room-temperature superconductivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A crucial question unaddressed in many works on flat-band superconductors1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 is whether the superfluid mass density s, or better, superfluid weight Ds (see below), is nonzero, leading to the Meissner effect and dissipationless transport12,13 that define superconductivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the single-band effective Hamiltonian approximation14,15,16, in which only the band dispersion enters, the superfluid weight vanishes (DsJ) since Cooper pairs localize in the individual lattice sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finite superfluid currents can be found in some flat-band systems17, but a general theory, connecting the superfluid weight to invariants of the band structure (possibly topological invariants) has not yet been provided.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The aim of this work is to answer, at a general level, the crucial question whether superfluidity can exist in a flat band and to explore its possible connections with topological properties of the band.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using a multiband BCS framework, we show that the superfluid density depends not only on the energy dispersion but also on the Bloch functions of a lattice Hamiltonian.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fact is especially important in the flat-band limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we argue that the superfluid density is subtly affected by the topological invariants encoded in the Bloch functions even in conventional superconductors (not topological)18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Topological invariants such as the Chern number C are gauge-invariant integer-valued quantities19,20, which determine the charge and spin conductance and the presence of robust edge states21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the physical picture of localized Cooper pairs is intimately related to the existence of exponentially localized Wannier functions24 that can be constructed only if the Chern number C is nonzero25 (see Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the Chern number corresponds to an antisymmetric tensor, the Hall conductance, whereas the superfluid weight is a symmetric one and, if nonzero in a flat band, is an invariant quantity constructed only from the Bloch functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the superfluid density in a flat band is proportional to a symmetric tensor given by the Brillouin-zone average of a quantity known as the quantum metric26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This tensor is the real part of an invariant matrix , which depends only on the Bloch functions, while the imaginary (antisymmetric) part is the Chern number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By means of the properties of the invariant , we prove a bound on the superfluid weight that reads Ds|C| in appropriate units (see Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we predict that the superfluid weight is proportional to the coupling constant DsU in a flat band.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a concrete application, we derive the superfluid weight in closed form for the HarperHubbard model28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using artificial gauge fields, the Harper model has been recently realized with ultracold gases29,30, which are a good platform to verify our predictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our arguments are general and similar results are expected for other flat bands or bands that are only partially flat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Superfluid transport and Wannier

whereas the superfluid fraction of the unitary Fermi gas has been measured by means of second sound52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, recent transport experiments with ultracold Fermi gases53,54 make it realistic to measure quantities like the superfluid weight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, the main issue in ultracold gas experiments is the excessive heating present in experiments with artificial gauge fields30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our estimates indicate (see Estimate of the critical temperature for the HarperHubbard model in Methods) that superfluidity may be achieved in the future in topologically nontrivial flat bands that can be realized with ultracold atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flat bands have been suggested as a possible mechanism to explain high-Tc superconductors11,10, and our results can be used to prove this hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If our results are generalized to the long-range Coulomb interaction, then one more experimental context where they may be important are quantum Hall ferromagnets (cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  the above-mentioned mapping of the superfluid weight (equations (20) and (26)) to the spin stiffness of a quantum Hall ferromagnet).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, a contact interaction is not an acceptable approximation in this case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results can be understood by distinguishing two possible ways to obtain a band of exactly degenerate states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On one hand, the particles can be confined in states with negligible overlap by high potential barriers, or alternatively localization can occur in overlapping orbits due to (pseudo-)magnetic fields or lattice geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the latter case, the possibility of transport is a nontrivial question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that we find a nonzero superfluid weight in a flat band can be understood by finite overlap of the Cooper pairs, indeed pairing fluctuations support transport whenever Cooper pairs can be created and destroyed at distinct locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Somewhat related in a work55 that focused on condensation rather than superfluidity, an effective Hamiltonian for bosons in a flat band was derived by taking matrix elements of the interaction between overlapping Wannier functions, which produced an effective hopping for the particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the work of Provost and Vallee26, pointing out for the first time the natural geometric structure present in a manifold of quantum states, it is suggested that macroscopic quantum systems that exhibit collective behaviour might be those where the quantum metric has direct physical significance, an intuition that has, in some sense, materialized in our results that showed the connection between quantum metric and superfluid weight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is an intriguing topic for future research to understand whether the pairing fluctuations and macroscopic phase of a superfluid have any connection to the fact that the quantum metric equals the fluctuations in the quantity that generates the path of a quantum state in the manifold26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While the above discussion may help to guide the intuition, the rigorous framework for future work is given by our results on the important role of Wannier functions in superfluid transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we have shown, the bound on the superfluid weight translates into a bound on the the localization functional for Wannier functions42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A nonzero Chern number implies that the Wannier functions have algebraically decaying tails24, and this explains the bound Ds|C|.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But the Wannier functions can also be delocalized on a short range only, which is consistent with the fact that the superfluid weight is related to an invariant distinct from the Chern number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, we propose (quasi-)flat bands as a viable way to increase the critical temperature in novel superconducting materials, while at the same time preserving the defining properties of superconductors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect the invariant  that controls the superfluid weight in a flat band to play a central role in this research effort.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

(37)) is the ground state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to Hunds rule, the interaction energy is minimized if the all the spins are parallel (a consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle), and in a

temperature in the order of the nanoKelvin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a low temperature results just because we wished to be able to use the analytical results derived here, which requires pairing within a single band and thus U needs to be smaller than the gaps to neighbouring bands, equation (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conceptually the same results can, however, be achieved when several (but not all) flat

substantially increased.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
