Pathological lymphangiogenesis is modulated by galectin-8-dependent crosstalk between podoplanin and integrin-associated VEGFR-3  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Lymphangiogenesis plays a pivotal role in diverse pathological conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that a carbohydrate-binding protein, galectin-8, promotes pathological lymphangiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Galectin-8 is markedly upregulated in inflamed human and mouse corneas, and galectin-8 inhibitors reduce inflammatory lymphangiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the mouse model of corneal allogeneic transplantation, galectin-8-induced lymphangiogenesis is associated with an increased rate of corneal graft rejection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, in the murine model of herpes simplex virus keratitis, corneal pathology and lymphangiogenesis are ameliorated in Lgals8/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistically, VEGF-C-induced lymphangiogenesis is significantly reduced in the Lgals8/ and Pdpn/ mice; likewise, galectin-8-induced lymphangiogenesis is reduced in Pdpn/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, knockdown of VEGFR-3 does not affect galectin-8-mediated lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) sprouting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, inhibiting integrins 11 and 51 curtails both galectin-8- and VEGF-C-mediated LEC sprouting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, this study uncovers a unique molecular mechanism of lymphangiogenesis in which galectin-8-dependent crosstalk among VEGF-C, podoplanin and integrin pathways plays a key role.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Lymphatic vessels are essential for preservation of fluid balance, nutrient absorption and immune surveillance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lymphangiogenesis is associated with diverse pathological conditions including metastatic dissemination, solid organ graft rejection, type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, lymphedema and chronic wound healing1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pathological lymphangiogenesis is also associated with various diseases of the eye including corneal graft rejection, herpetic keratitis, dry eye disease, ocular allergy and glaucoma2,3,4,5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, recent studies suggest that lymphatic vessel invasion in and around primary tumours rather than invasion of blood vessels, is the key prognostic marker of the aggressiveness of various types of cancers8, and that the growth of lymphatic vessels is also the major reason of corneal graft rejection3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The key regulatory signalling axis that induces lymphangiogenesis is vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3) and its ligand, VEGF-C.', 'Recent studies have demonstrated that the members of the galectin family of mammalian lectins characterized by a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) with affinity for -galactoside-containing glycans, play a critical role in hemangiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this respect, we have shown that a member of galectin family, galectin-3, modulates VEGF-A-induced angiogenic response by binding via its CRD to the N-glycans of integrin v3 and VEGFR-2 and subsequently activating angiogenic signalling pathways9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Galectin-8 is a tandem-repeat type member of the galectin family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It contains two different CRDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The N-terminal CRD prefers 2,3-sialyl glycans and mainly contributes to its unique carbohydrate-binding specificity11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro studies have shown that galectin-8 binds to podoplanin (PDPN) and that the lectin promotes adhesion and haptotaxis of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs)14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the direct evidence that galectin-8 exerts its biological functions through PDPN is lacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, Cueni and Detmar14 speculated that contribution of the interaction of galectin-8 with PDPN in the modulation of LEC migration and adhesion is most likely minor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, based on the findings that both unglycosylated and extensively glycosylated PDPN-Fc inhibit LEC adhesion and migration in vitro, it has been suggested that the interactions with PDPN ligands on the surface of LECs do not depend on PDPN glycosylation15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, the biological relevance of carbohydrate-dependent galectin-8/PDPN interactions is still elusive and more direct studies involving the use of galectin-8 knockout (KO) and PDPN KO mice have not been reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'PDPN is a unique transmembrane receptor protein16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is expressed by LECs but not blood ECs and promotes blood-lymph separation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice lacking PDPN have leaky lymphatic vessels and congenital lymphedema17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro studies have shown that PDPN expression in LECs is required for lymphatic capillary tube formation as well as VEGF-A-induced cell migration19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The critical role of extracellular domain of PDPN in lymphangiogenesis has been demonstrated by studies showing that PDPN-Fc and the functional blocking antibody against extracellular domain of PDPN inhibit LEC migration and tube formation in vitro and suppress lymphangiogenesis in inflamed mouse corneas in vivo15,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extracellular domain of PDPN is heavily glycosylated, and O-glycosylation as well as sialylation are critical for PDPN-mediated blood-lymph separation and platelet aggregation18,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Integrins are a major class of adhesion receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is well-established that angiogenic signals induced by VEGF and the interplay between VEGF receptors and integrins expressed on endothelial cells play an important role in the process of angiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Integrins that are well-defined for their role in lymphangiogenesis include 11, 21, 41, 51 and 91 (reviewed in Chen et al.24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of integrin 1 by collagen and fibronectin promotes VEGFR-3 activation25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, inhibition of integrin 51 but not v3 attenuates VEGF-C-induced VEGFR-3 activation26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to extracellular matrix proteins and growth factor receptors, integrins are glycosylated and interact with distinct members of galectin family in a glycan-dependent manner10,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although integrins, VEGFR-3 and PDPN are glycosylated like most cell surface receptors, more direct studies on the role of carbohydrate-dependent function of integrins, PDPN and VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 in the regulation of lymphangiogenesis have not been reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the current study, using multiple approaches involving the use of galectin-8 mutants lacking carbohydrate-binding activity, KO mice, specific sugar inhibitors of galectin-8, and siRNA knockdown of key players of lymphangiogenesis, we establish a critical role of galectin-8 and carbohydrate-mediated recognition in the process of lymphangiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that galectin-8 expression is markedly upregulated in inflamed corneas, and that galectin-8 is a potent lymphangiogenic factor and a key mediator of VEGF-C signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, we show that PDPN is a key player in VEGF-C-induced lymphangiogenesis, that knockdown of PDPN interferes with integrin signalling cascades in LECs, and that galectin-8 is a critical mediator of crosstalk among VEGF-C, PDPN and integrin lymphangiogenic pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 infection-induced pathological lymphangiogenesis is reduced in galectin-8 KO mice, and galectin-8-induced lymphangiogenesis is associated with an increased rate of graft rejection in a mouse model of allogeneic corneal transplantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, we show here that inhibitors of galectin-8 decrease lymphangiogenesis in inflamed mouse corneas in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is significant considering that there is much interest in finding ways to inhibit the activities of pro-lymphangiogenic factors for preventing graft rejection, tumour metastasis and other inflammatory conditions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

characterize the role of galectin-8 in the regulation of phenotypic behaviour of LECs in vitro, we examined the effect of galectin-8 on LEC proliferation, migration, tube formation and sprouting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to in vivo results, galectin-8 treatment had no effect on LEC proliferation in vitro (Supplementary Fig 1c and Supplementary Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reason that continuously produced galectin-8 may be required to stimulate LEC proliferation in vitro, as has been observed for other (lymph)angiogenic factors such as angiopoitin-1 (refs 28, 29) and sphingosine-1-phosphate30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Galectin-8, however, promoted cell migration and tube formation (Supplementary Fig 1d,e and Supplementary Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To better characterize the molecular mechanism by which galectin-8 mediates lymphangiogenesis, we utilized an in vitro three-dimensional LEC sprouting assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the sprouting assay, galectin-8, but not galectins-1, 3 or 7, promoted LEC sprouting (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stimulatory effect of galectin-8 on LEC sprouting was concentration-dependent (Fig 2d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we tested whether the stimulatory effect of galectin-8 on LEC sprouting was carbohydrate-dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, galectin-8-induced LEC sprouting was almost completely inhibited by thiodigalactoside (TDG), a pan inhibitor of galectins, whereas sucrose, a non-inhibiting disaccharide for galectins, had no effect (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nH (Hill coefficient) of galectin-8-induced LEC sprouting was 3.7, indicating a positively cooperative effect of galectin-8-induced LEC sprouting (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondly, compared with wild-type (WT) galectin-8, a galectin-8 mutant, Gal-8Q47A, which has markedly reduced ability to bind 2,3-sialylated glycans13,31, required at least 10 times higher concentration to promote LEC sprouting (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thirdly, 3-sialyllactose (3-SL, 10 mM), which binds N-CRD but not C-CRD of galectin-8 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13), markedly inhibited galectin-8-induced LEC sprouting, whereas 6-SL, which does not bind galectin-8, had no effect (Fig 2g and Supplementary Fig 2ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data establish that the stimulatory effect of galectin-8 on LEC sprouting is carbohydrate-dependent and that N-CRD of galectin-8 plays a critical role in the process of galectin-8-induced lymphangiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Next, we tested whether N-CRD can serve as a dominant negative inhibitor of galectin-8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Di/multivalent property of galectins allow them to crosslink many cell surface and extracellular matrix glycoproteins, such as integrins and growth factor receptors, to regulate signal transduction pathways32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isolated CRDs, which retain their carbohydrate-binding ability but are unable to dimerize or oligomerize and crosslink cell surface receptors, may compete with the carbohydrate-binding ability of the endogenous galectins and, hence, act as a dominant negative inhibitor10,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Published studies have shown that isolated CRDs of galectin-8 retain the carbohydrate-binding activity but manifest impaired biological activity13,34, suggesting that the biological function of the lectin is dependent on cooperative interactions of the two CRDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As described before, N-CRD of galectin-8 (Gal-8N) is unique among galectins in exhibiting a very high affinity for 2,3-sialyl glycans11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether the pro-lymphangiogenic property of galectin-8 is dependent on the cooperative action of both CRDs, we tested whether N-CRD is able to promote LEC sprouting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike full-length galectin-8, Gal-8N failed to induce LEC sprouting (Fig 2h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Gal-8N effectively inhibited galectin-8-induced LEC sprouting (Fig 2i and Supplementary Fig 2df).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that Gal-8N serves as a dominant negative inhibitor of galectin-8 and that 2,3-sialyl glycans recognized by Gal-8 N as well as cooperative action of both CRDs are required for galectin-8-induced LEC sprouting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'AKT and ERK1/2 are essential to lymphangiogenesis35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We, therefore, tested the activation of AKT and ERK1/2 pathways by

the recipient mice with recombinant galectin-8 or PBS (subconjunctivally and intraperitoneally, twice a week beginning at day 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On postoperative week 4, graft survival rate was

performed studies to determine whether: (i) PDPN inhibition attenuates matrix-mediated LEC migration; (ii) PDPN interacts with integrins 51 in a galectin-8-dependent manner; and (iii) knockdown PDPN impedes integrin-mediated signalling cascades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, blocking the function of PDPN by antibodies as well as siRNA knockdown attenuated both fibronectin- and galectin-8-

in not only galectin-8 but also fibronectin- and type I collagen-mediated LEC migration, a process in which integrins are well-known to play a key role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We demonstrate here that galectin-8 is highly upregulated in pathological corneas and plays a critical role in the process of lymphangiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The striking finding that several other members of galectin family including galectins-1 and 3, which are known to promote hemangiogenesis, did not promote LEC sprouting suggests that galectin-8-mediated LEC sprouting involves the affinity of N-CRD of galectin-8 for 3-sialylated galactosides that is unique among animal galectins11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this notion, specific inhibition of the N-CRD of galectin-8 with 3-SL reduced LEC sprouting and a galectin-8 mutant, Gal-8Q47A, which has lost its ability to bind to 2,3-sialyl glycans, did not promote LEC sprouting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data establish that galectin-8 promotes LEC sprouting in a carbohydrate-dependent manner and that N-CRD of galectin-8 was directly involved in the stimulatory effect of galectin-8 on LEC sprouting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A major finding of the current study is that galectin-8 modulates VEGF-C-mediated lymphangiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our studies show that Gal-8N (the dominant-negative inhibitor of galectin-8) and 3-SL (a competing disaccharide) ameliorated VEGF-C-induced LEC sprouting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in the in vivo corneal micropocket assay, the extent of lymphangiogenesis induced by VEGF-C was significantly less in galectin-8 KO mice compared with the WT mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a defect in lymphangiogenic response of galectin-8 KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, exogenous galectin-8 markedly enhanced VEGF-C-induced LEC sprouting in vitro and lymphangiogenesis in vivo in a carbohydrate-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data conclusively establish that galectin-8 significantly influences VEGF-C-mediated lymphangiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, the inhibitory effect of Gal-8N on VEGF-C-induced LEC sprouting is bell-shaped, which is similar to several other anti-(lymph)angiogenic molecules such as RGD-mimetic integrin inhibitors (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not surprisingly, much higher concentration of galectin-8 (0.75 M), compared with VEGF-C (2.38 nM), was required to produce equivalent LEC sprouting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because generally, the affinity of CRD of galectins towards their glycan ligands is lower (dissociation constant:M) compared with typical proteinprotein interaction (dissociation constant:10 nM)51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the weak affinity of their CRD, galectins achieve a stable interaction with their ligands due to their multivalency that results in overall high avidity52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, even if the affinity of one galectin-8 molecule for one PDPN molecule is weak, the overall high avidity is able to activate lymphangiogenesis pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our findings that PDPN binds to galectin-8 in a carbohydrate-dependent manner, that it contains the high affinity glycans of galectin-8 (2,3-sialylated glycans), that galectin-8 clusters PDPN on cell surface, and that unlike the knockdown of VEGFR-3, knockdown of PDPN abrogates galectin-8-induced LEC sprouting suggest that PDPN is a key player in the mechanism of galectin-8-induced LEC sprouting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another major finding of the current study is that PDPN plays a critical role in VEGF-C-mediated lymphangiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus far, VEGF-C- and PDPN-mediated pathways have been independently shown to promote lymphangiogenesis, but the relationship in the molecular mechanism of the two pathways has not been demonstrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, our findings suggest that a galectin-8-dependent cross-talk among VEGF-C, PDPN, and integrin pathways plays a critical role in lymphangiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is an important conceptual advance in the understanding of the molecular mechanism of a well-known VEGF-C lymphangiogenic pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Schematic representation of mechanistic aspects of galectin-8-induced lymphangiogenesis is shown in Supplementary Fig 10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our studies revealed that VEGFR-3 is a galectin-8-binding protein (Supplementary Fig 4a,b), and galectin-8 clusters and retains VEGFR-3 on cell surface (Supplementary Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this, VEGFR-3 knockdown did not inhibit galectin-8-induced sprouting (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that although VEGF-C-induced LEC sprouting is dependent on extracellular galectin-8, the lectin has the capacity to promote LEC sprouting independently of VEGFR-3, and VEGFR-3 may be a pseudoreceptor for galectin-8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reason that inhibiting galectin-8 attenuates VEGF-C-mediated signalling because the function of integrins 11 and 51, rather than VEGFR-3, is inhibited by galectin-8 inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that galectin-8 has a unique dual-faceted mechanism of action to promote lymphangiogenesis, where galectin-8-mediated interactions between lymphangiogenic integrins (11/51) and PDPN, are sufficient to activate the integrins and trigger the process of lymphangiogenesis without the involvement of VEGFR-3 (model I, Fig 8), but in the presence of VEGF-C/VEGFR-3, PDPN-galectin-8-integrin interactions substantially increase the magnitude of lymphangiogenic pathway by potentiating the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 signalling (model II, Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model I is supported by current studies showing that (i) VEGFR-3 is dispensable in galectin-8-mediated LEC sprouting; (ii) galectin-8-mediated lymphangiogenesis is dependent on PDPN and integrins 11/51; and (iii) galectin-8 treatment increases the

allogeneic transplantation, galectin-8-induced lymphangiogenesis is associated with an increase in corneal graft rejection; and that (iii) in the mouse model of HSV keratitis, corneal pathology and lymphangiogenesis is ameliorated in galectin-8 knockout mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings have broad implications for developing novel therapeutic strategies for conditions resulting from pathological lymphangiogenesis in both ocular diseases mentioned above as well as nonocular diseases such as cancer metastasis and solid organ transplant rejection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the avascular cornea serves as an excellent in vivo model to study mechanisms of hem- and lymph-angiogenesis that are also relevant to nonocular diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, based on the findings that lymphatics in the cornea promotes graft rejection, subsequent studies reported that lymphangiogenesis also occurs in solid organ grafting, such as renal and cardiac
