Energy dissipation from a correlated system driven out of equilibrium  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In complex materials various interactions have important roles in determining electronic properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) is used to study these processes by resolving the complex single-particle self-energy and quantifying how quantum interactions modify bare electronic states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, ambiguities in the measurement of the real part of the self-energy and an intrinsic inability to disentangle various contributions to the imaginary part of the self-energy can leave the implications of such measurements open to debate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we employ a combined theoretical and experimental treatment of femtosecond time-resolved ARPES (tr-ARPES) show how population dynamics measured using tr-ARPES can be used to separate electronboson interactions from electronelectron interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate a quantitative analysis of a well-defined electronboson interaction in the unoccupied spectrum of the cuprate Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x characterized by an excited population decay time that maps directly to a discrete component of the equilibrium self-energy not readily isolated by static ARPES experiments.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A host of interactions have a role in determining the properties of complex quantum materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Foremost among these are interactions between the electron quasiparticles, and between electron quasiparticles and bosonic excitations such as phonons and spin fluctuations1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantifying these interactions is essential to understanding the fundamental and emergent phenomena in complex materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, in strongly correlated materials the phenomenology of these interactions remains vital to understanding the behavior of charge and spin density waves, electrical conductivity anomalies and unconventional superconductivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the analysis is challenging because different experimental methods can easily lead to different conclusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difficulty primarily arises because the interactions overlap in energy, making them difficult to disentangle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interactions quite generally give rise to a finite quasiparticle lifetime, or equivalently an excitation energy linewidth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These lifetimes are described by the energy-dependent imaginary part of the quasiparticle self-energy, Im(E), which represents the effect of the interactions on the quasiparticle at energy E and determines various properties of the material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of the interactions has a specific contribution to Im(E), which in equilibrium add to result in a total linewidth according to Matthiessens rule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This superposition of single-particle self-energies complicates the disentanglement of the individual interactions, which is desirable to be able to understand the electronboson (eb) and electronelectron (ee) interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Quasiparticle lifetimes and their related mass renormalizations can in some cases be directly measured using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) by studying the linewidth (E) or effective dispersion E(k), obtaining the imaginary or real parts of the self-energy (Im(E) and Re(E)), respectively1,2,3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recently, femtosecond time-resolved ARPES (tr-ARPES)7,8,9,10,11,12 has come to the forefront as another method for studying the quasiparticle lifetimes through analyzing population dynamics, and thus ostensibly the interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these experiments, an ultrafast laser pump excites quasiparticles from their ground state, and their subsequent energy- and momentum-resolved relaxation to equilibrium is probed by analysis of the photoelectron spectrum generated by a second, much weaker, time-delayed probe pulse in the UV or extreme XUV spectral range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lifetime analysis of the laser-excited population relaxation by kinetic rate equations or density matrix formalism7,13 has proven successful for quasiparticle energies between 0.5 to several eV in a limit where relaxation is dominant at all times and quasiparticle lifetimes can indeed be determined in the time domain7,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'At energies close to the Fermi level EF, the situation is more challenging because two effects become important and hamper the lifetime determination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immediately after the pump, the primary electronic excitations relax by ee scattering, which leads to a population redistribution of secondary electronic excitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, coupling to phonons becomes in general the dominant contribution5,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under the generated non-equilibrium conditions, the various interactions do not simply add to determine the population dynamics and a quantitative, mode-selective analysis was so far not obtained17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here the population dynamics are calculated using a numerical time-dependent Greens function approach18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Explicit inclusion of the pump light field in our theoretical description as the primary electronic excitation mechanism avoids the assumption of an initially thermalized electronic distribution which was required in previous work8 and in the often-used n-temperature models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shows the photoexcited electrons scatter on an ultrashort timescale by ee interactions and, because these interactions conserve the total energy in the electron system, they cannot be responsible for the dissipation of the excess electronic energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dissipation required to relax the system is achieved by electronphonon (ep) interactions which transfer the energy from the electron system to a heat bath consisting of 75 meV phonons, where  is the phonon frequency, which will subsequently decay through anharmonic coupling into acoustic phonons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We validate this assertion of dissipation-driven population dynamics by a comparison between the tr-ARPES measurements and a theoretical calculation which only includes mass renormalizations in the relaxation dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A measurement of population dynamics on the copper oxide material Bi2212 in its normal state is used both because this material is known to host very strong mass renormalizations throughout its phase diagram1,2,19 and to demonstrate the ability of our approach to discern such interactions even when obscured by by additional phenomena, as is the case in the normal state of Bi2212.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is the fact that the same eb coupling contributes to the linewidth of equilibrium ARPES and determines the energy dissipation rate of populations in tr-ARPES that makes studying its properties important, especially since they can be isolated in the time domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we show how to separate the microscopic interactions of interest using population dynamics observed in tr-ARPES.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimentally observed relaxation dynamics are found to exhibit three characteristic timescales, , (E) and (E), reflected in the initial pump-induced, energy-dependent peak intensity and the shorter and longer exponential decay constants, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These timescales are assigned, respectively, to redistribution of the optically excited primary electrons, energy dissipation by a single bosonic mode and further relaxation by a bath of acoustic modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This tripartite enumeration of timescales represents an important step beyond previous tr-ARPES experiments, which have identified only one timescale17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The newly discovered short timescale (E) exhibits a sudden speedup at energies above + and is found to account for a large part of the lifetime obtained from the equilibrium linewidth (E) measured near EF along the zone diagonal of Bi2212.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time,  is found by fitting to be  less_than 10 fs, which is considerably shorter than (E), and (E) is found to consistently be an order of magnitude longer than (E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings open the way to a quantitative understanding of ARPES self-energies through population lifetimes measured in tr-ARPES.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparison with theory, we show that this timescale can arise from the coupling to a single optical phonon mode2,20, suggesting a new use for time-resolved measurementsas a selective probe of ep interactions in materials where their presence and strength are obscured by other processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This will furthermore allow the separation of ee from ep interactions in the single-particle spectrum both in and out of equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Employing non-equilibrium Greens functions theory, we demonstrate how to make quantitative conclusions based on these observations, and show also that the ep coupling leaves its mode-specific fingerprint on the population dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using tr-ARPES, we therefore observe population relaxation dynamics, which we describe by interaction with a specific phonon after excitation by a light field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find quantitative agreement between experiment and theory.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Theory', 'We begin with some general remarks regarding the dynamics of population distributions when driven out of equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pump deposits energy into the electrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If ee interactions are the only interactions present, the excess energy must remain in the electronic system, and although the scattering can cause a rapid change in the energy and momentum dependent population, it may only thermalize the electrons, resulting in a higher electron temperature determined by the absorbed energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a coupling to a bosonic bath of phonons can draw out the energy by transferring it to the lattice, which has a larger heat capacity than the electronic system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The determining factor for the dynamics is then the rate at which ep scattering dissipates the energy, which depends critically on the ep coupling strength and the phonon frequencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That the relaxation is ultimately dominated by a strong ep coupling even in Bi2212 is perhaps surprising even though the electronic relaxation has already been shown to act on timescales much faster than the thermalization timescale observed in tr-ARPES8,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These considerations lead, in their simplest form, to so-called n-temperature models for relaxation of an electron system driven out of equilibrium22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the full dynamics of this process, including ee and ep interactions, involves a complex interplay of electronic and bosonic interactions beyond this simple model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Energy relaxation of the photoexcited carrier population is expected to occur on three distinct timescales18: electron population redistribution on a femtosecond timescale mediated by ee scattering, transfer of energy from the electrons to strongly coupled phonons within tens to hundreds of femtoseconds and thermalization of the full system of electrons and phonons on picosecond or longer timescales, on which the excited population of the strongly coupled phonons decays through anharmonic coupling or transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 1, we illustrate the first and second processes, which are the relevant ones for the short-term dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured and calculated time traces typically show a rise at t=0, followed by a decay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dynamics are determined by a combination of the first and second processes, where ep and ee scattering cooperate in a fashion inconsistent with Matthiessens rule, , to equilibrate the electrons with each other as well as with the phonon bath.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here the breaking of Matthiessens rule derives from the difference between scattering processes which conserve energy, such as ee interactions, and those that do no, such as ep interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference is what provides our techniques advantage over static ARPES.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, since only ep interactions can carry energy away from the electrons in a non-magnetic system, we assign the observed bosonic mode to a phonon (although this is not, strictly speaking, required).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Time domain separation of electronelectron and electronboson scattering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Illustration of the dissimilarity between electronboson (eb) and electronelectron (ee) scattering for population dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electronelectron scattering (blue arrows) by nature maintains the amount of energy in the electrons, limiting it to rapid redistribution of energy within the electronic subsystem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, eb (red arrows) scattering can carry energy out, leaving a measurable impression on the population dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This causes the population dynamics to decay with the characteristics of the eb scattering (inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Calculated population decay rate extracted from the time-dependent density n(E, t) along the zone diagonal kx=ky as a function of the quasiparticle energy E for various Coulomb interaction strengths U.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, g2=0.02 (all interaction strengths are in eV2) and the phonon frequency =0.1 eV.Full size image', 'To show that the ep scattering is the determining factor in the return to equilibrium, we performed simulations of the pumpprobe process using non-equilibrium Keldysh Greens functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We treat the ep and ee interactions self-consistently, with both interactions being evaluated at second order in perturbation theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we go beyond our previous theoretical work18,23,24 and include the effects of ee scattering in second order self-consistently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculate the time-dependent density n(E, t) along the Brillouin zone diagonal after excitation by an ultrashort 1.5 eV pump pulse for a simple nearest-neighbor tight-binding model and then fit the time traces with a single exponential decay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To illustrate that the resulting decay rates reflect the ep scattering even when such strong ee scattering is present, we obtain the decay rates for various ee scattering strengths U.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1b shows the decay rates obtained for quasiparticles at energy E above EF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rates without ee scattering show a step at the phonon frequency18,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, even when the ee scattering is increased beyond the ep scattering strength (U2 greater than 0.02), the step remains visible in the data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also note that the high-energy decay rate is smaller when ee scattering is present, suggesting that there is some competition between the two processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This originates from the fact that the population dynamics is a fundamentally different quantity than the dynamics (and therefore lifetime) of a singly-excited quasiparticle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter is determined by the wavefunction decay, and the former by the interactions of the quasiparticles with each other, by the energy transfer mediated by the phonons and by their final redistribution in phase space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Experiment', 'We now demonstrate that this analysis can be applied in real materials by making a quantitative comparison between theoretical simulations of the type shown above and a tr-ARPES experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A typical equilibrium spectrum I(E, k||, teq) along the nodal direction of Bi2212 is shown in Fig 2a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here I is the photoelectron intensity probed at teq=5 ps before arrival of the pump pulse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the dispersion kink is difficult to observe without spectral deconvolution at this resolution25, the increase in coherence (or decrease in linewidth) of the states between  and EF is still clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the eb picture, this is due to a decrease in scattering rate for energies below the boson energy .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2b shows the difference spectrum from equilibrium, with teq representing an equilibrium spectrum: I(E, k||, t)=I(E, k||, t)I(E, k||, teq).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 2b, t=50 fs, and at absorbed pump fluence =35 J·cm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this fluence, by t=50 fs electrons excited above the equilibrium kink energy + and holes injected below  have largely relaxed, while those within the boson window  less_than E less_than + persist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that the pump photon energy of 1.5 eV (see Methods section for details) is well in excess of this 2 range, our tracking of the excitations in the vicinity of EF implies that we are primarily observing secondary electrons and holes and their relaxation towards EF rather than the initial excitation17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, Fig 2b shows the largest pump-induced intensity changes within the boson window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of this pileup in excited carriers at finite t means the relaxation times for carriers outside the boson window must be considerably shorter than inside since the former carriers have already relaxed by this time9,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine an upper bound of the relaxation time of primary excited electrons , we plot in Fig 3 the time-dependent photoemission intensity at EEF=1.451.5 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed symmetric time dependence implies that  is below the effective time resolution of 10 fs, which we explain by very efficient ee interaction, which may involve spin fluctuations as discussed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, this time-dependent signal serves as a cross-correlation (XC) at the sample of pump and probe pulses and defines t=0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below, we show that the significant change in relaxation times in the unoccupied part of the spectrum around + results from the sudden change in phase space with increasing E for the inelastic decay of excited carriers by emission of a single predominant bosonic mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conclusion is based on quantitative agreement between our experiment and the theory of fluence-dependent, boson-derived relaxation times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Equilibrium and excited photoelectron spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a)

observed below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is the process of filling states within the boson window18 that leads to the characteristic speeding up and slowing down observed here as well as the weakening of the 70 meV kink structure observed in previous experiments25,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As  is increased the dynamics of photoexcited carriers change from a regime reflecting essentially single-particle physics to one which is characterized by the dynamics of populations of interacting, hot particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parallel evolution, with increasing fluence, of the broadening step in  and the previously observed reduction in effective mass of the nodal kink below EF therefore encourages a description of the former effects within the same theoretical framework as the latter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of a similarly pronounced fluence dependence for (Ebin) (see Methods) may indicate that it originates in the coupling of hot electrons and phonons to a broad spectrum of bosonic modes, such as acoustic phonon modes, which can efficiently dissipate energy away from the excited system and effectively act like the energy bath in our model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, at present we can only speculate on the origin of the experimentally observed increase in apparent binding energy of the step in lifetimes as pump fluence is increased (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It might arise from effects due to electron correlations and changes in phonon properties at higher fluence as well as a hardening of the phonon mode itself under strong fluence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a particular fluence dependence of the relaxation times can furthermore indicate saturation of the particles available for excitation and interaction of the excited particles among each other leading to a bottleneck in the relaxation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such behavior bears the potential to distinguish phonon and spin fluctuations unambiguously28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A quantitative analysis will be the topic of a future

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The experiment and theoretical calculations both capture the dynamics of energy dissipation through electronphonon interactions and their separation from ee interactions which keep the energy within the electron system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fingerprint of the ep interaction through its particular phase-space restrictions is seen in the data through both energy and fluence dependence of the population decay rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding the detailed nature of the equilibrium self-energy is thought to be vital to understanding a host of phenomena in strongly correlated materials and beyond, not least those derived from non-Fermi liquid properties that would be expected to show up most strongly in electronic channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In equilibrium ARPES, it is difficult to disentangle phononic from other contributions to the self-energy, especially when several different interactions are present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of ee, eb and electron-impurity scatteringjust to name a fewcollude and increase the overall linewidth, making it difficult to separate a single contribution in static ARPES.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the techniques demonstrated here, we now have the ability to isolate the phonon contributions directly from the total equilibrium self-energy through measurement of population dynamics with tr-ARPES with high temporal resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This should ultimately allow for a quantitative deconvolution of the various contributions to the single-particle self-energy, insight into which is thought to be vital to understanding the high Tc problem in the cuprates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, in revealing the presence of at least three distinct timescales for population relaxation in Bi2212 our study has provided a new window onto the relative strengths of electronic, optical phonon and acoustic phonon couplings, including a strong bound on the timescale on which the ee interaction manifests itself in Bi2212.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis has further shown, through the separation of  from , that the energy of electrons driven out of equilibrium is not only dissipated (rather than dispersed) primarily by phonons but also that the 75 meV phonon mode which dominates the ep interaction above EF comprises a sufficiently short timescale that it can account for a large portion of the equilibrium self-energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this fact in itself is not sufficient to identify the origin of the famous nodal kink in the single-particle spectrum, it is very suggestive of at least some role for this mode since bosons couple to electrons above and below EF with equal vigor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Taken together, these observations and their theoretical understanding mean that the dominant form of energy dissipation in Bi2212, at least at optimal doping, is by interaction of electrons with the lattice, a rather surprising finding in a prototypically strongly correlated material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, given the energy of the phonon mode responsible for  we can speculate this mode is related to the 80 meV bosonic mode observed in the same material in recent momentum-resolved electron energy loss experiments29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, while this phonon mode clearly dominates the relaxation, our lowest fluence (and so closest to equilibrium) data is best explained quantitatively (Fig 5c) by an ep coupling constant of only 0.2 when isolated from other contributions to the self-energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, while seemingly pronounced when isolated by our non-equilibrium measurements, the interaction with this mode, by itself, does not provide an mechanism for high-temperature superconductivity in optimally doped Bi2212, although, as with the kink, its prominence may imply its participation in conjunction with other effects such as those of spin fluctuations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If this phonon mode is a c-axis mode, as seems likely, its ready separation from other interactions may further indicate that it constitutes a uniquely important channel for electronic interaction between the copper oxide planes even for the nodal region, which is typically considered to be highly two-dimensional.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we have focused on a material where the presence of a complex interplay of ee and eb interactions is well known, but ultimately separable in the time domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The very existence of the boson window effect in our non-equilibrium data indicates that for at least several hundred femtoseconds after the excitation of a so-called n-temperature model, in which a thermalized electron distribution can be considered to be well described by, for example, a FermiDirac distribution, is clearly invalid because the dynamic spectral weight transfer related to the boson window does not follow such a distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is well past the time that ee interactions dominate and are often assumed to have thermalized the excited electrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, our high fluence data indicate the potential importance of non-equilibrium effects on the boson population itself and such effects further complicate any effort to describe the relaxation of the system in simple thermodynamic terms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the wide employment of such models in understanding time-resolved experiments in strongly correlated materials, these findings also have important ramifications beyond the present study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They mean that strong correlations are no guarantee as a temperature model will be accurate even to relatively long times from the initial excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theoretical techniques of the sort deployed here are therefore vital for an understanding of the non-equilibrium physics of strongly correlated materials such as the Fe-based superconductors, heavy fermion compounds, and manganites, as well as more weakly correlated materials with strong ep interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Topological insulators are a field where the study of population dynamics is commonly used, and the methodology presented here can aid in the interpretation and analysis of the results30,31,32,33,34,35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the particular relevance of bosonic mode couplings for excited state population dynamics is of high interest, for instance, in light-harvesting applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We point out that this relevance is often implicitly assumed, for example, in recent ab initio computations of equilibrium self-energies, from which information about hot carrier dynamics for solar cells was inferred37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study provides a firm ground for such implicit assumptions, and the methods laid out by us can guide further efforts in this direction.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
