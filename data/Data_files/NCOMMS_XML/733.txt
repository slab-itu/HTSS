Bond selectivity in electron-induced reaction due to directed recoil on an anisotropic substrate  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Bond-selective reaction is central to heterogeneous catalysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In heterogeneous catalysis, selectivity is found to depend on the chemical nature and morphology of the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, however, we show a high degree of bond selectivity dependent only on adsorbate bond alignment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The system studied is the electron-induced reaction of meta-diiodobenzene physisorbed on Cu(110).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the adsorbates C-I bonds, C-I aligned Along the copper row dissociates in 99.3% of the cases giving surface reaction, whereas C-I bond aligned Across the rows dissociates in only 0.7% of the cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A two-electronic-state molecular dynamics model attributes reaction to an initial transition to a repulsive state of an Along C-I, followed by directed recoil of C towards a Cu atom of the same row, forming C-Cu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar impulse on an Across C-I gives directed C that, moving across rows, does not encounter a Cu atom and hence exhibits markedly less reaction.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Bond-selective chemistry due to differences in energy barriers continues to play a major part in the understanding of thermal heterogeneous catalysis1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A notable advance in recent years has been the employment of selective excitation of a molecule incident or present on a surface as a means to influence the reaction probability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For vibrationally and translationally excited gaseous beams incident at metal surfaces, reactions have been reported to be mode-specific3,4,5, bond-selective6,7 and gas-phase alignment-dependent8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of molecules adsorbed at surfaces, electrons from scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) have been employed to excite vibrationally or electronically the adsorbate, resulting in molecular translation9,10,11, rotation11,12,13, isomerization14 and desorption9,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The breaking of a selected chemical bond in the adsorbate has also been achieved by varying the electron energy16,17,18,19 or, for extended adsorbates, the excitation location19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we show a high degree of bond selectivity due to a cause that, to our knowledge, has not previously been noted, namely the directed recoil of products formed as a result of electron-induced surface reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The approach is quite general since directed recoil of products along what was the prior bond direction has been widely reported16,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the directed recoil occurs at an anisotropic surface, we find bond-selective surface reaction occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that different alignments, even of a chemically identical bond, can result in a hundred-fold alteration in reaction probability, with corresponding bond selectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The example given is that of an electron from an STM tip impinging on a single meta-diiodobenzene (mDIB) molecule on Cu(110) giving two orders of magnitude greater probability of breaking a carbon-iodine (C-I) bond lying Along (AL) a Cu row than the C-I that lies Across (AC) the rows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular dynamics (MD) calculations employing an approximate anionic potential, followed by impulsive recoil across a ground potential computed by density functional theory (DFT) reproduce the observed bond selectivity, explaining it as due to directed recoil across the anisotropic surface of the Cu.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The high degree of bond selectivity in electron-induced surface reaction reported here is linked to directed recoil in relation to the anisotropy of the substrate, resulting in stronger bonding to the substrate when one bond is broken than the other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We anticipate similar bond-selective reaction for electron-induced processes on other anisotropic surfaces, the cause being the greater proximity of a substrate atom to one bond in an adsorbate than to another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This proximity leads in the present instance to 100 × greater reactivity for the adsorbate bond more closely adjacent to a substrate atom, despite the fact that the bonds being broken in the reaction are chemically identical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proximity, in turn, is determined by the geometry of the physisorbed adsorbate relative to the substrate atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Directed recoil together with substrate anisotropy can therefore be expected to lead to bond selectivity in other electron-induced surface reactions, for example, in chemical reactions at surfaces being subjected to generalized electron radiation, in an extension of conventional heterogeneous catalysis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
