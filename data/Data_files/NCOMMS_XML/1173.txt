Structural insights into the mechanism of the membrane integral N-acyltransferase step in bacterial lipoprotein synthesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Lipoproteins serve essential roles in the bacterial cell envelope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The posttranslational modification pathway leading to lipoprotein synthesis involves three enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All are potential targets for the development of new antibiotics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the crystal structure of the last enzyme in the pathway, apolipoprotein N-acyltransferase, Lnt, responsible for adding a third acyl chain to the lipoproteins invariant diacylated N-terminal cysteine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structures of Lnt from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli have been solved; they are remarkably similar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both consist of a membrane domain on which sits a globular periplasmic domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The active site resides above the membrane interface where the domains meet facing into the periplasm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structures are consistent with the proposed ping-pong reaction mechanism and suggest plausible routes by which substrates and products enter and leave the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While Lnt may present challenges for antibiotic development, the structures described should facilitate design of therapeutics with reduced off-target effects.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Lipoproteins are essential components of bacterial membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lipoproteins functions are myriad1,2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some have enzymatic activity, as in the case of the -lactamase (penicillinase) lipoprotein6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Others are enzyme activators7 and inhibitors8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many lipoproteins are components of complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A noted example is the tetra-heme cytochrome subunit of the photosynthetic reaction center9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other complexes where lipoproteins play an important role include the -barrel assembly machinery (BAM) where four of the five BAM subunits are lipoproteins10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lipoproteins are also virulence factors against which mammals have evolved immune response systems12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These assorted functions make lipoproteins interesting, important and relevant biomacromolecules to understand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current study focusses on the final step in the lipoprotein synthesis and maturation pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Lipoproteins have an N-terminal cysteine residue where one or both of its functional groups is posttranslationally lipid modified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A diacylglyceryl moiety is attached by a thioether linkage to the invariant cysteine producing a diacylated lipoprotein (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining this modification with an N-acylation of cysteines free -amino group generates a triacylated lipoprotein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most cases, the lipid modification affixes the protein to the membrane with the protein part outside the membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on growth conditions, a lipoprotein can be di- or triacylated suggesting that posttranslational modification (PTM) is tightly controlled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Lipoprotein posttranslational processing in Gram-negative bacteria.The pathway includes the three processing enzymes Lgt, LspA and Lnt that reside in the inner membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pre-prolipoproteins enter the membrane for processing via the Sec or TAT pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trafficking to the outer membrane is by way of the Lol ABC transporter system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inset shows the chemical structure of the triacylated N-terminal cysteine of a mature lipoprotein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DAG, diacylglyceryl.Full size image', 'Lipoprotein synthesis begins with the full-length pre-prolipoprotein entering the inner membrane via the TAT or Sec secretion systems (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has a membrane anchoring N-terminal signal sequence 10 to 25 residues long that ends with a consensus lipobox sequence of form L(A/V)4-L3-A(S)2-G(A)1-C+1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first step in the three-step PTM pathway is catalysed by lipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase, Lgt14, which attaches a diacylglyceryl moiety from phosphatidylglycerol (PG) to the lipobox invariant cysteine by a thioether link15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diacylglyceryl modified (dagylated) cysteine is hereafter designated Cys*.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result of the reaction, the prolipoprotein product is secured in the membrane by the signal sequence and by the lipid modification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second PTM step is catalysed by lipoprotein signal peptidase, LspA16,17, which cleaves the signal sequence from the prolipoprotein to the N-side of Cys*.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apo-lipoprotein product remains anchored in the membrane by its diacylglyceryl tail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For some lipoproteins no further modification is needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They remain and function in the diacylated state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rest are acted on by the third and last enzyme in the PTM pathway, apolipoprotein N-acyltransferase, Lnt18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This transferase N-acylates the Cys* of the apo-lipoprotein using preferentially phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) as a lipid substrate and generating the triacylated lipoprotein product2,18,19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Crystal structures of the first two enzymes in the PTM pathway have been reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lgt from E. coli was captured in complex with PG and the inhibitor palmitic acid22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure of LspA from P. aeruginosa was solved with the antibiotic globomycin in the active site of this aspartyl peptidase17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe the structure of Lnt, the last enzyme in the PTM pathway, which offers valuable insights into its mechanism of action and antibiotic development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In E. coli, the enzyme has been shown to use the sn-1 chain of PE preferentially for lipoprotein N-acylation in a two-step reaction20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lnt is a member of the nitrilase family of enzymes with two domains, a membrane domain (MD) and a periplasmic nitrilase-like domain (ND) harbouring the enzymes active site21,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Nitrilases comprise a superfamily of thiol enzymes found in animals, plants, fungi and in certain prokaryotes23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They perform nitrile and amide hydrolysis and the N-acylation (reverse amidolysis) of proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nitrilase reaction takes place in a globular domain with a conserved  fold and a Glu/Lys/Cys catalytic triad.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seven branches of the superfamily have additional domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lnt, with its MD, is one such example.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In E. coli, Glu267, Lys335 and Cys387 were identified as the catalytic triad residues and homology modelling, with known nitrilase structures as templates, provided a putative structure and a mechanism for Lnt action24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, a crystal structure of the full-length enzyme was required to rationalize these findings and conjectures and to provide a structural framework for understanding Lnts mechanism of action.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Structure determination', 'A particular focus of this research group is on membrane proteins in P. aeruginosa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, a structure of Lnt from this opportunistic human pathogen (LntPae) was selected for investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because so much was known about Lnt from E. coli (LntEco), it too was included in the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two proteins have 39% sequence identity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pure proteins were functionally active as demonstrated in assays where product formation was quantified with the synthetic biotinylated lipopeptide, fibroblast stimulating ligand-1 (FSL-1-biotin), as the second substrate (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystallization trials were undertaken using the lipid cubic phase method25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystals that diffracted to 3 Å were obtained for both Lnt constructs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seleno-methionine (Se-Met) labelling of LntEco for Se-single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (Se-SAD) phasing was used to solve the native LntEco structure to a resolution of 2.9 Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LntPae structure and that of an inactive Cys387Ala mutant of LntEco were solved by molecular replacement using the native LntEco structure as the search model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data collection and refinement statistics are presented in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Representative electron density maps are shown in Supplementary Figs 2 and 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall structure of the three constructs is similar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-evolutionary covariance analysis is consistent with the crystal structures26 (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For purposes of the discussion that follows the focus will be on the wild type LntEco construct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Lnt activity assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

either DOPE or LntPae (lanes 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time dependence of the reaction is shown in lanes 35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When DOPE was replaced with DOPG or DOPC, the product was formed much

architecture', 'Lnt has two domains, a MD and a periplasmic ND with 230 and 278 residues, respectively (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interfacial area between domains is 440 Å2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The active site, defined by the catalytic triad, resides in the ND slightly above the membrane surface with an opening for substrates and products that leads into the bulk membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MD consists of eight transmembrane helices (H1H8) with both N and C termini in the cytoplasm (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first six helices are arranged cylindrically with helices forming the wall of the cylinder and coiled counter-clockwise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At its periplasmic end, opposing helices across the cylinders diameter are approximately equidistant giving the MD the appearance of an open ended cylinder (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This periplasmic opening is covered by a highly conserved 27-residue long linker (L1) connecting H5 and H6 that includes two short helices, h1 and h2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The positioning of L1 across the top of the MD is due, in part, to Pro129 which introduces a kink in H5 causing it to bend away from H6 and to align with H4 (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This enables conserved Arg139 on the periplasmic end of H5 to hydrogen bond with backbone carbonyls of highly conserved residues Phe146 and Trp148 in L1 thereby securing the loop as a periplasmic lid on the MD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The essential nature of Arg139 is borne out by mutational studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A strong interaction between highly conserved Gly145 in L1 of the MD and Tyr388 (Fig 5d) in the ND contributes to holding the two domains together where they meet at the periplasmic surface of the membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This, in turn, helps position the catalytic Cys387 for reaction (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cys387 in the ND sits above the center of the MD about 13 Å from where L1 crosses its cylindrical opening (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mapping conserved residues onto the structure identifies this region, between the two domains, as the putative active site pocket (Supplementary Figs 5a,6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Overall architecture of Lnt from E.

H1H6 holds with one exception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H2 is tilted into the core of the cylinder effectively closing this end of the protein (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arg123 on the cytoplasmic end of H5 interacts with Thr48 on H2 and with other local residues creating a water-tight seal between the two sides of the membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H7 and H8 in the MD are bridged by the ND in the periplasm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The connection between the two domains is by way of two long linkers (L2, L3) that look and possibly act like braces crossing over one another at the back of the ND (Fig 3a, Supplementary Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The H7/H8 helix pair sits to one end of the MD (hereafter referred to as the back end), run approximately parallel to one another, are oriented almost normal to the membrane plane and are separated from each other by the width of the MD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arg438 on the ND has extensive interactions with Thr478 and Gly479 in the L3 brace to H8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, highly conserved Thr481 on the L3 brace interacts with highly conserved Glu435 on the ND (Supplementary Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these interactions presumably help poise the catalytic triad in the ND above the MD for reaction and contribute to Lnts overall structural integrity and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, a Thr481Arg mutation inhibited the S-acylation step in the transferase reaction consistent with an uncoupling of the two domains21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite having a very high content of hydrophobic residues, H3 and H4 appear to extend above the membrane interface into the periplasm (Figs 3a and 4a, Supplementary Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H3 is bent at conserved Gly71 and coils over H4 in an anticlockwise direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that the periplasmic surface of H3 and H4 forms one side of the portal for amphiphilic substrates to enter the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to Gly71, H3 has three conserved glycines (Gly60, Gly64 and Gly66) in close proximity to one another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that H3 has considerable flexibility, possibly to accommodate and to orient into the active site the N-terminal diacylglycerylcysteine in differently sized and shaped lipoproteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) data support this proposal (Supplementary Fig 5c and d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The ND is globular in shape and rests on the periplasmic surface of the MD (Figs 3a and 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It emerges from the MD as a 277-long polypeptide connecting H7 and H8 (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As noted, the two domains are linked by way of two brace-like linkers (L2, L3) at the back of the ND (Supplementary Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  L2 and L3 connect H7 and H8 in the MD with the first (1) and last -strands (12) in the ND, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  L3 includes a short helix (h4) towards the junction with H8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ND is of the four-layer  sandwich fold type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Helices 1 and 2 form the upper layer that resides atop the protein in the periplasm with helices 3 and 4 forming the lower layer that sits on the periplasmic surface of the MD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 is really a pair of helices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first is a single-turn helix (3) and is part of a -strand-turn-helix motif termed a nucleophilic elbow in which resides the catalytic Cys387 (Figs 5 and 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Helix 3 includes highly conserved residues Tyr388 and Glu389 both of which were shown in mutational work to be essential24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second helix in the pair (3) is two turns long.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is separated from the lower -sheet of the ND and tilts into the core of the MD providing shape complementarity between the two domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two sheets of the nitrilase sandwich have different alternation of parallel and anti-parallel strands and, as usual, are twisted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The upper and lower  halves are connected on the front end of the ND by a 40 residue long loop with a short helix (**) between 5 and 6 and on the back end by the MD tethering linkages L2 and L3 between 11 and 12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Layers within the sandwich are held together primarily by hydrophobic interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The back end of the domain consists of short loops and, as a result, it is relatively flat and featureless.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the front end includes several loops of varying length that extend away from the ND approximately parallel to the membrane plane arranged roughly in a ring around the catalytic triad.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with the periplasmic H3 and H4 helical extensions, these loops create an opening to the membrane and a funnel-shaped pocket at the base of which sits the catalytic triad (Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They resemble arms that reach out from the active site creating a pocket for substrates to enter and for products to leave.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For convenience of description these active site cavity surrounding loops are hereafter referred to as arms and are identified numerically clockwise around the catalytic Cys387 (Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residues Pro353, Phe358 and Met362 on Arm3 and Trp237 on Arm7 have been identified in mutational studies as important or essential21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Highly conserved Gly447 resides at the end of Arm6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the location of these key residues and the fact that they do not interact notably with other parts of the protein we speculate that their essentiality arises from the critical roles the respective residues and the loops in which they reside play in guiding substrates and products into and out of the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6:

that extends out of the bulk membrane into the space between Arm 1 and Arm 3 (Fig 7a, Supplementary Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This long hydrophobic opening leads into the active site pocket.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that it serves as the portal through which lipid and lipoprotein substrates enter the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this, the structures of Lnt solved in the course of this study contain a varying number of structured monoolein lipid molecules from the mesophase in which crystallization occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most lipids decorate the MD of Lnt roughly in a bilayer arrangement reminiscent of lipids in a native membrane (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some however reside in the H4H5 cleft and occupy positions between Arm 1 and Arm 3 and above Arm 2 that feed into the active site pocket.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the LntEco-Cys387Ala mutant structure, where lipid density is well defined and plentiful in this region of the protein, the lipids arrange themselves in single file along the hydrophobic pocket entrance into the active site (Fig 8b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apolar nature of many of the residues in the periplasmic extensions of H3 and H4 and the three arms is consistent with this finding (Supplementary Fig 5b, Fig 8c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that the positions occupied by the structured lipids define the route to the active site taken by the phospholipid and lipoprotein substrates of Lnt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MDS performed with Lnt in a model hydrated membrane, reveal that lipids may enter this region from the bulk membrane (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that there is sufficient space for both substrates to enter the proposed catalytic site one at a time via this conduit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of the structured lipids in the crystal structures and simulations it was plausible to dock substrates and products individually into this binding pocket in a physico-chemically reasonable manner and that is consistent with the proposed ping-pong reaction mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these observations help explain how the lipid and lipoprotein substrates can effectively migrate out of the bulk membrane along the apolar conduit created by the cleft between H4 and H5 and the space between Arm1 and Arm3 to the active site Cys387 situated some 13 Å above the periplasmic

'N-acyltransferase mechanism', 'The N-acyltransferase reaction catalysed by Lnt is proposed to take place in two steps (Fig 9, Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first is an acyl transfer reaction where the acyl chain at the sn-1 position of the substrate, preferentially PE in the case of Lnt from E. coli, is transferred to form a thioester linkage with the S of the catalytic Cys387 (Fig 9ac, Supplementary Fig 9ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the second step, the acyl chain is transferred from Cys387 to the -amino group of the dagylated N-terminal cysteine of the lipoprotein (Fig 9df, Supplementary Fig 9df).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction follows a ping-pong mechanism where the first product departs the active site before the second substrate enters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first step is proposed to involve proton abstraction from the S of Cys387 by catalytic Glu267.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This generates a thiolate which, in turn, attacks the ester linkage between the acyl chain and the glycerol backbone of the phospholipid substrate to form a tetrahedral intermediate (Fig 9b, Supplementary Fig 9b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A net negative charge on the oxygen attached to the tetrahedral

that of a cysteine containing model peptide (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, at pH 7.0, Cys387 is fully protonated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, nearby Glu267 has a side chain pKa of 7.0 some two and a half pH units above that of Glu in a model peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This residue, which is 50% deprotonated at pH 7.0, is in a position to extract a proton from Cys387 thereby generating the highly nucleophilic thiolate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The closest distance between a side chain carboxyl oxygen on Glu267 and the S of Cys387 is 4.1 Å (3.5 Å in LntPae; Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is too far for direct interaction and suggests that proton abstraction may involve the mediation of a water molecule to relay transfer from Cys387 to Glu267.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a water molecule was not seen in the structure perhaps due to resolution limits or disorder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may also be that flexibility in local backbone and side chain conformation bring the Cys387 and Glu267 into proximity for direct proton exchange.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter conjecture is supported by MDS, which suggests a spontaneous and consistent hydrogen bond arrangement between the S proton of Cys387 and the side chain of Glu267 (Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a Glu267Gln mutation inactivated the enzyme consistent with its proposed role in proton abstraction (Fig 2d).

is in hydrogen bonding distance to conserved Ser411 (Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ser411 is suitably positioned to stabilize the S of Cys387 as it alternates between thiol and thiolate forms during the

next to Cys387.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In one of these (LntEco-C387A), the S of Cys387 is 4.5 Å from the hydroxyl on the glycerol backbone of a structured monoolein (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is compatible with a mechanism where a fatty acyl donor substrate, such as PE, accesses the site with its ester linked acyl chain at the sn-1 position of the glycerol backbone proximal to the nucleophilic thiolate for reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first step in the reaction happens spontaneously yielding an acylated-enzyme intermediate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the Lnt enzyme in whole cells has been shown to exist in its acylated form27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the thioester linkage is labile and can deacylate by hydrolytic cleavage in the absence of second substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the Cys387Ser mutant has been shown to acylate spontaneously but because the oxygen ester is more stable than the thioester, the subsequent N-acylation step is blocked even in the presence of lipoprotein substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed this in functional assays where the Cys387Ser construct proved to be inactive (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Efforts aimed at capturing a structure of

similar with RMSD values over 501 residues of 1.2 Å (Supplementary Fig 11a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite having different residues in the active site pocket, the catalytic triad residues superpose almost exactly on one another (Supplementary Fig 11c) consistent with the two enzymes catalysing the same N-acyltransferase reaction with similar substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the phospholipid profile of E. coli and P. aeruginosa membranes are similar with PE and PG together making up 95% of membrane lipids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rest is mainly cardiolipin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fatty acids of the

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Using substituted cysteine accessibility measurements (SCAM) with whole cells, a membrane topology for LntEco was reported that included six transmembrane helices, a periplasmic ND and an 80 residue long cytoplasmic loop21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter was proposed to include two hydrophobic helices disposed at the membrane interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ser154Cys mutant used in the SCAM study showed little accessibility to the water-soluble labelling agent leading to the conclusion that Ser154 and the entire cytoplasmic loop were to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current results rationalize this interpretation and show that the two hydrophobic helices referred to in the SCAM based model correspond to H5 and H6 in the crystal structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ser154 resides in L1 between H5 and H6 where the MD and ND come together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The arrangement is consistent with the Ser154Cys mutant showing little accessibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The crystal structures and MDS suggest that the tips of the arms surrounding the actives site are flexible (Supplementary Fig 5c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Towards the active site, flexibility reduces considerably.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the C387A mutant structure, a row of single monoolein lipid molecules appears corralled in this proposed portal formed by Arm 1, Arm 3 and the H3/H4 cleft that connects the active site pocket with the bulk membrane (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It makes sense therefore that this conduit can be navigated by phospholipid substrate molecules, especially in a sideways orientation with the sn-1 chain on point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On account of its size however, the lipoprotein substrate could experience difficulties with access and egress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, if the protein part of the lipoprotein is stably folded all the way to its diacylated N-terminal cysteine it is unlikely to be able to act as a substrate for lack of space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this folded condition therefore the only way to access the active site would be for the arms to open wide to accommodate the lipoproteins bulk which can be considerable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This seems unlikely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a conformation or range of motion was not observed in the crystal structures nor during MDS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more reasonable alternative is that the stretch of residues immediately following the N-terminal cysteine of the lipoprotein is unfolded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, it can function as a flexible peptide tether linking the N-terminus, which must access the active site buried in Lnt, and the rest of the lipoprotein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this scenario, the girth of the tetherthe diameter of a peptide chainwould easily be accommodated in the portal to guide the N terminus in its di- and triacylated states into and out of the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this proposal, the first 56 residues of the lipoprotein subunit CytC are unstructured as observed in the crystal structure of the reaction center complex where all N-terminal residues (C*FEPPPATTTQ) and the lipid modification of CytC are in electron density29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, sequence analysis (Supplementary Fig 12) performed on lipoproteins from E. coli and P. aeruginosa reveal C*SSK(T)P(S)E(K)D(V)S(P)Q(E)P(D)A(S) and C*SSS(L)PPPPP(L)PA, respectively, as the most frequently observed residues in the N-terminal undecapeptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high frequency of prolines is consistent with an unstructured conformation for the tether, a likely lipoprotein processing motif.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Docking and MDS performed with LntEco in complex with the lipodecapeptide substrate FSL-1 (C*GDPKHPKSF) indicates that this mode of access is entirely reasonable (Supplementary Fig 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The acyl chain preferences of LntEco have been investigated20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PE with saturated and unsaturated fatty acids at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions, respectively, is an effective substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chain preferences were not investigated in the current study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the crystal structures show that the active site is buried at the base of a long channel (Figs 7a and 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is there that the acyl chains of the lipid substrates are proposed to reside during reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to head group effects therefore, differences in how the acyl chains are accommodated in the confined space of the active site pocket are likely to play a major role in determining lipid substrate selectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same argument can be made regarding the lipid component of the lipoprotein substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mature lipoproteins are either di- or triacylated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, some lipoproteins are Lnt substrates while others are not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The origin of the disparity is not known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With lipid substrates, preferences are expressed by Lnt at both head group and acyl chain levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise for the lipoprotein substrate, preferences based on the protein as well as the lipid component are perhaps to be expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of the extant crystal structures of Lnt, it has been proposed that the identity of the acyl chains in the diacylglyceryl moiety of the lipoprotein will impact on lipoprotein substrate selectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What about the protein component and to what extent does it influence Lnt lipoprotein preference?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arguments have been presented above regarding the need for an unstructured peptide tether between the lipidated N-terminal cysteine and the folded region of the lipoprotein substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might suggest that provided the tether is unfolded and is long enough, it will suffice as an Lnt substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, tether length and structure may determine which lipoproteins will or will not undergo N-acylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Downstream of the PTM pathway, triacylated lipoprotein products interact with the Lol trafficking system (Fig 1)30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residues at the +2 and +3 positions (and +3 and +4 positions in P. aeruginosa), relative to the N-terminal cysteine at position +1, act as sorting signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on signal identity the lipoprotein either remains in the cytoplasmic membrane or is trafficked to the outer membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presumably, these signature residues matter little to Lnt since, regardless of identity, all of the corresponding lipoproteins must undergo N-acylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a degree of insensitivity on the part of Lnt to primary structure in this part of the lipoprotein substrate is expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  coli and P. aeruginosa have between 100 and 200 different types of lipoproteins that range in size from 50 to over 900 residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identity of all those that are Lnt substrates is not known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is likely to be considerable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the enzyme is promiscuous with regard to protein identity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that biotin C terminally labelled lipopeptide FSL-1 is an Lnt substrate is consistent with this apparent indifference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that Lnt is relatively indifferent to the protein component of its lipoprotein substrate and that the diacylglyceryl moiety on the N-terminal cysteine of a lipoprotein is likely to play a major role in determining whether or not it is an Lnt substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Clearly, the enzymes involved in the synthesis of lipoproteins that play a vital role in the life of the microbial cell are potential targets for antibiotic development programs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lnt presents a particular challenge because it has a catalytic triad of the nitrilase type and enzymes, with the same conserved catalytic triad, are found in mammals (Supplementary Fig 11c)23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fortunately, the substrates of Lnt and mammalian nitrilase-like enzymes are very different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both substrates of Lnt are fatty acylated molecules while nitrilases cleave carbon-nitrogen bonds in non-lipidated molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With high resolution crystal structures of both host and bacterial enzymes, it should be possible to rationally design drugs that selectively target the pathogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An additional difficulty arises with developing drugs targeting lipoprotein PTM enzymes that relates to the behaviour of lipoproteins as potent agonists of the immune system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pathogen recognition and eventual elimination benefits from prompt activation of the innate immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lipoproteins are triggers of this event that involves Toll-like receptors (TLR)31, TLR1, TLR2 and TLR6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heterodimerization of TLR2 with TLR1 or TLR6 and lipoprotein complexation sets in train the innate immune responses leading to antigen-specific acquired and long-term immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, simple lipopeptide mimics of lipoproteins, such as the di- and triacylated peptides, Pam2CSK4 and Pam3CSK4, trigger immune responses suggesting that the N-terminal lipidated cysteine in these ligands is the principal motif stimulating the immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This background highlights the nature of the challenge associated with developing antimicrobial therapies targeting PTM enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The receptors responsible for activating the host innate immune response as well as the enzymes that perform bacterial lipoprotein synthesis both bind lipoproteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a ligand found to inhibit lipoprotein synthesis and that is a potential antibiotic may act by binding to the active site of the enzyme mimicking the substrate or product lipoprotein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, the immune receptors bind lipoproteins tightly and specifically and in a manner that may well resemble that used by the PTM enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this event, the ligand while possibly a potent antibiotic will have undesirable off-target effects that show up as interfering with and possibly blocking the innate immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, with high-resolution structures of both receptor-lipoprotein and enzyme-lipoprotein complexes and assuming the binding pockets are sufficiently different, it should be possible to rationally design a selective antibiotic without such off-target effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystal structures of TLR-lipopeptide complexes are available32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, the need exists for structures of complexes between PTM enzymes and lipoproteins to advance the critical mission of developing safe and selective new antibiotics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
