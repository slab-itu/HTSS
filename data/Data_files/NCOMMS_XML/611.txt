Isotope analysis in the transmission electron microscope  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The Ångström-sized probe of the scanning transmission electron microscope can visualize and collect spectra from single atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can unambiguously resolve the chemical structure of materials, but not their isotopic composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we differentiate between two isotopes of the same element by quantifying how likely the energetic imaging electrons are to eject atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we measure the displacement probability in graphene grown from either 12C or 13C and describe the process using a quantum mechanical model of lattice vibrations coupled with density functional theory simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then test our spatial resolution in a mixed sample by ejecting individual atoms from nanoscale areas spanning an interface region that is far from atomically sharp, mapping the isotope concentration with a precision better than 20%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we use a scanning instrument, our method may be applicable to any atomic resolution transmission electron microscope and to other low-dimensional materials.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Spectroscopy and microscopy are two fundamental pillars of materials science.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By overcoming the diffraction limit of light, electron microscopy has emerged as a particularly powerful tool for studying low-dimensional materials such as graphene1, in which each atom can be distinguished.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through advances in aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy2,3 (STEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy4,5, the vision of a synchrotron in a microscope6 has now been realized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spectroscopy of single atoms, including their spin state7, has together with Z-contrast imaging3 allowed the identity and bonding of individual atoms to be unambiguously determined4,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, discerning the isotopes of a particular element has not been possiblea technique that might be called mass spectrometer in a microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we show how the quantum mechanical description of lattice vibrations lets us accurately model the stochastic ejection of single atoms11,12 from graphene consisting of either of the two stable carbon isotopes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our technique rests on a crucial difference between electrons and photons when used as a microscopy probe: due to their finite mass, electrons can transfer significant amounts of momentum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a highly energetic electron is scattered by the electrostatic potential of an atomic nucleus, a maximal amount of kinetic energy (inversely proportional to the mass of the nucleus, ) can be transferred when the electron backscatters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When this energy is comparable to the energy required to eject an atom from the material, defined as the displacement threshold energy Tdfor instance, when probing pristine11 or doped13 single-layer graphene with 60100 keV electronsatomic vibrations become important in activating otherwise energetically prohibited processes due to the motion of the nucleus in the direction of the electron beam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intrinsic capability of STEM for imaging further allows us to map the isotope concentration in selected nanoscale areas of a mixed sample, demonstrating the spatial resolution of our technique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability to do mass analysis in the transmission electron microscope thus expands the possibilities for studying materials on the atomic scale.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Quantum description of vibrations', 'The velocities of atoms in a solid are distributed based on a temperature-dependent velocity distribution, defined by the vibrational modes of the material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the geometry of a typical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study of a two-dimensional material, the out-of-plane velocity vz, whose distribution is characterized by the mean square velocity , is here of particular interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an earlier study11 this was estimated using a Debye approximation for the out-of-plane phonon density of states14 (DOS) gz(), where  is the phonon frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A better justified estimate can be achieved by calculating the kinetic energy of the atoms via the thermodynamic internal energy, evaluated using the full phonon DOS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As a starting point, we calculate the partition function Z=Tr{eH/(kT)}, where Tr denotes the trace operation and k is the Boltzmann constant and T the absolute temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluate this trace for the second-quantized Hamiltonian H describing harmonic lattice vibrations15:', '', 'where  is the reduced Planck constant, k the phonon wave vector, j the phonon branch index running to 3r (r being the number of atoms in the unit cell), j(k) the eigenvalue of the jth mode at k, and nj(k) the number of phonons with frequency j(k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'After computing the internal energy  from the partition function via the Helmholtz free energy F=kT lnZ, we obtain the Planck distribution function describing the occupation of the phonon bands (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We must then explicitly separate the energy into the in-plane Up and out-of-plane Uz components, and take into account that half the thermal energy equals the kinetic energy of the atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gives the out-of-plane mean square velocity of a single atom in a two-atom unit cell as', '', 'where M is the mass of the vibrating atom, z is the highest out-of-plane mode frequency, and the correct normalization of the number of modes  is included in the DOS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Phonon dispersion', 'To estimate the phonon DOS, we calculated through density functional theory (DFT;

Our results thus show that multiple excitations do not contribute to the knock-on damage in graphene, warranting another explanation (such as chemical etching11) for the evidence linking a highly focused HRTEM beam to defect creation27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each impact is, effectively, an individual perturbation of the equilibrium state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Local mapping of isotope concentration', 'Finally, to test the spatial resolution of our method, we studied a sample consisting of joined grains of 12C and 13C graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isotope labelling combined with Raman spectroscopy mapping is a powerful tool for studying CVD growth of graphene28, which is of considerable technological interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Earlier studies have revealed the importance of carbon solubility into different catalyst substrates to control the growth process29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the spatial resolution of Raman spectroscopy is limited, making it impossible to obtain atomic-scale information of the transition region between grains of different isotopes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The local isotope analysis is based on fitting the mean of the locally measured electron doses with a linear combination of doses generated by Poisson processes corresponding to 12C and 13C graphene using the theoretical cross section values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although each dose results from a stochastic process, the expected doses for 12C and 13C are sufficiently different that measuring several displacements decreases the errors of their means well below the expected separation (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To estimate the expected statistical variation for a certain number of measured doses, we generated a large number of sets of n Poisson doses, and calculated their means and standard errors as a function of the number of doses in each set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculated relative errors scale as 1/n and correspond to the precision of our measurement, which is better than 20% for as few as five measured doses in the ideal case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our accuracy is difficult to gauge precisely, by comparing the errors of the cross sections measured for isotopically pure samples to the fitted curve (Fig 2), an estimate of roughly 5% can be inferred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Local isotope analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) A STEM micrograph of a hole in the carbon support film (1.3 m in diameter), covered by a monolayer of graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each of the overlaid spots, 415 fields of view were irradiated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dimensions of the overlaid grid correspond to the pixels of a Raman map recorded over this area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Isotope concentration map where the colours of the grid squares denote 12C concentration based on the fitting of the Raman 2D band response (Methods; Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overlaid spots correspond to (a), with colours denoting the concentration of 12C estimated from the mean of the measured doses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Locally measured mean doses and their standard errors plotted on a log scale for each grid square.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The horizontal coloured areas show the means±s.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of doses simulated for the theoretical 12C and 13C cross sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that a greater variation in the experimental doses is expected for areas containing a mix of both carbon isotopes.Full size image', 'Working at 100 kV, we selected spots containing areas of clean graphene (43 in total) each only a few tens of nanometers in size (Fig 1a), irradiating 415 (mean 7.8) fields of view 1 × 1 nm2 in size until the first displacement occurred (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing the mean of the measured doses to the generated data, we can estimate the isotope concentration responsible for such a dose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assignment was corroborated by Raman mapping over the same area, allowing the two isotopes to be distinguished by their differing Raman shift.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A general trend from 12C-rich to 13C-rich regions is captured by both methods (Fig 3b), but a significant local variation in the measured doses is detectable (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This variation indicates that the interfaces formed in a sequential CVD growth process may be far from atomically sharp30, instead spanning a region of hundreds of nanometers, within which the carbon isotopes from the two precursors are mixed together.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'It is interesting to compare our method to established mass analysis techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In isotope ratio mass spectrometry precisions of 0.01% and accuracies of 1% have been reported31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these measurements are not spatially resolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For spatially resolved techniques, one of the most widely used is time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has a lateral resolution typically of several micrometers, which can be reduced to around 100 nm by finely focusing the ion beam32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of ToF-SIMS, separation of the 13C signal from 12C1H is problematic, resulting in a reported33 precision of 20% and an accuracy of 11%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The state-of-the-art performance in local mass analysis can be achieved with atom-probe tomography34 (APT), which can record images with sub-nanometer spatial resolution in all three dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent APT study of the 13C/12C ratio in detonation nanodiamonds reported a precision of 5%, but biases in the detection of differently charged ions limited accuracy to 25% compared to the natural isotope abundances35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A limitation of ToF-SIMS is its inability to discriminate between the analyte and contaminants and that it requires uniform isotope concentrations over the beam area for accurate results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  APT requires the preparation of specialized needle-like sample geometries, a laborious reconstruction process to analyse its results36, and its detection efficiency is rather limited37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our case, we are only able to resolve relative mass differences between isotopes of the same element in the same chemical environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While we do not need to resolve mass differences between different elements, since these differ in their scattering contrast, we do need to detect the ejection of single atoms, limiting the technique to atomically thin materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our method captures the isotope information concurrently with atomic resolution imaging in a general-purpose electron microscope, without the need for additional detectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have shown how the Ångström-sized electron probe of a scanning transmission electron microscope can be used to estimate isotope concentrations via the displacement of single atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these results were achieved with graphene, our technique should work for any low-dimensional material, including hexagonal boron nitride and transition metal dichalcogenides such as MoS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could potentially extend to van der Waals heterostructures38 of a few layers or other thin crystalline materials, provided a difference in the displacement probability of an atomic species can be uniquely determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither is the technique limited to STEM: a parallel illumination TEM with atomic resolution would also work, although scanning has the advantage of not averaging the image contrast over the field of view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The areas we sampled were in total less than 340 nm2 in size, containing 6,600 carbon atoms of which 337 were ejected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, while the nominal mass required for our complete analysis was already extremely small (131 zg), the displacement of only five atoms is required to distinguish a concentration difference of less than twenty per cent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future developments in instrumentation may allow the mass-dependent energy transfer to be directly measured from high-angle scattering39,40, further enhancing the capabilities of STEM for isotope analysis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

experimental fit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a more precise algorithm for the numerical integration of the equations of motion, more advanced theoretical models for the interaction, or time-dependent DFT may be required to improve the accuracy of the simulations further.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Varying mean square velocity with concentration', 'Since the phonon dispersion of isotopically mixed graphene gives a slightly different out-of-plane mean square velocity for the atomic vibrations, for calculating the cross section for each concentration, we assumed the velocity of mixed concentration areas to be linearly proportional to the concentration', '', 'where c is the concentration of 12C and v12/13 are the atomic velocities for normal and heavy graphene, respectively.

the Raman shifts of 13C graphene (12/13)1/2 times smaller, allowing the mapping and localization of 12C and 13C domains28 with a spatial resolution limited by the size of the laser spot (nominally 400 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shifts of the G and 2D bands compared with a corresponding normal graphene sample are given by , where 12 is the G (2D) line frequency of the normal sample, c013=0.01109

analyzed the shift of the 2D band, where two peaks were in most locations present in the spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in many spectra these did not correspond to either fully 12C or 13C
