A peptide for targeted, systemic delivery of imaging and therapeutic compounds into acute brain injuries  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health and socio-economic problem, but no pharmacological agent is currently approved for the treatment of acute TBI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, there is a great need for advances in this field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we describe a short peptide (sequence CAQK) identified by in vivo phage display screening in mice with acute brain injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CAQK peptide selectively binds to injured mouse and human brain, and systemically injected CAQK specifically homes to sites of brain injury in mouse models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CAQK target is a proteoglycan complex upregulated in brain injuries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coupling to CAQK increased injury site accumulation of systemically administered molecules ranging from a drug-sized molecule to nanoparticles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CAQK-coated nanoparticles containing silencing oligonucleotides provided the first evidence of gene silencing in injured brain parenchyma by systemically administered siRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings present an effective targeting strategy for the delivery of therapeutics in clinical management of acute brain injuries.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Acute brain injury such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) disrupts the normal function of the brain and generally has a poor prognosis for functional recovery and survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Termed a silent epidemic, TBI is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in children, teens and active adults from ages 1 to 44, with an annual incidence of 2.5 million in the US (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TBI can lead to acute and potentially long-lasting neurological dysfunction, including the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy or even Alzheimers disease2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A majority of combat-related TBI cases are additionally complicated by a penetrating injury to the brain, which is often even more difficult to manage than non-penetrating injuries3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this substantial socio-economic impact, TBI treatment is limited to palliative care and no specific therapies with long-term benefits are available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The bloodbrain barrier (BBB) is considered a major impediment to systemic treatment of central nervous system (CNS) diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, localized delivery of drugs within the brain has been explored, but it has limitations in clinical settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In acute brain injury and several cerebrovascular diseases, including stroke, hypertension and ischaemia, the BBB is transiently disrupted, which allows extravascular access for macromolecules and neuroprotective drugs from the systemic circulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the leakage of serum proteins into brain parenchyma is used to test for BBB integrity4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, lack of specific binding of passively accumulating proteins in the injured area can result in low retention and subsequent washout over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to this clearance, the therapeutic efficacy of a systemically administered drug may be greatly limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We previously employed in vivo phage display as a powerful and unbiased method to probe tissues in situ for specific molecular signatures and discovered homing peptides specific for different pathologies including tumours, atherosclerotic plaques and wounds5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reasoned that an acute and complex event such as TBI is suited for a similar approach as site-specific molecular changes in protein expression have been reported8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we set out to identify peptides that would recognize specific molecular changes at the sites of traumatic injury in the brain, and enhance delivery of therapeutic compounds to such sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The goal of this approach was to explore an alternative to local delivery of therapeutics, which is invasive and can add complications to the injury.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Isolation of brain injury selective peptide by phage display', 'To isolate peptides that specifically target brain injury, we inflicted unilateral puncturing stab wound injuries to the right hemisphere of adult male mice (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The penetrating brain injury (PBI) resulted in rupturing of BBB visualized by selective leakage of mouse IgG into the brain parenchyma on the injured side (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PBI also caused cortical tissue loss, axonal damage and loss of myelin in the corpus callosum (Supplementary Fig 1b), and was accompanied by an increase in glysocaminoglycan deposition in the injured hemisphere (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1:

investigate if CAQK targets other types of brain injuries, we tested peptide homing in a controlled cortical impact injury (CCI) model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without penetrating injury, this model mimics

Binding of CAQK peptide was specific to brain injuries as no peptide accumulation was detected in perforating injuries inflicted on the liver and skin (Supplementary Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that the binding epitope for CAQK peptide is specific for sites of brain injury, at least in the models tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'CAQK homing to PBI was observed up to 5 days after the injury (Supplementary Fig 3), indicating a potential window for effective systemic CAQK-targeting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To visualize peptide accumulation across the entire brain, whole brains were processed and made transparent using the CLARITY protocol10 and FAM-CAQK was visualized in the transparent tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FAM-CAQK signal in the clarified brain was restricted to the injured quadrant of the brain and was higher than the signal from FAM-CGGK control (Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CAQK accumulated in the region of the commissural fibres of the corpus callosum and in ring-shaped cellular structures in the cortex (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CAQK accumulation led to a greater retention in the injured brain, as the peptide signal was visible 3 h after injection whereas the control peptide was completely washed out (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'CAQK binding is specific to sites of brain injury', 'To further characterize the binding of CAQK to the injured brain area, we carried out overlay binding experiments with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) conjugated with CAQK (CAQK-nanoparticles (NPs)) on mouse brain sections (Supplementary Fig 5ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CAQK-NPs showed strong binding to the injured brain sections, whereas the binding of control NPs (CGGK-NP) was negligible (Fig 2fh).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low binding of CAQK-NPs to brain sections from normal animals was observed, suggesting the presence of low levels of the peptide binding epitope in normal brain, and its elevation upon injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar binding pattern of CAQK-NPs was also observed in the CCI model (Supplementary Fig 5d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding specificity was confirmed by inhibiting the CAQK-NP binding with excess of free CAQK, which resulted in near complete inhibition (Supplementary Fig 5fh).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'CAQK peptide interacts with components of brain ECM', 'To identify the potential protein targets of CAQK in the brain tissue, we performed mass spectrometry proteomics analysis of proteins separated from extracts of injured brain by affinity chromatography on immobilized peptides (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table 1 shows a comparison of proteins in eluates from CAQK and control (CGGK) columns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the large number of proteins identified, peptides prominent in the CAQK column eluates belonged primarily to the lectican family of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These included versican, associated proteins tenascin-R and the hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein (Hapln).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Versican and Hapln4 were exclusively present in the CAQK column eluates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In normal brain, lectican proteoglycans form extracellular matrix (ECM) complexes known as perineuronal nets (PNN)12 around neuronal surfaces and the expression of some of these lectican proteoglycans is upregulated at sites of CNS injury13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 CAQK binds to brain ECM proteins.Full size table', 'We confirmed the increase in expression of ECM-associated CSPGs at sites of brain injury by immunostaining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Versican, tenascin-R, and the hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein (hapln4), all of which are components of the brain ECM complex upregulated following an injury, showed high expression in the injured but not the uninjured hemisphere of the brain (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signal from intravenously injected CAQK co-localized with versican, tenascin-R and Hapln4 (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peptide signal also co-stained with Wisteria floribunda agglutinin lectin, a marker for PNNs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the cellular level, FAM-CAQK prominently accumulated at mature oligodendrocytes identified by expression of the adenomatous polyposis coli marker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In several instances, the CAQK binding pattern followed elongated cells that aligned in the direction of the callosal axons (see CAQK with adenomatous polyposis coli and even better with NG2 in Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only a few isolated Olig2 and NG2-positve cells, most likely oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, bound the peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No CAQK was detected in or around other glial cell populations, including astrocytes (GFAP+) and microglia (Iba+; Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data suggest that the binding molecule (receptor) for CAQK peptide is present in the PNN complex that is upregulated in brain injuries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3:

showed higher binding to ECM than control phage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Inhibition of CAQK phage binding to ECM by free CAQK peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Phage binding to ECM is reduced on enzymatic digestion of ECM with chondroitinase ABC or hyaluronidase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Representative data shown in bd is from three experimental repetitions each with three sample replicates.Full size image', 'To explore further the association of CAQK with the PNN complex, in vitro binding of CAQK phage to ECM produced by U251 human astrocytoma cells was tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells express high levels of versican and other members of the brain ECM (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15), which suggests that these cells are activated in culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CAQK phage showed significantly higher binding to the U251 ECM than a control phage (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to providing further evidence for the ECM binding of CAQK, this result indicates that CAQK recognizes the human target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is not surprising, as peptides are generally not species-specific in their binding properties16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding to this ECM was specific as it was inhibited with excess free CAQK peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, enzymatic treatment of the ECM with chondroitinase ABC or hyaluronidase resulted in loss of versican staining (Supplementary Fig 9) and correspondingly reduced CAQK binding (Fig 3c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the epitope for CAQK resides in the complex formed by the CSPGs, hyaluronic acid and associated proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'CAQK as a carrier of diagnostics and therapeutics', 'The accumulation of the FAM label attached to the CAQK peptide suggested that CAQK is capable of delivering low molecular weight compounds into sites of brain injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate further the translational potential of the CAQK-targeting approach, we first examined CAQK-mediated delivery to brain injury of NPs as a model of both an imaging agent and a drug carrier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CAQK conjugated, silver NPs (mean diameter20 nm), administered intravenously, showed significantly greater accumulation in injured brain tissue than control NPs (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The localization of CAQK-NPs was in excellent agreement with the localization of the free CAQK peptide (Fig 2b,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, CAQK targeted NPs mimic the homing ability of the free peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To demonstrate the versatility of CAQK system, we tested delivery of oligonucleotides loaded into porous silicon NPs (PSiNPs) as a carrier17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our proof of concept approach was to silence local expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) systemically expressed in transgenic mice from the CAG promoter18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We simulated therapeutic oligonucleotides by using short interfering RNA (siRNA) against GFP loaded in CAQK conjugated PSiNPs (Supplementary Fig 11ad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PSiNPs were intravenously injected into the GFP mice with PBI and visualized by time-gated luminescence imaging19,20 allowing quantification of their accumulation in the excised brains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The imaging showed that CAQK-PSiNPs accumulated in the injuries at markedly higher (35 fold) levels than PSiNPs coated with a control peptide (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other tissues, including regions of the brain outside the injury area, showed no significant difference in the accumulation of CAQK and control PSiNPs (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confocal microscopy on transverse cortical sections from mice injected with CAQK-PSiNP-siGFP exhibited a large void of GFP expression at the injury site, whereas brains from mice treated with control NPs did not differ from untreated brains (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed 70% silencing of GFP expression by targeting siGFP, whereas minimal silencing was observed with untargeted siGFP and other controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This silencing was visible across the entire injury and not just in a particular cell type presumably due to the gradual degradation of PSiNP and release of the siGFP over time in the injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gene silencing was specific for brain injury, as GFP expression remained unaltered in normal brains or in other major tissues (Supplementary Fig 11e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4:

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We describe a 4-amino acid peptide that selectively recognizes brain injuries and accumulates at the sites of injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that this peptide, CAQK, enhances the accumulation of systemically administered payloads with chemistries ranging in size from a drug-sized molecule to nanoparticles, and incorporating a variety of imaging and therapeutic functions of potential utility in clinical management of brain injuries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the target of this delivery system is expressed both in mouse and human brain injuries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We used two mouse models in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PBI model mimics gunshot or shrapnel wounds, such as the ones sustained by a warfighter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The blunt cortical impact model more generally reproduces the features of severe TBI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CAQK recognized the injuries in both models, suggesting broad utility across acute brain injuries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that the contralateral hemisphere, unlike normal brain, accumulated some CAQK phage suggests that less severe injuries than the ones we used may also be targeted with CAQK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains to be tested whether CAQK also homes to spinal cord injuries, or even demyelinating CNS lesions such as in multiple sclerosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we also show that CAQK recognizes its target in cultured human cells and in cortical sections of injured human brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The phage screening in this study revealed a novel aspect of the in vivo screening; whereas the previous screens have probed the vasculature of the target tissue, even in the brain21,22,23, the compromised BBB integrity in brain injury allowed the phage to probe the extravascular brain tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the high-throughput sequencing of the peptide-encoding inserts in the phage genome provided a technical improvement to the screening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One round of selection, as opposed to repeated rounds as previously done, provided a fingerprint of over 200,000 peptide sequences, revealing a striking enrichment of phage displaying the CAQK peptide sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a cyclic phage library was used, a library of this design contains a minority of linear peptides because stop codons occur within the random insert causing truncation of the cyclic peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, mutations may also change the structure of the peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, peptides that do not conform to the general structure of the library are commonly encountered in phage screening24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recovery of cyclic peptides containing the CAQK motif, in addition to the dominant linear CAQK peptide, suggests that CAQK motif is also active in the context of a cyclic peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'BBB disruption is an important contributor to secondary injury following TBI, and therapies to restore BBB functionality are under investigation for neuroprotection26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The localized permeability of BBB and the delayed onset of secondary injury provide a window of opportunity for therapeutic intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The literature27 and our results suggest the duration of the BBB impairment is at least up to 5 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within this time window, affinity ligand-based (synaphic) targeting can be an effective drug delivery approach; our results show as high as 35-fold enhancement in the accumulation of systemically administered imaging agents and therapeutics at and around the site of injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The concentrating effect of synaphic targeting is likely accounted for by two factors: the peptide can access and bind to its target that allows accumulation of the payload and causes retention at the site of injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The impairment of the BBB allows all circulating substances to enter the injury area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  And, if the peptide receptor is sufficiently abundant relative to the amount of the peptide-drug conjugate used, the binding of the peptide to the receptor can drive payload accumulation beyond what is caused by passive leakage28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the case in brain injury, where the components of the CSPG complex are overexpressed upon an injury12 (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second important factor is the retention effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the drug concentration decreases in circulation, the drug is washed out of the injury area29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peptide binding to its target can retain the drug in the injured microenvironment by minimizing this washout (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the targeting approach in this work encompasses the critical period of healing, which may provide a more lasting therapeutic effect, at least when the therapeutic action is long-acting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, some oligonucleotides, which is one of the types of drugs we successfully delivered in this work, have been shown to remain active for weeks in tissues30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'CNS injury results in formation of a CSPG-rich glial scar, which is a major barrier to regeneration31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strategies to prevent the accumulation of CSPGs in injury or dissolve existing deposits have been explored14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, site-specific delivery of the active compounds has been a challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intrinsic affinity of CAQK peptide for CSPG rich areas in injured brain could be effective in directing a CSPG-reducing payload, such as the chondroitinase ABC enzyme32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Having successfully targeted nanoparticle payload into brain injuries, we would expect to accomplish the same with proteins, such as chondroitinase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of the present approach to concentrate a payload at the site of brain injury is important for reducing toxicity at off-target sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An example of an existing therapeutic agent that would benefit from reduced toxicity is the neuroprotective agent brain-derived neurotrophic factor33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has side effects in the normal brain, which CAQK does not target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our targeting approach has the potential of converting agents with unfavourable pharmacokinetic profile into efficient drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Oligonucleotide-based drugs are a new class of drugs with great potential but hampered by delivery problems in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An example is siRNA, a therapeutic modality with the desired characteristics of specificity and potency, but particularly difficult to deliver through systemic circulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies on siRNA therapy of brain injuries have either used direct injection into the CNS space or silenced a target present in the brain endothelial cells34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CAQK-mediated targeted delivery of siRNA reported here provides the first evidence of delivery of active siRNA into injured brain tissue from systemic circulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of targets for gene silencing (such as Bcl-2 family proteins, caspases, histone deacetylases (HDAC) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)) have been suggested for brain injury34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, CAQK-mediated siRNA delivery was accomplished by using porous nanoparticles as a carrier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, these results also open up brain injuries for nanomedicine-based therapeutic approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The discovery of CAQK has translational potential because it can direct a payload from systemic circulation to the site of acute brain injury and retain it there for therapeutically relevant timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach provides an alternative to local delivery, which is invasive and can add complications to the injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the approach could be transferable to human patients, because CAQK recognizes the human target molecule and because the expression of the target appears to be elevated in injured human brain tissues in the same way it is in the mouse injuries.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
