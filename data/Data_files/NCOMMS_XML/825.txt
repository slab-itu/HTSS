In vivo genome editing with a small Cas9 orthologue derived from Campylobacter jejuni  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Several CRISPR-Cas9 orthologues have been used for genome editing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present the smallest Cas9 orthologue characterized to date, derived from Campylobacter jejuni (CjCas9), for efficient genome editing in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After determining protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sequences and optimizing single-guide RNA (sgRNA) length, we package the CjCas9 gene, its sgRNA sequence, and a marker gene in an all-in-one adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector and produce the resulting virus at a high titer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CjCas9 is highly specific, cleaving only a limited number of sites in the human or mouse genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CjCas9, delivered via AAV, induces targeted mutations at high frequencies in mouse muscle cells or retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, CjCas9 targeted to the Vegfa or Hif1a gene in RPE cells reduces the size of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization, suggesting that in vivo genome editing with CjCas9 is a new option for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Genome editing has recently been democratized by the development of RNA-guided programmable nucleases repurposed from the type II clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) adaptive immune system against invading genetic elements in eubacteria and archaea1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cas9, the single effector protein component in the system, is complexed with CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) or with single-guide RNA (sgRNA) composed of essential portions of crRNA and tracrRNA to form a sequence-specific RNA-guided endonuclease (RGEN)2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A new RGEN with desired target specificity is readily prepared by replacing crRNA or sgRNA, which hybridizes with a target DNA sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cas9 RGENs cleave chromosomal DNA in a targeted manner, enabling genetic modifications or genome editing in cells and whole organisms3,4,5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cas9 derived from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9), the first Cas9 orthologue to enable targeted mutagenesis in human cells3,5,6,9, is still the most widely used among several Cas9 proteins available for genome editing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to it large size (1,368 amino acids, 4.10 kbp; Fig 1a), however, the SpCas9 gene and its sgRNA sequence cannot be packaged together into certain viral vectors such as adeno-associated virus (AAV)10 for efficient delivery into cells in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the SpCas9 gene alone can be packaged into a single AAV vector in vivo11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, SpCas9 can be split into two parts13,14, each can be packaged into two AAV vectors15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, split SpCas9 is less active than the intact SpCas9 (refs 13, 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, co-delivery of two AAV vectors is less efficient than the delivery of a single AAV vector in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: CjCas9 and its PAM specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Cas9 orthologues and their sgRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sgRNA structures were obtained using the mfold web server.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See also Supplementary Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Schematic showing a PAM assay for characterization of PAM sequences recognized by Cas9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR amplicons containing a Cas9 target sequence (yellow) followed by randomized 10-bp (N10) sequences (green) were cleaved by CjCas9 in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequence logo showing the PAM specificity was obtained using deep-sequencing data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) PAM specificity in cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surrogate reporters encoding GFP and RFP and containing a CjCas9 target sequence with degenerate PAMs were transfected with CjCas9 and its sgRNA plasmid into HEK 293 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentage of cells that express both GFP and RFP was normalized with that obtained using the optimal reporter containing the 5-NNNNACAC-3 PAM sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  () represents a mock control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars indicate s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (n=3).Full size image', 'As an alternative to SpCas9, Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9) can be used for genome editing17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SaCas9 is smaller (1,053 amino acids, 3.16 kbp) than SpCas9 and can be packaged, together with its sgRNA, into an AAV vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Still, the SaCas9 gene cannot be packaged with a florescent reporter gene or two sgRNAs, essential for targeted chromosomal deletions or other rearrangements, into a single AAV vector in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sequences recognized by SaCas9, 5-NNGRRT-3, occur less frequently than those recognized by SpCas9, 5-NGG-3, limiting targetable sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, smaller Cas9 orthologues with different PAM sequences are highly desired to expand in vivo genome editing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present Campylobacter jejuni-derived Cas9 (CjCas9) for efficient genome editing in vitro and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CjCas9 is composed of 984 amino-acid residues (2.95 kbp) (Supplementary Fig 1), much smaller than SpCas9 or SaCas9 (Fig 1a), but has never been shown to induce targeted mutagenesis in human or other eukaryotic cells or organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we characterized PAM sequences and optimized the sgRNA length to utilize CjCas9 for genome editing in mice.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Determination of PAM sequences recognized by CjCas9', 'First, we determined the PAM sequences recognized by CjCas9 in vitro (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A PCR amplicon library containing a CjCas9 target sequence followed by randomized 10-base pair (bp) sequences was cleaved by CjCas9 (and SpCas9 as a control) and a sgRNA specific to the target sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cleaved duplexes were subjected to deep sequencing to identify PAM sequences recognized by CjCas9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assay revealed that CjCas9 recognized 5-NNNNACAC-3 or 5-NNNNRYAC-3 (where R and Y stands for purines and pyrimidines, respectively) as PAMs in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a different in vitro assay, Fonfara et al.18 reported that the optimal PAM for CjCas9 was 5-NNNNACA-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To confirm the PAM specificity in human cells, we performed cell-based reporter assays by co-transfecting plasmids encoding CjCas9 and its sgRNA and reporter plasmids containing the target site with variable PAM sequences between RFP and GFP sequences19 (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the RFP sequence is fused to the GFP sequence out of frame in these reporter plasmids, cells express RFP but not GFP (RFP+ GFP) in the absence of CjCas9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When CjCas9 cleaves the target site and induces small insertions or deletions (indels), the GFP sequence can be fused to the RFP sequence in frame.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These reporter assays showed that CjCas9 cleaved target sites containing 5-NNNNRYAC-3 PAM sequences in HEK 293 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the cytosine nucleotide at the 3-end was essential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Optimization of CjCas9 sgRNA length', 'We next optimized the sgRNA length for CjCas9-mediated genome editing in human and mouse cells (Fig 2; Supplementary Fig 2; Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We co-transfected CjCas9 and a series of sgRNAs with variable lengths into HEK 293 cells or NIH 3T3 cells and measured indel frequencies using targeted amplicon sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first nucleotide in the sgRNAs was fixed to an extra guanine (G) because sgRNAs are transcribed under the control of the U6 promoter, which requires a guanine at the 5 end.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike SpCas9, which is most active with GX20 sgRNAs that hybridize with a 20-nucleotide target DNA sequence upstream of a PAM, CjCas9 was most active with GX22 sgRNAs that hybridize with a 22 nucleotides target sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GX20 and GX19 sgRNAs failed to induce indels at 8 out of 19 sites and 3 out of 4 sites, respectively in human or mouse cells.

sgRNAs), 5-NNNNGCAC-3 PAM (dark blue; 10 sgRNAs), and 5-NNNNGTAC-3 PAM (yellow; 8 sgRNAs) were designed and their activities examined in HEK293 cells with deep sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars

with CjCas9 were able to induce indels at frequencies that ranged from 1.0 to 64% (21±5%, on average).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CjCas9 also induced indels at sites with 5-NNNNGCAC-3 PAMs, 5-NNNNGTAC-3 PAMs, and 5-NNNNATAC-3 PAMs albeit less efficiently (10±3%, 10±4%, and 16±5%, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Genome-wide target specificities of CjCas9', 'We then determined genome-wide specificities of CjCas9 using nuclease-digested whole-genome sequencing (WGS; Digenome-seq)20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell-free genomic DNA digested with CjCas9 in vitro was subjected to WGS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Uniform cleavage patterns corresponding to on-target and off-target cleavage sites were computationally identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CjCas9 designed to target 6 different DNA regions cleaved between one and 27 sites (7±4 sites, on average) in the human or mouse genome (Fig 3ad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In parallel, we used Digenome-seq to test three SpCas9 nucleases designed to cleave sites that overlapped with CjCas9 target sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SpCas9 cleaved 15 to 147 sites (70±40 sites, on average) in the human or mouse genome, in line with our previous results showing that SpCas9 targeted to 11 different sites cleaved 90±30 sites in the human genome21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One target site in the human genome contained a 5-NGGNACAC-3 PAM recognized by both CjCas9 and SpCas9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CjCas9 and SpCas9 cleaved human genomic DNA at 5 sites and 45 sites, respectively, although the two Cas9 orthologues showed comparable indel frequencies at this particular site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the higher specificity of CjCas9 was not gained at the expense of its lower editing efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, two CjCas9 nucleases targeting the Rosa26 locus or the Vegfa gene in the mouse genome cleaved genomic DNA only at the single on-target site, reminiscent of the remarkable specificity of Cpf1 nucleases22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence logos obtained computationally by comparing in vitro cleavage sites with each other unambiguously showed that these sites contained 5-NNNNACAC-3 or 5-NNNNRYAC-3 PAMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Genome-wide target specificities of CjCas9

targeted amplicon sequencing to measure indel frequencies in human cells (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indels occurred at the on-target site but were not detectably induced at the other in vitro cleavage sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results show that CjCas9 nucleases are highly specific in human cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remarkable specificity of CjCas9 can be at least partially attributed to its extended, 22 nucleotides target and 4 nucleotides PAM sequences, compared to the 20 nucleotides target and 2 nucleotides PAM sequences recognized by SpCas9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Efficiency and specificity of CjCas9', 'We compared genome editing efficiencies and specificities of CjCas9 with those of SaCas9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose 3 overlapping sites in the human genome with 5-NNGRRTAC-3 PAM sequences, which can be targeted by both CjCas9 and SaCas9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CjCas9 and SaCas9 generated indels at these sites in HEK 293 cells with comparable frequencies of 35±7% and 36±13%, respectively (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then determined genome-wide specificities of CjCas9 and SaCas9 nucleases targeted to two of these overlapping sites using Digenome-seq (Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CjCas9 and SaCas9 targeted to the AAVS1-TS16 site cleaved human genomic DNA at 59 and 118 sites, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CjCas9 and SaCas9 targeted to the AAVS1-TS39 site were more specific than were those targeted to the TS16 site, cleaving human genomic DNA at 2 and 15 sites, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that CjCas9 targeted to the TS16 site was more efficient than SaCas9 in terms of on-target indel frequency (46% versus 28%), suggesting that the higher specificity of CjCas9 was not gained at the expense of a lower on-target efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this report, we have presented a small and highly specific Cas9 orthologue, derived from C. jejuni, that can be packaged with a reporter gene in an AAV vector for efficient gene surgery in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The small size of CjCas9, compared with other orthologues including Neisseria meningitidis Cas9 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29), Streptococcus thermophilus Cas9 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29), SpCas9 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30) and SaCas9 (refs 17, 31; Fig 1a), allows more room for additional effectors or homology arms required for homologous recombination in AAV and other animal or plant viral vectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because CjCas9 is highly specific in vitro and in vivo, we expect that it will be widely used for precision genome editing in research and gene surgery in medicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we delivered the CjCas9 gene, its sgRNA sequence, and the GFP-coding gene to mutate three genes in two different tissues, TA muscles and eyes, in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CjCas9-induced indels at high frequencies in the Vegfa and Hif1a genes in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HIF-1 is a hypoxia-inducible transcription factor that activates the transcription of VEGF A (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike VEGF A, a secretory protein and a primary therapeutic target for the treatment of AMD, HIF-1 has not been considered as a drug target: Indeed, HIF1 in particular and transcription factors in general cannot be targeted directly by antibodies or aptamers or small molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we showed that CjCas9 targeted to the Hif1a gene in mouse eyes inactivated the gene in RPE cells efficiently and reduced the area of CNV in a mouse model of AMD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the CjCas9 target site in the mouse Hif1a gene is perfectly conserved in the human HIF1A gene, the AAV presented in this study or its variants could be used for the treatment of human patients in the future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect that CjCas9 can be directed to other traditionally undruggable genes or non-coding sequences to broaden the range of therapeutic targets, making the entire human genome potentially druggable.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
