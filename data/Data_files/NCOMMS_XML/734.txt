Evenodd layer-dependent magnetotransport of high-mobility Q-valley electrons in transition metal disulfides  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In few-layer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), the conduction bands along the K directions shift downward energetically in the presence of interlayer interactions, forming six Q valleys related by threefold rotational symmetry and time reversal symmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In even layers, the extra inversion symmetry requires all states to be Kramers degenerate; whereas in odd layers, the intrinsic inversion asymmetry dictates the Q valleys to be spin-valley coupled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the transport characterization of prominent Shubnikov-de Hass (SdH) oscillations and the observation of the onset of quantum Hall plateaus for the Q-valley electrons in few-layer TMDCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Universally in the SdH oscillations, we observe a valley Zeeman effect in all odd-layer TMDC devices and a spin Zeeman effect in all even-layer TMDC devices, which provide a crucial information for understanding the unique properties of multi-valley band structures of few-layer TMDCs.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Strong spinorbit couplings in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC)1,2,3,4 entangle the spin and valley degrees of freedom of the valence band states at K valleys5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gives rise to exciting electronic and excitonic properties, such as optical circular dichroism7,8,9,10, opto-valley Hall effect11,12 and optical valley Zeeman effect13,14,15,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inversion symmetry breaking in monolayer TMDCs plays an important role in opening energy gaps at the energy range of visible lights at K valleys7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with the substantial spinorbital couplings, the broken inversion symmetry in monolayer TMDCs further splits the spin-up and spin-down bands at the valence band edge of K valleys, which is absent in any bilayer TMDC10,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The former feature leads to the optical circular dichroism and valley Hall effect, the latter feature yields the observation of optical valley Zeeman effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far, the observed moderate electron mobility in most atomically thin TMDCs has prohibited the exploration of the quantum transport properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Impurity scattering and non-ohmic contacts are two major obstacles to fabricating high-mobility TMDC-based field-effect (FE) devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several attempts have been made recently in improving the electrical contacts by, for example, using phase engineering20, graphene on MoS2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21), Pt electrodes22 or selective etching process23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we present a magnetotransport study of both even- and odd-layer TMDCs with hexagonal boron nitride (BN) encapsulated structures and metal contacts made by the selective etching process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we will show, the peculiar electronic properties can be extended from monolayer TMDCs to few-layer TMDCs, from K valleys to Q valleys24, and from optical probe to transport detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This possibility can be explicitly appreciated by comparing the quantum transport measurements in odd-layer and even-layer TMDCs, in which the essential inversion symmetry is broken and respected, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unique transport properties observed in BN-encapsulated TMDC devices provide useful information for a better understanding of the thickness dependent magnetotransport of high-mobility Q-valley electrons and the spin-valley entangled unconventional quantum Hall (QH) effects in atomically thin TMDCs.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The degeneracy of 6 arises from the degeneracy between the 3 Q and 3 Q valleys because the spin degeneracy within each Q or Q valley is already lifted by the broken inversion symmetry in an odd-layer TMDC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At relatively high magnetic fields, an LL sextet can be lifted into two LL triplets caused by the valley Zeeman effect, which is similar to the K/K valley Zeeman effects observed most recently using optical circular dichroism13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Lande factor gL can be roughly estimated using the formula gLBBc=kBTC, where B is the Bohr magneton, and BC is the lowest

(see Supplementary Fig 2a) amounting to gL3.4, which is comparable to those reported for WSe2 and MoSe2 monolayers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At relatively high gate voltages (60 and 70 V), where the Hall mobility is sufficiently high, the Zeeman effect takes place at a small strength of B field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LL triplets start to appear where the SdH oscillations emerge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The cyclotron mass of charge carriers in the 9L MoS2 device is obtained by investigating the temperature dependence of R oscillations (see Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a given EF (Vg=60 V or n=4.32 × 1012 cm2) and a given B, the R peak amplitudes (see Supplementary Fig 2b) follow the Ando formula32 .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtain m*0.27±.01me, which is smaller than the effective mass (0.5me) obtained by our density functional theory (DFT) calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on the thickness of odd-layer samples, the measured m* can vary from 0.3 to 0.4me partially due to the uncertainty of the measured temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding quantum scattering time is q=206 fs, which is much shorter than the transport scattering time t=(m*)/(R0e2n)=1,100 fs, thereby demonstrating that long-range scattering is dominant in our MoS2 sample (see Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As expected, the valley Zeeman effect can also be observed in a 3L WS2 sample (Fig 2e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After subtracting the background of the data shown in Fig 2e, we plot R as a function of B (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At high-B fields, the LLs developed from sextets to triplets, with increasing amplitudes of SdH oscillations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the ultrahigh mobility achieved in these TMDC samples even enables us to observe the onset of the QH effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2g shows the longitudinal resistance R and Hall resistance Rxy as a function of B at 2 K in a 3L MoS2 device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond 6 T, Rxy exhibits at least three well-quantized plateaus (=36, 39 and 42), and they match very well with the corresponding R valleys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in other TMDC devices with an odd number of layers, the SdH oscillations in the 3L MoS2 device clearly exhibit an LL degeneracy of 3, implying the valley Zeeman splitting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Quantum oscillations in even-layer TMDCs', 'The SdH oscillations in the representative 6L WS2 device emerge when B field is greater than 2.5 T (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the gate voltages applied (Vg=5070 V) to the 6L WS2 device are similar to those applied (Vg=40, 60 and 70 V) to the 9L MoS2 device, the period of SdH oscillations appears twice larger in the 6L WS2 device (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the experimentally accessible carrier density is low, the Fermi energy crosses only the lowest spin-degenerate sub-band at the Q/Q valleys in our calculated band structure of 6L WS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The single sub-band nature is also evidenced by the unique period in the SdH oscillations (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The linear fit of n versus BF/0 (Fig 3c) indicates a LL degeneracy of 11.8±0.1; the linear fit of the LL filling factors versus the SdH valley positions (Fig 3d) yields a zero Berry phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a large field of 6.5 T, the secondary SdH valleys and doubling of the oscillation frequency are clearly visible because of the spin Zeeman splitting of LL duodectets into LL sextets (see Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The disappearance of secondary SdH valleys at around 10 K further indicates that the Lande factor is gL2.2 (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under similar experimental conditions, the presence of SdH valleys, as a result of the complete filling of a LL duodectet or sextet, has been repeatedly observed; for example, in a 6L MoS2 device (g=12/6 at low-/high-B fields in Fig 3e,f), in a 10L WS2 device (g=12 in Fig 3g,h) and in a 10L MoS2 (g=6 in Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly,

'Materials', 'MoS2 and WS2 crystals are grown by the chemical vapour transport method reported previously34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A mixture of Mo/W and S is first annealed in a sealed quartz tube at 800 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then the polycrystalline powders together with iodine are annealed in a furnace (950 °C for the cold zone and 1,050 °C for the hot zone) for several weeks to grow large single crystals35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The as-grown 2H-type crystals are pre-examined by optical approaches before making FE transistors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The h-BN sources (Polartherm grade PT110) are bought from Momentive and annealed at a high temperature to improve the quality of BN crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Sandwiched heterostructures', 'To eliminate impurities induced during device fabrication, we employ a polymer-free dry transfer technique in an inert environment of argon or nitrogen, as schematically demonstrated in Supplementary Fig 8a,b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atomically thin flakes are mechanically exfoliated on 300 nm SiO2/Si substrates by the scotch-tape microcleavage method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A selected FL XS2 (X=Mo/W) is picked up from the SiO2/Si substrate by a thin h-BN flake (515 nm thick) on PMMA (950 A7, 500 nm) via van der Waals interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The h-BN/XS2 flake is then transferred onto a fresh thick h-BN flake at 4050 °C, which is exfoliated previously on a different SiO2/Si substrate, to form a BN-XS2-BN heterostructure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BN-XS2-BN structure and the high-temperature annealing can guarantee the stability of our XS2 devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the annealing process (conducted in Ar atmosphere above 300 °C), the small bubbles formed at the interfaces between h-BN and XS2 are largely removed and the charge trap density are largely reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Thickness determination', 'The thicknesses of XS2 flakes are characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Veeco-Innva) as illustrated in Supplementary Fig 9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured sample thicknesses dm and their numbers of layers are listed in Supplementary Table 2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Technically, the roughness of SiO2 substrate surface is 1 nm, so there is a large variance when measuring the thickness of TMDCs lying on SiO2/Si substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we use a different method to determine the sample thickness (see Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We leave a small part of WS2 uncovered (without the top BN) when making the sandwiched structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bottom BN layer provides a smooth background in the AFM signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variance of sample thickness is smaller than 0.1 nm and the accuracy of the calculated number of layers is thus ensured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Selective etching process', 'To fabricate the metal electrodes, a hard mask is patterned on the BN-XS2-BN heterostructure by the standard electron-beam (e-beam) lithography technique using PMMA 950 A5 (see Supplementary Fig 8c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the etching rate of XS2 by our reactive ion etching (CHF3:O2=4:40 s.c.c.m.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  is lower than that of h-BN, the exposed top BN layer is then etched and XS2 is partially exposed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrodes are then patterned by e-beam lithography followed by O2 plasma etching (to remove PMMA residues) and standard e-beam evaporation (Ti/Au).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1ad show the schematic and the optical images of a typical BN-XS2-BN device with Hall-bar configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the metal electrode deposition, the contact resistance is further reduced by a post annealing treatment at 300 °C in ambient pressure for 12 h.', 'Transport measurement', 'The ISDVSD curves are measured by Keithley 6430.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other transport measurements are carried out using the standard lock-in technique (SR 830 with SR550 as the preamplifier and DS 360 as the function generator) in a cryogenic system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cryogenic system provides stable temperatures ranging from 1.8 to 300 K and magnetic fields up to 9 T. For comparison, the MoS2 device with graphene electrodes are fabricated and the device shows a complicated feature (see Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our MoS2 FE transistors connected by standard metal electrodes produce clean data which can be explained by DFT calculations fairly well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since we use the same quality of MoS2 channel material to fabricate these two kinds of devices, we conclude that MoS2-graphene-mixed devices always display complicated oscillations of magnetotransport which cannot be understood yet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'The data that support the findings of this study are available from the authors upon request.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
