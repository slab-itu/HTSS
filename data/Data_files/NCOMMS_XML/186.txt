Reversal of axonal growth defects in an extraocular fibrosis model by engineering the kinesinmicrotubule interface  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mutations in human 3-tubulin (TUBB3) cause an ocular motility disorder termed congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 3 (CFEOM3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In CFEOM3, the oculomotor nervous system develops abnormally due to impaired axon guidance and maintenance; however, the underlying mechanism linking TUBB3 mutations to axonal growth defects remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we investigate microtubule (MT)-based motility in vitro using MTs formed with recombinant TUBB3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the disease-associated TUBB3 mutations R262H and R262A impair the motility and ATPase activity of the kinesin motor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Engineering a mutation in the L12 loop of kinesin surprisingly restores a normal level of motility and ATPase activity on MTs carrying the R262A mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in a CFEOM3 mouse model expressing the same mutation, overexpressing the suppressor mutant kinesin restores axonal growth in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these findings establish the critical role of the TUBB3-R262 residue for mediating kinesin interaction, which in turn is required for normal axonal growth and brain development.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Microtubules (MTs), polymers of /-tubulin heterodimers, play critical roles in the developing nervous system1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several distinct - and -tubulin isotypes are found in mammalian brain, and their tightly controlled spatiotemporal expression is essential for brain formation and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each tubulin isotype plays a specific role, and accordingly, mutations in tubulin genes are linked to neurological diseases with distinct phenotypes in an isotype-specific manner3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Among the six -tubulin isotypes expressed in the mammalian brain, class-III -tubulin (TUBB3) is unique in its expression pattern in the nervous system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TUBB3 is primarily limited to neurons6, and confers a highly dynamic property to MTs compared with other -tubulin isotypes7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the neuronal expression level of TUBB3 is highest during the period of axon outgrowth and is reduced in the adult central nervous system, suggesting that the dynamic property of TUBB3 is important for aspects of nervous system development8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The uniqueness of TUBB3 is underscored by the fact that TUBB3s function cannot be replaced by other -tubulin isotypes, not even by TUBB2, despite the 90% sequence identity between these two isotypes9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The class-III tubulin diverged from the common ancestor of class II, III and IV -tubulins when vertebrates emerged; since then, this particular isotype has maintained 99% sequence identity across vertebrate species8 (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the unique properties of TUBB3 critically depends on its exact sequence, and mutations in TUBB3 in humans are associated with a spectrum of brain malformation and neurological disorders9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, eight heterozygous missense mutations in human TUBB3 are reported to cause congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 3 (CFEOM3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients show hypoplasia of the oculomotor nerves and dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, anterior commissure and corticospinal tracts11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These defects point to an essential function for TUBB3 in the processes of axonal outgrowth and maintenance during development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A subset of the TUBB3 mutations causing CFEOM3 (R262C/H, E410K and D417H/N) has been studied in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where the mutant -tubulins were found to impair the MT interaction with Kip3p and Kip2p kinesins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, axonal growth defects in patients may likely result from compromised kinesinMT interactions11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, although the involvement of TUBB3 acidic residues E410 and D417 in kinesinMT interaction is supported by both in vitro and in vivo observations12,13, the involvement of basic residue R262 is uncertain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, a recent study in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons found no effect of the R262C mutation on KIF5B- or KIF21A-dependent transport13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The kinesinMT interactions are primarily dependent on the interactions between the acidic residues in tubulin and the basic residues in kinesin14,15,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residue R262 has been neglected in these analyses because of its positive charge and its location in the H8-S7 loop, which is outside the C-terminal hairpin structures of - and -tubulin (H11H11H12) where other critical acidic residues reside (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the R262 mutation is the most common mutation in patients with CFEOM3, delineating its role in kinesin motility is essential for understanding the disease mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: The position of residue -R262 in the structure of tubulin dimer and in its amino-acid sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Distribution of the residues involved in the interaction with kinesin on tubulin dimer (on face view of the MT; PDB: 1JFF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alanine-scanning mutagenesis analysis of tubulin identified six acidic residues (red spheres) in the C-terminal hairpin structures (H11H11H12) of - and -tubulin (green) as critical for the interaction with kinesin17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The basic residue -R262 addressed in this paper (blue spheres) is located in the H8-S7 loop of -tubulin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Alignment of the sequences of human (Hs) TUBB3, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) TUB2, and pig (Ss) -tubulin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For pig tubulin, sequence numbering used in the PDB 1JFF was adopted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The positions of the secondary structure elements are indicated, and the labelled residues correspond to those shown in a with the same colour scheme.Full size image', 'A better understanding of whether and how R262 is involved in the kinesin interaction warrants a detailed examination of the effect of TUBB3 mutations on kinesin motility in a cell-free system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, such an analysis has been hampered by a lack of methods to purify recombinant TUBB3 tubulin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome this issue, we have recently developed a method to express and purify the heterodimer of human TUBA1B (-tubulin) and TUBB3 tubulin using a baculovirus-insect cell expression system19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, using this new method, we demonstrate that TUBB3 R262H and R262A mutations inhibit the motility of kinesin in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduced turnover rate of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis (kcat) indicates that the interaction via the R262 residue is critical for triggering ADP release from kinesins nucleotide pocket.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with this interpretation, the crystal structure of the kinesintubulin complex in its nucleotide-free state reveals that the R262 in tubulin binds with the D279 in the L12 loop of kinesin, which then connects to an element in the switch I/II subdomains20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With these biochemical and structural data, we sought a kinesin mutant that could bypass the effects of the TUBB3 R262A mutation and move on the mutant MT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did indeed find one: in a proof-of-principle experiment, expressing this mutant kinesin in a mouse CFEOM3 disease model by in utero electroporation rescued axonal growth in the developing brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, our findings establish that disruption of kinesinMT interactions is a major cause for axonal growth defects in CFEOM3 patients.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'-R262A mutation inhibits motility and ATPase activity', 'We used a baculovirus/insect cell expression system to express and purify the following three types of recombinant tubulin dimers composed of human 1-and 3-tubulin (TUBA1B and TUBB3, respectively): wild type (WT), R262C and R262H (Supplementary Fig 2a)19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare our results with those from previously reported charged-to-alanine tubulin mutants12,17, the TUBB3 R262A mutant was also expressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The WT, R262H and R262A tubulins were purified using His and FLAG tags and polymerized into MTs (Supplementary Fig 2b), but the yield of R262C tubulin was too low for use in biochemistry experiments due to the low solubility of the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the single-molecule motility assays using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, the two-headed KIF5B motor (human KIF5B construct HK432 at a concentration of 0.4 nM) did not bind to R262H or R262A MTs (Fig 2a; Table 1), while it did move on the WT MTs at a velocity of 0.57±0.19 m s1 (mean±s.d., N=480).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the former cases, the kinesin scarcely bound to the mutant MTs even when the kinesin concentration was raised to 20 nM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in MT-gliding assays using native KIF5, R262H and R262A MTs could not move on the kinesin-coated glass surface, while WT MTs moved at a velocity of 0.65±0.08 m s1 (mean±s.d., N=120).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the R262 residue in TUBB3 is critical for kinesinMT interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Effect of tubulin mutations -R262H and -R262A on single-molecule motility and MT-activated ATPase activity of the KIF5B motor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Kymographs of kinesin motility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Horizontal bar, 5 m; vertical arrow, 10 s.

it could not move on -E410A MTs, which was previously shown to be critical for kinesin motility12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these results demonstrated that the mutation D279R, but not D279N, recovered the motility of KIF5B on R262A MTs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also investigated whether the mutation D279R can recover the motility of KIF5B on R262H MTs, but the motility was not restored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Along with motility, the D279R KIF5B mutation showed enhanced ATPase activity by R262A MTs (Fig 3e;

Supplementary Fig 3; Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though the affinity did not fully recover in the paired mutant combinations, the D279R mutation was highly effective in suppressing the R262A mutation effect, considering the large increase in Kd values brought about by the R262A mutation (6-, 70- and 90-fold increase in the ADP, nucleotide-free and AMPPNP states, respectively, as compared with the WTWT pair).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The mutant kinesin rescues axonal growth defects', 'In light of the axonal growth defects in patients with CFEOM3 that result from mutations at R262, we next examined whether D279R kinesin rescued such defects in cultured neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dissociated neurons from embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5) cerebral cortices were transfected with plasmids encoding WT, R262H or R262A TUBB3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a 72- h culture, the lengths of the tau-1-positive axons in the cortical neurons were examined by immunocytochemistry (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the control cells that were transfected with WT TUBB3, the transfection of R262H and R262A TUBB3 perturbed the growth of axons, resulting in 20% reductions in axon length (mean±s.e.m., 42.5±2.2, 32.7±1.6 and 34.5±1.9 m for the WT, R262H and R262A TUBB3, respectively;

'To date, there has been no evidence for a basic tubulin residue playing a critical role in kinesin-based motility12,13,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a recent study in yeast showed that introducing the CFEOM3-associated mutation of the TUBB3 basic residue (R262C or R262H) to the yeast TUB2 gene blocked Kip3p accumulation at MT plus-ends11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether this basic residue mutation could inhibit the in vitro motility of kinesin when expressed in TUBB3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analyses revealed that the R262H or R262A mutations in TUBB3 impaired kinesin motility and the MT-activated ATPase of a two-headed KIF5B motor (Fig 2; Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to an earlier study that reported a low yield of R262C tubulin in rabbit reticulocytes11, the poor yield of R262C TUBB3 prevented us from examining its effects on motility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the observation in yeast cells that both R262C and R262H mutations decreased Kip3p accumulation on the plus end of MTs indicated that R262C might impair kinesin motility if tested in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Having established the importance of the basic residue -R262 in kinesin motility, our next questions were which residues of kinesin interact with -R262 and how does this interaction contribute to the kinesinMT interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A drastic reduction in kcat by -R262H or -R262A mutations indicates that -R262 might play a crucial role in mediating the structural signals required for ATPase activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It contrasts with the role of the critical acidic residues in -tubulin (-E410 and -D417) that increase the affinity of kinesin to MT (K0.5MT) without affecting kcat (Supplementary Table 1)17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the crystal structure of the kinesintubulin complex and the model of the kinesinMT complex based on cryo-EM images20,26,27, -R262 is a binding partner for D279 in the kinesin L12 loop in the nucleotide-free and ATP-bound states (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon MT binding, the rearrangement of salt bridges near this pair may contribute to the conformational change in kinesin, leading to ADP release from the nucleotide pocket20,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequence of the L12 loop and the adjacent 5 helix is highly conserved in kinesin, indicating the importance of this region in its function (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Earlier work using alanine-scanning mutagenesis of kinesin showed that while the residue substitution at D279 reduced the value of ATPase K0.5MT to about half of that of the WT, the substitution in the adjacent R278 resulted in a more than 15-fold increase in this value (Supplementary Table 1)14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter 15-fold increase is outstanding, given that residue substitutions in all other kinesin sites brought at most only a fourfold increase in K0.5MT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This outstanding impact of R278A mutation in kinesin is comparable to the 10-fold increase in K0.5MT by the R262A tubulin mutation (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Such similarly potent effects of kinesin R278A and tubulin R262A on K0.5MT values, and the close proximity of these two residues in three-dimensional space, suggest the possibility that -R262 in tubulin may interact with D279 in the L12 loop of kinesin, and thereby mediate the encounter of adjacent R278 to its binding partner (presumably D417 in the H12 helix of -tubulin) (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, because the MT is highly negatively charged, before (or concomitant with) binding with kinesin R278, the negative charge of D279 in the kinesin may need to be neutralized by electropositive -R262 on the MT; otherwise, the D279 of kinesin and the D417 and/or E421 of -tubulin will repel each other and prevent R278s access to the MT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis is consistent with the local structural change at the binding interface, as shown in the models of kinesinMT complexes15,27,28 and molecular dynamics simulations29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Schematic working model for the electrostatic latch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ac) Possible models for kinesinMT interactions in the WT KIF5BWT MT pair (a), D279R KIF5B--R262A MT pair (b) and D279N KIF5B--R262A MT pair (c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Red-, blue- and grey-filled circles represent basic, acidic and neutral residues in kinesin, respectively, whereas red, blue and grey unfilled circles represent basic, acidic and non-polar residues in tubulin, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dotted and thick lines indicate electrostatic attraction and the salt bridge, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Location of the residues D279 and R262 shown in the structure of KIF5B (top) and tubulin (bottom), based on the crystal structure of the KIF5Btubulin complex in the nucleotide-free state20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Three-dimensional isopotential contours for the KIF5B (top) and tubulin (bottom), calculated from the interface shown in d.
