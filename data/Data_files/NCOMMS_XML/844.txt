Wafer-scale two-dimensional semiconductors from printed oxide skin of liquid metals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A variety of deposition methods for two-dimensional crystals have been demonstrated; however, their wafer-scale deposition remains a challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we introduce a technique for depositing and patterning of wafer-scale two-dimensional metal chalcogenide compounds by transforming the native interfacial metal oxide layer of low melting point metal precursors (group III and IV) in liquid form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an oxygen-containing atmosphere, these metals establish an atomically thin oxide layer in a self-limiting reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The layer increases the wettability of the liquid metal placed on oxygen-terminated substrates, leaving the thin oxide layer behind.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of liquid gallium, the oxide skin attaches exclusively to a substrate and is then sulfurized via a relatively low temperature process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By controlling the surface chemistry of the substrate, we produce large area two-dimensional semiconducting GaS of unit cell thickness (1.5 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presented deposition and patterning method offers great commercial potential for wafer-scale processes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Two-dimensional (2D) materials present many promising avenues for future technologies due to their remarkable characteristics1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2D semiconductors, the most common of which are transition metal dichalcogenides, have recently attracted significant attention, particularly in electronic and optical device fabrication1,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial step in fabricating such devices is the formation of the 2D sheet on a chosen substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many methods have been proposed for the synthesis of 2D materials including exfoliation of flakes from a layered bulk2,5 followed by depositing the obtained flakes on a desired substrate, as well as chemical vapour deposition6,7 and atomic layer deposition8 techniques for directly growing 2D layers on substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, large-scale, high-quality and homogeneous deposition of such 2D sheets has proven to be a major challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far, only one report has addressed the wafer-scale homogeneity for the deposition of MoS2 using a metalorganic chemical vapour-based technique9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the temperatures used are above 550 °C that is incompatible with many electronic industry processes and, more negatively, the deposition process takes many hours that significantly adds to the cost and practicality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Among the family of 2D materials, semiconductors based on post-transition metals of group III and VI elements have been scarcely explored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This family typically exists in the monochalcogenide form of MX, where M=Ga, In and X=S, Se, Te, with further stoichiometries based on higher oxidation states also reported10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A representative example of this family is gallium (II) sulfide (GaS) that has a hexagonal crystal structure with a unit cell of a=b=3.587 Å, c=15.492 Å (c is equal to two fundamental layers of GaS; Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2D GaS has been recently explored for applications in transistors10, energy storage12, optoelectronics13, gas sensing14 and nonlinear optics15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: GaS representation and printing process of the 2D layers.Stick-and-ball representation of GaS crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Side view of bilayer GaS, showing a unit cell c=15.492 Å made of two GaS layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Top view of the GaS crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GaS crystal lattice is composed of GaGa and GaS covalent bonds that extend in two dimensions, forming a stratified crystal made of planes that are held together by van der Waals attractions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ga atoms are green and the S atoms are blue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c,d) Functionalization of the substrate with FDTES changes the contact angle between a Ga drop and the substrate by 12.9°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SiO2 substrate becomes more hydrophobic and thus resists wetting by liquid Ga.

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Deposition method', 'In this work, liquid Ga is placed on a SiO2/Si substrate (as shown in Fig 1eh and described in the Methods section), leaving an atomically thin-cracked layer of gallium oxide behind, upon removal of the liquid metal (Supplementary Fig 1 in the Supplementary Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selective area deposition of gallium oxide is achieved by selective treatment of the substrate using 1h1h2h2hperflourodecyltriethoxysilane (FDTES), as shown in Fig 1e,f, resulting in nonwettable regions on the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The treated areas of the substrate prohibit the adhesion of the 2D gallium oxide layer (Fig 1g), effectively facilitating selected area deposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The printed pattern is found to be visible by eye due to interference effects (Fig 1g inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A hydrochloric acid (HCl) vapour treatment (Fig 1h) is used as an intermediary step between patterned oxide deposition and sulfurization of the oxide (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HCl vapour transforms the thin gallium oxide layer into primarily GaCl3 (refs 27, 30), aiding subsequent sulfurization via two means.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, gallium oxide is chemically inert and its direct sulfurization requires high temperatures (900 °C) together with exposure to toxic H2S gas24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduced process temperature is highly advantageous since it allows the inclusion of a broad range of substrates, including certain polymers and glasses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the temperature used herein during sulfurization is still higher than the melting point of the halide, thus encouraging efficient recrystallization and continuity in the resultant 2D layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eventually, sulfurization of GaCl3 (Fig 1h) is conducted at low temperature (300 °C) that is compatible with existing electronic device processing standards.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process can be extended to forming other 2D PTMCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An example for depositing atomically thin In2S3 is also presented in Supplementary Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Structure and morphology', 'X-ray diffraction (XRD) is utilized to assess the obtained phase and phase purity of the sulfurized few-layer films (several layers of GaS are sequentially printed to increase the XRD signal intensity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The XRD patterns shown in Fig 2a present GaS peaks, and the lack of peaks from other stoichiometries (for example, Ga2S3) demonstrate that the synthesized film has a stratified structure and the desired monosulfide phase10,11,13,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Raman spectroscopy (Fig 2b) conducted on a single printed film reveals the characteristic features of a few-layer thick GaS, including the A11g (187.5 cm1), A12g (374.8 cm1) and E12g (303.75 cm1) vibrational peaks, matching those reported previously11,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed relative intensity of the phonon peaks between the out-of-plane (A11g, A12g) and in-plane (E12g) vibrations of 0.25 and 0.56 for A11g/E12g and A12g/E12g, respectively, are uniquely associated with bilayer GaS13,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) further confirms the stoichiometry of the printed layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main Ga 3d peaks (Fig 2c) are associated with stoichiometric GaS (Ga2+), with minor contributions from Ga at other oxidation states such as Ga0 and Ga3+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The S 2p and Ga 3s peaks (Fig 2d) as well as analysis of the Cl 2p and O 1s ranges (Supplementary Fig 3) further confirm the stoichiometry of the 2D material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure

XPS analysis of the printed 2D GaOx and GaCl3 are shown in Supplementary Fig 4.Full size image', 'Atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig 3a,b) reveals that the films have a thickness of 1.5 nm, corresponding to two layers of GaS, in good agreement with the Raman spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The surface of the 2D film is also shown to be atomically smooth (Supplementary Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-resolution transmission electron microcsopy (TEM) (Fig 3f) shows a lattice spacing of 3.1 Å that correlates to the 101 plane of GaS31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confocal PL microscopy (Fig 3d) verifies that the GaS has been successfully patterned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This PL is only seen after sulfurization (Fig 3ce).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PL has two major components centred at 393 and 641 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peak at 393 nm is due to the direct bandgap recombination at the  point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The energy difference associated with this peak is in excellent agreement with our density functional theory (DFT Methods section) band structure calculations of bilayer GaS (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, defects in GaS crystals are known to produce deep trap recombination states32 that are associated with the 641 nm peak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the main outcomes of this work is the deposition of patterned 2D GaS displaying near-uniform PL on a large scale with consistent PL

effect transistors (FETs) are developed via the deposition of tungsten (W) electrodes before deposition of Ga (Fig 6a,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  W is chosen as an electrode material for several reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, Ga does not amalgamate with W as it does with many other metals35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, W readily forms WS2 under the same conditions that we use for sulfurizing the gallium oxide layer (Fig 6b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WS2 is known to act as a hole injector that can be used to overcome the Schottky barrier36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A maximum electron mobility of 0.2 cm2 V1 s1 is

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'This paper describes a printing method that allows the selective patterning of atomically thin semiconducting layers of 2D PTMCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The process relies on the efficient transformation of an ultra-thin oxide layer on the surface of liquid elemental gallium onto an oxide-coated substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low temperature sulfurization leads to the formation of highly uniformly distributed semiconducting GaS bilayers of 1.5 nm thickness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are several advantages of this method including the relative simplicity and low temperature, cost effectiveness and scalability of the process (a comparative assessment is presented in Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method is compatible with well-established industry processes, and offers etchless patterning and deposition of 2D semiconductors on a wafer scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we demonstrate the development of electronic and optical devices based on 2D GaS, with the performance better than or comparable to previous reports on exfoliated GaS layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process for printing 2D semiconductors, which can be extended to the deposition of other 2D PTMCs, will provide a new paradigm for future electronics, optics, optoelectronics, sensors and other devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This work can be possibly expanded to create other types of 2D metal compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gallium can alloy a large number of different metals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, the self-limiting oxide layer can be tuned depending on the type and concentration of the alloyed metal, allowing the possibility of printing a large variety of pure and mixed oxides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2D oxides can be deposited and patterned on wafer scale and chalcogenetated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that gallium (or many other low melting liquid metals) can be potentially used as a reaction media to establish desired 2D metal-based compounds that should be further investigated.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
