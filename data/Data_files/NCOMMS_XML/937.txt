PNPLA1 is a transacylase essential for the generation of the skin barrier lipid -O-acylceramide  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Lipids are the primary components of the skin permeability barrier, which is the bodys most powerful defensive mechanism against pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acylceramide (-O-acylceramide) is a specialized lipid essential for skin barrier formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we identify PNPLA1 as the long-sought gene involved in the final step of acylceramide synthesis, esterification of -hydroxyceramide with linoleic acid, by cell-based assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that increasing triglyceride levels by overproduction of the diacylglycerol acyltransferase DGAT2 stimulates acylceramide production, suggesting that triglyceride may act as a linoleic acid donor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the in vitro analyses confirm that PNPLA1 catalyses acylceramide synthesis using triglyceride as a substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutant forms of PNPLA1 found in patients with ichthyosis exhibit reduced or no enzyme activity in either cell-based or in vitro assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, our results indicate that PNPLA1 is directly involved in acylceramide synthesis as a transacylase, and provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms of skin barrier formation and of ichthyosis pathogenesis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The body surface epidermis forms a permeability barrier, which has essential roles in protecting terrestrial animals from invasion of pathogens and harmful substances such as allergens and pollutants as well as from internal water loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, several cutaneous disorderssuch as ichthyosis, atopic dermatitis, infectious diseases and dry skinare characterized by alterations or defects of this skin barrier1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The principal compound family in the skin permeability barrier is lipids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lipids form multi-layered structures (lipid lamellae) extracellularly in the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of epidermis, and their high hydrophobicity inhibits the invasion of external materials and water loss from inside the body1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To carry out this special, barrier-creation function, lipid lamellae contain unusual lipids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately half of stratum corneum lipids are ceramide, which is the backbone of sphingolipids, and epidermis-specific ceramide species such as acylceramide (-O-acylceramide) exist3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acylceramide is especially important for skin barrier formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of acylceramide due to mutations in acylceramide synthesis genes leads to autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) in humans and neonatal lethality in mouse models, where gene loss causes similar skin barrier defects as in humans7,8,9,10,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ichthyosis is characterized by dry, thickened and scaly skin, and the skin barrier defect in ARCI is the most severe among several types of ichthyoses12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The structure of acylceramide is quite unique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although normal ceramides contain two hydrophobic chains, a long-chain base and a fatty acid (FA) with carbon chain-length of C1624 (refs 6, 14), acylceramide has an additional hydrophobic chain, linoleic acid (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the chain-length of the FA moiety is extremely long (C28C36) (refs 15, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, acylceramide is one of the most hydrophobic lipids in mammalian bodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The characteristic structure of acylceramide plays a pivotal role in organizing lipid lamellae17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, acylceramide is also important as a precursor of protein-bound ceramide, which connects lipid lamellae and corneocytes18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: PNPLA1 is involved in acylceramide synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Structure of acylceramide and genes involved in its synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AcylCer, acylceramide;

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'PNPLA1 is involved in acylceramide production', 'To identify the acyltransferase or transacylase involved in acylceramide production, a proper assay system that can detect its activity or product is necessary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the prior lack of such assay systems meant there was no way of identifying the responsible acyltransferase/transacylase for a long time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell-based assays had been unsuccessful, since most mammalian cells cannot produce ULC -hydroxyceramides, the precursors of acylceramides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we recently established a cell system that produces ULC -hydroxyceramides by overproducing the FA elongase ELOVL4, the ceramide synthase CERS3 and the FA -hydroxylase CYP4F22 in HEK 293T cells13, opening the door to identify the acyltransferase/transacylase of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this cell system, when lipids prepared from HEK 293T cells labelled with 3Hsphingosine, the sphingolipid precursor, were separated by normal phase thin layer chromatography (TLC), only long-chain (LC; C11C20) and VLC ceramides were detected as ceramide species (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of CERS3 and ELOVL4 caused cells to produce ULC ceramides, and further co-overproduction of CYP4F22 leads to production of ULC -hydroxyceramides, as we have described previously13 (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this cell system, we examined the involvement of several candidate genes in acylceramide production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The selected candidate genes were ABHD5 (/ hydrolase domain containing 5)/CGI-58 (comparative gene identification-58), LIPN (lipase, family member N), PNPLA1, PLA2G15 (phospholipase A2, group XV)/LLPL (lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase-like lysophospholipase), LCAT (lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase) and DGAT2 (diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ABHD5 is a causative gene of ChanarinDorfman syndrome (also known as neutral lipid storage disease with ichthyosis (NLSD-I)), an autosomal recessive disease accompanied by ichthyosis, steatosis and other symptoms26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LIPN and PNPLA1 are ARCI-causative genes12,24,25,27, but their roles in skin barrier formation have not yet been revealed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reasoning that since ABHD5, LIPN and PNPLA1 contain phospholipase/hydrolase domains and some proteins containing such domains act as acyltransferases or transacylases28, we chose them as candidates for acylceramide synthetic acyltransferases/transacylases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PLA2G15 has been implicated in the synthesis of 1-O-acylceramide, another type of acylceramide with unknown function29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined the possibility that PLA2G15 (and its homologue LCAT) is also involved in acylceramide (-O-acylceramide) synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DGAT2 encodes a diacylglycerol acyltransferase, and Dgat2 knockout mice exhibit a skin-barrier-defect phenotype30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Expression of PNPLA1 caused acylceramide production, while that of ABHD5, LIPN, PLA2G15 or LCAT had no effect (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of DGAT2 also caused acylceramide synthesis, albeit weakly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DGAT2 is involved in TG synthesis30,31, suggesting that TGs are somehow involved in acylceramide production, perhaps as a linoleic acid donor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To discriminate whether the produced acylceramide was -O-acylceramide or 1-O-acylceramide, we next performed the 3Hsphingosine labelling assay in the presence or absence of the FA -hydroxylase CYP4F22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acylceramide production induced by PNPLA1 and by DGAT2 expression was CYP4F22-dependent in both cases (Fig 1c): in other words, it was FA -hydroxylation-dependent, indicating that the produced acylceramide was -O-acylceramide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis revealed that acylceramides with carbon chain-length of C2836, mainly C3036, were produced by expression of PNPLA1 and DGAT2 (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PNPLA1 and DGAT2 expression increased acylceramide levels by 7.6- or 3.8-fold compared to control, respectively (Fig 1d, inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To confirm that PNPLA1 is indeed involved in acylceramide production, we performed knockdown analysis using human keratinocytes and a lentiviral vector-encoding shRNA system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection with a lentivirus bearing the shRNA specific for PNPLA1 (shPNPLA1) caused a large decrease in PNPLA1 mRNA levels compared with the control (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3HSphingosine labelling experiments revealed that differentiated keratinocytes treated with control shRNA generated acylceramide and its derivative acyl-glucosylceramide (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of keratinocytes with shPNPLA1 caused large decreases in acylceramide/acyl-glucosylceramide levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LC-MS/MS analysis confirmed that acylceramide levels were decreased by shPNPLA1 treatment, irrespective of chain-lengths (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total acylceramide levels in shPNPLA1-treated cells were 7.1% of those in control shRNA-treated cells (Fig 2c, inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that PNPLA1 is indeed involved in acylceramide production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Knockdown of PNPLA1 causes impairment of acylceramide production.Keratinocytes were infected with lentivirus harbouring control shRNA or shPNPLA1 and were differentiated for 7 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Total RNAs prepared from differentiated keratinocytes were subjected to RT-PCR using primers specific for PNPLA1 and GAPDH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Uncropped scanned photographs of the electrocataphoresis gels are provided as Supplementary Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Cells were labelled with 3Hsphingosine for 6 h at 37 °C in the presence of 10 M linoleic acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lipids were extracted, separated by normal-phase TLC and detected by autoradiography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AcylCer, acylceramide;

'Over 30 years have passed since acylceramide and acyl-glucosylceramide were discovered and their structures determined36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the synthetic genes of acylceramide remained unclear for a long time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There had long been only limited knowledge about candidate genes involved in acylceramide production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recent determination of ichthyosis-causative genes gave a clue to the identification of acylceramide synthetic genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the ichthyosis-causative genes CERS3, ELOVL4 and CYP4F22 are all involved in acylceramide production8,9,10,13,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we recently succeeded in establishing a cell system to produce ULC -hydroxyceramide, the substrate of acylceramide, by overproducing CERS3, ELOVL4 and CYP4F22 in HEK 293T cells13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this system again here, we revealed that the ARCI-causative gene PNPLA1 is involved in acylceramide production (Fig 1bd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we demonstrated that PNPLA1 catalyses the transacylation of the linoleic acid portion of TG to ULC -hydroxyceramide for acylceramide production in vitro (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Murakami and his colleagues reached the same conclusion using Pnpla1 knockout mice38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their mice exhibited neonatal lethality due to skin barrier defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acylceramide was not produced in Pnpla1 knockout mice, but its substrate ULC -hydroxyceramide accumulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the preparation of our manuscript, similar in vivo results were also reported by another group39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In that study, decreases in acylceramide levels in the differentiated keratinocytes from an ARCI patient were also reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking our cell-assay-based and biochemical in vitro results with the in vivo results from the two groups, we conclude that PNPLA1 plays an essential role in the final step of acylceramide production, esterification of ULC -hydroxyceramide with linoleic acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to PNPLA1, overproduction of the diacylglycerol acyltransferase DGAT2 also caused an increase in acylceramide levels in our cell system, although the effect was weaker than PNPLA1 (Fig 1bd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since DGAT2 is involved in TG synthesis30, it is likely that an increase in the levels of TG, as the substrate of PNPLA1, by overproduction of DGAT2 (Fig 3) indirectly enhances acylceramide production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dgat2 knockout mice exhibit a skin-barrier-defect phenotype30, although the mechanism remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From our results, we speculate that the decreased TG causes impairment of acylceramide synthesis, leading to the skin barrier defect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'PNPLA1 is known as an ARCI-causative gene24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it was previously unclear by what mechanism PNPLA1 mutations cause ARCI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we revealed that the PNPLA1 mutant proteins exhibited weak or no acylceramide production activity (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our results suggest that the pathology of ARCI associated with PNPLA1 mutation is caused by reduced acylceramide levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar correlations among ichthyosis pathology, enzyme activities and acylceramide levels have been observed for ARCI caused by CERS3 and CYP4F22 mutations as well10,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results indicate that PNPLA1 is the transacylase that acts at the final step of acylceramide production, esterification between ULC -hydroxyceramide and linoleic acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since acylceramide is essential to maintain skin barrier integrity, our findings constitute important information by which we can understand the molecular mechanisms behind skin barrier formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At present, there are no therapeutic agents for the causal treatment of ichthyosis or atopic dermatitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms behind skin barrier formation may lead to the development of such new therapeutic medicines.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
