Two-step photon up-conversion solar cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Reducing the transmission loss for below-gap photons is a straightforward way to break the limit of the energy-conversion efficiency of solar cells (SCs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The up-conversion of below-gap photons is very promising for generating additional photocurrent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we propose a two-step photon up-conversion SC with a hetero-interface comprising different bandgaps of Al0.3Ga0.7As and GaAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The below-gap photons for Al0.3Ga0.7As excite GaAs and generate electrons at the hetero-interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The accumulated electrons at the hetero-interface are pumped upwards into the Al0.3Ga0.7As barrier by below-gap photons for GaAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Efficient two-step photon up-conversion is achieved by introducing InAs quantum dots at the hetero-interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe not only a dramatic increase in the additional photocurrent, which exceeds the reported values by approximately two orders of magnitude, but also an increase in the photovoltage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the two-step photon up-conversion SC has a high potential for implementation in the next-generation high-efficiency SCs.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'High-efficiency photovoltaics using n-i-p semiconductor solar cells (SCs) are very promising for generating electrical power by utilizing solar radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conversion efficiency of single-junction SCs is limited to 30% of the so-called ShockleyQueisser limit owing to unavoidable losses, such as transmission loss, thermalization loss, Carnot loss, Boltzmann loss and emission loss1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the main factors influencing this efficiency limitation are the transmission loss of below-gap photons and the thermalization of photogenerated carriers towards the band edge2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below-bandgap photons with energy smaller than the bandgap of SC are not absorbed and do not contribute to create carriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many efforts have been made to realize high-efficiency SCs by breaking the conversion limit and several concepts have been proposed to improve the efficiency3,4,5,6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One promising SC is the intermediate-band SC (IBSC) containing an additional parallel diode connection, which can reduce the transmission loss5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IBSC includes intermediate states in the bandgap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By absorbing a below-gap photon, an electron transits from the valence band (VB) to the intermediate band (IB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon absorbing another below-gap photon, the electron is further excited into the conduction band (CB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This two-step photon up-conversion (TPU) process following the absorption of two below-gap photons produces additional photocurrent without degrading the photovoltage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to ideal theoretical predictions, the IBSC is expected to exhibit extremely high conversion efficiency,  greater than 60%, under the maximum concentration and 48.2% under one-sun irradiation5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Substantial progress has been made in this field10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27 since Luque and Martí have proposed this concept of IBSC in 1997 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generally, the absorption strength of the intraband transition from the IB to the CB is very weak14,15,16 and the energy relaxation of the excited electrons into the IB is fast17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, improving the second-excitation efficiency in the TPU process strongly influences the conversion efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optical selection rule for light irradiating the SC surface is relaxed by designing the electronic properties of the quantized states in low-dimensional structures, such as quantum dots (QDs)19 and impurities20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Obviously, carriers in the IB that have long lifetimes have a greater capacity to improve the TPU efficiency because the absorption coefficient between the CB and IB is proportional to the electron density in the initial state of the intraband transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the application of an additional infrared (IR) light corresponding to 40 suns has been observed to improve the external quantum efficiency (EQE) by  less_than 0.5% (refs 21, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The further enhancement of TPU is essential to accomplish high conversion efficiency above 50% under sunlight concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'TPU has been known to occur at the hetero-interfaces between III and V semiconductors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extensive studies have been conducted on photoluminescence up-conversion phenomena28,29,30,31,32,33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, Sellers et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  have proposed a SC structure which attempts optical up-conversion in electrically isolated up-conversion layers35,36, where high-energy photons emitted by radiative recombination of up-converted electron and hole in the up-conversion layers are absorbed in a SC stacked on it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we propose a TPU-SC with a hetero-interface, where up-converted electrons are directly collected by the top electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate an enhancement of the photovoltage as well as a dramatic increase in the photocurrent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This enhancement indicates that the quasi-Fermi gap widens according to the electron excitation into Al0.3Ga0.7As.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Concept of two-step photon up-conversion solar cell', 'We propose a simple structure with a hetero-interface that demonstrates the concept of the TPU-SC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the TPU is effectively realized at a hetero-interface comprising different bandgaps of III-V semiconductors instead of one IB in the bandgap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1a,b illustrate the schematic band diagram of the proposed TPU-SC with a diode structure of n-Al0.3Ga0.7As/Al0.3Ga0.7As/GaAs/p-GaAs on a p+-GaAs(001) substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single InAs QD layer capped by 10 nm GaAs was inserted just below the Al0.3Ga0.7As layer to improve the TPU efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed device structure is described in the Methods section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, sunlight irradiates the n-Al0.3Ga0.7As side (left-hand side of Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-energy photons are absorbed in the Al0.3Ga0.7As layer, and excited electrons and holes drift in opposite directions towards n-Al0.3Ga0.7As and p-GaAs, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The excited electrons reach the n-Al0.3Ga0.7As layer without being captured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The VB discontinuity of 170 meV (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  37) between Al0.3Ga0.7As and GaAs corresponds to the energy loss that occurs at the hetero-interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This loss must be carefully designed when optimizing the SC structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below-gap photons passing through Al0.3Ga0.7As excite the InAs QDs and GaAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The excited electrons and holes in GaAs drift in opposite directions in the internal electric field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the excited holes can reach the p-GaAs contact layer, the electrons are accumulated at the Al0.3Ga0.7As/GaAs interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides, similar spatial carrier separation occurs for photoexcited carriers in the InAs QDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electrons accumulated at the hetero-interface are separated from the holes and are expected to exhibit extended lifetimes, which can be in the order of milliseconds in some cases38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long-lived electrons improve the absorption strength for below-gap photons for GaAs and are efficiently pumped upwards into the Al0.3Ga0.7As barrier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1b, the output voltage of TPU-SC corresponds to the gap of the quasi-Fermi levels for electrons in Al0.3Ga0.7As and holes in GaAs at an operating condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Schematic band diagram of TPU-SC.Diagrams (a) at the short-circuit condition and (b) at an operating condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sunlight irradiates the Al0.3Ga0.7As side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-energy photons are absorbed in Al0.3Ga0.7As, and excited electrons and holes drift in opposite directions towards n-layer and p-layer, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below-gap photons for Al0.3Ga0.7As excite InAs QDs and GaAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long-lived electrons separated from holes are accumulated at the Al0.3Ga0.7As/GaAs hetero-interface, inducing a dramatic increase in the two-step photon up-conversion current.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ef in a is the Fermi level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Efe and Efh in b indicate the quasi-Fermi levels of electrons and holes, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ec and  Ev are the conduction band and VB discontinuity, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantized states in InAs/GaAs QDs are drawn by horizontal dashed lines.Full size image', 'Measurement of external quantum efficiency', 'To demonstrate the TPU effect, we measured the EQE and its change (EQE) that were produced by irradiating SC with IR light with photon energy lower than the fundamental edge of InAs QDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All the measurements were performed at room temperature (290 K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2a,b show the EQE and EQE spectra for TPU-SC with InAs QDs, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without the IR illumination, two clear absorption edges appear at 685 and 875 nm in the EQE spectrum (black colour in Fig 2a); these edges correspond to the bandgaps of Al0.3Ga0.7As and GaAs, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The EQE signal for high-energy photons (above the bandgap of Al0.3Ga0.7As) decreases because of the shallow penetration of the incident light and significant carrier recombination at the surface, which are suppressed by introducing a wider-gap window layer39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When excited above the bandgap of Al0.3Ga0.7As, the excited electrons and holes are collected at the corresponding electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the behaviour of carriers generated by below-gap photons in Al0.3Ga0.7As is different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below-gap photons are predominantly absorbed in i-GaAs and generate electrons and holes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The excited holes drift towards the p-layer of GaAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the drift current of excited electrons is partially obstructed at the Al0.3Ga0.7As/GaAs interface, resulting in a significant drop of the EQE signal below the bandgap of Al0.3Ga0.7As.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed photocurrent in the wavelength region between the bandgaps of Al0.3Ga0.7As and GaAs is caused by the thermal and tunnelling escape of the accumulated electrons at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this wavelength region, the EQE signal also shows a gradual decrease with increasing wavelength because the optical absorption coefficient becomes small with increasing wavelength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the near-IR wavelength region below the bandgap of GaAs, the EQE signal decreases drastically and shows a small structure at 912 nm that can be attributed to thermally excited carriers from the deep quantized states of the InAs wetting layer21,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: EQE spectra obtained with and without IR light and EQE spectra measured at 290 K.(a,c) show EQE spectra for TPU-SC with and without InAs QDs, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The black and magenta lines represent the EQE spectra measured with and without 1,300 nm LD illumination, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b,d) show EQE spectra of TPU-SC with and without InAs QDs, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EQE is defined as the difference between the EQE signals measured with and without the 1,300 nm LD illumination.Full size image', 'Figure 3a shows the temperature dependent EQE spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At low temperature, the absorption edges of Al0.3Ga0.7As and GaAs are relatively steep owing to the excitonic feature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With increasing the temperature, the absorption edges shift and the below-gap state attributed to the InAs-wetting layer appears gradually.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The EQE signal from QDs was very weak and below the detection limit because of the deeper quantized state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3b shows the temperature dependence of the current density at 780 nm excited by a laser diode (LD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  780 nm photons directly excite i-GaAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The excitation power density was 47 mW cm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current density increases with increasing the temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inset of Fig 3b indicates the applied bias voltage dependence of the estimated thermal activation energy EA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EA monotonically decreases with increasing the electric field because of lowering the effective barrier height at the hetero-interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EA shows the maximum of 221±3 meV at 0.02 V. Conversely, applying higher positive bias voltage weakens the internal electric field significantly and makes flatter the band.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the forward current increases even at the same bias condition with increasing the temperature, the detected photocurrent decreases rapidly with flatten the band.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereby, EA decreases and finally becomes negative with increasing the bias voltage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum EA excellently coincides with the estimated CB discontinuity between Al0.3Ga0.7As and GaAs37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3c shows the temperature dependence of the current density at 912 nm corresponding to the wetting layer state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recorded the current at the bias of 0.02 V.

The calculation model assumes an absorptivity of 1 and good photon selectivity25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We maintained the bandgap energy (1.80 eV) of Al0.3Ga0.7As fixed and varied the CB offset (E2) and the VB offset (E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TPU of electrons occurs at the potential discontinuity of E2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 8 shows the calculated results as a function of E2 at a solar concentration of 1 and 1,000 suns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing the E2 with a fixed E results in a decreasing E1 (see inset of Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When E2 and E are zero, the conversion efficiency coincides with that of a single-junction Al0.3Ga0.7As SC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless of E, the conversion efficiency increases as E2 increases because the contribution of the TPU increases, namely, the transmission loss decreases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the efficiency reaches a peak; under the one-sun irradiation, the maximum conversion efficiency is 44% at E2=0.63 eV when E=0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This value coincides with the efficiency calculated for the well-known ideal IBSC5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, under 1,000-sun irradiation, the conversion efficiency exceeds 50%, even at E=0.2 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The E2 at which the conversion efficiency exhibits a peak shifts with varying E. Increasing the E leads to a monotonic decrease in the conversion efficiency, which is caused by a voltage loss at the hetero-interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that a zero VB discontinuity (E=0) achieves maximum conversion efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To reduce E, the use of other material systems showing a type-II band alignment would accentuate the intrinsic nature of the TPU-SC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 8: Detailed balance calculation of TPU-SC.The horizontal axis represents the conduction band offset (E2), shown in the inset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bandgap energy of the host material (Al0.3Ga0.7As) is fixed at 1.80 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solid and dashed lines correspond to the results at a solar concentration of 1 and 1,000 suns, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E is the VB offset (inset).Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Intraband transition is recognized as a very weak phenomenon that depends on the carrier density in the initial state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we observed a strong TPU when using a hetero-structure that included InAs QDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the results of Jsc shown in Fig 7b, we estimated the intraband absorption coefficients for the TPU at the hetero-structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assumed that Jsc and the absorption coefficient obey the following relationship that is based on the BeerLambert law:', '', 'where q is the elementary charge, Nin is the incident 1,300 nm photon flux,  is the absorption coefficient and d is the thickness of absorber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When calculating Nin, we considered a reflectivity of 29.8% at the SC surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum value of d estimated from equation (1) was 9 × 103, depending on the 1,300 nm excitation power density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  d corresponds to the thickness of the electrons gas forming around the hetero-interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Roughly assuming that the electron gas concentrates in the InAs QDs layer, d is considered to be the InAs-QD height of 3 nm; consequently, the maximum  becomes 30,000 cm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This value is rather high compared to coefficients previously reported in the literature, which were in the range 4002,000 cm1 (refs 18,26,27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The developed TPU-SC presents extremely long-lived electrons accumulated at the hetero-interface that fill all the confinement states of the InAs QDs and wetting layer, leading to this strong intraband excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The additional 1,300 nm LD produces not only a dramatic increase in the photocurrent, which is two orders of magnitude greater than ever observed, but also an increase in the photovoltage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The typical illumination power density used in the experiment corresponded to approximately 17 suns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This concentration ratio is relatively low, demonstrating the efficient TPU effect, and is expected to be easily realized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Next, we compare Jsc with results reported in several references.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 7a, the maximum Jsc of our TPU-SC was 0.6 mA cm2 at the additional 1,300 nm IR-LD power density of 320 mW cm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14, two-step photon absorption in GaSb/GaAs type-II QD-IBSC has been reported, where the maximum Jsc obtained by irradiating additional IR light with the intensity of 750 W cm2 was estimated 10 nA cm2 at 200 K and became smaller than 1 nA cm2 at the temperature above 250 K. In ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38, we reported a saturable behaviour of Jsc in IBSC including InAs QDs embedded in Al0.3Ga0.7As/GaAs quantum well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In that study, the maximum Jsc was 0.15 A cm2 when excited by the additional IR light with the power density of 56 mW cm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the saturated Jsc is proportional to the IR power density, Jsc can be estimated to be 0.86 A cm2 at the IR power density of 320 mW cm2 used in our experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elborg et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  investigated the voltage dependence of extra photocurent for the GaAs/Al0.28Ga0.72As QD-IBSC23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In that literature, Jsc was 0.44 A cm2 when excited at the additional IR power density of 1,400 mW cm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sellers et al.24 investigated InAs/GaAs QD-IBSC inserting GaP strain-balancing layer between each QD layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the maximum Jsc was 3 A cm2 at the additional IR power density of 300 mW cm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, Jsc of our TPU-SC exceeded all the reported values by greater than two orders of magnitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The SC device used in this study was designed and fabricated to demonstrate a strong TPU phenomenon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the SC structure presented in this paper is not the final version of this device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed optimized design considering the theoretical predictions shown in Fig 8 is necessary to achieve the best performance of the TPU-SC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the position of the hetero-interface becomes important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, as the cause for TPU reduces when the electric field is strongly reduced, we need to perform detailed simulations of the band profile at the operating point in order to maintain a moderate internal electric field even at the operating point by controlling the doping profile near the hetero-interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In any case, the obtained results suggest that the SC structure proposed in this paper has a high potential for implementation in the next-generation high-efficiency SCs.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Solar cell fabrication', 'The TPU-SC was fabricated on a p+-GaAs (001) substrate using solid-source molecular beam epitaxy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detailed structure is illustrated in Fig 9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 150-nm-thick p-GaAs (Be: 2 × 1018 cm3) layer was grown over a 400-nm-thick p+-GaAs (Be: 1 × 1019 cm3) buffer layer at a substrate temperature of 550 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The substrate temperature was monitored during the growth using an infrared pyrometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, an i layer with the structure Al0.3Ga0.7As (250 nm)/GaAs (10 nm)/InAs QDs/GaAs (1,140 nm) was deposited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nominal thickness of InAs was 0.64 nm (2.1 monolayers).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The typical height and width of the QDs was 3 and 20 nm, respectively, and the QD density was approximately 1.0 × 1010 cm3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The substrate temperature before the deposition of the InAs QDs was 550 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The InAs QDs and the subsequent 10-nm-thick GaAs capping layer were grown at 490 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thin GaAs capping layer maintained the optical quality of the InAs QDs, even if Al0.3Ga0.7As is grown at 490 °C, which is lower than the optimum growth temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, n+-GaAs (Si: 2.5 × 1018 cm3), n+-Al0.3Ga0.7As (Si: 2.5 × 1017 cm3), and n-Al0.3Ga0.7As (Si: 1 × 1017 cm3) layers were grown on the SC structure at a substrate temperature of 500 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The beam-equivalent pressure of the As2 flux was 1.15 × 103 Pa.
