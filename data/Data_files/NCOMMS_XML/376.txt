Van der Waals interactions and the limits of isolated atom models at interfaces  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Van der Waals forces are among the weakest, yet most decisive interactions governing condensation and aggregation processes and the phase behaviour of atomic and molecular matter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding the resulting structural motifs and patterns has become increasingly important in studies of the nanoscale regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we measure the paradigmatic van der Waals interactions represented by the noble gas atom pairs ArXe, KrXe and XeXe with a Xe-functionalized tip of an atomic force microscope at low temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual rare gas atoms were fixed at node sites of a surface-confined two-dimensional metalorganic framework.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the magnitude of the measured force increased with the atomic radius, yet detailed simulation by density functional theory revealed that the adsorption induced charge redistribution strengthened the van der Waals forces by a factor of up to two, thus demonstrating the limits of a purely atomic description of the interaction in these representative systems.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The van der Waals (dispersive) interaction1, arising from the temporal fluctuation of electronic charge inducing transient dipoles of variable strengths, is ubiquitous in nature and is of central importance for many physical and chemical phenomena.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interaction plays a key role in the condensation of atoms and molecules, friction and adhesion2, and is crucial for the adsorption of molecules on inert surfaces such as graphite3,4 and of -conjugated molecules on metal surfaces5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While dispersion forces are inherently a quantum mechanical phenomenon, simple quasi-classical models have been applied very successfully6, and remain popular for many critical systems7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the advances of first-principles quantum methods, being applied to increasingly complex systems, have made it essential to include accurate van der Waals contributions and thus gain deeper insight into their physical consequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonlocal correlations, responsible for dispersion interactions, are not included in the most commonly used functionals9, but more efficient approaches are constantly evolving10,11,12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any new methods are usually rigorously tested against a set of known atomic structures or materials properties calculated using higher-order methods15, but as the systems studied increase in size and include large substrates and adsorbates, their capability is still limited by the current computational power.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, experimental approaches to measure interactions in complex systems remain complementary to advances in quantum physical simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, this combination has proved successful in the direct probing of the van der Waals interaction between two Rydberg atoms16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Atomic force microscopy (AFM) can directly measure the interaction between tip and sample down to the atomic scale via the frequency shift of an oscillating cantilever17, and by integrating the measured frequency shift in the z-direction, the force and potential can be extracted quantitatively18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This technique has been successfully used to discriminate embedded Si, Sn and Pb atoms in a Si(111) surface19 as well as In, Sn and Si atoms in a heterogeneous IIIIV chain on a Si(100) surface20, and also to study the complex interplay between deformations and electronic states in PtPt and CuCu metal contacts21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alongside such reactive systems, studies of weak interactions involving inert graphite22 and carbon nanotubes have been carried out23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the role of van der Waals interactions between Au structures and aromatic hydrocarbons was explored by AFM tip-induced lifting of individual molecules24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, direct force measurements of the atomic van der Waals potentials remain an unexplored topic to date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rare gas atoms have long been providing a benchmark in van der Waals interactions due to their inert, monoatomic nature and the dominance of dispersion forces in their binding26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this work, we directly measure the van der Waals interaction between two adsorbed rare gas atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual Ar, Kr and Xe atoms were adsorbed and stabilized at a nodal site of a molecular network on Cu(111), and their interaction with a Xe-functionalized tip of AFM was measured at low temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the magnitude of the van der Waals interaction scales with the size of the rare gas atom on the surface, that is, in order of XeXe greater than KrXe greater than ArXe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed theoretical simulation generally corroborated the experimental findings, and provided insight into the role of tip-induced atomic relaxations and charge transfer processes that cause deviations from a pure van der Waals interaction between two individual atoms.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Rare gas atoms stabilized by 2D MOF', 'In Fig 1a, a schematic representation of the AFM experiment is depicted, with the interaction forces categorized into long-range and site-dependent short-range contributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The system has four contributions; F1 the tipsample surface interaction, F2 the Xe tipsample surface interaction, F3 the tiprare gas atom on surface interaction and F4 the Xe tiprare gas atom on surface interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The F4 contribution corresponds to a direct component between the two atoms, which at long range is given by the van der Waals interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To extract the latter components, reference measurements were carried out at an equivalent atomic site in absence of a surface adsorbed rare gas atom (denoted empty site in Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By subtracting the two z-distance-dependent curves, the interaction force of F3+F4 could be determined directly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  F1F4 have different power laws and origins of the Z distance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among them, F4 has the largest power law and the smallest Z distance for a given tipsample distance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first attempted to probe the force of Xe adsorbed on a flat Cu(111) surface (Supplementary Fig 1)27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the high mobility of the rare gas atoms on the metal surface hampered a reliable measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the diffusion barrier was so low that the rare gas atom was often accidentally moved in the lateral direction by the tipsample interaction (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Rare gas atom stabilized by 2D MOF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic drawing of the AFM measurement set-up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Chemical structure of Cu-coordinated molecular network on Cu(111); the two symmetry-inequivalent nodal sites are indicated as i and ii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) STM topographies before and after the vertical manipulation of a Xe atom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Distance-dependent curve of the tunnelling current in the process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurement parameters: I=2 pA and V=200 mV in c, and V=2 mV in d.

#@NEW_LINE#@#  We formed the 2D MOF28 by depositing the perylene derivative 4,9-diaminoperylene-quinone-3,10-diimine (DPDI) on a clean Cu(111) surface, and then annealing the sample at 300 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent work has shown that a series of dehydrogenation reactions and subsequent coordination of the molecules nitrogen atoms to Cu adatoms results in the honeycomb structure depicted in Fig 1b (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result of the adsorption geometry of adatoms and molecules on the surface, the 2D MOF has two kinds of coordination motifs, indicated as i and ii (see also Supplementary Fig 3), each comprising three Cu adatoms and which are referred to as nodes in the honeycomb network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1c shows that Xe atoms, dosed onto the cold sample ( less_than 8 K), adsorb predominantly on node sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By setting a clean Cu tip 400 pm closer to the Xe site than the imaging distance30, the tip was reliably functionalized by the Xe atom (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Atomic scale imaging of the 2D MOF', 'Figure 2a displays the scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) topography, taken with a Xe-functionalized tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

molecular structure, we took advantage of the capabilities of AFM with functionalized tips31,32,33,34,35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 2b, the frequency shift map taken at a constant height is shown, in which the chemical structure at the centre of the perylene core becomes apparent but the molecular units remain blurred at the nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the measurement was performed in the repulsive interaction region, the darker area (more negative frequency shift) corresponds to a larger tipsample separation, that is, the nodes are closer to the Cu substrate and the nitrogen atoms are thus not resolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Atomic scale observation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) STM topography and (b) AFM images taken with a Xe-functionalized tip and (c) a CO-functionalized tip.

known to improve resolution compared with a Xe tip due to its smaller atomic radius and higher flexibility37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2c shows the frequency shift image, in which the chemical bonds in the perylene derivative now appear clearly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The carbon rings in perylene are apparently elongated in the direction of the short molecular axis due to the tilting effect of the CO molecule on the tip apex31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even the C3N2 pentagonal rings of the triply dehydrogenated (3deh)-DPDI exo-ligands at the nodes are resolved as indicated by a white arrow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the nitrogen atoms are coordinated with Cu adatoms on the surface, the end groups of the molecule are closer to the Cu substrate than the perylene core, in agreement with X-ray standing wave measurements and theoretical calculations of the system29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Cu adatoms coordinated to the nitrogen atoms are not visible in the images, although they have been identified indirectly by an STM fingerprint of the metalorganic coordination at particular bias voltages29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Closer inspection reveals that the two distinct nodal positions of the honeycomb network can be resolved by the adsorption of Xe atoms, which appear in STM images with different apparent sizes (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This experimental result unambiguously supports the previous

distance-dependent measurement, the z-feedback was deactivated so that the relative z-distances of two curves were consistent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the experiment, the absolute z-distance from the surface was undefined, and the origin of the z-distance therefore set a posteriori by equating the equilibrium force distance to the sum of the van der Waals radii (ArXe=404 pm, KrXe=418 pm and XeXe=432 pm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On the Xe-filled node site, a strong site-dependent interaction is detected while no significant site-dependent force was observed on the corresponding empty node site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Above the empty site, the tipsample separation is so large that only the macroscopic attractive interaction is present and the tip does not approach close enough to experience short-range interactions in the plotted tipsample separation range (equivalent to F1+F2, see Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By subtracting two curves measured at the Xe-filled and -empty node sites, we obtain the F3+F4 distance-dependent curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the origin of the z-axis in the F3 distance-dependent curve is shifted by the size of Xe atom, its contribution is smaller than that of F4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, the tip was ultra-sharpened by focused ion beam milling, which also contributed to the reduction of F3 (Supplementary Fig 5), giving a relation of F2 greater than F3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the maximum contribution of F3 can be estimated via F2 (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated the contribution of F2 via fitting the different power laws in the z-distance-dependent frequency shifts on the empty node site and consequently found that the contribution of F3 is  less_than 5% of F4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, by subtracting two curves measured at the Xe-filled and -empty node sites, we could estimate the interatomic van der Waals interaction (F4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To compare a magnitude of F4 for ArXe, KrXe and XeXe atom pairs, the z-distance-dependent frequency shifts were measured with the same Xe-functionalized tip as shown in Fig 3c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain a more quantitative physical value, the force was extracted via the measured frequency shift with the aid of a numerical algorithm (Fig 3d)18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnitude of the maximum attractive force between two noble gas atoms was found to be  less_than 35 pN, which is much smaller than what has been found in previous measurements on semiconductors and metals19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By integrating the force in the z-direction, the potential between ArXe, KrXe and XeXe were obtained as shown in Fig 3e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In a first attempt to relate these curves to a simple physical model, the corresponding force versus distance relations calculated from Lennard-Jones models6, where the equilibrium force distance and the depth of the force were adjusted to the experimental data, were determined and are shown with broken lines in Fig 3d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these, the depths of the potential wells were derived as ArXe=19 meV, KrXe=26 meV and XeXe=34 meV, which are in reasonable agreement with the depths of the potential curves directly extracted via the measured frequency shift, that is, 18.1 meV for a ArXe dimer, 26.1 meV for a KrXe dimer and 35.9 meV for a XeXe dimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the shapes of the fitted force curves deviate from the measured ones, indicating that the simple and rigid Lennard-Jones fitting was not suitable for a precise representation of the experimental results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Theoretical simulations', 'To demonstrate the dimer-specific relaxation of the adatom positions and the conclusions to be drawn on the interatomic potentials in detail, we used first-principles

explanations for the differences from the pure dimer potential energies, we analysed the atomic positions and electron density during the simulated tipsurface approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that major tip-induced displacements of the noble gas atoms occur at a separation of  less_than 0.5 nm, in the region of strongest interactionin particular as the repulsive part of the potential is entered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this region, the Xe-tip and atomsurface network bond lengths gradually reduce (up to 0.030.04 nm at a separation of 0.3 nm) as the tip approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is no systematic difference between Ar, Kr and Xe in this regard, although the displacements will have different relative energetic costs in each system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the energy cost of these relaxations is very specific to the approach site, they cannot be cancelled by subtraction of the empty site potential curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'There is also a clear systematic difference when comparing electron transfer in the three systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in the binding energy, and clearly linked to it, the magnitude of electron transfer between the investigated atoms and the surface network/metal tip correspondingly scales as Xe greater than Kr greater than Ar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, at a separation of 0.5 nm for each system, the Bader charge (integrating the electron density) on the surface noble atom is 0.01/0.03/0.09 e less than in the equivalent dimer configuration for Ar/Kr/Xe, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar difference (0.03 e) for Xe on the tip is also observed for each system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the nature of the electron density transfer (Supplementary Fig 8) shows that this is dominated by transfer from the rare gas atom into bonding states between the same atom and the tip or surface, and to copper and/or nitrogen if resting on the nodes of the network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this is mitigated by subtraction of the empty site reference potential (which has charge transfer contributions) to some degree, the electron transfer is significantly smaller in the region of the strongest interaction for the empty site system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The observed difference between pure van der Waals binding and our results on Xe to Ar/Kr/Xe dimers, along with the induced relaxation, certainly plays a significant role in the differences between the experimental and simulated tipsurface energy potentials and the pure atomdimer curves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the binding strength and electron transfer increases, so does the deviation, reducing the validity of subtraction of the empty site reference curve, such that ultimately the measured XeXe interaction is almost double the bare dimer interaction, while this discrepancy is not observed for the XeAr potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using an Ar-functionalized tip would mitigate the effect, but attempts to this end gave rise to severe issues with tip stability that precluded reliable measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite these difficulties to correctly describe the depth and position of the potential minimum based on a simple dimer picture, the asymptotic behaviour of the interaction at large distances is very similar to the asymptotics of the dimer curves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For dimers, or more generally any two point-like polarizable objects, the interaction potential asymptotically at long range has a leading term from the van der Waals interaction, which takes the form C6/r6 as a function of the distance, r. The interaction strength is determined on the dynamical polarizabilities of the individual atoms39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The curves of XeAr and XeKr in this region fit very well to such a limiting C6/r6 behaviour expected for the interaction between two rare gas atoms (Supplementary Fig 9), although the C6 coefficients obtained in this way are very large, 2.5 and 3.4 times higher than the free-ion cases (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the tail of the interaction extends beyond a distance at which direct charge transfer between tip and substrate is to be expected, the most natural explanation of this enhancement is the notion that the change in polarizability mostly stems from the rare atom adsorbed on the surface and its interaction with the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the XeXe interaction, the optimal asymptotic form is r5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For consistency of comparison, Table 1 gives the value of the C6 coefficient from a fit to the non-optimal r6 form, which also in this case is much larger than the free atom value, reflecting the much stronger binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deviation from the pure r6 form indicates that the interaction has contributions also from sources other than the van der Waals interaction that stems from the polarizability of the objects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our calculations show the formation of weak bond dipoles both at the tip and the substrate through charge transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two constant dipoles should result in an interaction decaying as r3, which is not seen for Ar and Kr, so it seems as an unlikely contribution also for Xe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the interaction between dipoles oriented as in our calculations should repel, giving a positive energy contribution and thus decrease the interaction, which is the opposite of what we see.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Performing a fit to a sum C6r6CNrN functions yields near-perfect fits for any N=2, 3, 4 and 5, and so is not helpful for disentangling these interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Xe is well known to be more prone to covalent interaction than both Kr and Ar, which may result in either electrostatic interaction due to the larger charge transfer to the substrate or a stronger covalent bond for the XeXe dimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the measured interval, we are not able to clearly distinguish these two scenarios for the XeXe interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Comparison of C6 coefficients fitted to AFM measurements and theoretical reference39.Full size table'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We present a quantitative force measurement of van der Waals forces in the atomic-scale contacts of ArgonXenon, KryptonXenon and XenonXenon atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These rare gas atoms were stabilized in the nodal sites of a metal-coordinated two-dimensional molecular network, and the probing AFM tip was prepared by picking up a Xe atom from the nodal site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Systematic force measurements established the depths of the potential curves for XeAr, XeKr and XeXe at 18.1, 26.1 and 35.9 meV, respectively, which is in agreement with the expected trend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tails of the interactions of XeAr and XeKr were found to display van der Waals r6 limiting behaviour; however, the effective strength of the interaction was found to depend on the influence of the tip and the substrate on the atomic polarizability, leading to a deviation from the behaviour of isolated noble gas atom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For XeXe interaction, we find a deviation from the van der Waals power law, which we interpret as an effect of stronger covalent interaction between the Xe atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach offers a systematic way to characterize the interaction between any atomic and molecular species that can be fixed at a solid surface of a solid or be templated by a surface framework, and has the sensitivity to measure even the weakest forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination with theory has allowed for a detailed analysis of the interaction components, clearly highlighting the role of classical van der Waals interactions while identifying the limits of an isolated atom model.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
