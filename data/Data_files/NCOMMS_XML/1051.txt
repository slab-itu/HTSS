Precise determination of graphene functionalization by in situ Raman spectroscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The verification of a successful covalent functionalization of graphene and related carbon allotropes can easily be carried out by Raman spectroscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the unequivocal assignment and resolution of individual lattice modes associated with the covalent binding of addends was elusive up to now.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present an in situ Raman study of a controlled functionalization of potassium intercalated graphite, revealing several new bands appearing in the D-region of the spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evolution of these bands with increasing degree of functionalization from low to moderate levels provides a basis for the deconvolution of the different components towards quantifying the extent of functionalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By complementary DFT calculations we were able to identify the vibrational changes in the close proximity of the addend bearing lattice carbon atoms and to assign them to specific Raman modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimental in situ observation of the developing functionalization along with the reoxidation of the intercalated graphite represents an important step towards an improved understanding of the chemistry of graphene.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The wet-chemical exfoliation of graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) and the subsequent treatment with electrophiles is one of the most potent methods for covalent graphene functionalization1,2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, graphite is typically activated by saturation doping with potassium to reach the highest stage I intercalation level with a crystalline K to C ratio of 1:8 (refs 6, 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the subsequent covalent binding step, a single electron transfer to the electrophile (for example, alkyl halide8 or diazonium compound4) takes place and, after halide or N2 elimination, the intermediately formed organic radical attacks the conjugated -system of the graphenide upon the formation of sp3 centres in the carbon lattice9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The degree of functionalization (DOF) depends on the reduction potential of the electrophile and if this is low enough, almost all negative charges of the graphenide can be quenched13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our recent work, we were able to provide a simple and efficient procedure for the quantitative discharging of reduced graphites using benzonitrile as trapping reagent that allows for the synthesis of defect-free graphene from graphenide solutions6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The verification of the successful covalent functionalization and the determination of the quality of exfoliated graphene can be obtained by Raman spectroscopy that serves as the most important characterization tool for the analysis of graphene-based materials15,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is a nondestructive technique, allowing for unravelling the interaction between individual graphene sheets and functional groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Raman spectroscopy and, in particular, statistical Raman microscopy9 can also be used to analyse the doping effects19,20, strain21, oxidation and sample quality22,23,24, molecular functionalization25 and number of layers26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, characteristic changes of the most prominent Raman modes, namely, the D, G and 2D modes are the most significant indicators15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a graphitic framework containing lattice embedded sp3 carbon atomsgenerally termed as sp3 defectsgives rise to additional Raman modes15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, recent work predicted the presence of additional Raman bands for hydroxylated graphene22 that have already been observed in graphene oxide (GO) samples27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, first approaches for the quantification of sp3 defects have been reported28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these considerations we have developed a geometrical model revealing the DOF  as ratio of the basal sp3/sp2 carbon atoms by the use of scanning Raman spectroscopy for statistical analysis9,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the information obtained from Raman spectroscopy is only valid for interdefect distances of 3 nm (refs 28, 29) and the corresponding  less_than 0.5% (refs 9, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, functionalized graphene derivatives like polyhydrogenated graphene31,32 or graphene oxide33,34 still cannot be addressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In those cases, the D, G and 2D modes appear as very broad and poorly resolved features18 hiding the individual contributions from the individual lattice vibrations35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unequivocal assignment and resolution of individual lattice modes introduced by covalent binding was elusive and remained a major challenge in graphene chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tackling this problem would require the in situ spectroscopic monitoring of the reaction progress before the defect-induced broadening of the Raman modes in highly functionalized samples prevents any line shape analysis and a detailed understanding of the correlation between defect-related Raman modes and the atomic structure of the addend carrying neighbourhood in the covalent adduct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report a comprehensive study involving in situ Raman spectroscopy supported by quantum mechanical calculations where we have successfully solved the challenges pointed out above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As model reaction we have chosen the hydrogenation of reduced graphite32 with H2O and compared it with the corresponding exposure to H2 and O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next to the very precise characterization of the covalently functionalized graphene by an unambiguous assignment of the lattice vibrations, we are furthermore able to provide profound mechanistic information on the underlying covalent addition chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results are of fundamental importance for any laboratory investigating the chemistry and materials design of graphene, graphene composites and other functional synthetic carbon allotropes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In situ monitoring of the chemical functionalization', 'The setup of the in situ Raman monitoring of the reaction of defect free KC8 crystals with H2O, H2 and O2 is presented in Fig 1a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This high-end system enables an unprecedented precise reaction control since a focused scenario consisting of the two reaction partners is provided.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this setup, the partial pressure of the volatile component at the solid/gas interphase is the only parameter that is varied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The in situ Raman setup is equipped with a laser probe (excitation wavelength 514 nm) that allows for the spectroscopic monitoring of the reaction and the detection of the stepwise evolution of functionalization-related Raman modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The required stage I GIC was prepared under argon atmosphere6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The successful and clean formation of KC8 was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy and by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After controlled exposure to H2O vapour we were able to monitor the early stages of the reaction (low degree of addition) associated with a mild surface hydrogenation (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 1c, the evolution of the Raman spectra of a fully doped GIC (nK+C8n) is presented upon extended exposure to H2O vapour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gradual growth of distinct modes becomes apparent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Raman setup and in situ spectroscopic monitoring of the covalent functionalization of KC8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic illustration of the setup for

fingerprint of nK+C8(n-m)-Hm after addend binding and sp3 defect site formation within the graphene lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The D- and G-line region (1,2001,700 cm1) contains 7 components: graphitic E2g G mode (1,575 cm1) and defect activated D mode (1,340 cm1), and five additional defect modes discovered for the first time in this study, namely, D1 (1,325 cm1), D2 (1,442 cm1), D3 (1,483 cm1), D4 (1,518 cm1) and D5 (1,559 cm1), that originate from carbon bond vibrational coupling deviations in the vicinity of the sp3 defect site.Full size image', 'After a few minutes of reaction, the pronounced surface functionalization is reflected by the Raman spectrum displayed in Fig 1d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By a detailed line-shape analysis of the spectra, at least seven main features could be identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most prominent can be assigned to the graphitic E2g G mode (1,575 cm1), while we attribute the slight deviation in the phonon frequency to strain present in the GIC21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the well-known dispersive D mode (1,340 cm1), five additional modes (D1D5) were identified for the first time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These modes are assigned as D1 (1,325 cm1), D2 (1,442 cm1), D3 (1,483 cm1), D4 (1,518 cm1) and D5 (1,559 cm1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their appearance is based on the change of hybridization in the graphene lattice in close proximity to the hydrogenated carbon atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As will be demonstrated below (Fig 2c,d) by a direct comparison with the results obtained by quantum mechanical calculations, these modes can be assigned to specific lattice vibrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pronounced CZ mode (560 cm1), indicating graphitic intercalation architecture in the bulk crystal, is widely retained (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the additional D modes clearly reflect the functionalization process on the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistically, a single electron transfer from the GIC to water protons and a subsequent addition of H-radicals to the oxidized graphene surface is assumed7,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the presence of a CZ mode and the absence of any second-order mode in the final spectrum show that the GIC oxidation of the bulk crystal is not complete.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Obviously, the oxidation potential of H2O and the limited mobility of K+ in the inner part of the crystal are not sufficient enough to allow for a complete bulk reoxidation, but can be used for a surface or thin film functionalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction comes to an end when a limiting stoichiometry of nK+C8(n-m)Hm is reached, as indicated in the spectrum presented in Fig 1d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This in situ investigation of the reductive graphene functionalization process allowed for a clear identification and correlation of introduced sp3 defect sites and related new Raman vibrational modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Identification and assignment of new Raman bands in G-H.(a)

hydrogen or oxygen and water', 'In another series of experiments we addressed the question of how GICs respond to the exposure of H2, O2 and a combination of O2 and H2O to simulate their behaviour under ambient conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding results are depicted in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expected that KC8 should not give rise to covalent hydrogenation with H2 gas under these conditions37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, as can be seen in Fig 2b, H2 exposure does not yield any covalent binding to the graphene lattice since the Fano-shaped signature of stage I GICs is largely preserved (Fig 2b, blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding evolution of the Raman spectra (Supplementary Fig 2a) rather indicates H2 intercalation, leading to (H2)@nK+C8n.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intercalation of H2 in between the graphene sheets is clearly corroborated by an increasing intensity of the CZ mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the exclusive exposure of oxygen gas to the GIC was also studied (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evolution of the Raman spectra clearly underlines that pure oxygen is not covalently reacting with KC8 but leads to a partial oxidation with the result of a lower overall potassium loading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be clearly recognized from the final Raman spectrum in Fig 2b (red), where no defect site-related fingerprint was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assume that exposure of KC8 to O2 leads to the formation of potassium superoxide1,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the reoxidation by oxygen without mass transport of potassium (in contrast to, for example, the oxidation in benzonitrile6) leads to disordered graphite that is clearly revealed in the respective XRD pattern (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To simulate ambient workup conditions with our setup, first the same hydrogenation reaction as shown in Fig 1 was initiated, leading to partially reoxidized and covalently hydrogenated nK+C8(n-m)Hm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, the sample was exposed to oxygen in the presence of water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions the material should be reoxidized and simultaneously a hydroxylation of the carbon scaffold can be expected14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This formation of -OH entities in the presence of oxygen and water has recently been confirmed for graphenide solutions6 and therefore represents a major field of interest in reductive functionalization of carbon allotropes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The in situ Raman analysis in Fig 2b clearly revealed that in this case further covalent binding is promoted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be assumed that after the initial treatment with H2O vapour, a water film is still absorbed on the graphitic surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent single electron transfer processes between the GIC and O2 can now be accompanied by follow-up reactions with H2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Raman spectra this is reflected by an additional defect site-related interband appearing at 1,460 cm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mode can be assigned to C-O vibrations that relate to the functionalization with covalently sp3 bound -OH groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with literature, this Raman fingerprint has already been predicted by theory22 and investigated for graphene oxide27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, our present study can unambiguously verify the proposed origin of this band by theoretical calculations (Fig 2d) and by temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy (TDRS) in combination with TG-MS (thermogravimetric analysis coupled to mass spectrometry) analysis (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings prove that the covalent hydroxylation of graphenide requires the presence of both oxygen and water6 that are omnipresent under ambient conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the sole treatment with oxygen is not sufficient, strongly supporting the reported mechanism for the hydroxyl functionalization14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Calculation of the vibrational Raman response', 'To address the lattice carbon bond vibrational coupling deviation from the normal E2g G mode related to the C=C sp2 vibrations in graphene at 1,580 cm1 upon introduction of sp3 defect sites and the corresponding additional C-C modes, the vibrational Raman response of pristine graphene functionalized by either a hydrogen or hydroxyl addend was calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, a 4 × 4 supercell of graphene (32 lattice carbon atoms) functionalized with one -H or -OH moiety (3.125% DOF) was considered (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The addend carrying sp3 hybridized lattice carbon atom is labelled CA, while the direct neighbouring basal C atoms are termed CB and those next to it CC and CD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting calculated Raman spectra for hydrogenated G-H and hydroxylated G-OH are presented in Fig 2d, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulated reference for defect free graphene G is provided in Supplementary Fig 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With respect to the approximations made in the calculations, the limitations provided by the experimental setup (resolution of the detector and calibration ambiguity) and the fact that the covalently functionalized graphene sample is a mixture of hydroxylated and hydrogenated species with varying content, the calculated and experimental values for the evolving bands is in good correlation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the case of G-H the hybridization change is accompanied by lifting the hydrogenated C-atom by z=0.46 Å out of plane in z-direction (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along with this shift, the CBCACB dihedral angle changes from =120° (pure sp2 in pristine graphene) to =114.5° for G-H (Supplementary Fig 7a) and to =113.7° for G-OH (Supplementary Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complete list of calculated angles, shifts and phonon frequencies is provided in Supplementary Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The theoretical analysis provides the phonon energy for excitations of lattice carbon atoms surrounding a sp3 defect is affected by the newly formed C-H bond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The geometry around the C-H/sp3 centre ((CBCACB)=114.5°) is strained, since it deviates from the regular tetrahedral angle of 109.5°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The appearance of the additional D1D5 modes between 1,300 and 1,600 cm1 is a consequence of these new geometrical constraints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the DOF is increased, structures of curved nanodiamond clusters are eventually emerging strongly reassembling the Raman spectra of nK+C8(n-x)-Hx and nK+C8(n-x-y)(H)x(OH)y in Fig 2b (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are fundamental for the general interpretation of the Raman spectra of any covalent graphene derivative, since the broadening of the modes can now be precisely attributed to distinct vibrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are in line with previous reports on the clustering of defect centres upon increasing the DOF39,40,41,42,43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The newly observed D1D5 modes start appearing in the spectra only beyond a certain DOF ( less_than 0.5%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At even higher degrees of functionalization ( greater than 3%), these modes broaden, causing a much less structured Raman spectrum, typically observed for highly functionalized graphene such as graphene oxide34,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, the resolution and assignment of the additional modes D1D5 reaches an optimum in a range of functionalization (0.5% less_than  less_than 2%) corresponding to the in situ situation depicted in Fig 4b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

#@NEW_LINE#@#  As a bulk functionalization approach we have chose the reaction of KC8 dispersed in tetrahydrofuran (THF), resulting in the exfoliation of the graphenide sheets G (THF)ic (Fig 3a)2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before the functionalization step, we observed no indication that KC8 would undergo any reoxidation or chemisorption within the dry solvent THF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the covalent functionalization the intermediate G (THF)ic was subsequently exposed to oxygen and water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting Raman spectrum of bulk functionalized powder sample after workup (Fig 3b) resembles the typical Raman signature of GO where three broad overlapping modes are observed in the Raman shift regime between 1,200 and 1,650 cm1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the double resonance area between 2,500 and 3,400 cm1, the three main components 2D, D+G and 2D* can be identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far, these features have neither been assigned to vibrations of specific addends nor have they been used to quantify the defects in GO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show now that the deconvolution of such spectra (Fig 3b, top) can be accomplished and a detailed analysis of the structural composition can be provided.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose the defect site-related Raman fingerprint with the characteristic modes termed as D, D and D were fitted to the spectrum in Fig 3b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These modes are located at the same Raman shift positions as the previously determined interbands (D1D5) of the mildly functionalized charged graphite, generated in situ before workup, and can therefore also be precisely identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As indicated in Fig 4 the D1, D2/D3 and D4/D5 modes can be correlated with the D, D and D interbands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, these bands can be assigned to the calculated vibrational modes CACB (D1, D), CBCC (D2/D3, D) and CCCD (D4/D5, D), respectively (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After complete reoxidation, the intravalley D* mode could be identified that cannot be observed in an intermediate charged state7,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interbands D1D5 of partial reacted graphene also vary in position and intensity in comparison with D, D and D of the completely reoxidized counterparts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a better understanding of the correlation between the different labelling formats (in situ, calculated, after workup) the respective information is summarized in Supplementary Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'TDRS and thermogravimetric analysis', 'For an independent chemical analysis of the nature of the grafted addends, TDRS was carried out and compared with the corresponding TG-MS results (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This correlation allowed for the unambiguous assignment of

the D, D and the D modes above 400 °C as depicted in Supplementary Fig 4b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Multifrequency Raman analysis of the sample', 'Finally, to further confirm the experimental assignment of the Raman modes, a multifrequency Raman study was conducted (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since our initial laser wavelength of 532 nm (2.33 eV) resulted in an exact superimposition of the nondispersive D mode excited at the  point of the Brillouin zone (1,325 cm1) and the dispersive D mode from the K point (1,340 cm1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prove this assumption, we varied the excitation wavelength from 405 to 633 nm for highly functionalized samples as shown in Fig 3c (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results confirm the dispersion of the D mode in highly functionalized graphene and the nondispersivity of the D mode at 1,325 cm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To double check the experimental assignments of each component, we carried out a cross-correlation employing the calculated Raman spectra of G-OH and G-H.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, this simulation fully matches the experimental Raman fingerprint as demonstrated in Fig 3b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has to be noted that for the calculation of the Raman modes, a 4 × 4 supercell was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This scenario, however, does not reflect the Raman processes at the K point of the graphene Brillouin zone, preventing the simulation of the D and D* modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, all other defect site-related Raman modes can be clearly assigned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The D-mode region is composed of two main components, as the nondispersive D mode and the dispersive D mode are superimposed for exc=532 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the individual components of the Raman signal can be correlated with the TG-MS analysis (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, this spectroscopic fingerprint is the first direct verification of the chemical nature of sp3 defects (here: -OH and -H) present in the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variation of the laser excitation energy proved that none of these modes are dispersive but the Raman D mode, entirely agreeing with our experimental and theoretical model of locally modified lattice carbon vibrations and molecular environments.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In Fig 4, the Raman spectra of three samples exhibiting a different DOF are presented to demonstrate the evolution of the Raman signatures with increasing sp3 carbon atom content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an example of a graphene derivative with a very low DOF ( less_than 0.5%), a typical Raman spectrum of a hexyl functionalized derivative, on which we reported previously10, is presented in Fig 4a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reductively functionalized sample has an isotropic distribution of defects with a distance of LD greater than 2 nm, resulting predominantly in the activation of the D and D* mode in the Raman spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this simple case, the ID/IG ratio can be used for the determination of  (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, the narrow width of the D mode (22 cm1) relates to =0.23%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At such low densities of defects, no additional Raman modes can be deduced and the deconvolution into D, G and D* modes can be easily carried out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in very good agreement with the observed maximum in the D/G ratio in defective graphene and graphite at LD of 3 nm (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28) and 4 nm (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deconvolution of these modes becomes more challenging if the DOF is further increased, as the D/G ratio is reduced concomitant to a line broadening28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results allow to clearly attribute the origin of this broadening to the additional evolving Raman interband modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For clarity, the Raman spectrum of functionalized graphene with =1.6% is shown in Supplementary Fig 8a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With ongoing functionalization, monitored by the laser probe, similar Raman interbands termed D1D5 are revealed in the in situ reaction of KC8 with H2O (compare Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DOF of this in situ resolved state can be attributed to a range of =0.5% less_than  less_than 2%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the corresponding covalent adducts the addends are already clustered within sp3 defect site regions, although  greater than 98% of the basal carbon atoms are still intact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cartoons in Fig 4 are presented to visualize the relationship between the observed Raman interbands and the respective structure on the graphene sheet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Upon approaching the maximum DOF after full reaction of KC8 under ambient conditions (Fig 4c), GO with =6.0% serves as ideal reference22,27, since the Raman modes do not change their shape but their overall intensity30 (Supplementary Fig 8b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the analysis of all assigned Raman interbands, both in GO and in G (THF)(OH)(H) (Fig 3a), allows for the characterization of adducts with  greater than 2%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this range, all additional components (DD) in the Raman spectrum are clearly identifiable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed fingerprint fully matches the simulated spectra for G-H and G-OH (Fig 3d) that were also calculated for 3%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in full agreement with recent surface-enhanced Raman scattering studies on functionalized chemical vapour deposition graphene, where a slight fingerprint for chemically modified graphene with a DOF of 0.5% leads to comparably weak Raman interbands in the D- and G-mode area46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we can conclude that the approach towards the maximal possible DOF of 12.5% (based on the ratio of K/C=1:8) is accompanied by clustering of addends and by the formation nonaltered sp2 nano domains39,40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we report a comprehensive study involving in situ Raman spectroscopy supported by quantum mechanical calculations to exactly monitor the covalent binding to graphene with unprecedented precision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach is very general and also allows for the fast screening and evaluation of suitable reaction conditions for covalent graphene functionalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As model reaction we have chosen the hydrogenation of reduced graphite (KC8) with H2O and compared it with the corresponding exposure to H2 and O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The early stages of graphene hydrogenation are accompanied by the evolution of a series of so far undiscovered D-modes (D1D5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using quantum mechanical calculations we were able to unambiguously assign these bands to distinct lattice vibrations in the neighbourhood of the covalently bound addend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the exposure of KC8 to H2 and O2 did not cause covalent binding but intercalation of molecular H2 or partial oxidation, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A combination of H2O and O2 treatment led to the formation of additional hydroxyl (-OH) functionalities that were clearly identified by Raman spectroscopy and TG-MS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter reaction represents a very suitable model for the decomposition of graphenides under ambient conditions (hydrogenation and hydroxylation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This important process has so far never been analysed in detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have further demonstrated that our fundamental mechanistic investigation brings us into the position to simulate and assign the spectroscopic signatures of both bulk functionalized G (THF)(OH)(H) and GO34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we have also applied our concept to simulate and characterize additional covalently functionalized graphene derivatives prepared as bulk materials with different composition (for example, DOF and nature of covalent addend) demonstrating the generality of the method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far, covalent graphene functionalization remained a very difficult field of synthetic chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is not only because suitable methods enabling graphite/graphene activation and dispersion had to be identified to allow an efficient adduct formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A major challenge was also the satisfactory characterization of reaction products since the typical powerful tools applied in synthetic chemistry such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry cannot be applied to this polydisperse 2D material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, the work presented here is a major breakthrough as it allows for graphene-derivative characterization with unprecedented precision.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
