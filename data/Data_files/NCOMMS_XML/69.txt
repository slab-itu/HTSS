Accurate lineshape spectroscopy and the Boltzmann constant  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Spectroscopy has an illustrious history delivering serendipitous discoveries and providing a stringent testbed for new physical predictions, including applications from trace materials detection, to understanding the atmospheres of stars and planets, and even constraining cosmological models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reaching fundamental-noise limits permits optimal extraction of spectroscopic information from an absorption measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate a quantum-limited spectrometer that delivers high-precision measurements of the absorption lineshape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These measurements yield a very accurate measurement of the excited-state (6P1/2) hyperfine splitting in Cs, and reveals a breakdown in the well-known Voigt spectral profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We develop a theoretical model that accounts for this breakdown, explaining the observations to within the shot-noise limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model enables us to infer the thermal velocity dispersion of the Cs vapour with an uncertainty of 35 p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  within an hour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allows us to determine a value for Boltzmanns constant with a precision of 6 p.p.m., and an uncertainty of 71 p.p.m.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Spectroscopy is a vital tool for both fundamental and applied studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Improving both the precision and accuracy of spectroscopic measurements is critical to efforts targeted at gaining maximum physical information about the quantum absorberseven as they are perturbed by the probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The immediate motivation for our work has arisen out of a call to the scientific community to develop new techniques to re-measure Boltzmanns constant, kB, in preparation for a redefinition of the kelvin1; however, advances in absorption lineshape measurement and theory will find applications in accurate gas detection and monitoring2, studies of planetary atmospheres3, thermometry in tokamaks4 and understanding distant astrophysical processes5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The accurate measurement of natural linewidths and transition frequencies, which can be directly related to the atomic lifetime, level structure and transition probabilities, is important for testing atomic physics7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'At thermal equilibrium, the velocity distribution of atomic absorbers in a vapour cell is related to the temperature through the Boltzmann distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This simple and fundamental relationship forms an excellent foundation for a type of primary thermometry known as Doppler broadening thermometry (DBT)10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DBT differs from the current leading technique for primary thermometry, which measures the temperature-dependent speed of sound in a noble gas contained in a well-characterized acoustic resonator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using that approach, a breakthrough determination of kB was made in 1988 with a total uncertainty of 1.7 p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Refinements to this technique over the last 20 years have reduced its uncertainty to the 1 p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  level13,14, improving the uncertainty in the CODATA-recommended value for kB from 1.8 p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (CODATA-02) to 0.91 p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (CODATA-10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these superb measurements, it is important that different techniques are employed to measure kB to reduce the possibility of underestimating systematic uncertainties that may be inherent to any single technique15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The DBT approach is one of the most theoretically transparent of the new approaches to primary thermometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectrum of a gas sample is measured with high precision, and a theoretical model is fitted to the measured data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the model includes all of the relevant physics then one can accurately extract the contribution to spectral broadening arising solely from the thermal distribution of atomic/molecular speeds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ammonia probed by a frequency-stabilized CO2 laser at 1.34 m was the first thermometric substance employed in a DBT experiment16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, an extended-cavity diode laser at 2 m was used to probe a ro-vibrational transition of CO2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these first experiments, the lineshape was assumed to be a Gaussian or a Voigt profile (a Gaussian convolved with a Lorentzian).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since 2007, with the ambitious goal of approaching 1 p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  accuracy, substantial experimental and theoretical improvements have been made to DBT using ammonia18,19, oxygen20, ethyne21 and water22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, one key challenge peculiar to molecular absorbers is the need to account for complex collisional effects on the lineshape19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We avoid this by using a dilute atomic vapour23,24 with a strong dipole transition for which a tractable, microscopic theory has been developed25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The benefits of a range of different atomic species have been considered in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we present measurements of a transmission lineshape of cesium (Cs) vapour with a quantum-limited transmission uncertainty of 2 p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in a 1 s measurement, which is to our knowledge, a factor of 16 times superior to anything previously demonstrated28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This extreme precision, allows us to directly detect subtle lineshape perturbations that have not been previously observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation prompted the development of a theoretical model, which now allows us to discriminate between the internal atomic state dynamics and their external motional degrees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the model we are able to estimate the velocity dispersion of the atoms with a precision (s.e.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of 53 p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  during a single-line scan, taking 30 s. This is consistent with the sample s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (also 53 p.p.m.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  over multiple scans, demonstrating the excellent reproducibility of the spectrometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measurement precision averages down to 3.7 p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  after 200 scans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values are 7 times better than the previous best results28,29,30, and also yields a near-two-fold reduction in the uncertainty of the excited-state hyperfine splitting in Cs31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our measurement of the homogenous broadening component of the lineshape has a precision within a factor of two of the best ever measurements of natural linewidth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modest improvements in the probe laser performance would deliver a new result for the excited state lifetime of Cs in a system that is experimentally and theoretically much simpler than that typically used for lifetime studies32,33.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
