ERK5 signalling rescues intestinal epithelial turnover and tumour cell proliferation upon ERK1/2 abrogation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The ERK1/2 MAPK signalling module integrates extracellular cues that induce proliferation and differentiation of epithelial lineages, and is an established oncogenic driver, particularly in the intestine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the interrelation of the ERK1/2 module relative to other signalling pathways in intestinal epithelial cells and colorectal cancer (CRC) is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that loss of Erk1/2 in intestinal epithelial cells results in defects in nutrient absorption, epithelial cell migration and secretory cell differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, intestinal epithelial cell proliferation is not impeded, implying compensatory mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic deletion of Erk1/2 or pharmacological targeting of MEK1/2 results in supraphysiological activity of the ERK5 pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, targeting both pathways causes a more effective suppression of cell proliferation in murine intestinal organoids and human CRC lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that ERK5 provides a common bypass route in intestinal epithelial cells, which rescues cell proliferation upon abrogation of ERK1/2 signalling, with therapeutic implications in CRC.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) are part of the classical family of mammalian mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which also include three c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK1/2/3), four p38 isoforms and its lesser-known counterpart, ERK5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The serine/threonine kinases ERK1 (MAPK3, also known as p44 MAPK) and ERK2 (MAPK1, also known as p42 MAPK) show 83% amino acid identity, are ubiquitously expressed and typically activated by growth factors and phorbol esters, whereas the p38 and JNK pathways are mainly activated by inflammatory cytokines and stress1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MAPKs are involved in regulation of mitosis, gene expression, cell metabolism, cell motility and apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ERK1/2 are activated by MEK1 and MEK2, which themselves are activated by Raf-1, A-Raf or B-Raf1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ras proteins (K-Ras, H-Ras or N-Ras) are small GTPases that can be activated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which recruit Raf proteins to the plasma membrane where they are activated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these modules constitute the RasRafMEKERK pathway3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The activation of ERK1/2 results in their nuclear translocation where they can phosphorylate a variety of nuclear targets such as Elk-1, c-Fos and c-Myc1, in addition to p90 ribosomal S6 kinases (p90RSKs) and mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinases, MSK1/2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full repertoire of substrates for ERK1/2 consists of at least 160 cellular proteins4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These proteins are typically involved in the regulation of cell proliferationmore specifically, G1/S-phase cell cycle progressionand differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, their cellular effects are context-dependent and determined by the spatial and temporal dynamics of ERK1/2 activity5, which are highly regulated by scaffolding proteins and phosphatases3,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite vast literature on the role of ERK1/2 in cell proliferation, the absolute requirement of this signalling module in rapidly dividing tissues relative to other signalling pathways is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The small intestinal epithelium is particularly suitable to address this question given the short (48 days) and dynamic life cycle of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells at the intestinal crypt base produce transit-amplifying cells, which then undergo a number of proliferative cycles before terminal differentiation into absorptive enterocytes at the cryptvillus border.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enterocytes then migrate to the villus tip where they undergo anoikis and are shed into the gut lumen8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of these cellular events are tightly coordinated by the Wnt, Notch, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and Hedgehog pathways9, whereas the roles of ERK1/2 remain to be charted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the intestines, the ERK1/2 pathway is likely activated by autocrine and paracrine factors downstream of RTKs, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)10, and by exogenous microbial-derived substrates that signal through the Toll-like receptor (TLR)/MyD88 pathway11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To study the effects of ERK1/2 in the adult intestinal epithelium, we generated mice with a conditional (IEC-specific) and tamoxifen-inducible deletion of Erk2 on the Erk1/ background, which completely abrogates this pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the ERK1/2 signalling module, surprisingly, is dispensable for IEC proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic deletion of Erk1/2 in primary IEC or treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines with MEK1/2 inhibitors results in compensatory activation of the ERK5 pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the treatment of human CRC lines with a combination of MEK1/2 and ERK5 inhibitors is more efficacious in the inhibition of cancer cell growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, compensatory signalling by ERK5 suggests a potential rescue pathway that has clinical implications for targeted therapy in colorectal cancer.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

days of follow-up, whereas their fl/fl littermates remained healthy (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This coincided with the clinical signs of malabsorption, including progressive body weight loss and 100% lethality of IEC mice within 2 weeks of follow-up (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Necropsy was performed at day 10 of follow-up of tamoxifen-treated IEC mice and their fl/fl littermates to evaluate the underlying pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IEC mice showed luminal distension of the small intestine and loss of abdominal fat, as well as a trend for shortening of the small intestine and colon (Fig 1d,e and Supplementary Fig 2b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Serum analysis at day 10 revealed that IEC mice suffered from hypoalbuminaemia, hypoglycaemia, hypocalcaemia and decreased alkaline phosphatase levels when compared with fl/fl littermates (Fig 1fh and Supplementary Fig 2d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with steatorrhoea (Supplementary Fig 2f), these findings are indicative of malabsorption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IEC mice also showed lymphocytopenia and increased levels of faecal albumin (Supplementary Fig 2g,h), consistent with a protein-losing enteropathy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest a loss of absorptive surface in the small intestine and/or severe intestinal pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, normal serum levels of critical electrolytes, such as Na+, K+ and PO43, were maintained in IEC mice (Supplementary Fig 2i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the serum levels of lipids (triglycerides, cholesterol) were normal or even increased in IEC mice (Supplementary Fig 2j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hyperlipidaemia may be associated with loss of gut barrier function16, which also occurred in IEC mice (Supplementary Fig 2h,k), leading to lipid accumulation in the intestinal lamina propria (Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the Vil-CreERT2 model may lead to recombinase activity in the kidney14, which could explain some of the observed metabolic aberrations, we analysed kidney function in fl/fl and IEC mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not observe any microscopic differences in the parenchymal tissue indicative of kidney failure, nor increased blood urea nitrogen levels in IEC mice (Supplementary Fig 2l,m), suggesting the observed phenotype was primarily caused by intestinal pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Histological analysis showed that the cryptvillus morphology was severely perturbed in IEC mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This included signs of crypt elongation and villus shortening, more severely in the ileum compared with the jejunum and duodenum, respectively (Fig 1i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, at the most severely affected sites in the ileum, there was dilation of lacteals in villi, also known as intestinal lymphangiectasia (Fig 1i and Supplementary Fig 3b), consistent with protein-losing enteropathy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though alkaline phosphatase (AP) staining did not show differences by confocal fluorescence microscopy (Fig 1j and Supplementary Fig 3c), detailed analysis of the brush border on enterocytes by electron microscopy revealed that microvilli of IEC mice were short, thick and non-uniform (Fig 1k), a hallmark of defective enterocyte differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these observations indicate a malabsorption and protein-losing enteropathy phenotype, resulting in rapid lethality of IEC mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest an essential role for the ERK1/2 signalling module in the orchestration of normal cryptvillus architecture, maintenance of the gut barrier and absorptive enterocyte maturation in the small intestine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'ERK1/2IEC has no major effects on colon homeostasis', 'Although efficient knockout was achieved in the colon by tamoxifen treatment in Erk1/;Erk2fl/fl;Vil-CreERT2 mice (Fig 1a and Supplementary Fig 1b,c), no gross alterations were observed in the colon crypt architecture resulting from IEC (Supplementary Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More detailed analysis showed a loss of the luminal, flat epithelial sheet in the colon (Supplementary Fig 3dg), analogous to the villous changes in the small intestine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Erk1/2 deletion in the colon did not result in perturbation of goblet cell differentiation or an increased rate of apoptosis (Supplementary Fig 3hk).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the lack of a spontaneous phenotype in the colon in IEC mice, we focused on the changes in physiology in the small intestine hereafter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'ERK1/2IEC leads to migration and differentiation defects', 'We hypothesized that the architectural derangement in the small intestine of IEC mice might be explained by a migration defect on loss of epithelial ERK1/2 signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, we observed retention of AP-positive IECs in small intestinal crypts in IEC mice, whereas AP immunoreactivity is normally not observed distal to the cryptvillus junction (Fig 1j and Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BrdU pulse-chase experiments demonstrated a dramatic reduction in the migratory rate of epithelial cells in IEC mice compared with fl/fl littermates (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This defect appeared to involve mostly migration in the villous compartment, which was observed  greater than 24 h after BrdU labelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differentiation and maturation of epithelial cells from the secretory lineagemost prominently, goblet and Paneth cellsare directly correlated with their position along the cryptvillus axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The long-lived Paneth cells make antimicrobial peptides and provide a stem cell niche at the crypt base; goblet cells produce mucus17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Less abundant secretory cell types include enteroendocrine cells that release a variety of hormones, and Tuft cells that produce eicosanoids17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These secretory cells, with the exception of Paneth cells, follow the migration pattern of absorptive enterocytes and share their fate at the villus tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we observed reduced numbers and an irregular distribution of Alcian blue-positive staining goblet cells in the small intestine of IEC mice when compared with fl/fl littermates (Fig 2c, Supplementary Fig 4bd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paneth cells, which can be identified by positive staining for the granule protein matrilysin (also known as matrix metalloproteinase 7, MMP7), displayed more dramatic changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paneth cells in IEC mice were mislocalized along the cryptvillus axis, showed reduced granule contents and had smaller secretory granules that were heterogeneous in size and found outside the apical cytoplasm (Fig 2df).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MMP7+ cells in the small intestine of IEC mice also showed a more rounded morphology rather than their regular wedge-like shape in fl/fl control littermates, even though they expressed the prototypical Paneth cell marker Cryptdin (Fig 2f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alcian blue/MMP7 double staining showed an increased number of cells expressing the Paneth cell marker, with a relative loss of mucin positive cells (Supplementary Fig 4c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that these observations might be explained by a differentiation block in the secretory lineage, resulting in the accumulation of immature intermediate cellsa precursor cell type that is normally rarely found in the lateral wall of the crypt base18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not observe any intermediate cells in the ileal sections from fl/fl mice, which showed the typical electron microscopic features of mature goblet and Paneth cells, respectively (Fig 2h,i and Supplementary Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, intermediate cells were evident in the ileal sections from IEC littermates (Fig 2h,i), with their goblet cells showing larger electrodense cores, and conversely, Paneth cells displaying smaller cores and increased amounts of free ribosomes in the cytoplasm (Supplementary Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that ERK1/2 signalling is critical for the migration of IEC along the cryptvillus axis, in addition to the full differentiation and maturation of IEC from the secretory cell lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Abnormal IEC migration and secretory cell differentiation in Erk1/2IEC mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ag) Comparison of ileum sections from fl/fl and IEC

progression, there were no signs of epithelial cell hypoproliferation in IEC mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, we observed crypt hyperplasia and an increased number of Ki67+ cells in the ileum (Fig 3a,b and Supplementary Fig 5a) and to a lesser degree in the colon (Supplementary Fig 5b,c) of IEC mice compared with fl/fl littermates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was associated with increased expression of the proliferation marker PCNA and cell cycle-associated protein cyclin D1 (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upregulation of cyclin D1 promotes progression through the G1/S-phase, thus indicating that on genetic ablation of ERK1/2, cell cycling in the intestinal epithelium remains intact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no direct evidence for upregulated Wnt/-catenin signalling in IEC after ERK1/2 deletion in vivo

found that treatment of the colorectal cancer cell line, HCT116, with the MEK1/2 inhibitor, PD0325901, was more effective in suppressing cell proliferation in combination with ERK5 inhibitor, XMD8-92, compared with either treatment alone (Fig 6a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were achieved by measuring cells in S/G2/M-phase by propidium iodide labelling after treatment with DMSO, MEK1/2 inhibitor alone, ERK5 inhibitor alone or the combination of both inhibitors, respectively (Supplementary Fig 7a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results were confirmed in the other CRC cell lines, including DLD-1, HT-29 and SW480 (Supplementary Fig 7c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, siRNA-mediated knockdown of ERK1/2 and/or ERK5 validated these MAPKs as drug targets in CRC, although cell lines were relatively more susceptible to ERK1/2 knockdown (Supplementary Fig 7e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then used a three-dimensional growth model with intestinal organoids generated from Apcfl/fl mice25, that were transduced with Adeno-Cre in vitro (referred to hereafter as Apc/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intestinal organoids with a somatic deletion of tumour suppressor APC display upregulated Wnt signalling activity, which results in a rounded, cyst-like morphology, distinct from wild-type organoids26 (Supplementary Fig 7g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously shown that ERK1/2 signalling is required for Wnt-driven adenoma formation in vivo11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, intestinal organoids that are APC deficient showed upregulated levels of p-ERK1/2 and p-ERK5 compared with WT organoids (Fig 6c).

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Here we show that ERK1/2 signalling in mouse intestinal epithelium is dispensable for cell proliferation, while it resulted in abnormal differentiation of enterocytes, wasting disease and ultimately lethality (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these findings, ERK1/2 MAPKs were shown to be associated with the enterocyte brush border and activated upon RTK stimulation or feeding27 or electrical field stimulation in polarized epithelium28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This seems at odds with literature that suggest that maintained ERK1/2 signalling precludes enterocyte differentiation29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A possible explanation for this discrepancy could be that cycling IEC in the transit amplifying zone of the crypt require relatively high levels of active ERK1/2, which is readily blocked by pharmacological intervention, whereas a transition to low level ERK1/2 activity in IEC migrating into the villus compartment promotes the absorptive enterocyte differentiation program that is only perturbed upon complete genetic deletion of Erk1/2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Little is known about the role of ERK1/2 signalling in the life cycle of secretory cells in the gut.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent report by Heuberger et al.15 described that IEC-specific deletion of non-receptor tyrosine phosphatase, Shp2, resulted in the loss of p-ERK1/2 levels in the small intestine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This coincided with an increased number of Paneth cells at the expense of goblet cells in the small intestine, as well as shortening of villi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also observed the strongest staining for epithelial p-ERK1/2 in the TA zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This p-ERK1/2+ staining pattern and the architectural organization of the TA zone were lost in Shp2 knockout mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the deleterious effects of Shp2 deficiency were rescued by expression of constitutively active MEK1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A model was proposed in which the balance between Wnt/-catenin and MAPK signalling determines Paneth cell versus goblet cell differentiation, respectively15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This proposed crucial role for ERK1/2 MAPK signalling in intestinal secretory cell differentiation is consistent with our observations in ERK1/2IECmice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Migration and differentiation are functionally intertwined in the intestines, as demonstrated by the immature phenotype of mislocalized Paneth cells observed in IEC mice (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Critical to epithelial cell migration is proper cytoskeleton reorganization mediated by the small GTPases of the Rho family, cell polarization regulated by Cdc42 and dynamic adhesion through cellmatrix and cellcell interaction via integrin/FAK/Src signalling31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ERK1/2 module is used as a downstream effector of many of these pathways in the intestine, including Rho GTPases32, FAK33 and Src34, and has been suggested to promote cell motility33,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RTK signalling also contributes to cell migration, for example, EphEphrin receptor interactions are crucial for correct positioning of Paneth cells36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ephrin receptor-induced epithelial cell migration has been shown to be mediated by Src and ERK1/2 activation37,38, which may explain the Paneth cell mislocalization observed in IEC mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, the ERK1/2 module is indispensable for full maturation of both absorptive enterocytes and the secretory lineage (Fig 7a), confirming its crucial role in the integration of cellular cues required for determination of epithelial cell fate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: Roles of ERK1/2 and ERK5 in intestinal homeostasis and tumorigenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) When the ERK1/2 pathway is intact, extracellular cues that are transduced via RTKs or GPCRs activate Ras under physiological conditions, or alternatively, Ras is constitutively active in colorectal cancer (Ras*), which preferentially activates the RafMEK1/2ERK1/2 module.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nuclear and transcriptional targets of ERK1/2 are crucial for enterocyte and secretory cell differentiation, IEC migration, as well as cell proliferation under homeostatic and oncogenic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, ERK1/2 activation also results in the activation of negative feedback mechanisms that suppress its upstream kinases (for example, RTKs, son of sevenless, Raf) and activate dual specificity phosphatases (DUSPs), resulting in the silencing of the ERK5 module.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Upon abrogation of MEK1/2 or genetic knockout of Erk1/2, the lack of negative feedback mechanisms (that is, feedback activation) results in upregulation of the RasRafMEK5ERK5 module, which maintains cell proliferation under physiological conditions, or results in continued tumour cell proliferation in colorectal cancer, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the lack of activation of ERK1/2-specific targets results in differentiation and migration defects of intestinal epithelial cells culminating in malabsorption, wasting disease and mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compensatory upregulation of the ERK5 pathway in CRC can be reversed by targeted treatment with its specific inhibitor, XMD8-92.Full size image', 'An unexpected finding was the redundancy of ERK1/2 in the gut with regard to cell proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Erk1/2 deletion was compensated by upregulated ERK5 signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic targeting of ERK1/2 in vitro previously showed that Erk2 knockdown is more effective than Erk1 knockdown in suppressing cell proliferation, although this may be related to higher expression levels of the former39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of gene dosage was demonstrated in vivo by the observations that while Erk1/ mice are viable12 and Erk2/ mice die in utero13, Erk2+/ mice are only viable when at least one copy of Erk1 is present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, mice heterozygous (+/) for both Erk1 and Erk2 alleles were born at lower than Mendelian ratio39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, it was reported that transgenic expression of ERK1 can compensate for Erk2 deletion40, demonstrating functional redundancy between both family members.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of Erk1/2 in adult skin tissue resulted in hypoplasia, which was associated with G2/M cell cycle arrest, without notable differentiation defects of keratinocytes41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data differ from our observations in the intestines, which might be explained by incomplete and transient siRNA-mediated knockdown of ERK1/2 in primary keratinocyte cultures41, compared with more efficient genomic deletion of Erk1 and Erk2 that is typically achieved by the Villin-Cre-ERT2 system14, possibly resulting in different outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Both ERK1/2 and ERK5 have been described to promote cell cycle progression, although they have different upstream signalling partners, MEK1/2 and MEK5, respectively1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, ERK2 and ERK5 proteins share only about 66% sequence identity, and MEK5 is phosphorylated by MEKK2/3, which can also activate the p38 and JNK pathways42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ERK5 pathway is classically activated by stress stimuli, in addition to mitogens; thus, it shares features of both the ERK1/2, and p38 and JNK pathways, respectively43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ERK5 induces expression of cyclin D1 (refs 44, 45), and suppresses expression of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors46, thereby promoting G1/S-phase cell cycle progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the role of ERK5 in IEC differentiation and intestinal homeostasis is currently unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockout of Erk1/2 in IEC induced activity of ERK5, which was not detectable in naive mice (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that the ERK1/2 and ERK5 modules may share proximal signalling components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although EGFR is a likely candidate in this context19,20, we found that abrogation of EGFR signalling did not prevent enhanced ERK5 activity upon MEK1/2 inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it was originally suggested that ERK5 signalling is independent of Ras20, other groups established that Ras, either through physiological signalling47, or by its oncogenic activity48,49, activates the MEK5ERK5 signalling axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, rewiring of signalling networks downstream of Ras could explain the supraphysiological activity of ERK5 upon conditional deletion of Erk1/2 in the intestines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, it has been shown that ERK1/2 signalling mediates negative feedback on ERK5 activity50, possibly through transcriptional activation of dual specificity phosphatases (DUSPs)51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, ERK1/2-induced FOS-like antigen 1 (Fra-1) may negatively regulate MEK5 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that ERK5 is a default bypass route downstream of RTK-Ras and activated upon loss of ERK1/2-mediated repression, thereby ensuring the transduction of mitogenic signals to the nucleus (Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this concept, we found that ERK5 inhibition induces atrophy of IEC intestinal organoids (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, important downstream transcriptional targets of ERK5 and ERK1/2 overlap, such as immediate-early gene Fra1 and oncogene c-Myc, whereas c-Fos and Egr1 were specifically induced by ERK1/2 (Fig 6 and Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specificity of ERK1/2 over ERK5 and other MAPK family members for the activation of c-Fos has been previously described53, demonstrating their differential biological output despite the shared ability to transduce potent mitogenic signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our findings may be relevant for the use of MAPK inhibitors in the treatment of colorectal cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there was only a mild phenotype in the colons of IEC mice under homeostatic conditions, the RasRAFMEKERK pathway is generally upregulated in malignant cells including CRC54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeted therapy typically results in feedback activation of upstream players of the targeted kinase, which are then able to reactivate the same pathway or utilize bypass signalling routes55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, on activation, ERK1/2 phosphorylates EGFR, son of sevenless56, and Raf57, thereby terminating upstream signalling activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockout of Erk1/2 eliminates this negative feedback.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that ERK5 is a putative resistance pathway in the context of targeted treatment with MEK1/2 or ERK1/2 inhibitors (Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different classes of MEK1/2 inhibitors display various modes of resistance to therapy (innate, adaptive and acquired)58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since we have only used one MEK1/2 inhibitor (PD0325901) in our studies, it will be necessary to evaluate other classes of inhibitors in combination with ERK5 inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, while treatment with either the MEK1/2 or ERK5 inhibitor suppressed tumour growth in murine Apc/ organoids, only the latter was able to inhibit the proliferation of Apc/;KRASG12V organoids (Fig 6), which are more representative of human CRC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with this, suppression of ERK5 expression by forced expression of miR-143/145 inhibited intestinal adenoma formation in the ApcMin/+ model59, and activated MEK5 correlated with more invasive CRC in human60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ERK5 has been previously reported to mediate resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy-induced apoptosis61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highly specific and bioavailable ERK5 inhibitor, XMD8-92, has shown antitumour effects in multiple preclinical cancer models by inhibiting tumour angiogenesis, metastasis and chemo-resistance62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, ERK5 inhibition does not induce feedback activation of upstream or parallel signalling pathways62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, the ERK1/2 and ERK5 MAPK modules display a high degree of signalling plasticity in the intestinal epithelium, which has implications for targeted treatment of colorectal cancer.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
