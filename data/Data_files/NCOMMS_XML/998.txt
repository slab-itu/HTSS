TWEAK mediates inflammation in experimental atopic dermatitis and psoriasis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis are driven by alternate type 2 and type 17 immune responses, but some proteins might be critical to both diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that a deficiency of the TNF superfamily molecule TWEAK (TNFSF12) in mice results in defective maintenance of AD-specific T helper type 2 (Th2) and psoriasis-specific Th17 cells in the skin, and impaired expression of disease-characteristic chemokines and cytokines, such as CCL17 and TSLP in AD, and CCL20 and IL-19 in psoriasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TWEAK receptor, Fn14, is upregulated in keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts, and TWEAK induces these cytokines and chemokines alone and in synergy with the signature T helper cytokines of either disease, IL-13 and IL-17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, subcutaneous injection of recombinant TWEAK into naive mice induces cutaneous inflammation with histological and molecular signs of both diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TWEAK is therefore a critical contributor to skin inflammation and a possible therapeutic target in AD and psoriasis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis are inflammatory disorders of the skin that cause substantial morbidity1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although most cases are mild, some patients experience severe or widespread disease that can be physically, socially and emotionally debilitating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Allergens are the primary cause of AD, whereas the triggers for psoriasis are not clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each disease is probably multifactorial, with interplay of genetic predisposition and environmental factors3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both diseases feature infiltration of immune cells, dermal changes, and epidermal acanthosis and hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts are of central importance to the pathogenesis of AD and psoriasis by responding to external and internal danger signals and expressing proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which attract cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems5,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these commonalities, AD and psoriasis are believed to develop through distinct immunological programs and may engage mutually biased immune signatures, with type 2 immune responses dominating AD9 and type 17 immune responses dominating psoriasis10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A clinical study demonstrated that blocking IL-4 and IL-13 is beneficial for patients with treatment-resistant AD13, whereas inhibition of IL-23 p19 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14) or IL-17A (refs 15, 16, 17) is highly effective in treating psoriasis patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless of the success of these current treatments, whether they will be completely effective at reducing all symptoms or will result in long-lasting control is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Continuing efforts to better understand the molecular basis of these diseases may lead to new anti-inflammatory drugs that could be either stand-alone treatments, or be combined with existing therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Many members of the TNF superfamily are emerging as important modulators of immune-mediated disorders18,19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blockers of TNF (TNFSF2) are already approved as anti-inflammatory agents for plaque psoriasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another family member, TWEAK (TNFSF12), can be expressed by myeloid, stromal and epithelial cells of various tissues and binds to its specific receptor Fn14 (TNFRSF12A) that is expressed on a range of target cells22,23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fn14 has a low level of ubiquitous expression on many cells, but is induced under conditions of stress or inflammation, one of the main regulatory mechanisms for TWEAK/Fn14 action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fn14 has been shown to induce canonical and non-canonical NFB signalling and leads to the expression of a number of inflammatory mediators in various cell types that can contribute to tissue inflammation and regenerative activities22,23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TWEAK has been shown to participate in several inflammatory conditions in mice, including ischemia and reperfusion injury and neurodegeneration, inflammatory bowel disease, hepatitis, arthritis, and lupus-like kidney disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the current study, we show a major role of the TWEAK/Fn14 pathway in immune-mediated skin inflammation using gene-deficient mice in clinically relevant models of AD and psoriasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, subcutaneus injection of TWEAK in naive animals is sufficient to induce localized skin inflammation with histological and molecular features of both AD and psoriasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify several inflammatory mediators that are controlled by TWEAK in vivo, and show that epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts are cellular targets of TWEAK that contribute to production of these mediators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include proinflammatory chemokines common to AD and psoriasis, namely CCL2, CCL5 and CCL7, that mediate recruitment of monocytes, T cells, and eosinophils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, TWEAK can enhance production of more disease-specific chemokines and cytokines, such as CCL17, CCL20, TSLP and IL-19 that further orchestrate skin inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that TWEAK is a critical mediator of the pathogenesis of both disorders.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

however, these features were strongly reduced in TWEAK-deficient animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line, there was markedly less epidermal thickness in TWEAK-deficient animals, including a reduction in hyperkeratosis (Fig 2ce).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dermal contribution in this disease model is minor (Fig 2c,e), in contrast to the AD model where both epidermal and dermal changes are evident.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, the expression of IL-17A mRNA in the skin, and the frequency of Th17 cells in the draining lymph nodes, was strikingly lower in the absence of TWEAK at the end of the experiment (Fig 2f), whereas mRNA for IL-17A and CD4+ T cells expressing IL-17 were not affected at early times (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that a Th17 response was initiated in the absence of TWEAK, but this could not be maintained in the skin over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, these results indicate that TWEAK is instrumental in the development of the characteristic histological features of both AD and psoriasis, and the absence of TWEAK/Fn14 interactions can limit the adaptive immune response in the skin regardless of the type 2 phenotype characteristic of AD or the type 17 phenotype characteristic of psoriasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'TWEAK regulates immune cell infiltration in skin lesions', 'We next analysed the cellular infiltrates of lesional skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the AD model, a mononuclear (CD45+CD11b+) and eosinophil dominant infiltrate was evident in dermatitis lesions (Fig 1h, Supplementary Fig 5 for gating strategy).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Skin infiltrates appeared after 4 days and accumulated thereafter until full establishment of disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the psoriasis model, a prominent mononuclear and transient granulocytic infiltrate was evident in lesions within the first days of disease (Fig 2h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eosinophils were virtually absent in IMQ-induced disease because of the lack of a Th2 response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, in both models, TWEAK-deficient animals showed significantly reduced numbers of infiltrating CD45+ cells compared to WT littermates, and reduced numbers of CD11b+ myeloid cells were evident in skin lesions of HDM-treated (Fig 1h) and IMQ-treated (Fig 2h) mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eosinophils were also almost absent in HDM-primed TWEAK-deficient animals (Fig 1h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that TWEAK directly or indirectly controls the recruitment and/or maintenance of innate inflammatory cells in the skin in addition to regulating the persistent accumulation of Th2 and Th17 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'TWEAK is sufficient to induce skin inflammation', 'To further understand the mechanism of action of TWEAK, we asked whether the recombinant protein alone was able to drive skin inflammation in the absence of any other inflammatory stimulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, we injected naive animals with rTWEAK as an Ig fusion protein, or an irrelevant control Ig, via the subcutaneous route.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, several injections of rTWEAK over 2 weeks in the rostral regions of the back induced a clinically defined dermatitis localized to the region of injection with features of both AD and psoriasis, although rTWEAK alone did not entirely mimic the phenotypes seen in the HDM and IMQ models (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single dose of rTWEAK had a rapid effect on epidermal hyperplasia (Fig 3b, day 4), although this effect increased with further doses over time (Fig 3b, days 10 and 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, dermal reactions only became evident after repetitive administrations (Fig 3c, days 10 and 14, and Fig 3a), thus in total resembling a mix of histology observed in the AD and psoriasis models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, Fn14-deficient animals were completely protected from skin inflammation and epidermal and dermal hyperplasia, indicating a specific activity of rTWEAK via its receptor Fn14 (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of infiltrates revealed that rTWEAK induced monocyte accumulation and moderate eosinophilia in the skin (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, rTWEAK is sufficient to independently promote skin inflammation and at least some activities associated with AD and psoriasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: rTWEAK induces skin inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) Naive WT mice were injected with 75 g mouse rTWEAK or IgG, administered s.c. either four times during a 14 day period (a), or once with analysis on day 4, or twice weekly with analysis on day 10 (b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Massons trichrome staining of representative skin sections on day 14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 200 m.

been shown to be primarily involved in Th2 responses and AD, or Th17 responses and psoriasis, respectively36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By quantitative PCR analysis, we confirmed strong upregulation of these chemokines in skin specimens after a single injection of rTWEAK (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the importance of several of these molecules in TWEAK-mediated skin inflammation, we blocked CCL2, CCL5 and CCL7 together, by injecting neutralizing antibodies at the time of rTWEAK injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, this significantly ameliorated skin infiltrates, epidermal thickening and the

CCL7, and furthermore, we found defective production of CCL17 and CCL20 in mice lacking TWEAK in the AD model and the psoriasis model, respectively (Fig 4g,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that TWEAK-deficient animals are incapable of inducing a sustained inflammatory chemokine milieu within the skin which may explain why they cannot maintain disease-mediating immune cells in the context of AD and psoriasis reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'TWEAK induces chemokine expression in keratinocytes', 'One likely source of chemokines in the skin is the keratinocyte.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We visualized Fn14 in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (Fig 5a) and a murine keratinocyte cell line (Supplementary Fig 4a) by flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first tested whether TWEAK could induce production in human keratinocytes of the five chemokines that we choose as the focus of our further studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also tested whether TWEAK might function in synergy with the signature cytokines of AD and psoriasis, IL-13 and IL-17A, whose receptors are also expressed on keratinocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  rTWEAK alone had mild/moderate activity in inducing CCL2, 5, and 17 (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, enhanced expression of CCL2 and CCL5 was observed when rTWEAK was combined with either recombinant IL-13 or IL-17A, whereas TWEAK-induced CCL17 was augmented by rIL-13 but not rIL-17 in line with CCL17 being associated with type 2 responses (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CCL7 and CCL20 were not induced by any of these molecules in isolation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, CCL7 was produced when rTWEAK was combined with rIL-13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CCL20 was upregulated when rTWEAK acted together with either cytokine, although in line with CCL20 being more associated with type 17 responses, a greater effect was seen with TWEAK and IL-17 (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings were also replicated to a large extent with the murine keratinocyte cell line PAM212.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

specifically augmenting CCL17 with rIL-13 and CCL20 with rIL-17 (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data, combined with our in vivo mouse results, show that TWEAK can directly promote chemokines that are common to both AD and psoriasis, as well as can enhance expression of chemokines that are more specifically associated with the type 2 and type 17 responses underlying these

6a,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TSLP has been found upregulated in skin lesions of AD patients38, and IL-19 has been shown to be upregulated in the skin of psoriasis patients39,40 (Fig 6a,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The epithelial cell barrier contributes to local immune homoeostasis and efforts to modulate the response of these cells to inflammatory signals are ongoing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the cytokines IL-17A and IL-13 that are current targets of clinical therapy for the skin inflammatory diseases psoriasis and AD have receptors expressed on keratinocytes, and it has been postulated that the efficacy of neutralizing these cytokines in suppressing disease symptoms is in part related to dampening keratinocyte activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We now identify keratinocytes, as well as dermal fibroblasts, as cells that can upregulate a number of chemoattractive and proinflammatory factors that are associated with AD and psoriasis in response to TWEAK, and that TWEAK can also synergize with signals from IL-17A or IL-13 to further upregulate some of these molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compellingly, a genetic deficiency in TWEAK in mice, or neutralizing this molecule, ameliorated skin inflammatory activity characteristic of both AD and psoriasis, implying that TWEAK may have a key role in the pathogenesis of both human disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The notion that AD and psoriasis are mutually exclusive diseases in humans stems from an immunological standpoint from experimental and clinical results suggesting that they are driven by separate lineages of T cells, as well as other immune cell types, that contribute Th2 versus Th17 cytokines, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given that these individual T-cell populations and characteristic cytokines are key drivers of the phenotype and pathology of each disease, it is still likely that there are inflammatory factors that will be common to both diseases that will aid, regulate or synergize with, these individual T-cell populations or cytokines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data clearly demonstrate that TWEAK is important for maximal disease in two well-established models of AD and psoriasis that display the Th2 (IL-13) or Th17 (IL-17) phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We validate in our studies that these cytokines and resultant immune cell phenotype (presence or absence of eosinophils) are exclusive to each of our models, but importantly show that in either case TWEAK and its receptor are upregulated at the same time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rationale for why TWEAK and Fn14 can participate in so-called mutually exclusive skin diseases is then that these molecules are not restricted to a particular lineage of cells, they do not control the generation of these lineages of cells, and they do not rely on these specialized lineages for their production or upregulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TWEAK alone cannot promote full AD or psoriasis phenotypes but it can promote chemokines common to both AD and psoriasis from keratinocytes and fibroblasts, as well as characteristic cytokines of both diseases such as TSLP and IL-19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As importantly, TWEAK can synergize with the disease-specific cytokines IL-13 and IL-17 in these activities, further explaining why this one pathway can be important for pathology in two diseases thought to be fundamentally different from one another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A primary effect of TWEAK in the skin, revealed by subcutaneous injection of the recombinant protein, was to promote expression of multiple chemokines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies over the past 10 years have solidified the notion that chemokines are pivotal in determining the localization of immune cells, maintenance of normal immune system function, and defense against pathogens46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover it is evident that dysregulated expression of chemokines is critially involved in the recruitment and persistence of pathogenic inflammatory cells in target organs, including the skin47, although the primary factors that control chemokine production in specific tissues are still not clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In active AD and psoriatic lesions, many CC and CXC chemokines have been found abundantly expressed, suggesting that their presence is pivotal to disease pathogenesis47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a comprehensive picture is not clear, the chemokine signatures in human AD and psoriasis biopsies show not only molecules characteristic to each disease, but also a number that are shared between the diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data now reveal that there are factors like TWEAK that are capable of providing the stimulus for the production of many of these chemokines in the skin regardless of the underlying pathology of the specific skin disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'TWEAK alone had some effect on chemokine production in vitro in keratinocytes, but this was broadened and enhanced by synergistic signals from IL-13 and IL-17, two of the primary factors critical for the pathogenesis of AD and psoriasis, respectively, suggesting the likelihood of co-operation in vivo between these cytokines in controlling chemokine expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, interestingly, a deficiency in TWEAK strongly ameliorated skin chemokine expression, suggesting its activity is dominant and not compensated by these other factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blocking individual chemokines therapeutically in inflammatory disorders has largely proven ineffective, likely due to redundancy of these molecules, many of which can act through the same receptor, as well as plasticity of the inflammatory milieu in complex inflammatory disorders48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But, targeting upstream signals, such as from TWEAK/Fn14, that can influence the production of multiple chemokines, could be a more attractive therapeutic option to alter the global chemokine signature associated with skin inflammatory diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we show that keratinocytes can be one source of these molecules downstream of TWEAK, there are additional possible targets of TWEAK activity that might also contribute to the chemokines induced in the skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This will be of interest to understand in future studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, other reports of TWEAK in variable structural cell populations not associated with the skin, such as HUVECs, rat brain endothelial cells, murine and human renal mesangial and tubular cells, mouse synovial cells and human corneal myofibroblasts, have shown it capable of inducing CCL2 and 5, and CXCL1, 8, and 10 (refs 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, this implies that TWEAK may be a strong orchestrator of chemokine production in several skin cell types, and that TWEAK may be a primary regulator of chemokine production in many tissues if it is highly upregulated during disease progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to chemokines, we found that TWEAK activity was required in vivo for the production of two other mediators of atopic dermatitits or psoriasis, TSLP and IL-19, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TSLP has been associated with a number of allergic Th2 responses56, and its transgenic overexpression in keratinocytes in mice resulted in development of AD symptoms57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TSLP is highly expressed in the lesional skin of AD patients, as well as a related skin disease, scleroderma58,59, and may have multiple targets on which it acts that perpetuate skin disease, including dendritic cells, mast cells, eosinophils and innate lymphoid type 2 cells56,60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-19, along with several other members of the IL-10 family, are upregulated in psoriasis lesional skin40,61,62,63,64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exact role of IL-19 is not clear, but it has been suggested, in synergy with IL-20 and IL-24 that share the same receptor, to enhance the epidermal hyperplastic process, promote keratinocyte migration and drive production of several factors by keratinocytes or fibroblasts, such as anti-microbial peptides like S100A7 that are found in psoriasis as well as keratinocyte growth factor65,66,67.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding that TWEAK can promote the expression of both TSLP and IL-19 from keratinocytes or dermal fibroblasts provides a further mechanism by which TWEAK can contribute to the development and/or maintenance of the clinical phenotypes of both AD and psoriasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is also likely that TWEAK/Fn14 interactions might promote other activities that are relevant to either AD or psoriasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One study of human foreskin keratinocytes found that TWEAK had a mild effect in promoting their proliferation when combined with a cocktail of cytokines that included IL-17 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  68), and another suggested that TWEAK signals could enhance the effect of TNF and promote a low level of apoptosis in primary human epidermal keratinocytes69.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both phenomena could also contribute to the disease phenotypes seen in AD and psoriasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Possibly relevant to the latter activity, a recent report by Etemadi et al.70 described a psoriasis-like disease in animals carrying a keratinocyte-specific deficiency for Traf2, an adaptor molecule of a number of TNFR superfamily members, including Fn14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, this inflammatory phenotype was driven by cell death and non-canonical NF-B activation and was partially dependent on TNF activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is tempting to speculate that TWEAK may have also been active in this spontaneous disease and contributed to non-canonical NF-B signalling in keratinocytes, and their apoptosis and activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary our data show that TWEAK activity is required for maximal clinical, histological and immunological symptoms in experimental models of AD and psoriasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, a recent publication also demonstrated that Fn14-deficient mice on the MRL/lpr background were protected from developing skin inflammation in this model of lupus erythematosus, and that Fn14 was highly upregulated in lesional skin from SLE patients71.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data, together with these results, then suggest that TWEAK might be a ubiquitous regulator of skin inflammation regardless of the origin of the disease, and that TWEAK-blocking reagents may be useful for the treatment of other immune-driven disorders as well as AD and psoriasis that involve deregulated dermal and epidermal activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is further possible that the activity of TWEAK extends from the inflammatory skin diseases to other forms of skin pathology, such as those that occur from irradiation, heat damage, or trauma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these cases, the question is whether TWEAK and/or Fn14 are upregulated in the skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the notion that the stimuli for these pathologies are stress-related but generally short lived, TWEAK and Fn14 may be transiently active and in these circumstances could recruit immune cells, or promote activities in structural cells, that contribute to the resolution phase of tissue damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will be important in future studies to understand if the action of TWEAK and Fn14 encompasses such nonspecific skin conditions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
