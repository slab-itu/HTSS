Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Anisotropic properties of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials make them promising in the application of next-generation electronic devices, among which graphene and few-layer graphene (FLG) have been most intensively studied for thermal management, due to their extraordinarily high in-plane thermal conductivity 1,2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, Yan et al.6 reported that the maximum hotspot temperature can be lowered by 20 °C in transistors operating at 13 W mm1 using FLG as a heat spreader for a gallium nitride (GaN) transistor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gao et al.7 reported that the maximum hotspot temperature decreased from 121 to 108 °C (T=13 °C) for a heat flux of 430 W cm2 after the introduction of a single-layer graphene heat spreader.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the simulations of graphene heat spreaders were also reported for silicon-on-insulator integrated circuits8 and three-dimensional (3D) integrated circuits9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thermal conductivity of a graphene laminate film supported on substrate was also investigated and found to remain rather large10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in most practical applications, graphene/FLG will be supported by and integrated with insulators, both in electronic circuitry and heat-spreader applications11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, thermal energy flow will be limited both by the in-plane thermal conductivity  of the supported graphene/FLG and by the thermal boundary resistance (R) at the graphene/FLGsubstrate interface12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Owing to their exceedingly large surface-to-volume ratio, the properties of 2D layered materials are very sensitive to the interactions with external bodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, when supported on an amorphous substrate,  of suspended graphene decreased by almost one order of magnitude, from 4,000 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13) to 600 W m1 K1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a striking discrepancy in  significantly limits the thermal performance of graphene/FLG in real applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is reported that the different behaviours are due to the strong scattering of the important heat-carrying flexural acoustic (ZA) modes15 to the substrate16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, it was identified that the phonon relaxation times of graphene ZA modes are suppressed when supported on a SiO2 substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies have improved our fundamental understanding in the physics behind the problem, and it was suggested that making rational choice of the substrate material14,17 and modulating its coupling to graphene12 may be useful to improve  of the supported graphene/FLG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The thermal boundary resistance (R) of a graphene/FLGsubstrate interface is another limiting factor to their thermal performance in devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Covalent functionalization has been proved to efficiently promote heat transfer between interfaces by introducing additional thermal pathways through the functionalizing molecules18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) were used to functionalize metallic surfaces to enhance heat transport across metalwater20,27, metalgas28, metalsemiconductor21 and metalpolymer31 interfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functionalization was used in graphene and carbon nanotube nanocomposites to mitigate the high thermal boundary resistance between the graphene/carbon nanotube fillers and the polymer matrices18,25,26,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functionalized molecules also assist to align and densely pack multilayer graphene sheets and reduce the interlayer thermal resistance of graphene25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, it was shown that plasma-functionalized graphene raised the cross-plane thermal conductance between aluminium and its substrate by a factor of two19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the functionalization-introduced point defects will further decrease  of the supported graphene/FLG, as they introduce phonon-scattering centres25,32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To correct this drawback, a robust solution that maintains the high thermal conductivity of graphene/FLG when supported, while effectively reducing the interface thermal resistance is needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we demonstrate that thermal management of a micro heater is considerably improved via introducing alternative heat-spreading channels implemented with graphene-based film (GBF) bonded to functionalized graphene oxide (FGO) through amino-silane molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We probed interface thermal resistance by photothermal reflectance measurements to demonstrate an improved thermal coupling due to functionalization on the graphenegraphene oxide interface and the graphene oxidesilica interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular dynamics simulations and ab initio calculations reveal that the functionalization constrains the cross-plane scattering of low-frequency phonons, which in turn enhances in-plane heat conduction of the bonded graphene film by recovering the long flexural phonon lifetime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results provide evidence that a graphene film deposited on a FGO substrate provides a very attractive platform for thermal management applications.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Graphene-based film and graphene oxide and device', 'A GBF bonded to the FGO substrate through silane molecules is shown in Fig 1a,b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To synthesize GBF and FGO experimentally (Fig 1c), we first prepared a graphene oxide (GO) dispersion (see Experimental method).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FGO was obtained by functionalizing GO with a silane-based chemistry suitable for reactive oxide-forming surfaces including the basal plane of GO and SiO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3-Amino-propyltriethoxysilane (APTES) has three SiO groups and one NH2 end, as shown in Fig 1a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to the simple chemistry and unique multifunctional nature of APTES, it can easily bind two different substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our case, the SiO end of APTES binds to the GO substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SiOC2H5 groups of APTES hydrolyse in water and form crosslink bonds with each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crosslinked SiO structure acts as a strong bonding layer between the substrate and GBFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the NH2 end of APTES binds onto carboxyl groups on the functionalized graphene film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FGO layer has a thickness of 5 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The graphene film was fabricated from chemically reduced GO and can recover relatively high in-plane thermal conductivity after thermal annealing34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The graphene film was then spin-coated35 with the FGO and the resulting bundle was transferred to a thermal evaluation device7, resulting in the formation of molecular bridges between the graphene surface and the devices SiO2 substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thermal evaluation device was integrated with micro Pt-based heating resistors as the hotspot and temperature sensors7, as shown in Fig 1d, acting as a simulation platform of an electronic component to demonstrate the heat-spreading capability of the supported graphene film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "Figure 1: Graphene-based film on FGO as heat spreader for hotspot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Sketch of the chemical bonds of the silane molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Schematic of a graphene film on different supports.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Left: conventional silica substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Right: the proposed silica/FGO substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Schematic of the measurement set-up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chip is embedded in the SiO2 substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T-SiO2 stands for thermally grown SiO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the in-plane and the cross-section of the GBF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) SEM image of the chip as the hotspot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 100 m.

circuit by applying an outer voltage V in Fig 1e, and hence the generated power is calculated as P=V × I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the lateral dimension of the hotspot (A=400 × 400 m2) is much larger than its thickness (260 nm), most of the heat is dissipated through the lateral direction of the hotspot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence the heat flux is defined as Q=P/A, and the direction is parallel to the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calibration relationship between the resistance R  and the temperature T (°C) of the thermal evaluation chip is R(T)=0.21T+112.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temperature measurement uncertainty is =±0.5 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1e shows the temperature measured in situ at the hotspot and compares the thermal performance of the graphene film with and without the functionalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a constant heat flux of 1,300±2.3 W cm2 at the Pt chip, the hotspot temperature decreased from 135±1.2 to 118±1.1 °C (T=17±2.3 °C) with a GBF deposited on non-functionalized GO compared with the case of a bare chip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a remarkable temperature decrease is far beyond the measurement uncertainty T (see Supplementary Fig 1 and Supplementary Note 1 for an uncertainty analysis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, with the same heat flux input, the hotspot temperature further decreased from 118±1.1 to 107±0.8 °C (T=11±1.9 °C) thanks to the presence of the APTES functionalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heat-spreading performance is thus enhanced by 57% via the functionalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have implemented a finite-element model (Supplementary Figs 24, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Note 2) of the heat-spreading device by taking the results of atomistic simulation as input parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1e, the heat-spreading performance of the equivalent macroscopic finite-element model agrees reasonably well with the one measured by experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Thermal resistance measurement with photothermal reflectance', 'To further confirm the enhanced heat spreading assisted by molecular functionalization, we measured the interface thermal resistance by using the pulsed photothermal reflectance (PPR) method36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To enhance heat absorption, a gold layer was evaporated on the surface of the GO and FGO layers after drop coating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample was first excited by a Nd:YAG laser pulse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This caused a fast rise in the surface temperature followed by a relaxation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The change of surface temperature was monitored by a probe laser, which reflects off from the samples surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the relaxation time is governed by the thermal properties of the underlying layers and interfacial thermal resistance between the layers, by obtaining the temperature profile one can extract the thermal properties of the layers and interface thermal resistance between the layers through a heat conduction model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four sets of samples were fabricated, as shown in Fig 2 and the thermal resistance R1 between the Au-Cr film and the (functionalized) GO layer, and the resistance R2

reported in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A fourfold reduction was achieved in the thermal resistance between GO and GBF from 3.8 × 108 to 0.9 × 108m2 K W1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the GOSiO2 interface, the functionalization remarkably reduced the thermal resistance by a factor of almost three, from 7.5 × 108 to 2.6 × 108m2 K W1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed a better thermal coupling on the metaldielectric interface between Au-Cr and GO due to the surface chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Normalized surface temperature of PPR measurements of the thermal interface resistance.

resistances are also reported in Table 1.Full size image', 'Table 1 Au/(F-)GO and (F-)GO/X interface thermal resistances.Full size table', 'Heat spreading through different functional molecules', 'To gain a deeper insight into the impact of molecular structure on the thermal transport along the molecules, we used APTES, 11-Aminoundecyltriethoxysilane and 3-(Azidopropyl)-triethoxysilane as different functional agent on the GO to evaluate their heat-spreading performance on the same thermal test platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same concentration of 0.1492, mol kg1 was used for all three types of molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3 shows the temperature reduction of the hotspot covered by GBFs with FGO using three different molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results show that the heat spreader of GO functionalized with APTES has the best cooling performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To properly understand this difference, an exploration of the internal vibrational properties of the molecule is crucial38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hence investigated how the differences in the phonon transmission impact the interfacial thermal transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this aim, we probed the phonon transmission (Eph) by atomistic Greens function to characterize the local heat conduction with and without the presence of the molecule (Supplementary Note 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Eph) enables a precise measurement of the atomic-scale molecule-graphene heat transport that the conventional models fail to provide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phonon transmission functions through different molecules and the associated thermal conductances versus temperature are shown in Fig 3b,c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phonon transmission at low phonon energies across the 11-Aminoundecyltriethoxysilane molecule is comparable to that across the APTES molecule, whereas at high phonon energies (4 meV), the phonon transmission is considerably suppressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a distinct phonon transport behaviour is determined by the molecule chain length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparing the chemical structures, we can see that 11-Aminoundecyltriethoxysilane (NC11SiO3) has the same functional groups as APTES (NC3SiO3) but has a longer carbon backbone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a long chain length has a rather weak impact on the low-frequency phonons due to their very long wavelength but can strongly suppress the phonon transport at high frequencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, when comparing the phonon transmission through the junction of APTES and 3-(Azidopropyl)triethoxysilane (NN+NC3SiO3), it is evident to identify a stronger transmission at all frequencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparing the chemical structures in Fig 3a, we can see that 3-(Azidopropyl)triethoxysilane has the same carbon backbone as APTES but has an azido group instead of an amino group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The azido group has strong interaction with the sp2-bonded carbon lattice of graphene to form three-membered heterocycle structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the similar backbone structure, the phonon eigenmodes in the molecule have not been significantly altered, but the transmission is enhanced due to the stronger thermal coupling to the graphene reservoirs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the introduction of nitrogen atoms into the sp2 carbon structure can strongly scatter phonons by distorting the structure of the graphene sheet, which leads to a poor thermal performance of the heat spreader.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Heat-spreading performance of GBF on FGO with different functional agents.The

presence of the APTES molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 4, the transmission function (Eph) for the two adjacent graphene layers without any molecule displays a clear stepwise structure that provides the number of phonon channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low-energy phonons (Eph10 meV) dominate heat conduction since the adjacent graphene flakes interact only through weak van der Waals (vdW) forces that inhibit the transmission of high-frequency phonons39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the graphene layers are bridged by a amino-silane molecule, the high-frequency phonons act as the major contributors in the heat conductance Gph, creating more phonon channels through the covalent bond vibrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in line with the transmission calculation of Segal et al.40 who observed a contribution to heat conduction by the higher-frequency phonons within the molecule coupled to the low-frequency phonons responsible for heat transport in the thermal reservoirs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oscillations in the transmission spectrum may originate from phonon interferences within the alkane chain41,42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FabryPérot-like interference effect occurs in the frequency region of Eph=20100 meV, as was previously observed in an alkane SAM interface41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such FabryPérot-like interferences originate from the multiple reflected phonons interfering constructively within the alkane chain, as the local maxima in the transmission (Fig 4) through the molecule can attain the same intensity of that through pristine graphene films at given frequencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although destructive quantum interference was believed unlikely to occur in a linear alkane chain42, we observe strong destructive interference patterns in the high-frequency range , which may correspond to two-path destructive phonon interferences43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also investigated the interlayer electron transport in the graphene and the effect of the silane intercalation in such a hybrid nanostructure through a ab initio calculation combined with Greens function (Supplementary Fig 8 and Supplementary Note 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main heat carrier in this system is phonon, as

the presence of the APTES molecule results in an unexpected increase both in the graphene film thermal conductivity  and in R. An overall decaying trend of the in-plane thermal conductivity  of the graphene film and its resistance R with the substrate versus the layer number lG is observed until approaching the value of bulk graphite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is due to the increased cross-plane coupling of the low-energy phonons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar decay was found both in experimental measurements of  (ref.

This critical number depends on the level of conformation distortion of the functionalized graphene sheet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several factors can play a role (Supplementary Figs 1214 and Supplementary Note 9): (i) molecule density: a diluted molecule distribution creates segregated ripples on the functionalized graphene sheet and even on the sheets further above thus interrupting the phonon mean free path.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case more graphene sheets are required to recover the flat conformation, that is, lc2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a high molecule density, the ripples tend to merge with themselves, recovering the flat surface in an extended area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such merging hence recovers the interrupted phonon MFP and alleviates the detrimental influence of the separate ripples on the basal-plane thermal conductivity of graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case the two layers of graphene with functionalization have higher basal-plane thermal conductivity compared with that without

phonon lifetime of graphene', 'We investigate the microscopic origin of the thermal conductivity  enhancement in the graphene film by probing the mode-wise phonon relaxation time (Supplementary Fig 15 and Supplementary Note 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phonon relaxation time  measures the temporal response of a perturbed phonon mode to relax back to equilibrium due to the net effect of different phonon-scattering mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  can be defined as49  where n and n0 are the phonon occupation numbers out of and at thermal equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under the single-mode-relaxation-time approximation, the thermal conductivity is given by  where Ci and vi are the specific heat per volume unit and the group velocity of the i-th phonon mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phonon dispersion of the supported graphene film for =0.081 nm2 and lG=2, and the extracted relaxation time  for all the phonon modes are shown in Fig 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By inserting the APTES

notable increase in  accounts for the enhancement in  of the graphene film bonded to the substrate since the ZA modes contribute considerably to  as much as 77% at 300 K (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We attribute the increase in  to the weakened coupling between the graphene film and the substrate, which is reflected as the increased thermal resistance R for =0.081 nm2 and lG2, as is shown in Fig 5b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An approximate expression from the perturbation theory for the relaxation time due to phonon leakage towards the contact interface yields , where  depends on the phonon density of states and K is the average vdW coupling constant between the graphene film and its substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A previous calculation16 shows that KZA largely depends on the substrate morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of the molecule strongly decreases the filmsubstrate coupling KZA, thus yielding a longer time .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This demonstrates that the

conduction between the top graphene films and the lower FGO layers is governed by the competing effects of (i) the intercalation of the molecules that tends to weaken the interlayer coupling of graphene therefore increasing the cross-plane thermal resistance and (ii) the additional heat channels introduced by the molecules covalently bonding the graphene sheets that tend to facilitate the cross-plane thermal coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigated the in-plane thermal conductivity  of the graphene film and its thermal resistance R with the functionalized substrate versus the equivalent APTES molecule number density  in Fig 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a low molecule density, the molecule population is too small in such a way that the additional thermal phonon transport through the molecules cannot compensate the weakened cross-plane thermal coupling through the interlayer vdW interactions due to the intercalation effect by the molecules (also see Supplementary Fig 17 and Supplementary Note 12 for a detailed analysis on the  relation at low molecular densities).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the net effect is an increase in the cross-plane thermal resistance between the top graphene films and the lower GO layers compared to the non-functionalization case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the limit of small number density, we consider the molecules as independent heat conductors connecting the film and the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  R agrees well with a reduced model of parallel thermal resistors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, R decreases with the number of molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  also decreases with the molecule number since the molecules increase the cross-plane phonon scattering in the graphene film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For larger , the interactions among the molecules gain importance and R starts to deviate from the prediction of the parallel-thermal-resistor model, as shown in Fig 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecule population is large enough so that the additional thermal phonon transport through the molecules becomes very strong and compensates the weakened cross-plane thermal coupling through the interlayer interactions due to the intercalation effect by the molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the net effect is that the cross-plane thermal resistance between the top graphene films and the lower FGO layers falls lower than that of the case without functionalization in the GO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For large , the thermal resistance R is lower than that without molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However  remains enhanced by a factor of 15% compared with its

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The correlation between the in- and cross-plane thermal transport of 2D materials has been recently studied from both theoretical15,17 and experimental13,14,16 points of view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among them, Ghosh et al.13 studied the dimensional crossover from a 2D graphene to a 3D graphite system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The in-plane thermal conductivity decreased with the increase of the layer number in the FLG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wei et al.17 used a 2D material model to show a negative correlation between the in-plane thermal conductivity and the cross-plane interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies have considered different mechanisms of the correlation, yet no general conclusion is applicable to any quasi-2D system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the functionalization molecules mediate the cross-plane phonon scattering and in turn effectively control the in-plane thermal transport in the graphene-based heat spreader.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our work tackles the key technological challenge of efficient thermal management in the industry of the next-generation integrated circuit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The excessive heat from the hotspots accelerates the failure rate and slows down the operating speed of microelectronic devices50,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extremely high power density beyond 1,000 W cm2 can be observed in microprocessors51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coolers are most commonly based on metallic materials due to their relatively high thermal conductivities, for example, 200400 W m1 K1 for Al and Cu, and the low cost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for these technologically important metals, the thermal conductivity of a 100-nm-thick film constitutes only 20% of the thermal conductivity of the bulk52,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, GBF used in the present work can have an in-plane thermal conductivity as high as 1,600 W m1 K1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  54), which is more than two orders of magnitude higher than the ones of the metal thin films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a superior thermal conductivity significantly facilitates the heat conduction when GBFs are used as heat spreaders together with a better cross-plane thermal coupling with FGO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The APTES functionalization yields an additional temperature decrease T of the hotspot of 11 °C compared with the case of GBF with non-functionalized GO (T=17 °C), resulting in a large total temperature decrease of 28 °C when operating at 1,300 W cm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison, the highest T achieved so far at a similar high heat flux of 1,250 W cm2 is 19 °C by using a miniaturized thermoelectric cooler51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contribution of functionalization to the overall T is robust especially at higher heat flux beyond 1,000 W cm2, as shown in Fig 1e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we propose a significant package-level solution for the thermal management of hotspots in high-power electronics at the micro- and nanometre length scale.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Experimental method', '(i) Sample synthesis: graphite (Sigma, 4 g); H2SO4 (92 ml, 98%); NaNO3 (2 g); and KMnO4 (12 g) were used to prepare GO dispersion by following Hummers method55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The obtained GO dispersion was reduced by L-ascorbic acid, and polyvinyl alcohol was also added for better suspension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GBF was prepared via vacuum filtration with polycarbonate filter paper with a pore size of 3 m. The film thickness was controlled by the filtration volume and the graphene concentration in the suspension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After dissolving the filter paper in pure acetone, a freestanding GBF was obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thickness of the GBF was measured as 20 m. Raman spectroscopy data of the GBF before and after the spin-coating with FGO are shown in Supplementary Fig 18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) Functionalization: GO powder (20 mg) and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (5 mg) were mixed with APTES (30 ml) by ultrasonication for 2 h to produce a homogeneous suspension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then the suspension was heated up to 100 °C for 3 h, with continuous stirring to realize the functionalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy data provide evidence for the functionalization (Supplementary Fig 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iii) Transfer process: the GBF was first transferred onto a thermal release tape, and then spin-coated35 with the FGO layer at 4,000 r.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  for 2 min onto the film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thermal release tape was removed by heating the device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Simulation set-up', 'Classical molecular dynamics simulations were performed using LAMMPS56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adaptive intermolecular reactive empirical bond order potential57 was used to simulate the graphenes CC interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intramolecular forces are taken into account through the ReaxFF potential58, which uses distance-dependent bond-order functions to represent the contributions of chemical bonding to the potential energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Periodic boundary conditions are applied in the in-plane directions and free boundary condition in the cross-plane direction of the graphene system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, each supercell was relaxed at the simulation temperature to achieve zero in-plane stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then the systems were thermalized by using a Langevin heat bath.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The system reached thermal equilibrium after 2 ns computed in the microcanonical ensemble.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temperature and heat flux were sampled in the microcanonical ensemble in the in the following 1 ns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Autocorrelation functions for the resistance and the thermal conductivity were calculated over this latter duration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Thermal conductance', 'Thermal conductance , where   is the thermal conductance due to the phonons (electrons).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the phonon transmission (Eph) the thermal conductance due to the phonon could be calculated as , where  is the frequency, T refers to the mean temperature of the system, fBE is the BoseEinstein phonon statistics, and  represents the reduced Plancks constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thermal conductance due to the electrons59 could be calculated from the electron transmission coefficient Tel as , where  in which fFD is the FermiDirac electron statistics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
