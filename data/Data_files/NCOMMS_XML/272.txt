Stratified coastal ocean interactions with tropical cyclones  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Hurricane-intensity forecast improvements currently lag the progress achieved for hurricane tracks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Integrated ocean observations and simulations during hurricane Irene (2011) reveal that the wind-forced two-layer circulation of the stratified coastal ocean, and resultant shear-induced mixing, led to significant and rapid ahead-of-eye-centre cooling (at least 6 °C and up to 11 °C) over a wide swath of the continental shelf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atmospheric simulations establish this cooling as the missing contribution required to reproduce Irenes accelerated intensity reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Historical buoys from 1985 to 2015 show that ahead-of-eye-centre cooling occurred beneath all 11 tropical cyclones that traversed the Mid-Atlantic Bight continental shelf during stratified summer conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Yellow Sea buoy similarly revealed significant and rapid ahead-of-eye-centre cooling during Typhoon Muifa (2011).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings establish that including realistic coastal baroclinic processes in forecasts of storm intensity and impacts will be increasingly critical to mid-latitude population centres as sea levels rise and tropical cyclone maximum intensities migrate poleward.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Tropical cyclones are among the most destructive weather phenomena on Earth1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Declines in hurricane related mortalities2 reflect improvements in global atmospheric and ensemble modelling approaches3 that have reduced hurricane track forecast errors by factors of 23 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite two decades of progress in hurricane track prediction, improvements in hurricane-intensity forecast skill have lagged significantly4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The predictions, public response and unexpected devastation patterns related to Hurricane Irene exemplify this dichotomy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accurate track forecasts days in advance provided time for preparations and coastal evacuations, but Irenes official forecast maximum wind speeds along the Mid-Atlantic coast were consistently 5 m s1 too high5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Irene instead caused catastrophic inland flooding because of heavy rainfall5, making it the eighth costliest cyclone to hit the United States since 1900 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6), with damages of $16 billion (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These intensity forecast uncertainties have significant negative consequences, ranging from unnecessary preparation costs to future public skepticism7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Improved tropical cyclone intensity predictions include dependencies on the rapid spacetime evolution of the atmosphereocean responses and feedbacks8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coupled atmosphereocean models demonstrate that small shifts in sea surface temperature (SST) and stratification, even on small (100 km) horizontal scales, can have significant impacts on storm intensity9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several studies have noted12,13,14,15,16 the relationship between warm and cold mesoscale features in the deep ocean and rapid changes in intensity, but the coastal ocean has received much less attention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, utilizing an ocean observing network to inform ocean and atmospheric model simulations, the role of baroclinic processes on a stratified coastal ocean and their impact on the intensity of Hurricane Irene was quantified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high percentage of ahead-of-eye-centre14,17,18 cooling (7698%) observed in Irene is not reproduced by standard open ocean models that exclude these coastal baroclinic processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atmospheric model sensitivity studies indicate that intense in-storm sea surface cooling over a strongly stratified coastal regime is the missing contribution required to reproduce the rapid decay of Hurricane Irenes intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 30-year historical buoy record shows an average of 73% of the in-storm cooling occurs ahead-of-eye-centre on the Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB) in the stratified season.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Yellow Sea buoy observed up to 85% of in-storm cooling ahead-of-eye-centre during Super Typhoon Muifa (2011).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results demonstrate the importance of rapid ahead-of-eye-centre vertical shear-induced mixing processes and the ensuing oceanatmosphere feedbacks for generating more accurate simulations of storm intensity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Synoptic conditions', 'Hurricane Irene formed east of the Caribbeans Windward Islands on 22 August 2011 and made initial United States landfall in North Carolina as a Category 1 hurricane on 27 August.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It re-emerged over the ocean in the MAB before a second landfall in New Jersey as a tropical storm on 28 August (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5), closely following the historical northeastward tracks of hurricanes along the northeast United States19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Irene accelerated and lost intensity as it crossed the MAB, moving parallel to the coast with the eye over inner-continental shelf waters (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Propagation was rapid at 3040 km h1, requiring only 9.5 h to cross from North Carolina to New Jersey landfall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cloud bands extended over 600 km from the eye centre, obscuring the ocean from satellite infrared SST sensors during passage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differencing 3-day composites of cloud-free satellite imagery before (2426 August) from after (2931 August) Irene reveals the regional pattern of MAB sea surface cooling (Fig 1a and Supplementary Fig 1A,B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest cooling (511 °C) was observed to the right of the eye centre over the MABs middle to outer shelf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inner shelf cooling was slightly less, with averages of 35 °C of cooling within the 25-km radius eye wall (Supplementary Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cooling was much less significant on the shelf seas to the south of the MAB, in the deep ocean to the east and, as previously noted in other hurricanes20, along the very shallow unstratified coast, bays and sounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Map of the study domain with satellite and buoy data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) SST difference map post-Irene (8/31) minus

near 20 m s1 from offshore as Irene approached.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At these NDBC buoys and at 44100, water temperatures dropped rapidly by 3.86.3 °C ahead of eye centre passage (Fig 1bd), representing 8298% of the in-storm cooling at these locations (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At Irenes fast propagation speed, the eye was still 150200 km to the south after the most rapid cooling was complete.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the ocean surface cooled, observed air temperatures were greater than SSTs, indicating airsea-sensible heat fluxes were from the atmosphere into the ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Atmospheric conditions (Fig 2a) were recorded just inshore of a Slocum autonomous underwater glider21,22 measuring subsurface ocean conditions23 during Irene at the location shown in Fig 1a (see Supplementary Fig 4 for a plot of the complete glider track well before, during and after the storm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Winds initially from offshore (90°), with speeds near 20 m s1 ahead of the eye, rotated rapidly to blow from onshore (270°) after the eye passed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glider-observed subsurface temperatures (Fig 2b) indicate that initially, typical MAB summer stratification24 was present, with a seasonally warmed surface layer (24 °C) above the MAB Cold Pool25 ( less_than 10 °C) separated by a sharp ( less_than 8 m thick) thermocline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant cooling of the surface layer (5.1 °C) and deepening of the thermocline ( greater than 15 m) was observed under the leading edge of the storm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Little change in thermocline depth and much less cooling (1.6 °C) of the upper layer was observed after eye passage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, ahead-of-eye-centre cooling represents 76% of in-storm cooling observed at the glider (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the glider and buoy data suggest that much of the satellite observed SST cooling (over 100,000 km2 of continental shelf) occurred ahead-of-eye-centre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Data from a local

currents (Fig 2c) at the glider location, with positive values towards land, indicate that the onshore surface currents began building before the eye entered the MAB, increasing to a peak value  greater than 50 cm s1 towards the coast before the eye passage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along-shelf currents throughout the water column were weak (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the eye, the winds changed direction and within a few hours, the cross-shelf surface currents switched to offshore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the strong observed surface currents, the depth-averaged current (Fig 2c) reported by the glider remained small during the storms duration, with peaks barely exceeding 5 cm s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in deep water, the current response is baroclinic28,29, but the low depth-averaged current implies a strong offshore flow in the bottom layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These bottom layer currents were estimated based on the relative layer thicknesses and the requirement that the combined surface and bottom layer-averaged currents matched the glider-observed dead-reckoned depth-averaged current.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The estimated bottom layer currents accelerated in the offshore direction as the eye approached, causing significant shear between the two layers at the same time the surface layer was deepening and cooling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Ocean model simulations', 'Coastal ocean three-dimensional (3D) model simulations of Irene using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) in the MAB30,31 successfully reproduced the thermocline deepening and surface layer cooling (Fig 3a) similar to the glider observations (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modelled cross-shelf velocity component (Fig 3b) also has similarities to the combined glider and HF radar data (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The surface layer flow accelerated shoreward for 12 h until eye passage, while the bottom layer responded more slowly with an offshore counter-flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A few hours after eye passage, the cross-shelf flows reversed, also consistent with observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dominant terms in the cross-shelf momentum balance (Fig 3g) indicate that the surface wind stress increased as the eye approached and decreased as it receded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before the eye centre arrival, the presence of a coastline produced an offshore-directed pressure gradient that nearly balanced the wind stress and accelerated the offshore jet in the bottom layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the storm passage, the cross-shelf surface current switched to offshore; the cross-shelf pressure gradient also switched sign and was redirected towards the coast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this point in the storm, the dominant cross-shelf momentum balance was nearly geostrophic (Fig 3g) with a northward

significant influence on vertical mixing as illustrated by the Richardson number (Fig 3e) and the vertical eddy viscosity (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Richardson number and the eddy viscosity show that the surface layer deepened to meet the stratification at the top of the thermocline as the surface layer accelerated with the approaching storm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the offshore counter current accelerated in the bottom boundary layer, the lower layer Richardson number also decreased and eddy viscosity increased until the two layers interacted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most rapid ahead-of-eye-centre cooling and deepening of the surface layer occurred when the small Richardson numbers and large vertical eddy viscosities from the surface and bottom boundary layers overlapped.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The models temperature diagnostic equation indicates that vertical diffusion (Fig 3f) was the dominant term (Supplementary Fig 6) acting to deepen the thermocline and cool the surface layer during the event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Atmospheric model simulations', 'Atmospheric model simulations of Irene used the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)32 model as applied to the US East Coast for tropical cyclone forecasting33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typical surface boundary approaches in uncoupled atmospheric models use satellite SSTs over water that remain fixed when new data is not available because of cloud cover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A matrix of over 130 simulations revealed ahead-of-eye-centre cooling of the oceans surface layer has a significant impact on intensity as reflected in the hurricane pressure (Fig 4) and wind fields (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examining the ensemble of simulations with track errors less than one eye-wall radius, the largest wind and pressure intensity sensitivities were generated using fixed warm pre-storm and cold post-storm SST boundary conditions (Supplementary Figs 8,9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sea level pressure (SLP) fields at landfall indicate the warm (Fig 4a) versus the cold (Fig 4b) SST changed the centre SLP by 78 hPa, with the maximum wind speed reduced by  greater than 5 m s1 due to the cooler SST (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The minimum SLP time history (Fig 4c) of selected model runs can be compared with the National Hurricane Center (NHC) best track parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The best track central pressure remains constant near 952 hPa until the eye enters the MAB (28 August at about 00 h), followed by a steady increase in the central pressure to 965 hPa 13 h later as the eye leaves the MAB.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Using Hurricane Irene as a diagnostic case study, a new feedback mechanism on storm intensity in the coastal ocean has been identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strong onshore winds occurring ahead-of-eye-centre in tropical cyclones and the coastal wall set up a down-welling circulation that limits the storm surge and results in significant shear across the thermocline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shear leads to turbulent entrainment of abundant cold bottom water and mixing with warmer surface water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting ocean cooling reduces surface heat fluxes to the atmosphere, weakening the storm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Rapid tropical cyclone intensity changes over the deep ocean have been correlated with storm passage over warm and cold core eddies12,13,14,15,16,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also in the deep ocean, SST changes of as little as 1 °C are noted to significantly impact storm intensity9,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During Hurricane Irene, ahead-of-eye-centre cooling of 3.86.3 °C was observed with nearshore buoys (Supplementary Fig 3) and 5.1 °C was observed with a mid-shelf glider (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Storm-induced cooling in deep water is often equally distributed between the front and back half of the storm36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deep ocean simulations of Irene with both a 1D ocean mixed layer model and the 3D PriceWellerPinkel37 model produced 32 and 56% of the in-storm cooling ahead-of-eye-centre, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Hurricane Irene, 76% (glider) to 98% (buoy 44100) of the in-storm cooling occurred ahead-of-eye-centre, indicating that coastal baroclinic processes are enhancing the percentage of ahead-of-eye-centre cooling in Irene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To verify that enhanced ahead-of-eye-centre coastal ocean cooling is not unique to Irene, 30 years of historical nearshore buoy data throughout the MAB were investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During that time period, ahead-of-eye-centre cooling was observed in all 11 tropical cyclones that tracked northeastward over the MAB continental shelf during the highly stratified summer months (JuneAugust)24,38 (Table 1 and Supplementary Figs 1012).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum continental shelf buoy observed ahead-of-eye-centre cooling for these 11 storms averages 2.7±1.3 °C, representing an average of 73% of the in-storm cooling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Sea surface temperature cooling in coastal tropical cyclones.Full size table', 'An 11-year global satellite climatology39 reveals that the shallow mid-latitude Yellow Sea and northern East China Sea also experience a large 20 °C seasonal SST cycle, similar to the MAB but over three times larger in area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 1986 Yellow Sea shipboard conductivity temperature and depth survey reports surface to bottom temperature differences approaching 15 °C (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  40), also similar to the stratified summer MAB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maps of western Pacific typhoon tracks ( coast.noaa.gov/hurricanes) indicate 26 typhoons have tracked across the northern East China Sea and Yellow Sea during JuneAugust since 1985.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like Irene, the landfalling intensity of Super Typhoon Muifa (2011) was over-predicted by standard models41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Satellite SST maps indicate Muifa caused significant in-storm cooling (up to 7 °C) across 300,000 km2 of the continental shelf41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nearshore buoy observations show cooling of 4.1 °C (85% of the in-storm cooling observed at that location) was ahead-of-eye-centre (Table 1, Supplementary Fig 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Globally, over the past 30 years, tropical cyclone maximum intensities have migrated poleward42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the North Atlantic, hurricane intensities have increased since the early 1980s and are projected to continue to increase as the climate warms43,44,45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined with rapid sea level rise47, mid-latitude population centres will experience heightened vulnerability to storm surge and inundation from increasingly powerful storms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To mitigate these risks, improved forecasting of tropical cyclone intensity over mid-latitude stratified coastal seas is vital, and will require realistic 3D ocean models to forecast enhanced ahead-of-eye-centre cooling.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Forecasting Advanced Research (WRF-ARW) dynamical core (code available at http://www.wrf-model.org)32, Version 3.4 was used for the atmospheric simulations in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WRF-ARW is a fully compressible, non-hydrostatic, terrain-following coordinate, primitive equation atmospheric model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our WRF-ARW domain extends from South Florida to Nova Scotia (Supplementary Fig 14), with grid resolution of 6 km in the horizontal and 35 vertical levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lateral boundary conditions used are from the Global Forecast System (GFS) 0.5° initialized at 06 UTC on 27

the order of 1 °C or less (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because our model simulations include only 6 h of storm presence over the SAB before NC landfall, and SST cooling in the SAB was significantly less than observed in the MAB (Fig 1), we can conclude that the main result from our SST sensitivity is due to the ahead-of-eye-centre cooling in the MAB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'WRF sensitivity to air-sea

that disallows any latent heat flux less than 0 W m2 (similarly, there is a switch that disallows any sensible heat flux less than 250 W m2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WRF convention for negative heat flux is downward, or atmosphere to land/water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We run WRF after removing the line of code disallowing negative latent heat flux, and compare to the control run.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This switch removal only changes latent heat flux and allows it to be negative over water, as the subsequent WRF land surface scheme modifies fluxes and allows for negative latent heat flux over land.
