A mutation in the POT1 gene is responsible for cardiac angiosarcoma in TP53-negative LiFraumeni-like families  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cardiac angiosarcoma (CAS) is a rare malignant tumour whose genetic basis is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show, by whole-exome sequencing of a TP53-negative LiFraumeni-like (LFL) family including CAS cases, that a missense variant (p.R117C) in POT1 (protection of telomeres 1) gene is responsible for CAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same gene alteration is found in two other LFL families with CAS, supporting the causal effect of the identified mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We extend the analysis to TP53-negative LFL families with no CAS and find the same mutation in a breast AS family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutation is recently found once in 121,324 studied alleles in ExAC server but it is not described in any other database or found in 1,520 Spanish controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In silico structural analysis suggests how the mutation disrupts POT1 structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional and in vitro studies demonstrate that carriers of the mutation show reduced telomere-bound POT1 levels, abnormally long telomeres and increased telomere fragility.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The incidence of primary cardiac tumours is estimated to be between 0.001 and 0.003% in general population1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cardiac angiosarcoma (CAS) is a very rare malignant tumour that represents  less_than 10% of cardiac malignancies Patients are generally diagnosed at advanced stages with very poor prognosis and short survivals2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients with sporadic AS had a 5-year survival rate of 14% while familial cancer patients had a mean survival time of 4 months.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Age of familial CAS onset shows a wide range but most patients affected are younger than 65 years of age2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Information about familial CAS is very scarce and as far as we now, only two families have been reported presenting both an earlier age of onset than sporadic3,4 No genes responsible for these cases have been identified so far, thus humpering early diagnosis and effective treatment, which involves surgical excision combined with chemotherapy, and heart transplantation only for patients with no evidence for metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On the other hand, LiFraumeni syndrome (LFS) is characterized by the presence of different types of tumours including sarcomas and ASs in multiple locations such as liver, spleen, breast, head and neck, and rarely heart5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most cases, LFS is triggered by the mutations in the TP53 gene ( greater than 80%), which is the causal gene that confers susceptibility to the development of different tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, LiFraumeni-like (LFL) families have similar clinical presentation and family characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, they are generally diagnosed at a later age of onset and rarely associated with mutations in TP53 ( less_than 20% of cases)6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we describe the identification by whole-exome sequencing of POT1 (protection of telomeres 1) gene as responsible of TP53-negative LFL families with CAS, as well as other tumour types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'POT1 is a component of the so-called shelterin complex (POT1, TRF1, TRF2, TIN2, TPP1 and RAP1) that binds to telomeres and has fundamental roles in chromosome stability and regulation of telomerase activity at chromosome ends8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'POT1 possesses two N-terminal OB domains, which confer to this protein high specificity for single-stranded DNA sequence 5-TAGGGTTAG-3, thereby binding to the telomeric G-strand overhang10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, POT1 binds through its C terminus to TPP1 and anchors POT1 to the shelterin complex at telomeres13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  POT1 regulates telomere length (TL) by preventing telomerase access to telomeres by sequestering the DNA terminus12,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  POT1 loss-of-function mutations have been related with telomere lengthening and chromosomal instability18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, germline mutations in the POT1 gene were found in familial melanoma and glioma tumours20,21,22, as well as in somatic chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we identify a new missense variant in POT1 (p.R117C) as responsible of LFL locus specifically associated with CAS and demonstrate that mutation carriers show reduced telomere-bound POT1 levels, abnormally long telomeres and increased telomere fragility, highlighting a new role of POT1 as a high susceptibility gene in familial cancer and opening therapeutical opportunities for prognosis and treatment in families with CAS.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have found a novel damaging missense variant (p.R117C) in the POT1 gene in TP53-negative LFL families with CAS and other tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations in POT1 were recently associated with familial melanoma20,21 and glioma22 and as a driver for CLL23, uncovering a new role of this gene not only as telomere protector, but also as one of the main responsible genes for development of different familial cancer types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutation was the same in the four studied families.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Haplotype studies suggested a possible founder effect within the Spanish population although larger studies are necessary to confirm this issue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'There are several consequences of this mutation that we have demonstrated by in silico, in vivo and in vitro studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in silico studies showed that the p.R117C substitution putatively disrupted the interaction between OB1 and OB2 (Fig 2d) and affect the protein-binding site to TPP1 (Supplementary Table 4), which might result in the loss of capability of the POT1R117C protein to interact with ssDNA and to be recruited to telomeres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The predicted conformation change might be explained as a consequence of the substitution of a polar basic aa (Arginine) with a non-polar thiol aa (Cysteine) at position p.117 with the capability to generate disulfide bonds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In silico analyses were confirmed by in vivo assays analysing the binding of mutated POT1 protein to telomeres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Double immunofluorescence with POT1 and TRF1 in immortalized LCLs suggests that the variant has an important effect on the levels of POT1 at telomeres by showing significant decreased levels in mutation carriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro assays demonstrated that POT1R117C is deficient at both, in TPP1 interaction and in telomeric ssDNA binding, affecting POT1 function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although the mutation was located within the OB1/OB2 domains of the protein, similarly to the germline mutations found in familial melanoma and glioma20,21,22 (Table 2), it was specific of CAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, only a member from family 1 carrying the mutation (II-6) developed melanoma, and no members from reported families with melanoma or gliomas carrying POT1 mutations presented CAS20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fourth family (Fig 1, family 4) did not have any member with CAS but the family structure was small and we cannot rule out the possibility that asymptomatic carriers of the mutation will develop a CAS in the future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These findings stress the importance of POT1 domains in cancer development and raise the intriguing open question about the correlation between the genotype and the phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our in silico studies suggest that the putative conformational changes in POT1 proteins due to the mutations described in melanoma and glioma tumours are different from those observed for POT1R117C (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because POT1 is described in tight coordination with the rest of shelterin complex proteins, we cannot rule out that different conformational changes might have different effects on the shelterin complex function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Similarly to other members of the shelterin complex, disruption of POT1 function was associated to increased DNA damage at telomeres and occurrence of telomere fragility23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our case, defective POT1R117C function has shown to lead to a moderate increase in MTS, and in telomere DNA damage, that could account for the genomic instability that these cases present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, increased TL was confirmed in mutation carriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in agreement with previously described POT1 mutations in CLL and familial melanoma and glioma patients that showed abnormally elongated telomeres20,21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our cases, TL was markedly different between mutation carriers and non-carriers within older members, suggesting that there was a cumulative effect in telomere elongation with age (Fig 4b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences observed in the amount of telomeres shorter than 3 Kb in older members suggest a downfall in the telomere shortening through aging, indicating abnormal telomere biology in mutation carriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed similar in vitro TRAP telomerase activity levels in both carriers and non-carriers, indicating no defects in telomerase assembly or function (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the longer telomeres observed in mutation carriers are rather due to alterations in in vivo telomerase recruitment and function on telomeres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, POT1 has been shown to be important to prevent telomerase access to telomeres by sequestering the DNA terminus12,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that POT1R117C is defective in both binding to TPP1 and binding to ssDNA telomeric DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore tempting to speculate that POT1R117C fails to inhibit telomerase due to the reduced telomere-bound POT1R117C, as well as to defective binding to telomeric G-strand overhang.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, given the defective binding of POT1R117C to single G-strand overhang (Fig 3d,e), telomeric damage could also stem from defective maintenance of the 3 G-strand overhang needed for proper T-loop formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, abnormal telomere elongation due to the consequence of increased telomere recombination (ALT) was ruled out as no differences in T-SCE were found in lymphocytes between carriers and non-carriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, lack of functional POT1 seems to affect telomere structure and expose them to abnormal elongation by a normal telomerase activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The telomeric phenotypes observed in lymphocytes from p.R117C variant carriers were validated by in vitro studies in Hela cell lines created using retroviral vectors expressing wt MYC-POT1, MYC-POT1R117C and MYC-POT1OB1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26) in the presence of endogenous POT1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed that the POT1R117C protein acts in a dominant-negative manner, analogous to that previously reported for the POT1DOB1 mutant26, as well as for others POT1 variants found in CLL23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this system, we also detected decreased POT1R117C protein levels at telomeres, moderate increase in MTS incidence, higher telomeric DNA damage and a telomere lengthening effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So, it is tempting to speculate that telomere elongation induced by this mutation in POT1 may constitute the underlying molecular mechanism favouring tumour incidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The identification of POT1 mutation in CAS is important, since it provides the possibility for earlier diagnosis of people at risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently this tumour is diagnosed in advanced stages when distant metastases are present and the survival is very poor, as surgical resection is not effective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Larger studies are necessary to fully assess the clinical spectrum associated with this mutation and other mutations along the whole POT1 gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work is needed to address POT1R117C relation not only with familial but also with sporadic CAS and its role in LFL cases including ASs other than cardiac.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
