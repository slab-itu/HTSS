Host genotype and age shape the leaf and root microbiomes of a wild perennial plant  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Bacteria living on and in leaves and roots influence many aspects of plant health, so the extent of a plants genetic control over its microbiota is of great interest to crop breeders and evolutionary biologists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Laboratory-based studies, because they poorly simulate true environmental heterogeneity, may misestimate or totally miss the influence of certain host genes on the microbiome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report a large-scale field experiment to disentangle the effects of genotype, environment, age and year of harvest on bacterial communities associated with leaves and roots of Boechera stricta (Brassicaceae), a perennial wild mustard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Host genetic control of the microbiome is evident in leaves but not roots, and varies substantially among sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microbiome composition also shifts as plants age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a large proportion of leaf bacterial groups are shared with roots, suggesting inoculation from soil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate how genotype-by-environment interactions contribute to the complexity of microbiome assembly in natural environments.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Bacteria can have wide-ranging effects on the success of their host plants, influencing plant processes such as disease resistance1,2,3, drought tolerance4, life cycle phenology5,6 and overall vigour7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The implications of plantmicrobe interactions for agriculture8 and the ecology and evolution of wild plants4,5,6 have stimulated great interest in the factors that shape plant-associated microbiota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By treating the microbiome as a complex plant trait, we can apply quantitative genetic tools to disentangle multiple sources of variation in plant-associated bacterial communities9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The extent of plant genetic control over bacterial communities is of interest to crop breeders and evolutionary biologists, because heritability of the microbiome determines whether it can evolve (as part of the hosts extended phenotype) in response to selection on host plants9,10,11,12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Laboratory studies have confirmed that intraspecific genetic variation can alter endophyte communities of the root and rhizosphere (the thin region of soil permeated by root exudates)15,16,17,18 as well as leaf surfaces and interiors19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Laboratory settings eliminate natural exogenous stimuli that drive plasticity of complex phenotypes, potentially including plant traits that underlie microbiome assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, laboratory-based studies may overestimate the influence of certain plant genes on the microbiome composition in natural environments, while simultaneously failing to identify important loci with context-dependent functions21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even in complex natural environments, the same problem arises when microbiomes are studied only within one field site or 1 year20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agroecosystems and wild habitats, biotic and abiotic influences that could overwhelm, amplify, or mask the effects of host genes often vary between locations and years, resulting in context-dependent expression of genetic variation for functional traits that could shape the microbiome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, quantitative trait locus mapping of field-grown maize exposed to low and high levels of ultraviolet-B radiation revealed multiple loci that controlled bacterial epiphyte diversity only under high ultraviolet-B, in addition to several loci with environment-independent (constitutive) effects22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such targeted experiments are useful for studying the genes underlying microbiome responses to specific environmental stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, genetic variation for plastic responses to the suite of environmental factors that differentiate natural environments and agroecosystems should also be assessed23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Another understudied potential source of microbiome variation is host age, which can affect expression of plant functional traits that influence the microbiome (for example, defensive chemistry15,24,25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies reported strong changes in phyllosphere (above ground) microbial communities over the course of a growing season26,27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For annuals, these patterns describe the microbiome throughout the life of the plant; but for perennials each growing season represents only a fraction of the plants lifetime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Longer-term studies of trees have reported phyllosphere changes between years27,29, but could not separate effects of plant age from interannual variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more targeted experimental design is needed to learn how plant-associated microbial communities are maintained in aging perennial plants in the face of temporal variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We conducted a multi-year, large-scale field experiment using the short-lived perennial mustard Boechera stricta30 to disentangle the effects of genes, environment, and host age on plant-associated microbial communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because B. stricta is naturally inbreeding31, siblings produced by self-fertilization of wild accessions are nearly clonal, enabling replication of genotypes across multiple environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The species has wide genetic diversity, and accessions from distinct populations are often highly divergent31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many B. stricta populations and habitats are largely undisturbed throughout the species range in western North America, allowing study of the plants in environments where they, and their associated microbes, have been evolving for thousands of years30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We focus on the following questions: first, how do bacterial communities change over the lifetimes of perennial plants?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, how much do plant genotype and interactions of plant genotype with the local environment contribute to microbiome variation?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, do above- and below-ground organs show similar patterns of genetic control over their resident bacterial communities?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that root microbiomes change as plants age from 2 to 4 years old; the host genotype effect on the phyllosphere microbiome is environment-dependent; and despite strong overlap in community membership, leaf and root microbiomes are shaped by different sources of variation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Leaves and roots harbour distinct microbiomes', 'We transplanted replicates of 48 B. stricta lineages (descended from accessions from five natural populations) into five common gardens in the native range in central Idaho, USA (Methods; Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Replicated, randomized experimental blocks within field sites (Fig 1b) and independent lines within genotypes allowed us to assess multiple scales of environmental and genetic variation, respectively, using nested random effects in our statistical models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identical cohorts were planted in 2008 and 2009; representative subsets of the surviving plants were destructively harvested in 2011 and 2012 for root and leaf samples from hosts aged 2, 3 or 4 years (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This temporally staggered experimental design allowed us to test the effect of plant age while controlling for variation between years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used several methods for statistical support: linear mixed models (LMMs) to predict -diversity (within-sample diversity) and independent components of -diversity (between-sample diversity) while accounting for our hierarchical experimental design; and negative binomial models (NBMs) to test for enrichment/depletion of individual bacterial taxa32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our variance-partitioning model tests for effects of host age, host genotype and year on microbiome communities, while age-by-site, genotype-by-site and year-by-site interaction terms describe how the distinct bacterial communities at different common gardens respond differently to each of these factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Summary of experimental design and analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Map of the study region in central Idaho, USA (map data from the R package maps70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The five genotypes used in this experiment were collected from the five B. stricta populations shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We collected seeds from 810 individual B. stricta plants from each population, for a total of 48 accessions or genetic lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For our analyses these lines were grouped back into five genotypes corresponding to the populations from which their ancestors were collected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The populations marked with triangles correspond to the sites of the three common gardens where the experiment took place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 50 km.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Schematic representation of common garden layout.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each garden contained six replicated, randomized blocks per planting cohort (2008 and 2009).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each block contained one replicate of each line, for a total of 810 replicates per genotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both 2011 and 2012, one individual of each genotype was haphazardly chosen for destructive sampling in each block.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) A temporally staggered planting/harvesting design disentangled the effects of plant age and year of observation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Abbreviations and colour codes are shown for the five genotypes and three sites featured in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) The relative abundances of major phyla are shown for each leaf or root sample.Full size image', 'Poor survival in two sites (Mil and Par, probably due to drought and erosion, respectively) unbalanced the experiment (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig 1); therefore, we only analysed the data from the remaining three sites (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We quantified bacterial communities in 21 bulk soil, 306 whole-leaf and 310 whole-root samples of B. stricta by sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous analyses showed that these bulk soil communities differed among field sites but not between years6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each leaf sample comprised both epiphyte and endophyte DNA, and each water-washed root sample comprised both rhizoplane (root surface) and endophyte DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These 616 samples represented 440 individual plants across three common gardens (sites), 36 experimental blocks (12 nested within each site), five genotypes (each encompassing 810 genetic lines, to represent additional variation within each genotype), 2 years of observation and three age groups (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final data set included 27,763±15,790 observations per sample (mean±1 s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), comprising 3,718 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) after we removed contaminants and non-reproducible OTUs (see Methods)16 and corrected counts for 16S rRNA gene copy number variation34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Distributions of OTU counts were highly positive skewed, especially in leaves (Supplementary Fig 2), where one OTU (Sphingomonas sp.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  accounted for 36% of all observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both leaf and root communities consisted largely of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes (Fig 1e), but were distinguished from each other and from bulk soil by their most common families (Supplementary Tables 24 and Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Habitat and year strongly influenced microbiomes', 'The three undisturbed B. stricta habitats that we used as field sites (Jackass Meadow, abbreviated Jam in the figures; Mahogany Valley Mah; and Silver Creek Sil) were separated by 2692 km, ranged in elevation from 1,812 m (Silver Creek) to 2,676 m (Jackass Meadow), and varied in moisture, temperature, plant diversity and soil nutrition (Fig 1a and Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work showed that soils from these sites harbour distinct bacterial communities6; our experiment confirmed that bacterial communities inhabiting B. stricta leaves and roots also distinguish these habitats (Fig 2 and Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Habitats differ strongly in richness and composition of leaf- and root-associated bacterial communities.Sample sizes are N=306 for leaves and N=310 for roots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Mean Chao1 richness and effective Shannon diversity (eShannon entropy) differed among field sites for both roots and leaves (ANOVA, P less_than 1.5e11;

however, this effect was minor compared with the differences between sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many taxa shifted in abundance between years in both organs (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although fairly common, these temporal changes were weaker than changes attributable to other sources of variation (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacterial communities of bulk soil samples did not differ significantly between years6, suggesting that the observed change in root communities may be driven by plant responses to other temporally varying environmental factors such as precipitation or temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Together, these results demonstrate that in nature, both leaf and root microbiomes vary profoundly among sites and between years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern was consistent from individual OTUs (Fig 3a) to community-level measures of  and  diversities (Fig 2 and Tables 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dissimilarity of plant microbiomes among habitats is a very common observation23,36,37,38,39, although not universal40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such strong site effects likely reflect the influence of distinct soil pH and nutrient profiles on local bacterial communities (Supplementary Fig 3), or other environmental factors such as water availability, temperature and ultraviolet radiation41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to these likely biogeographic explanations, environmental heterogeneity could have affected leaf and root communities indirectly by causing plasticity of plant functional traits that underlie the microbiome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, drought stress can alter cuticle thickness43, which in turn may affect microbial colonization1,19,20,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, in our experiment, environmental differences among sites altered root glucosinolate defensive chemistry, which may affect root-associated bacteria (although bacteria themselves are part of a plants environment and may have contributed to this phenotypic plasticity; Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Fig 8)6,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, variation in microbiomes of plants growing in multiple wild soils brought into the laboratory may not fully represent the variation that would be observed among the same plants growing in those soils in their natural settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Bacterial communities changed as host plants aged', 'Our temporally staggered planting and harvesting design allowed us to test for effects of plant age after controlling for year-to-year changes (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because we germinated these plants in the greenhouse and then transferred them into common gardens as juveniles, plant age was confounded with microbial succession after a major habitat shift.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mostly affected roots, which received an initial microbial inoculum from the potting soil before exposure to natural soil communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the juvenile leaves that formed in the greenhouse fell off during the winter immediately following the autumn transplant, and were replaced by new spring growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, over the lifetime of the plant, these rosette leaves either senesced during the summer (to be regrown from the live root the following spring) or persisted between years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our age measurement represents the plant as a whole, but not necessarily the sampled leaves themselves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, root samples generally comprised whole perennial root systems, with fractions of tissue ranging in age from new growth, to the same age as the plant, or even dead.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, systematic changes in the age distribution of root sub-sections are one possible mechanism for an effect of plant age on the root system as a whole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To help distinguish true effects of host age from signals of post-transplant succession, we also sampled bulk soils and endogenous B. stricta plants (of unknown age) from natural populations in the vicinity of all five sites, resulting in 30 soil, 30 leaf and 23 root samples that had never been exposed to the greenhouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only 29 OTUs (of 3,718 total), with a combined relative abundance of 0.11% in all root samples, were present in our experimental plants but absent from these endogenous plants and wild soils (Supplementary Data 2 and Supplementary Fig 9a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We removed these 29 unnatural OTUs (which were otherwise unremarkable; Supplementary Fig 9b) from the data set before analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because several distinct bacterial strains may be lumped into a single OTU44, organisms persisting from the greenhouse might still be counted as natural OTUs that also were observed in the endogenous plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, 84.5% of OTUs from endogenous plants and wild soils were also found in samples from the greenhouse (Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Limited resolution of intra-OTU variation is an inherent drawback of 16S rDNA profiling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the transplants similarity to endogenous plants, their dissimilarity to greenhouse controls and their strong microbiome divergence between field sites despite their origin in a common potting soilnot the presence/absence of particular OTUsprovide the best evidence that wild bacteria had largely replaced the initial greenhouse inoculum (Fig 2b, Supplementary Fig 10 and Supplementary Table 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bulk of the evidence suggests that microbiomes of our experimental plants were much more wild than not, and that host age effects can be partially, but not entirely, explained by the attrition of potting-soil bacteria (Supplementary Figs 1011 and Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we infer that the initial potting-soil inoculum reached equilibrium with surrounding soil within 2 years of transplant, and the plants continued to fine-tune their root microbiota for another 12 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Leaf communities remained largely stable as host plants aged (Fig 4ac and Tables 1 and 2), although age-by-site interactions affected abundance of multiple taxa (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, plant aging affected abundance of leaf-associated Actinobacteria, Armatimonadetes and Verrucomicrobia differently at various sites (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Root -diversity declined monotonically with plant age (Fig 4a and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Age also shaped root -diversity: root communities of older plants were more similar to those of endogenous plants, probably representing the replacement of potting-soil microbes by natural ones (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This replacement process, along with true effects of plant age, impacted most bacterial taxaincluding the phyla Acidobacteria, Armatimonadetes, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Gemmatimonadetes, Planctomycetes and Proteobacteria (Fig 3a, Supplementary Data 1 and Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Leaf- and root- associated bacterial communities change as plants age.Detailed statistics for all tests are found in Tables 1 and 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample sizes are N=306 for leaves and N=310 for roots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Within-sample diversity declines with age in roots (ANOVA, F2,57=6.08;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our study demonstrates that several sources of variation interact in complex ways to form and maintain the plant microbiome in a short-lived perennial in its native habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Environmental heterogeneity can decouple host genotypes from their microbiomes, just as it alters the mapping of genotype onto other aspects of the host phenotype45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distinct microbial communities in different habitats can exhibit distinct responses to host genotype, host age and year-to-year variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study illustrates the importance of replicating microbiome experiments across sites and timepoints, in order to reveal genotype-by-environment interactions that are potentially even more profound than environment-independent effects of host genetic variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach, although laborious and challenging, may improve our ability to find genes controlling microbiome variation, and simultaneously increase our confidence that those genes are actually important in realistic environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such genotypeenvironment interactions observed between natural habitats or agroecosystems represent the cumulative influence of a potentially huge number of environmental factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, manipulative experimentsboth in the field and in controlled environments facilitating reductionist hypothesis testingwill be necessary to further disentangle these many facets of environmental complexity and learn how each affects plant microbiome composition and function21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Employment of additional tools including GWAS, RNAseq, metagenomics and experimental reinoculations will aid this effort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A better understanding of how host genetic variation affects associated microbial communities will be rewarding for future efforts to incorporate microbiome biology into evolutionary ecology and agricultural science.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
