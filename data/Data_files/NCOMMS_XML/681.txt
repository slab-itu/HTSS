Nanoscopy of bacterial cells immobilized by holographic optical tweezers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Imaging non-adherent cells by super-resolution far-field fluorescence microscopy is currently not possible because of their rapid movement while in suspension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Holographic optical tweezers (HOTs) enable the ability to freely control the number and position of optical traps, thus facilitating the unrestricted manipulation of cells in a volume around the focal plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that immobilizing non-adherent cells by optical tweezers is sufficient to achieve optical resolution well below the diffraction limit using localization microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual cells can be oriented arbitrarily but preferably either horizontally or vertically relative to the microscopes image plane, enabling access to sample sections that are impossible to achieve with conventional sample preparation and immobilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This opens up new opportunities to super-resolve the nanoscale organization of chromosomal DNA in individual bacterial cells.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'To overcome the limit of diffraction in optical microscopy, several super-resolving microscopy or nanoscopy techniques have been developed in recent years1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A common caveat of all of these techniques is their extended data acquisition time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Localization microscopy techniques, such as direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) and photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM), typically require several thousands of image frames for the reconstruction of a single super-resolved image, leading to very long acquisition times on the scale of seconds to minutes2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This entails a high demand on the spatial position stability of the sample, which is typically achieved by chemical fixation and attachment of biological samples such as cells to glass coverslips.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Likewise, extended acquisition times make super-resolution microscopy inapplicable to non-adherent cells or other freely diffusing samples, such as bacterial cells or immune cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Embedding these cells into gel matrices (for example, collagen or agarose) may alter their appearance and impair signal-to-noise ratios during the imaging process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the complex optical requirements for current nanoscopy methods restrict the ability to freely access and/or orient the sample with respect to the image plane or during cellcell interactions, typically resulting in different spatial resolutions along different directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Faster, parallelized versions of nanoscopy have been developed, but these still require the acquisition of several tens of images, making them too slow to image fast moving cells4,5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, non-adherent cells in suspension have not yet been imaged by any form of optical nanoscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we show that it is possible to overcome these limitations in optical nanoscopy by the combined use of a holographic optical tweezers system and single-molecule localization microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beam shaping by a spatial light modulator (SLM) enables the generation and dynamic control of multiple, independent optical traps8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We combined this system with dSTORM to facilitate the immobilization of the sample at specific, pre-defined positions and orientations in suspension during the nanoscopic imaging process.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Influence of different optical trap powers on dSTORM images', 'The potential of the combination of optical tweezers and dSTORM (Supplementary Fig 1) is demonstrated by first trapping microspheres in suspension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The surface of the microspheres is labelled with Alexa 647 for single-molecule localization by dSTORM9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to the short exposure time (29.55 ms), individual fluorophores on the bead surface, which are excited by highly inclined and laminated optical sheet illumination10, are in general localized with mean single-molecule localization precisions11,12 of 1012 nm (Supplementary Fig 2), mainly depending on the photon statistics of the fluorescence emission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is comparable to what is typically achieved in localization microscopy of samples attached to a glass coverslip13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, holding the sample above the coverslip by optical traps weakens the effective localization precision due to position fluctuations of the sample (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on the laser power of the optical tweezers, the surface of the microspheres is reconstructed with different apparent widths in the dSTORM images obtained from several thousands of image frames (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different near-infrared laser powers lead to differences in trap stiffness and, hence, to different restoring forces during the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This circumstance becomes clear by considering an inherent property of optical tweezers: owing to weak interaction forces, an optically trapped object moves stochastically around a mean position, while experiencing Brownian motion of the surrounding molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the optical trapping potential may be approximated by a harmonic oscillator potential14, the position of a trapped particle follows the statistics of a Gaussian distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any fluorescent molecule that is firmly attached to the optically trapped particle will therefore exhibit the same displacement statistics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the same single molecule is localized multiple times during the dSTORM experiment, its localizations must exhibit the position distribution characteristics of the entire optically trapped sample (assuming the sample is stiff in comparison with the surrounding medium).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same applies to labelled structures that are visualized with subdiffraction resolution by single emitter localizations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mathematically, this corresponds to the dSTORM image of the structure, as it might be determined for an immobilized sample, convolved with the position distribution experienced within the optical trap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In case of the microsphere bead edges, this fact is illustrated by their average full width at half maximum (FWHM) becoming broader in the dSTORM images as the trap power decreases and roughly following the theoretically expected dependence of  (Fig 1a and Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Response of the combined dSTORM and optical tweezers setup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Polystyrene beads (8.18 m mean diameter) with fluorophores attached to their surface are optically trapped by applying different trapping laser powers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average FWHM in the dSTORM reconstruction of the bead edge is determined for the different trapping powers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For reference, the grey curve indicates the theoretically predicted power dependence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lower images show dSTORM reconstructions for trapping laser powers of 42 mW (blue) and 5 mW (green).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars indicate the 95% confidence interval for the FWHM and the variation of the optical trap power.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Principle of the PDF: (I) white light imaging of the trapped object (left: polystyrene bead, right: E. coli cell) followed by frame-by-frame determination of its centre-of-mass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (II) Typical position trajectories (5 s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beads were trapped using 42 mW (blue) and 5 mW (green) laser power, revealing different extents of the trap stiffness according to a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (III) Multiple position determinations are used to calculate the PDF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to spherical beads, trapping rod-like-shaped bacteria results in a strongly elliptical PDF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) The PDF determined for a specific trap configuration is used for deconvolution, uncovering the much smaller structure of the beads edge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The edge profiles for the same bead under modified conditions are normalized and a Gaussian function is fitted; for 5 mW of trapping power, FWHM values of 223 nm before PDF deconvolution (green) and 145 nm post-deconvolution (magenta) were determined, compared with a pre-deconvolution FWHM of 126 nm for 42 mW of trapping power (blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) The ellipticity of the PDF is largely determined by the symmetry of the trapped object and the trap configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Displacements of equal amplitudes in either direction result in restoring forces on the bead of similar magnitudes towards the equilibrium position (left column).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trapping a rod-shaped object with two optical traps yields overall restoring forces of different magnitudes depending on the direction of the displacement (right column).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the mean displacement amplitude is higher parallel to the long axis of the bacterium, which causes the PDF to be extended in that direction and results in the elliptical shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars, 1 m.Full size image', 'Computational compensation of motion within optical trap', 'This consideration clearly bears analogies with the process of optical image formation where the diffraction-limited imaging process causes a structure to appear convolved by an optical point spread function (PSF) in conventional light microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An established postprocessing technique in this case is image deconvolution15, exploiting the fact that by prior knowledge of the PSF (or even theoretical modelling of the PSF based on known parameters of the imaging system) the actual structure can be revealed from the originally recorded image more clearly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With regard to localization microscopy of samples held by optical tweezers, knowing the position distribution function (PDF) of the object inside the optical trap also enables the use of algorithmic deconvolution of the reconstructed image to reduce the influence of position fluctuations on the reconstructed image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach will hold if at least one of two conditions is met: (i) each individual label contributes several localizations to the reconstructed image or (ii) the distance between the labels is sufficiently small, that is, the imaged structure is densely labelled, which applies to the samples presented here (Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Determination of the PDF is possible by detecting the trapped objects position frame by frame in a transmitted light image stack and binning its position trajectory to a two-dimensional (2D) grid (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be done before or subsequent to the dSTORM imaging, but in any case the trap configuration must not be altered between the imaging experiment and the determination of the PDF, that is, the number, relative arrangement and individual power of the optical traps need to remain unchanged (Supplementary Note 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using, for example, a centre of mass algorithm16, the PDF can also be identified for non-symmetrically shaped samples, such as single bacteria and other cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, fixed rod-shaped Escherichia coli bacteria floating in suspension are captured by two optical traps, which are positioned at the cells end caps (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the trajectory of the sample is binned, a 2D Gaussian function is fitted to the distribution and rendered to the same pixel size as the dSTORM image for which it will be used during deconvolution (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy of the chromosome of a fixed E. coli cell immobilized by two optical traps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematics explaining the cell trapping by holding the bacterium using two optical tweezers at its end caps and the simultaneous super-resolution imaging experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Diffraction-limited fluorescence image and (c,e) super-resolution fluorescence images before (c) and after (e) deconvolution using the PDF (d and Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acquiring the raw dSTORM data took 90 s.

A comparison of the diffraction-limited fluorescence image (Fig 2b) of the chromosomal DNA and the directly reconstructed dSTORM image (Fig 2c) readily demonstrates the power of super-resolution imaging of optically trapped biological samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify that similar structures are observed in trapped and attached cells, E. coli cells are initially held in suspension and then pulled onto the coverglass by the optical traps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  dSTORM images recorded under these conditions show consistent structures in both cases (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation indicates that in contrast to translational Brownian motion, no significant rotational Brownian motion appears in the case of the trapped bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is further verified by dividing the dSTORM localizations of one trapped cell into separate reconstructions which, again, show consistent structures (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Deconvolution of the dSTORM reconstruction (Fig 2c) with the optical traps PDF (Fig 2d) leads to an image with increased spatial resolution and higher contrast (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural features of the bacterial chromosome with dimensions of  less_than 100 nm can now be resolved (Fig 2e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Close inspection of the super-resolution images reveals multiple nucleoids within a single cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E. coli cells are governed by coupled replication and chromosome segregation, and exhibit overlapping replication cycles if grown in nutrient-rich media18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This results in multiple copies of the chromosome in each bacterial cell, which show different progress in their second replication cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, it was recently shown that the nucleoids show heteromeric substructures, which are typical for a particular stage in the cell cycle19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, these heteromeric substructures of the E. coli chromosome are visualized in the super-resolution images of optically trapped E. coli (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Multiple perspectives by controlling the sample orientation', 'The benefit of being able to adjust the samples alignment relative to the image plane becomes apparent by our ability to consecutively image the same bacterium at different orientations: an E. coli cell is first held horizontally, that is, parallel to the focal plane (Fig 3a), and dSTORM data are recorded (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, one trap is switched off.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This forces the bacterial cell to align vertically along the trap axis, caused by its rod-like shape following the form of the Gaussian laser beam, which propagates in the axial direction (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lower end cap of the E. coli cell is then pushed onto the coverslip, followed by a second acquisition of dSTORM data (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By this means, three-dimensionally (3D) super-resolved information of a specimen can be gathered, where each single image reaches the isotropic high resolution of 2D localization microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This feature enables bypassing the inherently poorer spatial resolution of 3D localization microscopy along the optical axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is even more important in combination with fluorescent proteins, which emit substantially fewer photons than synthetic dyes and yield poor axial resolution in common 3D localization schemes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Still, for interpretation of the data, it must be taken into account that a reconstructed localization microscopy image shows a projection of the emitters position in the axial direction within a certain volume around the focal plane that can span throughout the entire E. coli chromosome (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, aligning one axis of a sample parallel to the focal plane in a first step results in limited information about the radial emitter distribution around that axis (Fig 3b), but this is achieved in the second step after aligning that axis orthogonal to the focal plane (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orthogonal alignment indicates that the nucleoid is located heterogeneously along the radial direction (Fig 3d and Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significantly lower DNA concentration is found near the centre of the bacterium, whereas DNA concentration (determined by the number of dSTORM localizations) is increased at a distance of 200380 nm from the centre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Holographic optical tweezers allow for super-resolution imaging of the same sample arranged in

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The parallel alignment of E. coli reveals distinct heterostructures of the nucleoid along the long axis (Figs 2e and 3b, and Supplementary Fig 7), which have been observed by dSTORM before19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reason for the tube-like structure of the nucleoid, which was revealed by measuring in orthogonal alignment, however, is still unclear (Fig 3d and Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nucleoids could be forced into this shape by radial confinement, but also the transertion model could explain the proximity to the membrane20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA compaction into thicker filaments is mediated by nucleoid-associated proteins22 and entropic effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These filaments are believed to exhibit a bead-on-a-string formation with an estimated bead size of 130440 nm (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From our measurements, we determined a median size (FWHM) of the highly resolved DNA filaments of 85 nm in both parallel and orthogonal alignment of the cell (Supplementary Fig 8), a value that is close to the lower bound of the reported bead size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify that the observed structures are neither artefacts caused by the labelling approach nor by handling the cells with the optical tweezers, identically prepared and additionally Sytox Green-labelled, but not optically trapped, E. coli cells were imaged by structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM), allowing for 3D super-resolution imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, similar tube-like structures of the nucleoid are observed in planes parallel to the long axis of the cell (Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although 3D-SIM provides the ability to observe multiple layers orthogonal to the focal plane and, hence, the long axis, it does not provide isotropic spatial resolution, because the axial resolution is approximately a factor of 3 lower than its lateral resolution13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar disadvantage also applies to common implementations of 3D localization microscopy, which also suffer from anisotropic resolution, usually worse in the axial direction24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With our combined HOT and dSTORM system, this drawback is overcome by its ability to freely align samples with respect to the image plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although not providing the opportunity to render a full 3D image, realignment of the sample allows for uniform super-resolution imaging of conventional 2D localization microscopy in planes parallel and orthogonal to their respective axes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immobilization and handling of suspension cells by optical tweezers is also readily compatible with other super-resolution imaging methods and opens up new opportunities to image and track cellular structures and interactions on the nanoscale.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
