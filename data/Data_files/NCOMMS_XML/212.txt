Reduction of aberrant NF-B signalling ameliorates Rett syndrome phenotypes in Mecp2-null mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mutations in the transcriptional regulator Mecp2 cause the severe X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome (RTT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we investigate genes that function downstream of MeCP2 in cerebral cortex circuitry, and identify upregulation of Irak1, a central component of the NF-B pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that overexpression of Irak1 mimics the reduced dendritic complexity of Mecp2-null cortical callosal projection neurons (CPN), and that NF-B signalling is upregulated in the cortex with Mecp2 loss-of-function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, we find that genetically reducing NF-B signalling in Mecp2-null mice not only ameliorates CPN dendritic complexity but also substantially extends their normally shortened lifespan, indicating broader roles for NF-B signalling in RTT pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide new insight into both the fundamental neurobiology of RTT, and potential therapeutic strategies via NF-B pathway modulation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder presenting almost exclusively in girls, with a prevalence rate of one in 10,00015,000 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After Downs syndrome, RTT is considered the second most common genetic cause of cognitive disability in girls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Children with RTT develop relatively normally for 618 months, after which they undergo a period of rapid regression, with loss of purposeful hand use, deceleration of head growth and onset of repetitive, autistic behaviours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations of the MECP2 gene on the X chromosome are found in over 95% of cases of classic RTT (refs 1, 2), and MECP2 has been implicated in several other neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism, childhood schizophrenia and X-linked cognitive disability3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although mouse genetic studies clearly reveal that abnormal neurodevelopmental phenotypes of Mecp2 mutant mice are largely attributable to lack of MeCP2 function in the central nervous system (CNS)4,5, there is little neuropathological understanding of the molecular causes of CNS abnormalities of Mecp2-null mice, or of children with RTT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'MeCP2 has been typically referred to as a transcriptional repressor that selectively binds to methyl-CpG dinucleotides in the mammalian genome and mediates transcriptional repression through interaction with co-factors; however, more recent work shows that MeCP2 can also function as a transcriptional activator6, and regulate global neuronal chromatin structure in response to neuronal activity7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, recent evidence clearly indicates that molecular pathways regulated by MeCP2 are tissue- and cell-type specific9,10,11,12, and that disruption of MeCP2 function in defined CNS circuits results in distinct RTT phenotypes13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is critical to identify MeCP2 target genes and pathways in distinct neuronal populations in order to understand the underlying molecular and cellular pathogenesis of RTT, and to design effective therapeutic strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have focused our investigation of molecular pathways regulated by MeCP2 on neocortical inter-hemispheric callosal projection neurons (CPN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CPN, projection neurons primarily located in cortical layers 2/3 (80%) and 5 (20%), connect homotopic regions of the two cerebral hemispheres via the corpus callosum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CPN are critically involved in bilateral associative integration of cortical information, and abnormal CPN development and dysfunction are implicated in autism17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our previous results identified that layer 2/3 CPN increasingly express MeCP2 as they mature, and that loss of MeCP2 function reduces their dendritic complexity in a largely cell-autonomous manner19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduced dendritic complexity of neocortical layer 2/3 projection neurons (predominantly the inter-hemispheric CPN) has also been observed in post-mortem brains of RTT patients21,22, with synaptic circuit abnormalities identified in this population in mouse23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it seems likely that the morphological abnormalities observed in this neuronal population might underlie at least some aspects of the cognitive, integrative symptoms observed in RTT, as well as more broadly in autism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these motivate and provide foundation for investigation and identification of gene targets of MeCP2 regulation in purified mouse CPN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Focusing on CPN, we identify Irak1, a signalling kinase and scaffold protein within the NF-B pathway, as one of the genes significantly upregulated by Mecp2-null CPN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirm that Irak1 is upregulated following Mecp2 loss-of-function, and that overexpression of Irak1 recapitulates the reduced dendritic complexity phenotype of Mecp2-null CPN, both in vitro and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We establish that NF-B pathway signalling is upregulated with loss of Mecp2 function or Irak1 overexpression in cortical neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we identify that genetic attenuation of the aberrant NF-B signalling in Mecp2-null (Mecp2/y) mice not only ameliorates the CPN dendritic complexity phenotype, it improves health, and thus significantly extends (50%) the usually shortened lifespan of Mecp2-null mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that abnormal activation of NF-B signalling, via loss of Mecp2 modulation of Irak1 expression, is centrally involved in the pathogenesis of Mecp2-null mice and, therefore, likely RTT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide new insight into both the fundamental neurobiology of RTT, and potential therapeutic strategies via NF-B pathway modulation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Identification of dysregulated genes in Mecp2-null CPN', 'To identify potential target genes regulated directly or indirectly by MeCP2, we performed comparative gene expression analysis on Mecp2/y (Mecp2-null) and wild-type CPN purified via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS; Supplementary Fig 1), using an approach we previously developed24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach of interrogating purified neuronal subpopulations reveals more extensive transcriptional disruptions in Mecp2-null brains than earlier studies performed on heterogeneous brain tissue homogenates12, because of the different target genes of MeCP2 in distinct cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified 18 overexpressed and 19 underexpressed candidates that are most severely dysregulated at very high levels of statistical stringency ( greater than 2 or  less_than 2-fold dysregulation, P less_than 0.001) by Mecp2-null CPN (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2), and an additional 38 overexpressed and 46 underexpressed genes in Mecp2-null CPN using a lower stringency of  greater than 1.5 or  less_than 1.5-fold dysregulation, P less_than 0.005 (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with accumulating evidence that MeCP2 deficiency causes abnormal neuronal development and maturation, these dysregulated candidate downstream targets include genes such as Kif1b, Mcf2 and Gsn, which are already known to be involved in dendritic, cytoskeletal and synaptic formation, maturation and maintenance (Supplementary Table 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'From this newly identified set of genes regulated by MeCP2 in CPN, we chose interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase 1 (Irak1) to further validate and functionally investigate in depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Irak1 is a central component of the NF-B pathway, which regulates multiple aspects of neuronal process development, including dendritic complexity and synaptic plasticity26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NF-B signalling has been extensively investigated in other systems, such as the immune system, and a number of its inhibitors have been identified and are already in use clinically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we reasoned that these investigations might have the potential to identify a viable avenue for treatment of disease pathology, potentially toward practical near-term therapies for RTT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'CNS-specific mis-regulation of Irak1 in Mecp2-null mice', 'Three independent probe sets identified approximately 3-fold overexpression of Irak1 in the initial microarray analysis, and we validated these findings using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR; Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, a number of other studies have also found overexpression of Irak1 in Mecp2-null brain regions28, but Irak1 has not previously been biologically investigated as an MeCP2 target gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed that Irak1 expression is aberrantly increased in the cortex of two independent lines of Mecp2-null mice, in which the Mecp2 locus was differently targeted4,5 (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, to investigate whether Irak1 overexpression is specific to the Mecp2-null CNS, or whether it is present in all organ systems, we analysed Irak1 expression levels in multiple distinct organs of Mecp2-null mice, including lung, heart, spleen and kidney, in addition to the cerebral cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis reveals that the increase in expression of Irak1 is, indeed, specific to Mecp2-null cortex, with no significant change in non-neural tissues examined (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: MeCP2 represses Irak1 expression in a brain-specific manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) In our microarray analyses, three independent probe sets reveal that Irak1 is overexpressed an average of 2.9-fold in P14 Mecp2-null CPN, which was confirmed by qPCR on three independent biological replicates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  *P less_than 0.05, **P less_than 0.01, paired two-sided t-test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) qPCR at 6 weeks of age reveals that Irak1 is overexpressed in cortices of two independent Mecp2-null mouse lines (B-mice and J-mice), when compared with wild-type cortex, but not in multiple non-CNS tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  *P less_than 0.05, unpaired two-sided t-test, mean±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (cf) To exclude the possibility that overexpression of Irak1 is an artefact of gene targeting of Mecp2, we knocked down Mecp2 in wild-type layer 2/3 neurons by in utero electroporation of an Mecp2 shRNA, in comparison with a control shRNA, at E15.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Cells electroporated with Mecp2 shRNA do not exhibit any disruptions in migration, laminar location or survival in comparison to control, scrambled shRNA, as indicated by GFP reporter expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 200 m. (d) Electroporated cells were purified by FACS at P14, and qPCR analysis reveals that Irak1 is overexpressed an average of 1.9-fold following an approximate 40% reduction in Mecp2 mRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  *P less_than 0.05 from three independent experiments, paired two-sided t-test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) MeCP2 protein (red) is detected in P14 layer 2/3 neurons (NeuN, blue) electroporated with a control, scrambled shRNA, but it is not detected in layer 2/3 neurons electroporated with an Mecp2 shRNA construct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) IRAK1 protein (red) is detected in layer 2/3 NeuN positive (blue) neurons electroporated with either scrambled or Mecp2 shRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 25 m (e,f).Full size image', 'Further, we assessed whether shRNA-mediated knockdown of Mecp2 similarly upregulates Irak1 expression in otherwise wild-type CPN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We electroporated either a scrambled control or Mecp2 shRNA construct into cortical progenitors at E15.5, the peak of layer 2/3 CPN generation, and purified electroporated cells at P14 via FACS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these studies, we employed an shRNA targeting Mecp2 that has been previously thoroughly validated to be effective and specific23,28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with previous studies employing these shRNA constructs, shRNA-mediated knockdown of Mecp2 does not appear to disrupt migration or survival of layer 2/3 CPN23 (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis by qPCR reveals a modest 35% knockdown of Mecp2 at the mRNA level (Fig 1d), while immunocytochemistry demonstrates highly reduced MeCP2 protein detection following knockdown (Fig 1e), in keeping with previous studies23,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reduction of MeCP2 expression by wild-type CPN is sufficient to increase Irak1 expression approximately 2-fold (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed by immunocytochemistry that IRAK1 protein is, indeed, expressed by layer 2/3 CPN (Fig 1f); however, the inherent limitations and variability of immunocytochemistry, combined with the decreased soma size and increased packing density of Mecp2-null CPN19, prevent reliable quantitative assessment of IRAK1 protein following only a 23-fold upregulation of Irak1 mRNA with Mecp2 loss-of-function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The Irak1/IRAK1 locus is located 10 kb downstream of the Mecp2/MECP2 locus in both mouse and human genomes (Supplementary Fig 2), raising the theoretical possibility that genome modification of the Mecp2 locus artifactually upregulates Irak1 expression because of this proximity of the loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, taken together, our experiments confirm that overexpression of Irak1 in Mecp2-null cortex results from loss of Mecp2 function specifically in the CNS; it is not an artefact of the gene targeting of the Mecp2 locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A recent study reported that MeCP2 can repress Irak1 expression via mirR-146a (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether MeCP2 might also directly regulate Irak1 expression in the cortex, we investigated whether MeCP2 binding sites exist on the Irak1 promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first analysed the methylation status of CpGs around the transcription initiation site of Irak1 via bisulfite genomic sequencing (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the majority of CpGs on or near exons 1 and 2 are methylated at very low levels, consistent with a previous study31, five CpGs in a region upstream of Irak1 (2,107; 1,492; 779; 547; and 426 bp) are highly methylated, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis identifies that MeCP2 binds specifically to the CpG at 1,492 bp upstream of the Irak1 transcription initiation site (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that Irak1 expression in the cortex might be regulated both directly and indirectly by MeCP2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This potential dual mode of regulation of Irak1 by MeCP2, and the identification of Irak1 upregulation in multiple Mecp2-null brain regions (including cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum) by multiple laboratories, indicates that Irak1 is an important MeCP2 target gene, requiring tight regulation in neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We, therefore, investigated whether aberrant overexpression of Irak1 might underlie, at least in part, Mecp2-null neuronal phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Overexpression of Irak1 disrupts CPN dendritic complexity', 'To determine whether overexpression of Irak1 induces the reduced dendritic complexity phenotype of Mecp2-null CPN, we first overexpressed Irak1 in developing immature cortical neurons in culture;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In these experiments, we identify increased, aberrant expression of Irak1 caused by Mecp2 loss-of-function, and reveal that the resulting abnormal activation of NF-B signalling is critically involved in the pathogenesis of Mecp2-null mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While NF-B signalling has been most highly studied, and is best understood, in the immune system, there is an extensive literature investigating the regulation of neural process development and structural plasticity by NF-B, including dendritic complexity, in addition to implicating NF-B regulation in learning and memory (reviewed in Gutierrez and Davies27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NF-B subunits are expressed throughout the CNS, by neurons as well as by glia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within neurons, NF-B subunits are detected in neuronal processes and synapses, signalling back to the nucleus in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli, including Ca2+, neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, neurotrophins, cytokines and neural cell adhesion molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NF-B signalling either promotes or inhibits neurite growth in a context-dependent manner, with neuronal subtype and developmental stage being two key variables26,27,36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, a developmental switch in NF-B signalling is necessary for neurite outgrowth36, and NF-B activity increases during neuronal differentiation38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, NF-B signalling can either promote or inhibit neurite growth in the same neurons, depending on the mechanisms of NF-B activation37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This highly dynamic developmental regulation of NF-B likely results in the reduced dendritic complexity observed in embryonic cortical neurons cultured from Nfkb1-null mice39, while there is no disruption in dendritic complexity in adult Nfkb1-null CPN on an Mecp2 wild-type background (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, even modest dysregulation of the activity of this key signalling pathway might lead to widespread perturbations of neural development and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recently, null mutations in CC2D1A, a scaffolding protein that regulates multiple effectors upstream of NF-B, were found to cause a spectrum of cognitive phenotypes, including intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of Cc2d1a in mouse hippocampal neurons in vitro results in reduced dendritic complexity, which can be rescued by NF-B inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, mutations in TRAPPC9, which encodes a binding protein for NF-B-inducing kinase and IB kinase complex beta, have been identified in multiple families with intellectual disability41,42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings, taken together with our results, strongly suggest that excessive NF-B signalling disturbs normal brain function via aberrant circuit assembly, and that the neurodevelopmental disorder RTT (and potentially some autism spectrum disorders and other intellectual disabilities) is in consequential part attributable to abnormal activation of NF-B signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results also offer new insight into a neurodevelopmental disorder that partially displays RTT-like symptoms, and is caused by duplication of a genomic region that includes the MECP2 locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This duplication is thought to cause 1% of unexplained X-linked cognitive disability1,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the neurodevelopmental abnormalities have been attributed to gene dysregulation caused by increased MECP2 expression45,46, MECP2 and IRAK1 are both included in the duplicated regions of all patients with this disorder examined to date44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given our findings that overexpression of Irak1 significantly disrupts cortical neuronal dendritic morphology (Fig 2), it seems likely that duplication of IRAK1 itself, with associated increase in its expression, might partially and directly contribute to the pathogenesis of this category of cognitive disability, potentially explaining why RTT and X-linked cognitive disability due to duplication of MECP2 share similar symptoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Common regulation pathways shared by the immune system and nervous system have increasingly been identified in the past decade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, microarray analyses of human autistic brain tissue have detected increased transcript levels of many genes standardly viewed as immune system-related, including components of the NF-B signalling pathway47, and genome-wide association studies of multiple psychiatric disorders implicate both (what are standardly considered) neuronal and immune pathways48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, maternal immune activation through interleukin 6 (IL-6), a downstream target of NF-B signalling, results in offspring that display behaviours linked to schizophrenic and autistic behaviour in rodents49, and Mecp2 knockdown in vitro in myeloid lineage cells can enhance NF-B signalling and increase expression of inflammatory cytokines50,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent report indicates that microglia, the resident immune cells in the CNS, play a critical role in RTT52, and microglia-neuron immune crosstalk in the hypothalamus can regulate longevity via NF-B signalling32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is unlikely that this microglial mechanism underlies the increased longevity of Mecp2/y;Nfkb1+/ mice, however.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reducing NF-B signalling (Nfkb1+/) increases lifespan from 90 to 130 days in Mecp2-null mice, but has no effect on Mecp2 wild-type mice, within the timeframe of our analyses (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetically attenuating NF-B signalling in microglia of the hypothalamus, on the other hand, only alters aging phenotypes in old mice (greater than 18 months), and a CNS-specific knockdown of NF-B signalling (IkbkbFl/Fl) extends average lifespan from 800 to 1,000 days32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Based on findings that reactivation of MeCP2 can reverse neurological phenotypes and lethality of Mecp2-null mice53,54, even at advanced symptomatic stages, attempts have been made to improve the developmental deficits of Mecp2-null mice, towards future therapeutic approaches for RTT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While some recent studies have focused on MeCP2 functions as a global inhibitor of transcriptional noise8,55,56, other recent studies indicate that modification of transcription of a single MeCP2 target gene or pathway can improve phenotypes of Mecp2-null mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, overexpression of Bdnf in Mecp2-null mice57; treatment with statin drugs to correct aberrant cholesterol homeostasis in Mecp2-null mice58; and systemic treatment of Mecp2-null mice with IGF1 (refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  59,6059,60), can all partially ameliorate the neurological abnormalities and extend lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, treatment of female heterozygous mice with a TrkB agonist can restore wild-type breathing frequency61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Because NF-B signalling has been extensively investigated, and because many inhibitors of this pathway have been identified and are already in use clinicallyincluding vitamin D, disulfram and sodium salicylate, our results strongly suggest that modulation of NF-B signalling via relatively modest pathway inhibition might provide a viable avenue for treatment of disease pathology, potentially towards practical near-term therapies for RTT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The known ability of vitamin D and its analogues to inhibit NF-B signalling62,63 is particularly compelling given the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in RTT patients64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Developmental vitamin D deficiency leads to severe neurodevelopmental disruptions and behavioural abnormalities in rodents (reviewed in Eyles et al.65), and there is growing evidence of a correlation between vitamin D deficiency and autism spectrum disorders66,67,68.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precise mechanisms by which vitamin D regulates neurodevelopment are not known, but these findings raise interesting questions regarding converging underlying mechanisms and possible involvement of NF-B signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Taken together, our results indicate that abnormal activation of NF-B signalling, at least in part via loss of Mecp2 regulation of Irak1 expression, is critically involved in RTT-like cerebral cortex dysgenesis, reduced dendritic-circuit complexity, and reduced health, function and lifespan of Mecp2-null mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide new insight into both the fundamental neurobiology of RTT, and potential therapeutic strategies via NF-B pathway modulation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
