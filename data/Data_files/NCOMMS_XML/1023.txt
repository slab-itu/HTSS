Progressive approach to eruption at Campi Flegrei caldera in southern Italy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Unrest at large calderas rarely ends in eruption, encouraging vulnerable communities to perceive emergency warnings of volcanic activity as false alarms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A classic example is the Campi Flegrei caldera in southern Italy, where three episodes of major uplift since 1950 have raised its central district by about 3 m without an eruption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual episodes have conventionally been treated as independent events, so that only data from an ongoing episode are considered pertinent to evaluating eruptive potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An implicit assumption is that the crust relaxes accumulated stress after each episode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we apply a new model of elastic-brittle failure to test the alternative view that successive episodes promote a long-term accumulation of stress in the crust.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results provide the first quantitative evidence that Campi Flegrei is evolving towards conditions more favourable to eruption and identify field tests for predictions on how the caldera will behave during future unrest.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Large calderas with areas of 100 km2 or more are among the most-populated active volcanoes on Earth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They commonly show episodes of unrest at intervals of 10102 years1 and, although the minority end in eruption, each raises concern that volcanic activity might be imminent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An outstanding goal therefore remains to distinguish between pre-eruptive and non-eruptive episodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'With an unprecedented 2,000-year record of historical unrest and eruption2, Campi Flegrei provides key insights for understanding the dynamic evolution of large calderas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three episodes of major unrest have occurred since 1950, in April 1950May 1952, July 1969July 1972 and June 1982December 1984 (refs 3, 4, 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The last occasion of such behaviour occurred during the century before the calderas only historical eruption in 1538 (refs 2, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current unrest is consistent with a reactivation of the magmatic system after 412 years and, hence, with an increase in the threat from volcanic activity to the calderas population of almost 360,000 people, as well as to the three million residents of Naples immediately outside its eastern margin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The largest ground movements recorded since Roman times have been concentrated near the modern coastal town of Pozzuoli at the centre of the caldera (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They have been dominated by a secular subsidence of c. 1.7 m a century2 that has been interrupted by at least two extended intervals of net uplift, by about 17 m in c. 14301538 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2) and about 3 m since 1950 (refs 5, 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pattern of recent uplifts has been radially symmetric, decaying to negligible movements at distances of about 5 km from the centre in Pozzuoli3,4,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cause of deep-seated subsidence has to be confirmed, but the uplift is consistent with an elastic-brittle crust being pressurized at depths of about 2.53 km, near the base of the geothermal system (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pressurization has been attributed to intrusions of magma, fed from a primary magma reservoir 79 km below the surface, and to disturbances of the geothermal system8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A sill geometry is preferred for the magma intrusions, because it requires the least overpressure to drive the observed magnitudes of uplift15, and inversions of geodetic data for the 19701972 and 19821984 uplifts yield intruded volumes of 0.020.04 km3, sill diameters of 46 km and mean thicknesses on the order of metres (Fig 1)15,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Structure and VT seismicity in Campi Flegrei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The active ring-fault zone encloses the principal area of caldera collapse (blue, shaded) associated with the eruption of the Neapolitan Yellow Tuff 15.6 kyr ago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upward ground movements since 1969 have extended 5 km (black, dashed curve) around the centre of uplift (black filled circle) and within the perimeter (magenta, dashed curve) defined by the proposed collapse associated with the eruption of the Campanian Ignimbrite 39 kyr ago54,55,56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are consistent with the intrusion of sills at depths of c. 3 km during 19691972 (inner black circle) and 19821984 (outer black circle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Serapeo (white filled circle) in Pozzuoli is shown for reference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scale bar is 3 km.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Epicentres of VT events57 across Campi Flegrei for the intervals 19721974 (pink circles), 19831984 (blue circles) and 20052015 (yellow circles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dashed line AB shows the trace of the cross-section in c.

we expect the combined episodes of uplift to show the VT-deformation behaviour of an elastic crust with a large number of small faults23,24 (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Regimes of deformation', 'The ideal sequence of behaviour starts from lithostatic equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial deformation is elastic, for which strain is accommodated by deformation of unbroken rock around faults (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the total strain increases, the crusts behaviour becomes quasi-elastic, for which most deformation is elastic, but a small proportion is accommodated inelastically by fault movement (which is recorded as VT seismicity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion of faulting increases until it becomes the only mechanism for accommodating additional strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this stage, the strain stored elastically remains constant and additional deformation is controlled inelastically by fault movement alone23,24 (Fig 3; see equations (2)(4), in the Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the rock between faults is expected to become increasingly damaged, with a greater linkage in the inelastic regime among cracks much smaller than the faults themselves25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequence finishes with bulk failure and the potential escape of magma through a newly propagating fracture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stored strain can then be released as the crust relaxes elastically around the newly opened fracture, as well as around the pressure source26 that caused the precursory deformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: The evolution of deformation regimes during elastic-brittle behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) As the applied differential stress increases from zero, the deformation of natural rock (black curve) deviates increasingly from elastic behaviour

circle) coincides with deformation under a constant maintained stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) The deviation from elastic behaviour is caused by faulting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total deformation caused by fault movements is represented by the cumulative number of VT events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of VT events increases exponentially with deformation in the quasi-elastic regime, but linearly with deformation in the inelastic regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) The evolution from quasi-elastic to inelastic deformation was observed (blue curve and line) during the 23-year precursory unrest before the

at Rabaul and supports our view that the entire sequence of unrest since 1950 reflects a long-term accumulation of stress in the crust (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interpretation is reinforced by the remaining interval of significant VT seismicity between 1972 and 1982 (Fig 2), which was characterized by a gradual decay in VT event rate from 200 to 300 events per month and a minor corrected, ground subsidence and recovery of about 5% of the total uplift.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was followed by a new 30-month episode of corrected uplift that, for its first 8 months until March 1983, raised the ground at Pozzuoli by 0.4 m without significant seismicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When VT events again occurred, they accelerated to rates of about 300500 events per month in  less_than 3 months (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The VT decay with minor ground movement resembles an extended aftershock sequence, in which fracturing and fault slip relax stresses in the surrounding rock under a constant bulk strain34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before faulting can resume, the surrounding rock must be re-stressed elastically until the local stresses have returned to their values before relaxation35.

same value of N/hch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the ratio of their respective event rates should be similar to the corresponding ratio of their mean rates of uplift.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such similarity is indeed observed: the ratio of VT event rates lies in the range 0.7±0.3, which embraces the uplift-rate ratio of 0.8 for mean uplift rates of 0.57 m per year in 19691972 and 0.72 m per year in

seismic relaxation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To a first approximation, stress and uplift change in proportion when behaviour is quasi-elastic23, so that the fraction of total stress lost during relaxation is approximately the ratio of uplift during elastic recovery to total uplift before relaxation, that is 0.4 out of 2.5 m or 16%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This value is consistent with independent estimates of the proportion of energy lost by seismicity during 19721982.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion of total stress relaxed by seismicity is (Es/ET)1/2, where Es and ET are the seismic energy released and total

'Our interpretation predicts that if the current uplift continues to a corrected value of about 4.5 m at Pozzuoli, the crust in Campi Flegrei will have returned to the stress conditions that prevailed in 1984 at the end of the last major uplift (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We would then expect any additional uplift to continue the VT-deformation trend interrupted in 1984 and, hence, to be accompanied by a significant increase in VT seismicity, regardless of the specific mechanism that is increasing the applied differential stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Should the rate of uplift also return to the rapid values of 19821984, we would further expect the onset of VT event rates as high as 8001,000 per month.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rapid uplift, however, is not essential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At Rabaul, for example, the approach to eruption was preceded by 2 years at a maximum recorded uplift rate of about 0.15 m per year, which was about three times smaller than the peak rates that had been registered 10 years previously24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A return to the long-term VT-deformation trend at Campi Flegrei may thus occur at uplift rates and VT event rates slower than observed during previous emergencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The indirect stress ratio h/ch suggests that the differential stress accumulated in Campi Flegreis crust is about four times its tensile strength (Fig 5) and so is approaching the transition from quasi-elastic to inelastic deformation regimes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An increase in linkage among small-scale cracks between faults is also expected to occur at the transition to inelastic behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would favour an increase in bulk permeability and, hence, a faster escape of fluids from the geothermal system, which is consistent with the onset of corrected subsidence in 1984.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A return to the long-term VT-deformation trend may therefore be characterized by inelastic behaviour under a constant maintained stress, for which increases in total deformation are determined by additional fault movement (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a transition would be associated with VT event rates increasing in proportion to the rate of uplift.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The few field data available for large calderas and stratovolcanoes suggest that the quasi-elastic regime contributes between 40 and 80% of the total precursory deformation (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming this range, a corrected uplift of 4.2 m at the end of quasi-elastic behaviour at Campi Flegrei (Fig 5) indicates that the inelastic regime may continue until reaching a total corrected uplift of between 5 and 10 m before an eruption can be expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A transitional value of 4 for h/ch assumes that bulk failure occurs in tension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The value increases towards 5.6 as the failure mechanism involves tension with an increasing component of shear27,28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing shear could thus raise the transitional uplift by some 25% and, hence, yield a total corrected uplift of between 6.25 and 12.5 m before an eruption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The estimated limits on total uplift are smaller than the 17 m of caldera-wide uplift inferred to have occurred during the century before the calderas last eruption in 1538 (refs 2, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A greater total uplift would be favoured by a larger uplift before the transition to inelastic behaviour, without necessarily changing the proportion of uplift in the two deformation regimes, or by a greater proportion of uplift in the inelastic regime alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A larger transitional uplift would be favoured if the pre-1538 intrusions had been required to break connected horizons of rock stronger than those providing resistance today (to increase the uplift required before tensile failure).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Otherwise, the difference may indicate that mechanisms for reducing effective bulk rigidity, such as bedding-plane slip43,44, become significant as deformation proceeds (to enable greater uplift for a given applied stress); that, at timescales of 102 years, non-brittle (and seismically quiet) processes, such as viscous flow19, also contribute to deformation (to permit greater uplift than from elastic-brittle behaviour); that additional intervals of fault slip under constant strain reduce the accumulated stress (to enable a greater total uplift before the failure stress is eventually achieved); or that fluid pressure in the hydrothermal system has become large enough to contribute significant uplift.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although these mechanisms would favour a greater proportion of inelastic deformation at Campi Flegrei than has been recorded elsewhere, none of them guarantees that an uplift of 17 m needs to occur before eruption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The onset of inelastic behaviour thus represents a significant increase in the potential for volcanic activity and provides a new criterion for defining levels of alert.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In common with other volcanoes for which few or no precursory data are available from previous eruptions45,46,47, expert elicitation is a favoured method for evaluating unrest at Campi Flegrei48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method estimates the probability of an eruption given the occurrence of selected precursory criteria, such as critical rates or amounts of ground uplift.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By necessity, the critical values are determined empirically from volcanoes elsewhere and so are not well constrained49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the VT-deformation trends (Fig 3) are generic and can be applied in the absence of historical information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The change from the quasi-elastic to inelastic regime therefore complements probabilistic evaluations by providing an objective criterion for increasing alert levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'At Campi Flegrei itself, an additional obstacle to effective warning is a low public awareness of volcanic hazard compared with the perceived threat from microseismicity50,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The persistent VT seismicity in 19831984 damaged buildings throughout Pozzuoli and triggered the evacuation of some 40,000 people52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with emergencies since 1950, therefore, a new episode of rapid uplift is likely to present a greater hazard from persistent ground shaking, as well as a significant increase in the potential for eruption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Past experience of rapid uplifts is thus unreliable for perceiving the level of risk during a future emergency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The residents of Campi Flegrei have experienced three episodes of rapid uplift over seven decades without an eruption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This favours the view that rapid uplifts are poor indicators of imminent volcanic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recognizing the long-term evolution in precursory behaviour is essential for moderating misplaced confidence in non-eruptive outcomes and for delivering improved warnings to the public.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
