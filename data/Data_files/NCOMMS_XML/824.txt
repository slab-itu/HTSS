CRISPR/Cpf1-mediated DNA-free plant genome editing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cpf1, a type V CRISPR effector, recognizes a thymidine-rich protospacer-adjacent motif and induces cohesive double-stranded breaks at the target site guided by a single CRISPR RNA (crRNA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that Cpf1 can be used as a tool for DNA-free editing of plant genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We describe the delivery of recombinant Cpf1 proteins with in vitro transcribed or chemically synthesized target-specific crRNAs into protoplasts isolated from soybean and wild tobacco.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Designed crRNAs are unique and do not have similar sequences (3 mismatches) in the entire soybean reference genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeted deep sequencing analyses show that mutations are successfully induced in FAD2 paralogues in soybean and AOC in wild tobacco.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike SpCas9, Cpf1 mainly induces various nucleotide deletions at target sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant mutations are detected at potential off-target sites in the soybean genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that Cpf1crRNA complex is an effective DNA-free genome-editing tool for plant genome editing.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas), an adaptive immune system of prokaryotes1, has now become a powerful tool for genome editing2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the type II CRISPR-Cas system, RNase III and the single, large Cas9 protein are involved in the processing of precursor CRISPR RNA (crRNA) in the presence of trans-acting crRNA6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Cas9 protein has two additional functions: recognizing the target site and making a site-specific double-stranded break7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the type I and type III systems, several Cas proteins are involved in the recognition and cleavage of target sites8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the simplicity and efficiency of the type II system, Cas9 proteins (especially from Streptococcus pyrogene) are widely used for genome editing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'CRISPR-Cpf1 (CRISPR from Prevoltella and Francisella1) has recently been reported as a new type of genome-editing tool9; similar to the type II CRISPR-Cas system, a single Cpf1 protein functions in crRNA processing10, target-site recognition and DNA cleavage9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cpf1, however, differs from Cas9 as follows9,11: (1) Cpf1 recognizes T-rich (such as 5-TTTN-3) PAM sequences; (2) the PAM sequence is located at the 5-end of a target DNA sequence, upstream of a protospacer sequence; (3) Cpf1 is guided by a single crRNA, no trans-acting crRNA is needed9; and (4) Cpf1 is a ribonuclease, processing precursor crRNAs10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among several proteins in the Cpf1 family, LbCpf1 from Lachnospiraceae bacterium ND 2006 and AsCpf1 from Acidaminococcus sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BV3L6 act more effectively in human cells compared with other orthologues9,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previously, we reported a DNA-free genome-editing method in plants using SpCas9 mixed with a single guide RNA (ribonucleoprotein, RNP)13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Use of RNPs can reduce off-target effects and cytotoxicity associated with DNA transfection and also avoid the possibility of integration of small DNA fragments derived from plasmids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether the Cpf1 protein can be used as an alternative DNA-free genome-editing tool in plants, we delivered the recombinant LbCpf1 and AsCpf1 proteins mixed with crRNAs into protoplasts isolated from soybean and wild tobacco plants and analysed insertion and deletion (indel) frequencies and patterns at the targeted loci (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results show that Cpf1crRNA complexes can introduce targeted mutations in plant genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Schematic overview of CRISPR/Cpf1RNP-mediated genome editing in plants.To edit the plant genome without introducing DNA, recombinant Cpf1 proteins and in vitro-transcribed crRNAs were pre-assembled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These active RNP complexes were delivered via conventional PEG-mediated transformation to protoplasts isolated from the target plant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The delivered RNP complex can recognize the crRNA complementary sequence and produce cohesive double-stranded breaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 10 m.Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We showed here that Cpf1crRNA RNP complexes successfully induced indel mutations, mainly deletions of several base pairs, at two targeted loci simultaneously in the soybean genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To implement Cpf1 as a plasmid-based genome-editing tool for plants, one should consider the host-plant-specific codon usage and choose appropriate promoters to express Cpf1 and crRNA in cells as shown in a recent report20, but these concerns can be circumvented by using the Cpf1RNP system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Cpf1RNPs can considerably reduce off-target mutations12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We cloned plant-codon optimized Cpf1 and mature crRNA into a plasmid that we used to express SpCas9 and guide RNA in protoplasts13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we failed to induce indels in protoplasts using this system (Supplementary Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Xu et al.20 recently showed the same result in rice; the delivery of a plasmid expressing Cpf1 proteins and mature crRNAs into the cells was not able to induce the targeted mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To solve this problem, Xu et al.20 delivered two different types of precursor crRNA and were able to edit the target sites with high levels of indel frequencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we found that expression of the Cpf1 protein in protoplasts was not detectable (Supplementary Fig 5b), suggesting that codon optimization is not the only issue to consider for optimizing Cpf1 protein expression in plant cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The Cpf1RNP system has at least three potential benefits for plant genome editing compared with the Cas9 RNP system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, Cpf1 crRNAs are shorter than Cas9 sgRNAs by 60 nucleotides, allowing us to use a chemically synthesized crRNA: no foreign DNA was inserted in the host genome using the RNP method when chemically synthesized crRNAs were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, Cpf1 induces larger deletions in the target sites than does SpCas9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, the cleavage pattern of Cpf1 might assist the NHEJ-mediated insertion of donor DNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our previous study, we edited a target gene in lettuce protoplasts using the SpCas9-RNP system and successfully regenerated whole plants from the protoplasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To fully validate the viability of our Cpf1-mediated plant genome editing protocol for producing transgenic plants, we hope to generate whole plants from Cpf1RNP-transfected protoplasts in the near future and confirm the heritability of mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Cpf1RNP system will be used as an additional tool to edit the plant genome without introducing foreign DNA.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
