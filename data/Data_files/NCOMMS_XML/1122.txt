Real-time observation of cation exchange kinetics and dynamics at the muscovite-water interface  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Ion exchange at charged solidliquid interfaces is central to a broad range of chemical and transport phenomena.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Real-time observations of adsorption/desorption at the molecular-scale elucidate exchange reaction pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report temporal variation in the distribution of Rb+ species at the muscovite (001)water interface during exchange with Na+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Time-resolved resonant anomalous X-ray reflectivity measurements at 25 °C reveal that Rb+ desorption occurs over several tens of seconds during which thermodynamically stable inner-sphere Rb+ slowly transforms to a less stable outer-sphere Rb+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Rb+ adsorption is about twice as fast, proceeding from Rb+ in the bulk solution to the stable inner-sphere species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Arrhenius plot of the adsorption/desorption rate constants measured from 9 to 55 °C shows that the pre-exponential factor for desorption is significantly smaller than that for adsorption, indicating that this reduced attempt frequency of cation detachment largely explains the slow cation exchange processes at the interface.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Charged solidliquid interfaces are primary sites for a wide array of chemical reactions including ion adsorption and molecular uptake1,2,3,4,5, catalysis6,7,8,9,10 and energy storage11,12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fundamental understanding of these processes depends on the ability to see changes in interfacial structure during reactions within the electrical double layer (EDL)15,16,17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent work20,21,22 demonstrated that the EDL structure at solidwater interfaces can be complex, having coexisting ions in different hydration states including inner-sphere (IS) complexes that adsorb at the surface in a partially solvated state and outer-sphere (OS) complexes that adsorb in a fully solvated state (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Distinguishing these adsorbed species requires determination of the interfacial structure at the molecular scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, knowledge of the dynamic variations in these adsorbed counterions largely relies on computational studies4,23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, experimental validations of ion dynamics at interfaces are scarce primarily because of difficulties in monitoring molecular-scale changes in the interfacial structure in situ and in real time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction steps that control ion dynamics at interfaces, including reaction pathways that determine the overall reaction rates as well as energy barriers that separate distinct adsorption states within the pathways, are also not well defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Monovalent cation exchange and interfacial structure at the muscovite mica (001)water interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic of the EDL at the muscovitewater interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monovalent cations adsorb as a combination of partially hydrated IS and fully-hydrated OS complexes, with several potential pathways for exchange between the adsorbed and bulk solution species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Interfacial structure between the mica (001) surface and 30 mM NaCl versus 3 mM RbCl solutions22,56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total electron-density profiles determined by high-resolution XR are shown for the two solutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of IS and OS Rb+ determined by RAXR is shown in shaded areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The height is referenced to the average height of oxygen in the mica surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of OS Rb+ is scaled vertically by a multiplicative factor of 3 for clarity.Full size image', 'Muscovite mica has a basal surface that is atomically flat with a known structural negative charge (1e per surface area of a unit cell, AUC=46.72 Å2, corresponding to 0.34 C m2; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adsorption of simple alkali cations and associated changes of interfacial hydration at the muscovite (001)water interface have been studied extensively using various approaches including surface force apparatus27,28,29,30, atomic force microscopy31,32, in situ X-ray surface scattering22,33,34,35,36 and computational simulations34,37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies unequivocally report that the reactivities of cations are closely related to their hydration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, a competitive adsorption isotherm between Rb+ and Na+ at the muscovite (001)water interface revealed that the intrinsic adsorption constant (K°ads) for Na+ on the muscovite (001) surface is substantially lower than that for Rb+ (102.51±0.14 versus 104.12±0.10; refs 35, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relatively weak adsorption for Na+ was interpreted to result from a larger energy cost for partial dehydration of more strongly hydrated Na+ compared to Rb+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Gibbs free energy of hydration for Na+ is 365 kJ mol1, and is significantly larger than 275 kJ mol1 for Rb+ (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Differences in cation hydration can also influence adsorbed cation speciation at the interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of Rb+ adsorbed at the muscovite (001)water interface was determined to be a mixture of IS and OS complexes using in situ resonant anomalous X-ray reflectivity (RAXR)22 (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fractional coverage of IS Rb+ was 8590%, indicating that the majority of adsorbed Rb+ is in a partially solvated state, in which the muscovite surface completes the solvation shell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dominant IS adsorption of Rb+ within the surface ditrigonal site of the muscovite surface also was reported from in situ atomic force microscopy31,32 and in situ crystal truncation rod (CTR) measurements36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, our understanding of the distribution of Na+ adsorbed at the muscovite (001)water interface is still elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike Rb+, whose distribution can be determined precisely using X-ray reflectivity (XR) and RAXR techniques22, the adsorbed distribution of Na+ ions is difficult to quantify by these techniques because of its small electron-density contrast with a water molecule22,34,37 and its X-ray absorption K-edge energy (1.071 keV) that is too low for in situ RAXR measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, it was speculated that Na+ may adsorb to the muscovite surface at a greater distance from the surface (for example, as an OS complex) on the basis of its relatively weaker adsorption strength35 and stronger hydration strength40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Computational methods have been utilized to model the adsorbed structure of Na+ and the other alkali metal cations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the calculated structures depend strongly on the choice of force field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular dynamics simulations with the Kawamura force field37 show that all alkali metal cations except Li+ adsorb as an IS complex in the ditrigonal cavity of the muscovite surface34,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation contrasts with results using the Skipper force field41, which show preferential adsorption of cations on top of Al-substituted tetrahedra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecular dynamics simulations using the CLAYFF force field show that Na+ can form two types of IS species38, instead of one dominant species as observed by the other two calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, experimental and computational studies indicate that it is well understood that Rb+ forms mostly an IS complex at the muscovitewater interface, whereas further observations are needed to understand the adsorbed structure of Na+ accurately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we present experimental observations of the real-time evolution of adsorbed ion coverage and speciation during exchange reactions between Na+ and Rb+ at the muscovite (001)water interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Time-resolved RAXR measurements reveal both the significant difference between cation adsorption and desorption rates and asymmetric variations in adsorbed cation speciation at 25 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rb+ adsorption is faster than Rb+ desorption, and appears to proceed directly to the dominant IS species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Rb+ desorption is a slow stepwise process where thermodynamically stable IS Rb+ transforms to OS Rb+ before desorption from the interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Real-time variations in Rb+ coverage at temperatures from 9 to 55 °C indicate that slow desorption is primarily controlled by a small pre-exponential factor attributed to the multiple paths each ion can take as it desorbs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that the adsorption strength (as characterized by the intrinsic adsorption constant, K°ads) is determined by the relative magnitude between adsorption (kads) and desorption (kdes) rate constants, we conclude that the thermodynamic stability of these cation adsorbates is effectively determined by the rate of desorption, in particular the attempt frequency of detachments of ions from the muscovitewater interface.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

the reactions are reversible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rates of reaction were sensitive to both the reaction direction (for example, Rb+ adsorption versus desorption) and the photon energy where the XR data were measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apparent time constant (App) for Rb+ desorption at E=0.1 keV was almost twice the value for Rb+ adsorption (15 versus 8 s, respectively, Supplementary Table 1),

spectrum at ttads=14 s (where tads corresponds to the time when Rb+ adsorption started), that is, the spectrum has almost the same magnitude as that at ttads=30 s. The spectra measured during Rb+ desorption (Fig 3c) also show a notable change in shape at ttdes=14 and 30 s from the spectrum at ttdes=0 s, indicating that interfacial Rb+ distribution (that is, its speciation) changed during desorption42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the spectra (Fig 3d) measured during Rb+ adsorption show almost no shape changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These differences in the RAXR magnitude and shape indicate that temporal variations in the adsorbed Rb+ coverage and speciation depend on the reaction direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify this relationship, the

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Time-resolved RAXR reveals that Rb+ desorption is a slow stepwise reaction in which the thermodynamically stable IS Rb+ transforms to the less stable OS Rb+ before it desorbs from the interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the adsorption of Rb+ proceeds rapidly to the stable adsorption mode in which Rb+ adsorbs dominantly as an IS species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These asymmetric variations on Rb+ speciation with reaction direction can be understood in the context of the free energy profile of interfacial Rb+ (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative free energies of adsorption for the IS and OS species, the widths of the free energy minima and a lower limit for the energy barrier for the transition between the IS and OS states are obtained from the electron-density profile of Rb+ adsorbed on the muscovite surface derived from previous RAXR measurements22 (see Supplementary Note 5 for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The free energy profile for IS Rb+ is deeper than OS Rb+, reflecting thermodynamic stability of IS Rb+ over OS Rb+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because IS Rb+ is more stable than OS Rb+ by 6 kJ mol1 (corresponding to |G°ISOS| in Fig 6), the energy barrier for the transition from IS to OS for Rb+ during desorption (EISOS18 kJ mol1) is higher than the energy barrier for the transition from OS to IS during adsorption (EOSIS12 kJ mol1;

ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  57) is expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the observed Ea values (2640 kJ mol1; Table 2) are higher, indicating that additional energy is required to explain the difference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that adsorption and desorption processes also involve the (partial) disruption of the hydration shells around the cations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative differences in activation energies for Na+ and Rb+ can be understood by the relative differences in the ion hydration energies, that is, there is a larger barrier to adsorption for the more strongly hydrated Na+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the activation energies are substantially smaller in magnitude than the hydration free energies for the cations (365 kJ mol1 for Na+ and 275 kJ mol1 for Rb+;
