Misorientation-angle-dependent electrical transport across molybdenum disulfide grain boundaries  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Grain boundaries in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides have unique atomic defect structures and band dispersion relations that depend on the inter-domain misorientation angle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we explore misorientation angle-dependent electrical transport at grain boundaries in monolayer MoS2 by correlating the atomic defect structures of measured devices analysed with transmission electron microscopy and first-principles calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transmission electron microscopy indicates that grain boundaries are primarily composed of 57 dislocation cores with periodicity and additional complex defects formed at high angles, obeying the classical low-angle theory for angles  less_than 22°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inter-domain mobility is minimized for angles  less_than 9° and increases nonlinearly by two orders of magnitude before saturating at 16 cm2 V1 s1 around misorientation angle20°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This trend is explained via grain-boundary electrostatic barriers estimated from density functional calculations and experimental tunnelling barrier heights, which are 0.5 eV at low angles and 0.15 eV at high angles (20°).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Understanding the atomic structures of grain boundaries (GBs) is essential to controlling and improving electrical transport properties in both bulk and low-dimensional materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In traditional mesoscopic semiconductors, GBs are scattering sites for majority carriers and degrade transport via the formation of electrostatic barriers1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such degradation is amplified in low-dimensional materials due to the limited phase space and reduction in Coulomb screening3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides are one class of low-dimensional materials with unique electrical and electro-optical properties showing promise for emerging valleytronics4 and soft electronics applications5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, large-area monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides synthesized via chemical vapour deposition (CVD) inevitably possess GBs between randomly oriented crystal domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early theoretical research involving density functional theory (DFT) calculations for MoS2 predicted the possibility of both metal and semiconductor GB characteristics, depending on the local atomic structures6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, experimental assessment of MoS2 GB transport is still under debate in the literature6,7,8,9,10,11 due to a large device-to-device performance variation, poor single-domain carrier mobility, and, most importantly, lack of correlation between transport properties and GB atomic structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we overcome these difficulties by directly correlating four-probe transport measurements across single GBs with both high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging of the measured devices and first-principles calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using an inert-environment fabrication procedure, we observe a positive and nonlinear correlation between field effect mobility (FE) and misorientation angle ().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precise boundary location, orientation and atomic structure of transistor devices were also examined by TEM, results of which were cross-referenced with further characterization and imaging of pristine MoS2 GBs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On using DFT to calculate the -dependent local GB band structures, equilibrium electrostatic GB barriers were found to be correlated with experimentally determined barriers, which gives a clear understanding of the underlying mobility dependences.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Other missing inter-domain data of Fig 1e resulted from similar insulating behavior, likely due to tearing during substrate transfer (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation agrees with previous experiments on 3D crystals, where high-angle samples frequently shattered after growth14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peculiarly high mobility of the inter-domain 19° device results from the boundary

 The distance between the edge dislocation cores can be estimated by d=b/sin(), where b is the Burgers vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dislocations are composed of Up or Down types (Figs 2jm) that correspond to SS bonding or MoMo bonding at the core, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the three-fold (not six-fold) symmetry of the MoS2 monolayer, a lack of inversion symmetry exists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a scenario induces the formation of two types of LA-GBs with the aforementioned Up or Down dislocations along the armchair directions, as highlighted in Fig 2n.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All devices investigated for electrical transport were of the Up-type boundary variety (except for 19°, which is not utilized in the comparison) and thus comparison can be made.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the energies associated with Up/Down dislocations are similar, and both are energetically favourable since they both have the smallest Burgers vector 11-20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to kinetic growth limitations, GBs with overall relative orientation between the armchair directions of MoS2 are also composed of 1120 dislocations (Up/Down).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The boundary is decomposed into short armchair-oriented sections and is slightly kinked on the mesoscopic scale (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For bulk materials, LA-GBs usually imply  less_than 6° due to strong interactions between the strain fields generated by adjacent dislocation cores at higher angles15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, basal plane strain relaxation can occur in 2D materials via local rippling or buckling16, thereby allowing for an extension of LA-GB theory to larger angles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The periodicity of the dislocation core distance is inversely proportional to , in accordance with the classical LA-GB theory (Fig 2i and Supplementary Fig 9), but the range greatly exceeds the classical limit and is extended up to 13°, at which point the GB lines are bent by intense strain fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thermodynamically, these LA-GBs should follow a straight line in a direction perpendicular to the Burgers vector (armchair directions in MoS2), which is consistent with our observations (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'High-angle (HA)-GBs between two domains can be classified as either coherent or incoherent, the former of which refers to GBs that possess a periodic lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using notation from coincident site lattice theory17, the most favourable coherent boundaries for monolayer MoS2 are 7 (22°), 13 (28°), 19 (13°), and so on (Supplementary Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the results of TEM/STEM characterizations and DFT calculations (Supplementary Fig 12), we observed that most HA-coherent GBs also follow straight lines composed of continuous 57 ring cores, in a manner similar to LA-GBs (Figs 2c,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any GB with an  that deviates from coherent angles will be an incoherent GB (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A curved (non-straight) GB can be identified in the atomic scale images (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When compared to coherent GBs, the incoherent GBs have a larger aperiodic width of defects, whereas the mirror GBs (60° GB) are mostly straight along the zigzag direction and composed of a series of 44 cores with few kinks (Figs 2d,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when the mirror GB follows the armchair direction (due to growth kinetics), it is decomposed into a series of 48 cores (Supplementary Fig 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In terms of mechanical stability, LA GBs are mostly stable, regardless of the GB type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This explains how we were able to accumulate a large set of data points, as shown in Fig 1e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the HA region, only coherent GBs with =22°, 38° and 60° were stable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While many samples contained boundaries with intermediate angles, transport data were not collected for these specimens because GBs were easily fragmented during the transfer process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since incoherent GBs are generally wider with a complex array of defect structures (see Fig 2f), they are energetically less stable when compared to coherent GBs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This agrees well with the theoretical prediction that the total energy usually increases in response to the misorientation angle18.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Dislocations and GBs in IIIV systems (e.g., GaN) have previously been modeled by a generalized line charge with density L defect density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing L induces a larger electrostatic potential and results in a lower effective mobility19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison, here we observe a positive and nonlinear correlation between FE, the dislocation core density and .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explain why greater dislocation core density permits greater inter-domain mobility, and if results are consistent with the aforementioned theoretical models, we first consider whether the boundary is charged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IdsVgs curves from 26 two-terminal FETs (Fig 3a) reveal that Ioff is rather invariant and limited by leakage current, while hysteresis is trivial and a uniform 0.25 V (300 K), equal to the Vgs point spacing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Boundary charge must therefore be fixed, which is further examined by comparing respective Vth values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As transport is band-tail limited and a well-defined saturation regime is absent in the IsdVgs curves (Fig 3a), Vth is defined by the Vgs logarithmic turn-on point corresponding to the peak subthreshold swing (SS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This point is denoted at VgsVth=0 by a dotted line in Fig 3a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found 11 V less_than Vth less_than 5 V for all samples (Fig 3b), which is comparable to that obtained from STM studies of atomically clean exfoliated samples21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A positive 1.6-V shift (in median value) is observed in the inter-domain samples compared with intra-domain, which is clear evidence for the existence of an electrostatic potential barrier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This potential barrier can be estimated by noting that, at Vth, SS230 mV dec1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since  is measured at the Fermi level (EF) within the bandgap, 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Substituting  and SS above, we observe that Cloc=76 nF cm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An order-of-magnitude estimate for the potential barrier height b is obtained from an equivalent circuit model with SiO2 capacitance in series with the MoS2 self-capacitance, =190 meV (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Extraction of Schottky barrier height from the threshold voltage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Dual sweep Ids-Vgs data for 26 different intra-/inter-domain two-terminal FETs at 300 K.

transferred onto a highly doped (1019 cm3) silicon substrate with a 100-nm-thick thermal oxide layer by a conventional transfer method mentioned in the previous TEM sample preparation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glovebox preparation was employed for baking samples at 120 °C for SiO2 and MoS2 surface trap passivation for 2 h before beginning fabrication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All further baking steps during fabrication were also performed in the glovebox.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electron beam lithography and evaporation (Ti/Au 7/35 nm) were used to define the MoS2 electrode contacts for each sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MoS2 was patterned into an elongated Hall bar structure via a final electron beam lithography step, followed by a weak 10-W plasma etch for 10 s under a 30-sccm flow of SF6.

structure of each GB (high-resolution STEM images).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that we succeeded in transferring the entirety of each device, which allowed for a direct investigation of the electrical behaviour and its correlation to both the atomic structure of the GBs and defects in MoS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the transfer process was similar to the one previously mentioned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the method employed in this study is compatible with Ti/Au electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While Ti is not the optimum contact for MoS2, it is more easily transferred, as the Ti layer is easy to detach from the SiO2/Si substrate compared to other metals such as Cr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transfer time for this process is longer than that associated with typical transfer procedures, which require less than a minute to detach the PMMA/MoS2 from the SiO2/Si substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'TEM and DF-TEM', 'TEM imaging was conducted using a JEM ARM 200F machine operated at 80 kV; no damage was apparent in the samples at this accelerating voltage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The acquisition time for DF imaging was 1 s using the smallest objective lens aperture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HR-TEM imaging acquisition time was also 1 s.', 'ADF-STEM', 'ADF-STEM imaging was conducted using a probe aberration-corrected JEM ARM200F operated at 80 kV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-angle ADF images were acquired at 20 mrad convergence angle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the energy of the low-voltage electron beam was below the damage threshold energy, the pristine MoS2 lattice remains stable and defect-free with regular scanning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images presented in the main text were acquired with a medium-angle ADF detector with a collection angle ranging from 50 to 180 mrad and an acquisition time of 40 s per pixel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have used controlled imaging time (within 1 min) under high-magnification STEM node to avoid beam damage on the MoS2 sample6,24,25,26.

a 2 × 2 × 1 k-point mesh was used for geometrical optimizations, and a 4 × 8 × 2 k-point mesh was employed for electronic structure calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All models for structure optimization were supercells with a sufficiently large size and minimal defect interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The super sizes of all GB types were the same, as shown in Fig 4c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the
