Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Similar to electron waves, the phonon states in semiconductors can undergo changes induced by external boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, despite strong scientific and practical importance, conclusive experimental evidence of confined acoustic phonon polarization branches in individual free-standing nanostructures is lacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report results of BrillouinMandelstam light scattering spectroscopy, which reveal multiple (up to ten) confined acoustic phonon polarization branches in GaAs nanowires with a diameter as large as 128 nm, at a length scale that exceeds the grey phonon mean-free path in this material by almost an order-of-magnitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dispersion modification and energy scaling with diameter in individual nanowires are in excellent agreement with theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phonon confinement effects result in a decrease in the phonon group velocity along the nanowire axis and changes in the phonon density of states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The obtained results can lead to more efficient nanoscale control of acoustic phonons, with benefits for nanoelectronic, thermoelectric and spintronic devices.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The phonon states in crystal lattices can undergo changes induced by external boundaries1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modification of the acoustic phonon spectrum in structures with periodically modulated elastic constant or mass densityreferred to as phononic crystalshas been proven experimentally and utilized in practical applications3,4,5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A possibility of modifying the acoustic phonon spectrum in individual nanostructures via spatial confinement would bring tremendous benefits for controlling phononelectron interaction and thermal conduction at the nanoscale9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Engineering electron waves and energy dispersions with external boundaries in semiconductor heterostructures and quantum well superlattices became the foundation of modern electronics and optoelectronics11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent technological developments suggest that tuning the phonon energy dispersion may become as important for the next generation of nanoelectronic circuits as engineering of the electron dispersion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acoustic phonons carry heat in semiconductors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Improving phonon transport in nanometer scale devices is crucial for their reliability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phonons set performance limits for alternative technologies under development, from superconducting electronics to spintronics and quantum computing12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It has long been suggested theoretically that sound waves in layered media14, or acoustic phonons in nanostructures, can undergo modification due to externally imposed periodic or stationary boundary conditions15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modulation of the elastic constants, Cij, or mass density, , in such structures can lead to changes in the acoustic phonon dispersion, (q), which include reduction in the phonon group velocity, G=(q)/q or emergence of the phonon energy band gaps (here  and q are the phonon energy and wave vector, respectively)5,8,10,15,16,17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are many experimental reports of the phonon wave effects in periodic structures, including the early Raman spectroscopy studies in semiconductor superlattices20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The possibility of controlling the acoustic phonon spectrum in periodic structures has led to an explosive growth in the field of phononic crystals4,5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the strong motivations, and a large body of theoretical studies10,11, experimental investigation of the acoustic phonon confinement effects in individual nanostructuresas opposed to periodic compositesis lagging behind.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Establishing the existence of confined phonon subbands in free-standing nanostructures, and determining the length scale, D, at which they reveal themselves are important tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Controlling the phonon spectrum via spatial confinement would allow for fine-tuning of the phonon interactions with electrons, spins and other phonons, particularly at low temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A commonly used assumption in the thermal community21,22 is that the phonon spectrum modifications only appear when the structure size is on the order of the dominant thermal phonon wave length T(sh)/(kBT), which is about 1.5 nm for many solids at room temperature (RT) (here kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, h is the Planck constant and s is the sound velocity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This criterion is based on the notion that the phonon wave functions do not preserve coherence over larger distances owing to natural surface roughness in real nanostructures, defects and lattice anharmonicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the phonon wave interference required for modification of the phonon dispersion does not take place even if solution of the elasticity equation predicts the appearance of confined phonon subbands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another point of view2,10,15,18 considers that phonon spatial confinement effects start to take place when D is on the order of the average phonon mean free path (MFP), defined in kinetic theory as the grey MFP: G=3K/(CVs), which is about 20 nm for bulk GaAs at RT (here, K and CV are the thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is considered of importance because energy differences between the phonon subbands in the middle of the Brillouin zone (BZ) can result in changes in the electronphonon scattering, and, correspondingly, electron relaxation rates, particularly at low temperature2,12,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the thermal context, the spatial confinement and modification of the phonon density of states (DOS) can affect the thermal conductivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies established that the phonon MFP can be substantially larger than G (refs 24, 25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was found, that 40% of thermal conductivity of crystalline Si near RT come from the phonons with MFP above 1 m (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phonons with the longest MFP may have the lowest frequency, .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phonon life-time scales as s, where s1 depends on the phonon scattering mechanism and dimensionality of the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, phonon MFP =G will be growing with decreasing .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discovery of the large contribution of the long-MFP phonons to thermal conductivity makes the task of determining the length scale of the onset of confinement effects even more important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Semiconductor NWs with smooth boundaries are the most suitable candidates for investigation of spatial confinement of acoustic phonons in the free-standing (or free-surface) nanostructures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For NWs, the characteristic length scale D is the diameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, random distribution of diameters in typical NW arrays, small distances between NWs, and difficulty of direct detection of acoustic phonons so far precluded confirming the theoretically predicted confined phonon branches in NWs27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A few published reports for NWs only infer possible confinement effects indirectly by measuring thermal conductivity and comparing the result with calculations, which use both bulk and confined phonon dispersion29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach is ambiguous owing to the difficulty of separating the phonon confinement effects from the phononboundary scattering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Brillouin spectroscopy study of GaN nanowires made an important step forward in investigating confined phonons31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a large distribution in NW diameters, and discrepancy between the experimental and calculated dispersion left the question open.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Raman spectroscopy study of the etched Si membranes gave the energies of the slab phonon modes in the BZ center32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another notable investigation of the etched suspended Si membranes confirmed the changes in the fundamental phonon modes but have not shown clear confined phonon subbands, possibly owing to surface roughness inherent for the etched films or strain in the suspended structures33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report measurements of the acoustic phonon spectrum of NWs in a unique set of NW arrays with different diameter and large inter-nanowire distance, which allowed us to conclusively prove the existence of the confined phonon polarization branches in individual nanostructures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have also discovered that the phonon confinement effects become pronounced at a substantially larger length scale than previously believed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis is focused on confined phonons in the 440 GHz range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, higher frequency confined phonons have also been observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By varying the distance between the NWs we proved that the observed spectral feature are signatures of individual NWs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured phonon dispersion in NWs is in excellent agreement with theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The obtained results can lead to more efficient nanoscale control of acoustic phonons, with benefits for various practical applications.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Large H and L greater than  greater than D also ensure that each NW can be modelled theoretically as an infinite NW with free-surface boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These unique characteristics of NW samples made possible investigation of the phonon spectrum features originating in individual NWs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'There are three mechanisms, which contribute to light scattering in our samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are scattering from the bulk, that is, the volume of the substrate via the elasto-optic mechanism34,35; from the surface of the substrate via the surface ripple mechanism34,35; and from the side-facets of NWs via the surface ripple mechanism as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the volumetric mechanism (i) the phonon wave vector, q, is fixed at qB=4n/ where n is the refractive index of GaAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the ripple scattering mechanisms (ii) and (iii), the phonon wave vector is given by qSS=(4/)sin() for the substrate and qSNW=(4/)cos() for NWs (see notation for angle  in Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in the angle dependence is due to the perpendicular alignment of NWs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In probing the ripple scattering mechanism, changing  allows one to vary q within a certain range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The volumetric elasto-optic scattering is absent in our NWs because D less_than .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the light scattering is from the NW surface ripples it inherently depends on the confined phonon modes inside the NW, which create the ripples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our experiments, changing  from 15° to 40° corresponded to 6.1 m1qSS15.2 m1 and 18.1 m1qSNW22.8 m1 in the ripple scattering from the substrate and NWs, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking into account that n=4.13 for GaAs (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  46) at =532 nm the q value for the substrate elasto-optic scattering was fixed at qB=97.6 m1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1c shows BMS spectra of NWs with the diameter D=122 nm (inter-NW distance H=800 nm) extracted from SEM data, and the substrate without NWs in the frequency range from 20 to 125 GHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phonon peaks at 45.6 and 85.8 GHz in the spectrum from the substrate correspond to the transverse acoustic and longitudinal acoustic (LA) polarization branches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These peaks originate from the true acoustic bulk phonons that have zero frequency at the BZ center, that is, (q=0)=0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bulk phonon peaks are present in the spectra of NW samples as well because part of the signal is coming from the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most interesting feature of NW spectrum is the appearance of additional peaks attributed to the confined acoustic (CA) phonons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These phonons are quasi-optical in nature, in a sense, that their energy is non-zero at the BZ center, that is, (q=0)0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All confined phonons in NWs are hybrid in nature comprising of vibrations with different polarization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although confined phonons are higher in energy than the true acoustic phonons, in the experimental spectrum, they appear at smaller frequencies because the probing phonon wave vectors are different: qSNW less_than qB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1d presents the evolution of the BMS spectrum for the same NW sample for different values of q that are varied by changing the angle .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were able to resolve six confined phonon branches denoted as CAi (i is the confined phonon index).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For clarity, the BMS spectra for the bare substrate without nanowires at various incident light angles has been shown in Supplementary Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peak below 15 GHz is a mixture of the true LA phonons in the substrate and LA-like phonons in NWs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To understand and confirm the confined nature of the observed phonon peaks above 15 GHz, we solved the elasticity equation for NWs using the finite-element method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulations were carried out for NWs with hexagonal cross-sections using GaAs elastic constants for a specific crystallographic direction (111) and NW diameter determined from SEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2a shows the simulated phonon dispersion (solid curves) in a hexagonal NW along the 111 direction for D=122 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One can see excellent agreement between the experimental data and modelling results for both true acoustic and confined phonon branches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The accurate BMS peak positions were determined using Lorentzian fitting (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental uncertainties, on the order of 1 GHz, is within the standard deviation of the NW diameters (that is, 2.9% for D=122 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other sources of uncertainty are inevitable variations in the elastic behaviour of NWs resulting from the stacking faults and possible small inclusions of the wurtzite phase to the dominant zinc-blende (ZB) polytype in NWs with various diameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may result in a small change in the

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our proof of the confined nature of the phonons is based on excellent agreement of the dispersions obtained from BMS experiments and calculated for the exact NW shape and material parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to confirm that the identified phonon modes are Brillouin active, we calculated the average surface displacement of NWs side-facet perpendicular to qSNW.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the surface scattering mechanism, the phonon modes that produce displacement perpendicular to qSNW in the plane of scattering are those likely to contribute to the BMS spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scattering cross-section is given by (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  47)', '', 'Here  is a coefficient proportional to the illuminated area, I is the frequency of the incident light, c is the speed of light in the vacuum, F is a function of the incident and scattered light angles as well as n of the scattering medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The last term  less_than  greater than  is the surface-displacement power spectrum with qx projection to the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculated displacements, which enter equation (1), are shown in Fig 2b by the colour of the simulated phonon branches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are in agreement with the experiment in a sense that the measured data points are all within the Brillouin active segments of the polarization branches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that these branches are active is in line with the observation that the considered phonon modes are hybrid in nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The phonon modes are visualized in Fig 3a,b as the normalized displacement field distributions in NWs for two wave-vectors qSNW=0.3 m1 and qSNW=18.0 m1close and away from the BZ center, correspondingly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modes become more hybrid in nature as q increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The active modes show strong surface ripple on the side facets of NWs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The symmetry of the confined modes is complicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The point group of ZB is Td with 24 invariant operations whereas wurtzite is characterized by C6v (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confined NW geometry reduces the symmetry to C3v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two lowest branches are flexural acoustic modes of E1 symmetry with the quadratic dispersion k2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The degeneracy of this branch is broken for NWs along the 111 direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The next two acoustic modes, torsional acoustic of A2 symmetry and LA-like of A1 symmetry, respectively, have linear dispersion k, near the BZ center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The confined branches mainly belong to the higher symmetry groups for example, E2, B1, B2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See animation of the modes in Supplementary Movie 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Normalized displacement field of the Brillouin-active phonon modes.The calculated data are for a 1-m long NW with (a) qS-NW=0.3 m1 and (b) qS-NW=18.0 m1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The red colour corresponds to stronger displacement.Full size image', 'The final element of evidence of spatial confinement of acoustic phonons in free-standing NWs comes from the analysis of the diameter dependence of the CA phonon frequencies (energies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 4a shows the measured phonon spectra for different NW diameters, D (H=800 nm for all samples).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One can see that with increasing D, the frequencies of the confined phonons decrease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trend and the magnitude of the frequency change are consistent with the theory (see calculated dispersions for various D in the Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 4b we present spectra of NWs with the constant D=122 nm and varying H. The spectral position of CA peaks does not depend on the inter-NW distance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of H dependence indicates that the measured spectral features are characteristics of individual NWs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is no elastic coupling among NWs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spatial phonon confinement in the free-surface NWs is distinctively different from the phonon spectrum changes owing to the periodic boundary conditions in the phonon band-gap materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Effect of the diameter and inter-nanowire distance on confined phonon energies in nanowires.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Brillouin-Mandelstam spectrum for NWs with different diameter at a constant probing phonon wave vector qS-NW=18.1 m1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decrease in the frequency of the confined phonons with increasing NW diameter is clearly visible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The confined phonon branches show strong diameter dependence even for relatively large D values in the range from 103 to 128 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diameter dependence proves conclusively the presence of the spatial confinement effects at the length scale above the grey phonon mean-free path.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Measured spectrum for a set of NWs with the constant diameter D=122 nm and varying inter-NW distance H at a constant probing phonon wave vector qS-NW=22.8 m1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data are presented for the same fixed accumulation time of 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectral position of the CA peaks does not depend on H. The intensity decreases with increasing H owing to smaller number of illuminated NWs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of the inter-NW distance dependence proves that the observed spectral features are characteristics of individual NWs.Full size image', 'A remaining intriguing question in confirming the confined nature of CA peaks is why their full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) appear smaller than that of the substrate LA phonon peak (see Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theory suggests that the phonons with smaller group velocity, G, should be more strongly scattered18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phonon life-time limited by the point-defect scattering, , rapidly decreases with decreasing G (here Vo is the volume per atom and  is the defect scattering factor).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Umklapp limited phonon life-time also decreases with decreasing G. The answer to this question is that FWHM of the elasto-optic and ripple mechanism peaks cannot be compared directly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FWHM of the LA peak from the substrate ( =13.6 GHz) is defined by the light absorption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For an opaque crystal with the refractive index n=n1+in2, theoretical broadening for the elasto-optic scattering49 is  /=2n2/n1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using for GaAs, n1=4.13 and n2=0.34 46, we obtain  /=0.164, which closely matches with the measured  /=0.158.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the CA phonons, observed in our experiments via the surface ripple scattering, the peak broadening is defined by the aperture effects34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The fact that the acoustic phonon spectrum becomes strongly modified near BZ center at the length-scale much larger than the grey phonon MFP or the thermal phonon wavelength has important implications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It means that the acoustic phonon confinement can affect the electronphonon scattering rates50 in the structures comparable in size to the state-of-the-art electronic devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BZ-center phonons (q less_than 106 cm1) are essential for controlling electron relaxation2,15,17,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequency-dependent average phonon group velocity51 ()=g()/j1/j(), which affects the heat conduction, also changes (here g() is the number of phonon branches in the spectra with the frequency , and j() is the group velocity of the phonon mode of the subband j and frequency .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The group velocity of each phonon branches is shown in Supplementary Fig 8a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In NWs with D100 nm, ()drops to less than half of the LA-like mode sound velocity in the frequency range around 2060 GHz due to emergence of the confined phonon branches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our measurements were conducted in the GHz range of phonon frequencies, which dominates heat conduction at low temperature52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that we established the existence of the confined phonon branches at RT indicates that the effects can be even stronger at low temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  THz phonons are considered to be the main contributors to thermal transport at RT owing to a much higher DOS, which scales as 2 in bulk crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the nearly dispersion-less confined phonons in the BZ-center can substantially change the DOS (Supplementary Fig 8b) resulting in a greater role for the GHz phonons in thermal transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even in bulk, the low-frequency phonons, including the GHz range, participate in the phononphonon scattering processes1,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of the low-frequency phonons is greatly increased in alloyed materials because the higher frequency phonons scatter more strongly54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A possibility of reducing the phonon thermal conductivity in nanostructures with smooth boundaries is important for thermoelectric devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phonon confinement mechanism allows one to reduce the thermal conductivity without degrading the electron transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may become particularly relevant in the quest for efficient low-temperature thermoelectric materials.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
