Ultrafast collisional ion heating by electrostatic shocks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'High-intensity lasers can be used to generate shockwaves, which have found applications in nuclear fusion, proton imaging, cancer therapies and materials science.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collisionless electrostatic shocks are one type of shockwave widely studied for applications involving ion acceleration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show a novel mechanism for collisionless electrostatic shocks to heat small amounts of solid density matter to temperatures of keV in tens of femtoseconds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unusually, electrons play no direct role in the heating and it is the ions that determine the heating rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ions are heated due to an interplay between the electric field of the shock, the local density increase during the passage of the shock and collisions between different species of ion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In simulations, these factors combine to produce rapid, localized heating of the lighter ion species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the heated volume is modest, this would be one of the fastest heating mechanisms discovered if demonstrated in the laboratory.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'High-intensity ( greater than 1018 W cm2), high-contrast (109) short-pulse ( less_than 100 fs) lasers have allowed for the creation and manipulation of close to solid density plasma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because they allow for direct lasertarget interaction before hydrodynamic expansion can create a lower density pre-plasma, which absorbs much of the laser pulse1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these interactions, ions are usually only indirectly heated by the laser via electrons; typically, ions gain thermal energy only through electronion thermal equilibration or electronion instabilities3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are several mechanisms for the deposition of laser energy into ions such as indirect heating by electrons, ion trapping in the downstream region of shocks or through the acceleration of bunches of 109 ions to MeV energies for a broad range of applications including nuclear fusion, proton radiography and hadron therapy4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dissipation of laser energy through the intermediary of collisionless electrostatic shocks (CESs)18,19,20 are one such class of deposition mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ionion collision dynamics are often assumed to be unimportant in these cases, which typically involve near-critical density targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the solid density targets we consider, the ionion dynamics are critical for the deposition of laser energy into ions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the following, we demonstrate an entirely unexpected effect; for CESs launched into solid density targets composed of two ion species, the dissipation mechanism of CESs can switch from acceleration of a few ions to bulk heating of the target to keV temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreoever, the heating process is extremely rapid, on time scales of femtoseconds, and is unusual because electrons play no direct part in the thermal heating of the ions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability to create small regions of very high ion energy density on time scales shorter than that of hydrodynamic expansion will be of interest in attempts to understand the processes involved in inertial confinement fusion21 and will have implications for some specialized ion acceleration schemes which involve solid density targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect is unimportant for densities much less than solid including near-critical density targets at typical wavelengths for high-intensity laser systems.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have demonstrated a new heating mechanism in which radiation pressure-driven electrostatic shocks can produce proton temperatures of the order of keV at solid densities on time scales of the order of tens of femtoseconds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heating mechanism relies on ionion collisions between different species of ion, which are not typically assumed to be important in dissipating CESs and is unusual in that ions are not heated directly by their interactions with electrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modest volume heated by this mechanism means that it may have few practical applications (unless the effect could somehow be enhanced), although it could have implications for ion acceleration schemes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conditions required for ultrafast collisional ion heating are within the capabilities of current laser facilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If this heating mechanism is demonstrated experimentally, the rate of ion heating will be, to our knowledge, the fastest achieved for a significant number ( greater than 1012) of particles.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
