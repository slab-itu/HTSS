Rapid antibiotic-resistance predictions from genome sequence data for Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has led to an urgent need for rapid detection of drug resistance in clinical samples, and improvements in global surveillance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show how de Bruijn graph representation of bacterial diversity can be used to identify species and resistance profiles of clinical isolates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We implement this method for Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a software package (Mykrobe predictor) that takes raw sequence data as input, and generates a clinician-friendly report within 3 minutes on a laptop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For S. aureus, the error rates of our method are comparable to gold-standard phenotypic methods, with sensitivity/specificity of 99.1%/99.6% across 12 antibiotics (using an independent validation set, n=470).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For M. tuberculosis, our method predicts resistance with sensitivity/specificity of 82.6%/98.5% (independent validation set, n=1,609); sensitivity is lower here, probably because of limited understanding of the underlying genetic mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We give evidence that minor alleles improve detection of extremely drug-resistant strains, and demonstrate feasibility of the use of emerging single-molecule nanopore sequencing techniques for these purposes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The marked increase in antibiotic use in health care and agriculture since the 1940s has driven a rise in frequency of drug-resistant bacterial strains, which now present a global threat to public health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinical isolates resistant to most drugs have now been seen for many species including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antimicrobial susceptibility testing is therefore now central to the treatment of serious bacterial infections diagnosed by culture, and is used to determine the protocols for first-line antibiotic use when culture is not available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At present, phenotyping tests take at least 12 days to complete for rapidly growing bacteria such as S. aureus, and can take weeks in slow-growing bacteria such as M.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  tuberculosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Microbial genome sequencing has the potential to substantially increase the speed of antibiotic resistance detection for many pathogens2 and in addition provides valuable information on relatedness that could contribute to surveillance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The key biological constraint is the extent of our understanding of the genotype-to-phenotype correspondencethat is, the genotype needs to be sufficiently predictive of resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasingly, this correspondence is high for many bacterium/drug combinations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Gordon et al.3 recently demonstrated that a curated panel of mutations and genes known to cause drug resistance in S. aureus was sufficient to predict resistance for 12 antibiotics with a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 99%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, at least for one species, a genotype-based method could deliver results with accuracy suitable for use in a clinical laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We set out to develop methods applicable to standard clinical samples, and solve the multiple computational challenges that act as barrier to routine and rapid deployment of such a system in clinical practice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These challenges include not only the need to determine species and predict resistance, but also developing a framework extensible to many species, and ensuring accessibility of the tool to a user base who may be unskilled in bioinformatics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, although clinical samples currently undergo protocols that tend to remove diversity (for example, blood culture for S. aureus and solid/liquid culture for M. tuberculosis), future developments to reduce bed-to-diagnosis time will surely involve reductions in culture time, and potentially increase the levels of diversity in the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus we set out to build a system robust to mixture, and to establish whether an appreciable proportion of phenotypic resistance was explained by low-frequency alleles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Methods using genome sequence data for species identification range from the specific4 to the sensitive5, but generally performance is measured globally in terms of detection of species presence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for clinical use we need considerable flexibility in tuning sensitivity and specificity for different species, potentially weighted to minimize clinical risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, there may be a species associated with high mortality (for example, S. aureus) that can occur in samples mixed with other species (for example, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), which are common contaminants of blood cultures, being present on the skin through which the blood was taken), and that may even share the same resistance genes and thus confound inference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Various methods have been used for genotyping resistance features: mutations and genes have been detected by whole-genome assembly3, genes by assembly and BLAST6, or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and indels by mapping7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These methods have been demonstrated to have adequate performance in some circumstances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, traditional whole-genome bacterial assembly is fundamentally based on the assumption that all data comes from a single haploid genome9, and so is ill-suited for mixed samples, and mapping to a single-reference results in error rates that depend on genetic distance of the sample from the reference10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are pre-existing tools for expert users that incorporate resistance prediction6,11,12, none of which handle the issue of contaminating related species in clinical samples, or minor cloneswe include comparative data below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we aim to move beyond proof-of-concept of how sequencing might work in the clinic, to a general framework for genotype-based antimicrobial-resistance prediction, with concrete implementations for two species where drug resistance is of global concern: S. aureus and M. tuberculosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The user should be able to obtain a report interpretable by a clinician by simple drag-and-drop of raw sequence data file.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluate extensively against clinical gold standards using current (Illumina) sequence data, including the impact of minor population detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We notice that minor alleles improve ability to distinguish multi-drug resistant (MDR) from extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that our method also works with an emerging strand-sequencing technology (Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), MinION), giving perfect concordance with phenotype after just 7â€‰h of sequencing, both for SNP-based and gene-based resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we discuss what is needed to apply our framework to other species.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Using population genome graphs for genotyping', 'We show in Fig 1a a cartoon of the genetic diversity in a bacterial species and two options for building a reference variation structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In option (i) we show the standard approach, where we select an arbitrary strain (strain 1) to be the reference genome, along with one copy of each plasmid gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work we have developed an alternate approach, shown in option (ii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We start with a curated knowledge base of resistant/susceptible alleles, and assemble a de Bruijn graph13 of them on different genetic backgrounds, along with many examples of resistance genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This forms our reference graph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 1b we show the corresponding analyses of a mixed sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The traditional approach is shown in option (i), whereby sequence reads are mapped to the reference genome and genes, requiring the mapping and inference to cope with the divergence between sample strains and the reference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach (option (ii)) directly compares the de Bruijn graph of the sample with the reference graph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This results in statistical tests for the presence of resistance alleles that are unbiased by choice of reference or assumptions of clonality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, these tests will improve as the catalogue of diversity in the species grows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach is implemented in a software application called Mykrobe predictor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Methods section for details.

used a training set (St_A1) of 495 and a validation set (St_B1) of 471 S. aureus isolates that had been sequenced and phenotyped after being collected in Oxfordshire, UK (samples and phenotyping described in Methods section, Supplementary Fig 1; accession codes and phenotyping data are given in Supplementary Data 1 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show in Fig 2b a phylogeny (construction described in Methods section) of these samples, showing that both the training set (orange tips of tree) and validation set (blue) are distributed across the entire phylogeny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also confirmed that, although enriched for the S. aureus clonal complexes seen in UK hospitals (CC22/CC30), all major clonal complexes were represented (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A subset of these samples (n=94) has been compared in a previous publication with international clinical strains (US, UK, Japan and Australia), animal-associated strains (bovine, ovine and poultry) and historic clinical strains (1943, 1952 and 1960) to show that Oxfordshire S. aureus diversity, while not exhaustive, broadly recapitulates that of the world14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'All validation samples were phenotyped using two methods: a British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) disc test15 and the Phoenix automated microbiology system (BD Biosciences, Sparks, MD, USA), except for trimethoprim, for which only disc testing was performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A consensus phenotype was defined to be either that called by disc/Phoenix where they agreed, or the result of an Etest and/or nitrocefin (for penicillin) where disc and Phoenix were discrepant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allowed us to estimate error rates for disc and Phoenix as well as for Mykrobe predictor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Considering each resistance mutation and gene in turn, our prediction algorithm first genotypes a sample into one of three categories: clonal susceptible, minor frequency-resistant allele, or major frequency-resistant allele.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It then predicts a resistant phenotype for samples containing resistant alleles of sufficiently high frequency, where sufficiently high is estimated using the training set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that for antibiotics where resistance is mediated by genes on variable copy-number plasmids (erythromycin and tetracycline) a minor population with high copy number of a resistance-carrying plasmid may sometimes be called as major resistant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After using the training data set to estimate parameters for our statistical model (see Methods section, and for results on training set, see Supplementary Table 2), we applied Mykrobe predictor to the validation set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2c,d shows in red the false-negative calls (panel c) and false-positive calls (panel d) for Mykrobe predictor and the two laboratory methods: disc and Phoenix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we consider Fig 2c first, and focus on the 7 drugs with more than 10 resistant samples, then Mykrobe predictor misses fewer resistant calls than the other individual phenotypic methods for all drugs except ciprofloxacin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ciprofloxacin had a false-negative rate of 4.6%; we were unable to determine the reason for these missed resistant predictions, although we note that disc and Phoenix had similar problems, and that this drug has at least one uncharacterized mechanism for resistance16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the three drugs (methicillin, penicillin and erythromycin) for which our study has enough resistant samples to meet US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria (false-negative rate  less_than 1.5%, upper 95% confidence interval  less_than 7.5%), Mykrobe predictor met these criteria17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data underlying this plot are presented in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results for the disc and Phoenix tests on the validation set are in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Comparison of Mykrobe predictor S. aureus resistance prediction results with consensus phenotype for validation set (St_B1).Full size table', 'The equivalent plot for false-positive calls is shown in Fig 2d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all drugs except penicillin and methicillin, all methods have low false-positive rates, below the FDA threshold of 3%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All methods had unacceptably high error rates for penicillin (11.7% for Mykrobe predictor, 15.1% for disc and 16.0% for Phoenix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is known that for penicillin, phenotyping methods may under-detect resistance18,19,20, and so the apparent high false-positive rate is likely to be artefactualthat is, under-detecting resistance by disc, Phoenix and nitrocefin might lead to an (incorrect) consensus susceptible call.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed it has been previously shown3 that for some samples with weak beta-lactamase activity (exhibited by a very slowly developing nitrocefin test), resistance was not detected by either disc or Phoenix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mykrobe predictor had an acceptable false-positive rate for methicillin of 0.0%, compared with disc (0.5%) and Phoenix (18.9%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This high false-positive rate for Phoenix was unexpected; either both disc and Etest under-detected resistance (they are both diffusion methods and might have correlated errors), or these were indeed false calls from Phoenix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For comparison with a commercial software package, we also ran SeqSphere6 on the validation set, which made predictions for six drugs where resistance was gene based.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since SeqSphere predicted all 471 samples to be resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin, we excluded these drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other results were broadly comparable to Mykrobe predictor and the phenotyping methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Figs 4 and 5 for full results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, our strong prior expectation was that there would be limited within-sample diversity, due to blood culture followed by storage processes, and removal of contaminated samples (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mykrobe predictor confirmed this expectation and made only 6 minor calls out of 11,592 (12 drugs times 966 training and validation samples).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we noted with interest that for the four samples where Mykrobe predictor made false-positive (major) resistant calls that were not made by disc or Phoenix, re-running the disc test resulted in contradictory results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two changed to resistant (ciprofloxacin and erythromycin) and two produced heteroresistant phenotypes (erythromycin, tetracycline, see Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This behaviour is consistent with a disc test presented with mixed strains or with variable plasmid loss (that would explain the three erythromycin/tetracycline results).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All four samples had low levels of chromosomal diversity (between 12 and 25 heterozygous SNPs, Methods section), ruling out contamination unless by a closely related strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Photograph of BSAC disc test showing heteroresistant phenotype.Seen on

greatest power to detect resistance genes that lie on multi-copy plasmids, with detection power reaching 94 and 100% by the time the population frequency is 2% for tetracycline and erythromycin,

large sample numbers; dotted lines extrapolate linearly from points at 1 and 2%), which causes methicillin resistance in S. aureus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the risk of detecting mecA but not detecting

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Rapid determination of antimicrobial resistance profile is of critical importance to patient care for many serious bacterial infections and has wider implications for determination of treatment protocols and national surveillance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have developed a software application, extensible to many bacterial species, called Mykrobe predictor, which can identify species, resistance profile and other genomic features such as virulence elements and phylogenetic lineage, within 3â€‰min on a standard laptop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have provided two implementations, for S. aureus and M. tuberculosis, and validated them extensively against clinical gold standards.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results for S. aureus (overall sensitivity and specificity above 99%) are comparable to or better than phenotyping methods (BSAC disc test, Phoenix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For M. tuberculosis, specificity is high (98.5%) and sensitivity of 82.6% matches the line-probe assays from which our resistance panel was constructed, but still is below that of the gold standard of DST based on solid (LÃ¶wensteinJensen) culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as new resistance-causing mutations are determined, Mykrobe predictor can be easily updated and tested, and unlike a line-probe assay or the automated Xpert-Mtb/Rif (Cepheid) assay, is unaffected by number of resistance-causing mutations in the panel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We detail in Fig 7a how the timelines for a proposed S. aureus sequencing workflow would compare with the clinical protocols implemented at Oxford University Hospitals clinical laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using an Illumina MiSeq 16.5â€‰h run, our proposed sequencing workflow would provide a full set of predictions for all drugs at 36â€‰h, ahead of Oxford University Hospital by 12â€‰h. At other institutions, one might use MALDI-TOF or alternate rapid methods to identify the species or even methicillin resistance directly on blood culture45,46 but these cannot give the full susceptibility profile (nor any information on ancestry, epidemiology or virulence).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: Timelines for sequencing-based analysis and culture-based DST.The timelines are shown for (a) S. aureus and (b) M. tuberculosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In (a) both culture-based (a,i) and sequencing-based (a,ii) options involve 12â€‰h of blood culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After this, the culture-based approach (at Oxford University Hospitals clinical laboratory) follows with a direct coagulase test (Coag.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  that provides a presumptive species identification at 4â€‰h (marked A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concurrently, blood culture is subcultured to blood agar, and MALDI-TOF confirms the species at 12â€‰h (B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A disc diffusion test for five antimicrobials (including methicillin) is performed directly from a positive blood culture providing first-line susceptibility information 1824â€‰h later (C), assuming an acceptable inoculum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, post-subculture samples are undergo extended susceptibility testing by automated broth microdilution (brandname Phoenix), giving final results after another 1824â€‰h (D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the sequencing-based workflow (a,ii), the DNA extraction plus sample preparation takes 7.5â€‰h because samples are from blood culture, not colony isolates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the Illumina MiSeq v3 reagents, a 16.5â€‰h run is possible (giving paired 75â€‰bp reads, adequate for this purpose), giving full susceptibility results at the same time as direct disc tests provide results for five drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) The culture-based process (b,i; in a typical UK reference laboratory) starts with two weeks of mycobacterial growth indicator tube (MGIT) culture, followed by a species identification test (X).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the species belongs to the MTBC, then DST is run in MGIT, and at decision point Y, if the sample tests susceptible to all first-line drugs, no further testing is done.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MGIT DST is repeated for pyrazinamide if the first test revealed resistance to this drug.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If there is resistance to any other drug, then solid culture DST is performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If these tests show there is resistance to rifampicin then another round of MGIT culture followed by MGIT DST is done for second-line drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For sequencing-based approaches we show timelines for the present study (b,ii) and a potential alternative (b,iii), which would reduce time-to-results to just over 2 weeks.Full size image', 'The acceleration provided by sequencing is even greater for M. tuberculosis, where the standard process to run first-line drug tests and, if necessary, the second-line tests afterwards, takes months (Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In principle these could be run in parallel, but the cost is prohibitive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, for the sequencing workflow, most clinical isolates become MGIT positive within 2 weeks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, if sample preparation and sequencing is completed within 2 days of positivity47, one can get results in 2 weeks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a gain of somewhere between 5 and 17 weeks compared with gold-standard DST, depending on whether the sample is resistant to first-line drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have demonstrated that detection of simple minor resistant infections can be achieved in a robust and automated fashion, assuming at most two strains are present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are unaware of any other resistance prediction tool that allows this.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, Mykrobe predictor classified 3.5%/4.9% of our M. tuberculosis training/validation samples as having minor resistant populations, with median frequency of 6.8%/9.2%, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to match the results of the in vitro gold standard, we only predicted a resistant phenotype for alleles above 10% frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains an open question as to whether the lower frequency alleles have a bearing on patient outcome, despite generally failing to cause in vitro resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For TB, initial treatment is with the preferred set of four first-line drugs (rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol and pyrazinamide) until it is identified that a drug-resistant strain is present, when treatment is changed to second-line drugs, many of which are less effective, less well-tolerated and more difficult to administer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spread of MDR TB48 (resistant to rifampicin and isoniazid) and of XDR TB (MDR plus resistant to specific second-line drugs, that is, quinolones and an injectable such as capreomycin or amikacin) is a major global health concern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our validation set, which contained the bulk of our XDR samples, we found minor alleles improved power to predict resistance by 9.1/11.8/23.0% for second-line drugs capreomycin, amikacin, and ofloxacin respectively (also see Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, minor alleles (or heteroresistance) may have a significant role in distinguishing MDR from XDR TB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, since only 18%/44% of our training/validation samples were phenotyped for at least one quinolone or injectable, this finding needs replication with larger data sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recognizing that lack of bioinformatics expertise is a barrier to clinical adoption, we provide drag-and-drop Windows and Mac applications (see screenshots in Supplementary Figs 810) and a linux version that could, for example, enable a cloud service.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our demonstration that Mykrobe predictor can work on low-specification hardware, such as a mobile phone or Raspberry Pi is intended to enable future applications of resistance determination in the field, in low-resource settings with no internet access.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along these lines, the advent of portable single-molecule sequencing machines that deliver long-read information in real time will change the face of clinical microbiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability to sequence a single sample removes the need to batch samples until an Illumina MiSeq sequencing run is justified, reducing bedside-to-treatment time, and the long reads could provide vital information on mixed infection composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our N=1 test of the Oxford Nanopore MinION machine offers only proof-of-principle, but unlike one recent report49, we were able to get fully concordant results for both gene and SNP-driven resistance with only 13 Ã— coverage, without the high per-base error rate causing any false SNP calls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since Mykrobe predictor can test the de Bruijn graph and assess confidence of resistance/susceptibility approximately an order of magnitude faster than MinION reads arrive, this could be done as the reads come in from the machine, enabling a real-time decision to be made as to whether to stop sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case we could have stopped after 7â€‰h of sequencing, and throughput on this maturing platform has improved considerably since then.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In terms of the path to clinical use of Mykrobe predictor, the next steps for S. aureus and M. tuberculosis are further clinical testing, and then obtaining regulatory approval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We will be running Mykrobe predictor in parallel with the clinical workflow in hospitals in Oxford, Leeds and Brighton (UK) for 3 months starting in 2015 as part of a Health Innovation Challenge Fund project.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is relatively simple to extend Mykrobe predictor to other bacterial species by using a panel of known sites and genes, as we did in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, more generally, for a species where resistance mechanisms are poorly characterized, one would need to use a large training set with both whole-genome sequence data and phenotype information for hypothesis-free discovery of causal mutations or purely predictive markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some such studies have been done50,51, and we expect many more.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'There are two main limitations to the current implementation of Mykrobe predictor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we suspect that incorporating a more general model of mixtures, rather than simply major/minor clones, will be of value when analysing M. tuberculosis samples direct from sputum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, our sensitivity for M. tuberculosis is low (82.6% across all drugs) compared with traditional DST, and completely excludes the first-line drug pyrazinamide since known mutations are poorly predictive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This issue, shared by all molecular assays, can only be resolved by large-scale sequencing and phenotyping studies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

a
To show that our software program could deliver automated antimicrobial-resistance predictions for two bacterial species given a pre-specified genotype-to-drug-resistance mapping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The limitations of the pre-specified mapping would place an upper bound on sensitivityfor S. aureus that upper bound was above 99%, but for M. tuberculosis we followed the HAIN and AID assays, expecting sensitivity of 82%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To achieve this, we used independent training and validation sets previously obtained in other studies3,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both species, the number of samples with resistant phenotypes was limiting, and we only estimated false-negative rates where there were sufficiently many ( greater than 10) resistant samples in the validation set, reporting confidence intervals calculated using the ClopperPearson interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  b
To handle contamination and mixture issues seen in clinical samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used independent data sets for design of probes and validation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To include some realistic sampling of species, the validation set for mycobacteria included the set Myc_Retro consisting of all mycobacterial (meaning positive MGIT culture) samples sent to the laboratories at the Oxford John Radcliffe Hospital between 2 June 2013 and 29 January 2014.
