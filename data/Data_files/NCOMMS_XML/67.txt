Functional classification of memory CD8+ T cells by CX3CR1 expression  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Localization of memory CD8+ T cells to lymphoid or peripheral tissues is believed to correlate with proliferative capacity or effector function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate that the fractalkine-receptor/CX3CR1 distinguishes memory CD8+ T cells with cytotoxic effector function from those with proliferative capacity, independent of tissue-homing properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CX3CR1-based transcriptome and proteome-profiling defines a core signature of memory CD8+ T cells with effector function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find CD62LhiCX3CR1+ memory T cells that reside within lymph nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This population shows distinct migration patterns and positioning in proximity to pathogen entry sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Virus-specific CX3CR1+ memory CD8+ T cells are scarce during chronic infection in humans and mice but increase when infection is controlled spontaneously or by therapeutic intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This CX3CR1-based functional classification will help to resolve the principles of protective CD8+ T-cell memory.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Upon challenge with infectious intracellular microorganisms such as viruses and intracellular bacteria, the immune systems mounts a rapid and commensurate response characterized by an early innate inflammatory response that is followed by generation of pathogen-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such CD8+ T-cell immunity is important to eliminate or at least contain infection with intracellular pathogens1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Memory CD8+ T cells generated in response to the initial pathogen encounter survive in the absence of further antigen-specific stimulation3 but also survive during chronic infection and continuous antigen challenge4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Memory CD8+ T cells provide protection against re-infection with the same pathogen but may also contribute to long-term control of infection if the pathogen cannot be completely eliminated, such as during infection with herpes viruses or hepatitis viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially, two discrete memory CD8+ T-cell populations were characterized by their distinct tissue localization that are believed to be linked to their functionality: central memory T cells (TCM) with proliferative potential that localize to lymphoid tissues and effector memory T cells (TEM) with direct cytotoxic effector functions that reside in peripheral tissues5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, TCM were distinguished from TEM by differential expression of the lymphoid-tissue homing receptors CD62L and CCR7 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proliferation of memory T cells is required to generate sufficient numbers of effector T cells to control infection, whereas memory T cells with direct cytotoxic effector function are important to provide immediate protection in infected tissues6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'However, this strict correlation between memory CD8+ T-cell function and their localization was challenged by the finding that T cells with effector functions in the memory T-cell population directly mediate protective immunity6 and the discovery of tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) that possess effector function and have the capacity for self-renewal yet do not recirculate to lymphoid tissues7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, invasion of lymphoid tissues by bacteria and viruses indicated the necessity of T cells with effector function to be present in lymphoid tissues8, which cannot be explained by our current understanding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather than looking at bulk T-cell populations that localize to particular tissues, more sophisticated distinction via surface markers is necessary to better understand the mechanisms determining T-cell immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Attempts have been made to establish phenotypic markers that predict the functional properties of memory T cells6,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although distinct memory T-cell populations that differ in their functional, proliferative and trafficking characteristics have been recognized10,11, it has not been investigated whether functionally distinct memory T-cell populations exist among CD62L+ TCM in lymph nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report that the expression of the fractalkine receptor CX3CR1 discriminates memory CD8+ T cells with cytotoxic effector function from those with proliferative potential both in humans and mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using CX3CR1 together with CD62L as markers, we determine a core gene and protein signature of memory CD8+ T cells with cytotoxic effector functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allowed us to identify a CX3CR1+CD62Lhi memory T-cell population with direct effector function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This population is stationary in the lymph node and locates to the subcapsular area where pathogens enter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find low numbers of CX3CR1+ memory CD8+ T cells with effector function in patients suffering from chronic viral infection and high numbers in patients who recovered from viral infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also in preclinical models of chronic viral infection, that is, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) clone 13 infection, numbers of CX3CR1+ memory CD8+ T cells correlate with control of infection and response to immune therapy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'CX3CR1 expression on memory CD8+ T cells', 'We have previously reported a unique murine memory CD8+ T-cell population with proliferative potential that is distinct from TCM and is induced by non-professional antigen-presenting cells in the liver but not lymphoid tissues12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reassessed our previously published set of whole-genome transcriptome data utilizing an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model to detect differentially expressed genes as well as self-organizing-map analysis of gene expression profiles to identify genes specific for memory T cells12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found the fractalkine receptor CX3CR1 among genes coding for cell surface receptors that were most upregulated within a memory-specific cluster of genes (Fig 1a and Supplementary Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CX3CR1 has been reported to define subsets of myeloid cells, including monocytes and dendritic cells, in the blood and different tissues, such as the gut and lymph nodes13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far, CX3CR1 expression on a protein level was detected on CD4+ T cells residing in the lung or skin16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to date, this was not analysed in detail for memory CD8+ T cells, although published transcriptome analysis in memory CD8+ T cells indicated the expression of the Cx3cr1 gene18,19 and CX3CR1 was detected on terminally differentiated cytotoxic effector T cells20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To analyse the expression pattern of CX3CR1 in CD8+ T cells during the course of infection and memory formation, we used CX3CR1+/GFP reporter mice13, in which GFP expression correlated with CX3CR1 protein expression (Supplementary Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: CX3CR1 expression on antigen-experienced memory T cells in mice and man.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a)

CX3CR1-expressing T cells among total CD8+ T cells increased after adenoviral infection (d60) (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among CD44+ T cells, CX3CR1 expression was most prominent in CD8+ T cells (Fig 1d), prompting us to study CX3CR1 expression on antigen-specific memory CD8+ T cells in response to infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After infection with a recombinant adenovirus coding for luciferase and ovalbumin (OVA), which results in hepatocyte infection that can be monitored by in vivo bioluminescence measurement21, in vivo activation of ovalbumin-specific OT-ICX3CR1-GFP T cells was observed at 2 days post infection (d.p.i.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  as demonstrated by increased CD44 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GFP (CX3CR1) expression, however, was not detected before 5 d.p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  when control over viral infection had been achieved (Fig 1e), as determined by reduction of in vivo bioluminescence (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total numbers of GFP+ (CX3CR1+) T cells were highest at 5 d.p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and then gradually decreased parallel to the total numbers of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Fig 1C) consistent with contraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antigen-specific GFP+ (CX3CR1+) and GFPneg (CX3CR1neg) CD8+ T cells were found in the lymphoid tissue like in the spleen but also in the blood and liver after viral infection (Supplementary Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GFP (CX3CR1) expression level per CD8+ T cell increased during this time by one log (Fig 1e and Supplementary Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings were corroborated studying CX3CR1 expression on antigen-specific CD8+ T cells generated from the endogenous T-cell repertoire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CX3CR1+ expression was observed after infection with adenovirus (AdOVA) or Listeria monocytogenes (L.m.-OVA) on OVA-specific memory CD8+ T cells and after LCMV infection on LCMV-gp33-specific memory CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 60 d.p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of CX3CR1+/GFP reporter mice, the majority of CD8+ T cells in the blood and spleen, which were specific for OVA (after AdOVA or L.m.-OVA infection) or LCMV-gp33, showed GFP (CX3CR1) expression (Fig 1g and Supplementary Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar separation in CX3CR1+ and CX3CR1neg populations was observed in memory CD8+ T cells generated from 500 adoptively transferred naive OT-ICX3CR1-GFP CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Fig 1H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even  greater than 200 days after AdOVA infection, antigen-specific GFP+ (CX3CR1+) and GFPneg (CX3CR1neg) memory CD8+ T cells were found (Fig 1h) arguing that both memory T-cell populations are long lived.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we confirmed CX3CR1 expression on T cells in healthy human volunteers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, CX3CR1 expression was also most prominent on antigen-experienced CD45RO+CD8+ T cells with numbers varying among healthy individuals (Fig 1i,j and Supplementary Fig 1I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data indicated that CX3CR1 is expressed in a population of murine and human memory CD8+ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'CX3CR1 expression identifies cytotoxic memory CD8+ T cells', 'As GFP (CX3CR1) expression separates memory CD8+ T cells into two populations (Fig 1), we addressed the question whether antigen-specific GFP+ (CX3CR1+) and GFPneg (CX3CR1neg) memory CD8+ T cells generated after viral or bacterial infections in CX3CR1+/GFP reporter mice had distinct functional properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability to produce the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) is considered a hallmark of those memory T cells that have the potential to proliferate and generate T-cell progeny22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that GFPneg (CX3CR1neg) memory CD8+ T cells were the main producers of IL-2 upon re-stimulation, whereas GFP+ (CX3CR1+) memory CD8+ T cells failed to produce significant amounts of this cytokine (Fig 2a and Supplementary Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To directly test the proliferative capacity of GFP+ (CX3CR1+) versus GFPneg (CX3CR1neg) memory CD8+ T cells in vivo, we adoptively transferred both populations and analysed their numbers after viral or bacterial infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transferred GFPneg (CX3CR1neg) memory CD8+ T cells showed vigorous and antigen-specific proliferation upon pathogen challenge, whereas GFP+ (CX3CR1+) memory CD8+ T cells showed much less proliferative capacity (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained using transgenic OT-ICX3CR1-GFP-derived memory CD8+ T cells after re-challenge with AdOVA infection (Supplementary Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

expression, only GFP+ (CX3CR1+) memory CD8+ T cells at 60 d.p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (L.m.-OVA) constitutively expressed GzmB (Fig 2c and Supplementary Fig 2C), which is a hallmark of T cells with cytotoxic effector function23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, only GFP+ (CX3CR1+) OT-ICX3CR1-GFP memory T cells showed potent cytotoxic effector function directly ex vivo (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After adoptive transfer, GFP+ (CX3CR1+) OT-ICX3CR1-GFP memory T cells but not GFPneg (CX3CR1neg) T cells conferred immediate in vivo protection by rapid control of hepatocyte infection with AdOVALUC (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, GFPneg (CX3CR1neg) T cells did not control infection (Fig 2e), which is consistent with their lack of cytotoxic functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon pathogen re-challenge, GFP+ (CX3CR1+) OT-ICX3CR1-GFP memory T cells showed further rapid (6 h) increase of GzmB expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, GzmB expression was also triggered by AdGFP infection lacking the cognate antigen but was more pronounced upon AdOVA infection (Fig 2f), indicating that antigen-specific restimulation was superior to virus-induced inflammation in augmenting GzmB expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, GFPneg T cells remained GzmB negative under such conditions (Fig 2f), providing a rationale for the failure of this population to confer protective immunity upon transfer (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, no difference in expression of interferon (IFN)- was observed between GFPneg and GFP+ T cells (Supplementary Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Having established the functional segregation of memory CD8+ T cells based on CX3CR1 expression, we next reconciled our data with previous work that employed the homing-related molecules CD62L and CCR7 to separate memory CD8+ T cells into functionally distinct populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'CX3CR1 and CD62L identify four memory CD8+ T-cell populations', 'Memory T cells have been divided into two populations based on the expression of CD62L and CCR7 that allows CD62LhiCCR7+ TCM to localize to lymphoid tissues, whereas CD62LlowCCR7neg TEM remain in the blood and peripheral tissues5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although tissue localization correlates with expression of these markers, the separation of functional properties between TCM to generate T-cell progeny and TEM to show cytotoxic effector functions is less stringent6,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This led us to analyse GFP (CX3CR1) expression in CD62LhiCD127+KLRG1neg TCM, CD62LlowCD127+KLRG1neg TEM and KLRG1+CD8+ T cells derived from naïve OT-ICX3CR1-GFP T cells at 60 days after AdOVA infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this time point, all KLRG1+ effector-like CD8+ T cells showed high GFP (CX3CR1) expression (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, 25% of TEM did not show GFP (CX3CR1) expression (Fig 3a) and 30% of TCM showed GFP (CX3CR1) expression (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on this data we reasoned that CX3CR1 in combination with

arise from GFPneg (CX3CR1neg) memory CD8+ T cells during recall responses after viral infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Also in the polyclonal repertoire of human CD45RO+CD8+ T cells, staining for CD62L and CX3CR1 identified four cell populations (Fig 3g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CCR7 expression was observed in all CD62Lhi memory T cells and thus did not discriminate CX3CR1+ from CX3CR1neg memory CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative frequencies of these four populations varied between the 18 healthy individuals studied (Supplementary Fig 3B,C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only CX3CR1+CD62Llow and CX3CR1+CD62Lhi human memory CD8+ T cells expressed GzmB (Fig 3h,i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, CD62L expression levels did not identify GzmB-positive cells among CD45RO+ or CD45RA+ CD8+ T cells, whereas all GzmB-positive CD8+ T cells stained positive for CX3CR1 (Supplementary Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, IL-2 production following restimulation was only observed in CX3CR1neg memory CD8+ T cells, although we observed more prominent IL-2 production in CX3CR1negCD62Lhi compared with CX3CR1negCD62Llow CD8+ T cells (Fig 3i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mice, several markers, such as CD27, CD28, CD127, and the activation-associated isoform of CD43 (1B11) have been reported to correlate with CD8+ T-cell functionality6,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the expression of these markers has not been investigated within CD62L+ TCM, especially not in humans, we evaluated their expression in comparison with our CX3CR1-based separation on human memory T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In human memory T cells, CD43 expression was rather high in CX3CR1+ CD8+ T cells, whereas CD27 showed higher expression on CX3CR1neg CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Fig 3E,F) indicating that the co-regulation of CD43 and CD27 on human memory CD8+ T cells9,26 does not allow for clear cut separation with regard to functionality as CX3CR1-based separation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD127 expression levels were slightly higher in CX3CR1neg T cells independent of CD62L expression levels (Supplementary Fig 3E,F) consistent with previous reports on CD127 expression on long-lived central memory T cells27,28,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, CD28 expression was slightly increased on CX3CR1neg T cells (Supplementary Fig 3E,F) confirming the increased expression found previously on TCM5,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, beyond the resolution achieved by CD62L or other T-cell surface markers, CX3CR1 expression precisely classifies memory CD8+ T cells into two distinct populations in mice and humans independent of their tissue-homing properties, one with cytotoxic effector function but little proliferative capacity, the other with proliferative capacity but no cytotoxic function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this notion in an unbiased manner, we decided to apply transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of human memory CD8+ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Core signature of human CX3CR1+

4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only in the CX3CR1negCD45RO+CD8+ T cell populations, CD62L discriminated two separate populations, albeit they were more closely related to each other than to naïve CD62Lhi CD45RA+CD8+ T cells and the CX3CR1+CD45RO+CD8+ T-cell populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hierarchical clustering of variable genes shown as a heat map (Fig 4c) confirmed these findings as naïve CD45RA+CD8+ T cells showed the most significant difference to the other four CD45RO+ T-cell populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CX3CR1negCD62LhiCD8+ T cells and CX3CR1negCD62LlowCD8+ T cells had distinct gene expression patterns, whereas gene expression patterns of CX3CR1+CD62LhiCD8+ T cells and CX3CR1+CD62LlowCD8+ T cells were almost identical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these results and with the usefulness of CX3CR1 as marker for functionally distinct T-cell populations, we found that CX3CR1 expression was similar to CD43 expression, whereas other markers for memory T cells, such as CD27, CD28 or CD127, were downregulated in CX3CR1+ CD8+ T cells independent of their CD62L expression (Supplementary Fig 3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Focusing on differentially expressed genes as determined by the ANOVA model on present genes directly comparing CD62L+ CX3CR1+ CD8+ T cells or CD62L CX3CR1+ CD8+ T cells to naïve T cells and visualizing the results by ratio/ratio plots, further confirmed that CX3CR1+CD8+ T cells had almost identical expression patterns irrespective of CD62L expression levels (Fig 4d and Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, CD62Lhi and CD62Llow CD8+ T cells lacking CX3CR1 showed differential expression of a subset of genes (Fig 4e and Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine a core signature for the CX3CR1+CD45RO+CD8+ T cells, we performed an analytical approach combining the results of the ANOVA model with either co-regulation analysis or weighted network analysis and subtracted genes also enriched in CX3CR1 T cells to identify differentially expressed genes (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach revealed a set of 363 signature genes (Supplementary Data 2) with high expression in CX3CR1+ memory T cells, intermediate to low expression in CX3CR1 memory T cells and low to absent expression in naïve CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We visualized genes of this CX3CR1-associated core signature belonging to functional categories including T-cell cytotoxicity markers, NK-cell markers, T-cell activation-associated molecules, adhesion molecules and transcription factors as heat maps of z-transformed expression values (Fig 4g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This signature included known cytotoxic effector molecules such as FAS-L, perforin and GzmA/B/H, or transcription factors associated with effector function, such as TBX21, BATF, RUNX3 and EOMES, but also other molecules whose relation to CD8+ T-cell effector has not been studied yet (Fig 4g and Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, to better understand which biological processes might be linked to the core signature of CX3CR1+ CD45RO+CD8+ T cells, we performed Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis (GOEA) followed by network visualization (Fig 4h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The major clusters of biological processes we obtained are compatible with an activated immune cell including Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with immune cell activation, immune response, defense response, cytolysis, adhesion, response to stress, but also regulation of cell death and cell death/apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, the genome-wide analysis of gene expression defined a

principal component analysis, with CX3CR1neg CD62Llow T cells being most closely related, whereas CX3CR1negCD62Lhi and naïve CD8+ T-cell populations were more distinct (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was reflected by hierarchical clustering of variable proteins as both CX3CR1+CD8+ T-cell populations showed close similarities, whereas CX3CR1neg CD62Lhi and naïve CD8+ T cells had clearly different

expression, we investigated whether CX3CR1+CD8+ memory T cells were present in lymph nodes of CX3CR1+/GFP reporter mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sixty days after viral or bacterial infection, GFP+ (CX3CR1+) CD62LhiCD8+ T cells constituted about 2040% of antigen-specific memory CD8+ T cells in lymph nodes (Fig 6a,b and Supplementary Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, we detected GFP+ (CX3CR1+) memory CD8+ T cells in the white pulp of the spleen (Supplementary Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although little is known about the heterogeneity of memory T cells present within lymph nodes, two distinct positioning and migration patterns have been described8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we investigated whether CX3CR1+ and CX3CR1neg CD8+ memory T cells differed in their positioning within the lymph node.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confirming our previous results8, we found that CD8+ memory T cells were not located in the deep paracortex as naïve T cells, but instead were found at the peripheral paracortex and the subcapsular sinus area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This differential positioning of memory versus naïve CD8+ T cells was even further pronounced for CX3CR1+ memory CD8+ T cells (Fig 6c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CX3CR1+CD8+ memory T cells had a lower velocity and scanned their environment more slowly than CX3CR1neg CD8+ memory T cells, as analysed by intravital two-photon microscopy (Fig 6e and Supplementary

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Discrete memory T-cell populations with complementary functions, executed in distinct anatomic locations, cooperate to mediate immune protection from repeated infection with intracellular pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lymphoid tissue homing receptors such as CD62L and CCR7 have been employed to distinguish between CD62LhiCCR7+ TCM that home to lymphoid tissues where they proliferate upon re-challenge and CD62LlowCCR7neg TEM that remain in the circulation and peripheral tissues where they mount immediate cytotoxic effector function5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify CX3CR1 as the marker that differentiates memory CD8+ T cells with direct cytotoxic effector function generated in response to viral or bacterial infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CX3CR1 expression allows their discrimination from memory T cells with proliferative potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using CX3CR1 together with CD62L as markers, it is possible to stratify memory CD8+ T cells in man and mouse into four populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome-wide transcriptome and in-depth proteome analyses provided independent evidence that CX3CR1 separates functionally distinct memory CD8+ T-cell populations and allowed us to establish for the first time a core gene and protein signature of memory CD8+ T cells with cytotoxic effector function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these results, we identify a so far unrecognized memory CX3CR1+CD62Lhi CD8+ T-cell population with cytotoxic effector function that localizes to the subcapsular sinus of lymph nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Human and mouse CX3CR1+ CD8+ T cells co-expressed cytotoxic effector molecules (GzmB and perforin) and showed potent cytotoxicity but had no proliferative capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of CX3CR1 on virus-specific CD8+ T cells appeared shortly after clearance of experimental infection, then steadily increased to reach a plateau 2 weeks and was still found up to 200 days after infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that early effector T cells, which are generated during the initial phases of the pathogen-specific immune response35, do not express CX3CR1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, CX3CR1 is expressed shortly thereafter, presumably on both effector T cells and early memory T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'After clearance of infection, only long-lived memory CD8+ T cells with immediate cytotoxic effector function expressed CX3CR1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some but not all CX3CR1+ memory T cells also showed expression of KLRG1, consistent with the reported expression of KRLG1 on some memory T cells6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CX3CR1+CD8+ T cells found 60 days after infection showed a heterogeneous expression pattern of CD127, indicating that these cells may not exclusively depend on homeostatic survival signals delivered through the IL-7 receptor27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead CX3CR1 itself may promote survival of memory CD8+ T cells, similar to the dependence of survival myeloid cells on CX3CR1 expression36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of CX3CR1 has been reported previously for myeloid cells, such as monocytes, macrophages and microglia37,38, but also for CD4+ helper T cells that cause persistent airway inflammation17 and for terminally differentiated effector CD8+ T cells20,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, CX3CR1 is important for leukocyte migration and adhesion40 and recruitment of cytotoxic T cells to sites of inflammation is achieved through CX3CL1-expressing cells20,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not find evidence for changes in the functional phenotype of CX3CR1-deficient memory CD8+ T cells, indicating that CX3CR1-mediated signals are not the cause of direct cytotoxic effector functions in memory T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Notwithstanding, CX3CR1 expression accurately distinguished human and mouse memory T cells with direct cytotoxic effector functions from those with proliferative potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with CD62L expression levels, four CD45RO+ CD8+ T-cell populations can be separated: CX3CR1neg CD62LhiCD8+, CX3CR1negCD62Llow, CX3CR1+CD62Lhi and CX3CR1+CD62Llow CD8+ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcriptome and proteome analysis of these cell populations revealed that CX3CR1 was superior to CD62L to classify distinct memory CD8+ T-cell populations based on functional properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allowed us to establish a core signature shared by memory CD8+ T cells with cytotoxic function independent of their tissue localization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This core signature consists of 363 genes and contains granzymes, perforin, FASL and IFN-.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The list further entails genes coding for transcription factors associated with effector function such as Tbx21, Batf, Nfat, Runx3 (refs 41, 42, 43) and surface molecules found on NK cells such as CD57 (B3GAT1), CD160, killer cell lectin receptors and NKG7 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  44) or signalling molecules such as SLAM genes that participate in NK cell function and T -ell differentiation45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of the core signature genes are also present in the proteome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some proteins in the core signature, however, are not found in the gene signature such as s100 proteins, which exert alarm functions upon further oxidative modifications46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although expression of these molecules known to be related to cytotoxic effector functions confirms the CX3CR1-based core signature, this list will help to refine human immune monitoring to guide immune therapies and initiate research into molecular pathways not yet associated with cytotoxic memory T-cell function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'CX3CR1 expression was found on CD62Llow as well as CD62Lhi memory CD8+ T cells and transcriptome and proteome profiles of these two cell populations were almost identical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these analyses both CX3CR1+CD62low T cells and CX3CR1+CD62hi memory T cells are best described as memory T cells with effector function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High CD62L expression suggested that some CX3CR1+memory T cells with effector function could localize to lymph nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, CX3CR1+ memory CD8+ T cells were found in lymph nodes more than 60 days after viral and bacterial infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These CX3CR1+CD8+ T cells localized to the subcapsular sinus and showed prolonged and continuous interactions with CD169+ macrophages, thus taking a strategic position where pathogens entering lymphoid tissues via afferent lymphatics are in first contact with immune cells8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that CX3CR1+ CD8+ T cells in the lymph node may contribute to pathogen-specific immunity through immediate production of IFN-, that is required for rapid initiation of immune responses8,47, after recognizing subcapsular macrophages (cross)presenting microbial antigens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such rapid induction of IFN- may initiate CXCL9-mediated recruitment of CXCR3-expressing memory T cells with proliferative potential48 thereby

by performing GOEA using the Cytoscape65 plug-in BiNGO (v2.44) with an FDR threshold of 0.05 to include only significant results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Cytoscape plugins Enrichment Map (v1.1) with a Jaccard coefficient of 0.25 and an FDR Q-value cutoff of 0.025 as well as Word Cloud were used to visualize the GO network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Bioinformatics of proteome data', 'Proteins being variable (P less_than 0.05) across the data set were visualized via principal component analysis and via a heat map based on z-transformed data using PGS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To link the RNA-seq expression data to the protein data, the data sets were matched by using the UniProt database.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of normalized RNA-seq expression values of present genes was visualized in the form of a histogram splitted into different protein expression classes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain a core signature for CX3CR1+ CD8+ T cells based on protein data, the same approach as used for the RNA-seq data was applied, harbouring only a few changes in terms of the used parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MCL algorithm in BioLayout Express3D was applied on proteins showing a Pearson correlation of at least 0.8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For weighted correlation network analysis, a power of 18 and a MEDissThres of 0.5 were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collating the intersections of each CX3CR1+ cell representing cluster with the significantly and commonly upregulated proteins resulted in a pre-signature of 192 proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After excluding proteins encoded by known polymorph MHCII genes as wells as those proteins having an absolute expression difference of  less_than 1e+06 between CX3CR1+ and CX3CR1 cells, a refined signature of 165 proteins remained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fold change rank plots were used to map their change of expression to their corresponding change in the RNA-seq data set, as well as the same vice versa for the defined RNA-seq signature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overlapping the transcriptome and proteome signatures resulted in 65 CX3CR1+-associated proteins, which generated a clearly refined GO network based on the same enrichment parameters as used for the transcriptome-based signature network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Statistical analysis', 'The two-tailed Students t-test was used for the statistical analysis of differences between two groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of multiple groups was done using two-way ANOVA.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
