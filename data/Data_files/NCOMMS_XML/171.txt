BPTF is required for c-MYC transcriptional activity and in vivo tumorigenesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'c-MYC oncogene is deregulated in most human tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histone marks associated with transcriptionally active genes define high-affinity c-MYC targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanisms involved in their recognition by c-MYC are unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that c-MYC interacts with BPTF, a core subunit of the NURF chromatin-remodelling complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BPTF is required for the activation of the full c-MYC transcriptional programme in fibroblasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BPTF knockdown leads to decreased c-MYC recruitment to DNA and changes in chromatin accessibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Bptf-null MEFs, BPTF is necessary for c-MYC-driven proliferation, G1S progression and replication stress, but not for c-MYC-driven apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bioinformatics analyses unveil that BPTF levels correlate positively with c-MYC-driven transcriptional signatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo, Bptf inactivation in pre-neoplastic pancreatic acinar cells significantly delays tumour development and extends survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings uncover BPTF as a crucial c-MYC co-factor required for its biological activity and suggest that the BPTF-c-MYC axis is a potential therapeutic target in cancer.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The MYC oncogenes encode a family of related sequence-specific bHLHZip transcription factors (c-, L- and N-MYC) that control a plethora of cellular functions including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  c-MYC is deregulated in more than half of human cancers1, often in association with aggressive, poorly differentiated tumours2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The oncogenic potential of c-MYC stems from its function as a transcriptional regulator that binds DNA on heterodimerization with MAX3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MYC-MAX heterodimers show a predilection for the palindromic E-box motif (CACGTG) found in regulatory elements of genes controlled by this complex4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, mounting evidence indicates that the genomic distribution of c-MYC-MAX complexes is influenced by factors other than sequence specificity, most notably the chromatin context5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-affinity sites are bound by c-MYC in a wide variety of cell types and are typically enriched in CpG islands together with high levels of activating histone marks (H3K4me3, H3K79me, H3ac and H2A.Z).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low-affinity sites vary among cell types and are only engaged when c-MYC is expressed at high levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with high-affinity targets, they show a selective enrichment for macroH2A, H3K27me3 and H4K16ac5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon binding to its target promoters, c-MYC recruits multiple cofactors that affect the state of chromatin and the activity of RNA polymerases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among them are chromatin-remodelling complexes (for example, SWI/SNF), acetyltransferases and methyltransferases that modify core histones (for example, P300/CBP-Associated Factor (PCAF)) and proteins associated with the basal transcriptional machinery (for example, P-TEFb)8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The mechanisms involved in the recognition of the active chromatin configuration by c-MYC are poorly understood but likely involve the combined action of epigenetic readers and chromatin remodellers that modulate the accessibility of DNA in modified nucleosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A plausible candidate to act as a c-MYC tethering factor is NURF (ATP-dependent nucleosome-remodelling factor), an ISWI complex that uses ATP hydrolysis to catalyse nucleosome sliding11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mammalian NURF consists of three subunits: BPTF, SNF2L and pRBAP46/48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BPTF (bromodomain PHD transcription factor) provides sequence specificity to NURF through interactions with transcription factors, histone variants and histone modifications of transcriptionally active genes (H3K4me3, H4K16Ac and H2A.Z)12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that BPTF is mutated in bladder tumours and its knockdown in cultured bladder cancer cells results in reduced proliferation15 and hypothesized that these effects might be mediated, in part, by c-MYC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we show that BPTF and c-MYC are present in a protein complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interaction is critical for c-MYC function, since BPTF knockdown leads to a decrease in c-MYC binding to DNA, changes in chromatin accessibility and impaired activation of the c-MYC transcriptional programme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, BPTF expression in human tumours positively correlates with activation of c-MYC gene signatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, BPTF is necessary for the survival of c-MYC-overexpressing cells and for c-MYC-driven tumorigenesis in the mouse pancreas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results highlight the potential of exploiting the BPTF-MYC axis in cancer therapy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'BPTF depletion impairs c-MYC transcriptional activity', 'To assess whether BPTF is required for the transcriptional activity of c-MYC, human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) were stably transduced with the chimeric MYC-ER complementary DNA (cDNA; hereafter HFF MYC-ER) and infected with lentiviruses coding for either control (shNt) or BPTF-targeting short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs; sh#1 and sh#2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To rule out proliferation-associated effects, and to avoid the interference of endogenous c-MYC, cells were driven to quiescence by serum starvation before treatment with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses confirmed that the lentiviral shRNAs inhibited the expression of BPTF and did not interfere with either MYC-ER expression or nuclear translocation (Fig 1a; Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined the expression of a set of well-established c-MYC targets in control and BPTF-silenced HFF MYC-ER cells by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RTqPCR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BPTF knockdown resulted in a significant impairment of the induction of 6/7 c-MYC messenger RNA (mRNA) targets with at least one of the two shRNAs (Fig 1b;

therefore, we focused on its best-established role as a transcriptional activator18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found an impaired activation of five independent c-MYC signatures in BPTF-silenced cells (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results were validated by RTqPCR for an additional 20 genes, 19 of which are c-MYC chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) targets in at least one cell line profiled by ENCODE (Supplementary Data 1 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extent of induction of these genes was significantly reduced in HFF MYC-ER cells transduced with both BPTF-targeting shRNA lentiviruses (average fold change (4-OHT versus vehicle) for shNt, 2.44;

Supplementary Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data suggest that BPTF interacts with c-MYC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'BPTF regulates c-MYC binding to DNA', 'The E-box motif recognized by c-MYC is very widely represented at the genome-wide level and the findings described above suggested that BPTF serves to recruit c-MYC to its target promoters through its ability to recognize specific histone marks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we conducted ChIP with anti-c-MYC antibodies followed by massive parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq) in HFF MYC-ER cells (Supplementary Data 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 1,397 peaks were identified in 4-OHT-treated control cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with previous reports, the analysis of the density profiles of the distance between the summit of peaks and transcription start sites (TSSs) showed that c-MYC-binding sites concentrate around the TSS (Supplementary Fig 3a)5,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ChIP peaks occurred within promoter regions (TSS±3 kb; 35.6%), gene bodies (intragenic; 25%) and further upstream or downstream (intergenic; 39.4%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence analysis of c-MYC-bound regions with MEME27 unveiled a significant over-representation of the MYC-MAX-binding motif (P=2.8 × 1069; Supplementary Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, GSEA analysis of c-MYC-bound promoters showed highly statistically significant overlap with three transcriptional signatures of c-MYC-dependent genes and with biological modules associated with c-MYC function (for example, cell proliferation; Supplementary Fig 3c; Supplementary Data 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, genes directly bound by c-MYC showed a significantly higher mRNA induction than those lacking a ChIP-Seq peak (Supplementary Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To determine whether BPTF silencing interfered with c-MYC recruitment to chromatin, we analysed the magnitude and distribution of c-MYC ChIP-Seq peaks upon BPTF knockdown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Globally, c-MYC-binding intensity was significantly lower in shBPTF-expressing cells (P less_than 2.2 × 1016, Wilcoxon test) (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reduction was not uniformly distributed at the genome-wide level: only 50.2% of the peaks showed a read number fold change 2 and this was unrelated to peak intensity, suggesting that the differences did not result from an inefficient ChIP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that BPTF silencing selectively affects a subset of c-MYC ChIP-Seq peaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We validated these observations by ChIPqPCR on gene promoters for which a peak was identified in the ChIP-Seq experiment (target), as well as on non-target control genomic regions (Supplementary Data 3 and 6), in at least three independent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By this approach, c-MYC recruitment to target genes was significantly reduced in cells infected with the BPTF-targeting shRNAs (Fig 2c,d;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The broad range of biological activities of c-MYC, its involvement in a wide variety of human tumours, and its unique ability to regulate a large fraction of the genome have spurred a great interest in the study of the molecular mechanisms involved in the c-MYC-mediated control of gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A prominent feature of c-MYC is that sequence-specific DNA binding is only one of the requirements for its regulatory activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its genomic distribution is influenced by the epigenetic context, which is determined by histone modifications, histone variants and CpG island distribution5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, how these features relate to c-MYC engagement to promoters is not known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we provide evidence that BPTF interacts with c-MYC and is a key determinant of its genomic distribution and biological activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'c-MYC target promoters can be classified according to their binding affinity and histone marks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-affinity sites display high levels of H3K4me3, H2A.Z and unmethylated CpGs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low-affinity sites are enriched in repressive histone marks (for example, H3K9me) together with H4K16Ac and are only occupied when c-MYC levels are high5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BPTF can recognize histone marks in both types of promoters; however, low-affinity promoters are more sensitive to BPTF levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results support the hypothesis that proteinprotein interactions between c-MYC and other chromatin-bound complexes are critical to target recognition by c-MYC44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BPTF binds H3K4me3 through its PHD domains45 and its knockdown does not affect the levels of this histone mark at c-MYC target promoters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, BPTF silencing reduces the hyperacetylation of H3, commonly associated to c-MYC activation46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that BPTF, either on its own or through its association with c-MYC, is required to recruit and/or modulate the activity of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) or histone deacetylases at promoters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Precedents for this kind of regulation are found in Drosophila melanogaster, where Nurf301 is needed for the histone acetyl-transferase ATAC to access chromatin and maintain the decondensed architecture of the male X chromosome47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More work is required to determine how BPTF regulates the recruitment of HATs/histone deacetylases by c-MYC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'BPTF silencing not only affected the transcriptional response of promoters where c-MYC binding was reduced but also of those where recruitment was unaffected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that this results from defective chromatin remodelling, as suggested by the fact that BPTF silencing blocks the increase in DNA accessibility at c-MYC promoters typically linked to c-MYC activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  c-MYC recruits the chromatin remodeller SWI/SNF8, whose activity is partially inhibited by the linker histone H1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NURF is necessary for H1 displacement at the promoters of progesterone receptor target genes13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we hypothesize that NURF-mediated eviction of H1 is a pre-requisite for subsequent remodelling and nucleosome eviction by SWI/SNF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, BPTF may either prevent or enhance the binding of transcription factors to DNA sequences adjacent to CCCTC-Binding Factor (CCTC)-binding sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the binding of KLF4 in the vicinity of CTCF sites is prevented by BPTF due to its nucleosome-remodelling activity49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The recognition of active histone marks in regions of open chromatin by BPTF may facilitate and stabilize c-MYC binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, alternative scenarios are possible and the mechanisms through which c-MYC co-factors operate may differ at high- and low-affinity promoters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our studies do not allow us to conclude on the sequence of recruitment of BPTF and c-MYC to target promoters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is, in part, due to the fact that the use of RNA interference leads only to a partial reduction of BPTF levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is possible thatwhen present at low levelsBPTF could differentially bind to histone marks and thereby affect gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recently, WDR5 and c-MYC have been shown to interact directly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A c-MYC-WBM mutant unable to bind WDR5 showed reduced chromatin recruitment capacity, suggesting that WDR5 is important for c-MYC binding to chromatin10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A direct comparison of BPTF and WDR5 is required to determine the specific role of each of these proteins in the regulation of c-MYC activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The impact of BPTF silencing on c-MYC recruitment to distal enhancer elements remains to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Active enhancers are characterized by high H3K4me12, H3K27ac, recruitment of the HAT p300 and the presence of transcription factor-binding motifs and DNAse I hypersensitivity sites50,51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C-terminal PHD finger of BPTF binds H3K4me2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is thus possible that NURF is recruited to enhancers through H3K4me2, along with other chromatin remodellers such as CHD7 and BRG1 (refs 54, 55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, as indicated above, BPTF interacts with CTCF that can bind and regulate nucleosome distribution at enhancers49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'c-MYC has a wide range of biological activities determined, in part, by its expression levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we asked for which of them is BPTF required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In multiple cell types, we show that BPTF is essential for c-MYC-driven proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is not necessary for MYC-triggered apoptosis in MEFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Omomyc, a c-MYC mutant protein that cannot dimerize with MAX and does not bind E-boxes, also displays selective effects on c-MYC function: it interferes with proliferation but it exacerbates apoptosis triggered by high c-MYC levels56,57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The selective effect of BPTF knockdown on a subset of c-MYC functions could be related to the mechanisms of transcriptional activation of the genes involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To induce cell proliferation, c-MYC binds directly the promoter of genes participating in DNA replication and cell cycle control (that is, MCM5, MCM6 or DBF4) and enhances their transcription26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, c-MYC-driven apoptosis is mostly indirect, through pathways that do not require binding to DNA, and involves the stabilization of p19ARF and p53 or the downregulation of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 through inhibition of MIZ-1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore propose that BPTF is only required for those c-MYC functions involving direct binding to chromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'MYC oncogenes have partially overlapping biological functions but display distinct tissue-specific expression and transforming activity59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  c-MYC and N-MYC can functionally replace one another in certain contexts (for example, murine development) and share similar oncogenic potency60,61, but N-MYC is distinctly involved in the regulation of genes involved in neural development62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite that less is known on L-MYC, it appears to differ from the other family members22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our genomic analyses suggest that BPTF may differentially affect the oncogenic activity of MYC family members and BPTF levels correlate positively with a c-MYC transcriptional signature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CTCF is required for c-MYC expression63; it is possible that BPTF and CTCF interact to activate c-MYC expression through the recruitment of transcription factors to its promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More work is required to determine the relevance of the epigenetic context of, and the requirement of BPTF for, the activity of N-MYC and L-MYC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In recent years, genetic mouse models have shown that tumours become addicted to c-MYC64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In inducible c-MYC-driven models, established tumours regress upon withdrawal of ectopic c-MYC expression65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even transient inactivation of MYC is sufficient to restore checkpoint mechanisms resulting in tumour regression, remodelling of the tumour microenvironment, and shutdown of angiogenesis56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies also show that systemic c-MYC inhibition in mice causes a mild and reversible toxicity in proliferative tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of these findings, we analysed whether the in vivo oncogenic effects of c-MYC are dependent on BTPF using the Ela-Myc model of pancreatic cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KRAS is the main oncogene involved in human PDAC; however, c-MYC is amplified and overexpressed in 10% and  greater than 50% of human PDAC, respectively66.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relevance of c-MYC to pancreatic carcinogenesis has been underscored by the finding that, in mice, c-MYC is required for mutant KRas-driven development of preneoplastic pancreatic lesions and invasive tumours67.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Ela-Myc mice, dysplasia is observed at 8 weeks of age and multifocal tumours develop starting a few weeks later; acinar tumours occur early while ductal tumoursreminiscent of human PDACappear later42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this highly aggressive model, elimination of a single Bptf allele was sufficient to delay tumour initiation (that is, dysplasia) and progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, these effects did not result from an incomplete maturation of exocrine cellsas in other systemssince we did not find evidence of altered acinar differentiation in BptfP/ mice, as determined by histological analysis and digestive enzyme mRNA expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings support the notion that disruption of the BPTF-c-MYC interaction may represent a valuable strategy for the therapy of c-MYC-driven tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, it is noteworthy that incomplete inactivation of Bptf in acinar cells contributed to tumour development in a fraction of mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanisms through which Bptf inactivation suppresses MYC-driven tumour development in vivo need to be studied further.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite the in vivo genetic evidences, a therapeutic approach to target c-MYC has remained elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike other transcription factors, c-MYC lacks a ligand-binding domain, what constitutes a formidable obstacle towards direct inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, the disruption of chromatin-dependent processes that suppress c-MYC activitysuch as the inhibition of the BET bromodomain protein Brd4 by JQ1has shown promising results in experimental models of multiple myeloma, BL, acute myeloid leukaemia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and neuroblastoma68,69.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is predicted that the effects of these inhibitors would be restricted to tumours where c-MYC transcription is dependent on BRD4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have shown that BPTF is required for cell proliferation of BL, PDAC and bladder cancer cells in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The broad pattern of expression of BPTF in tissues70 and the correlation between BPTF expression and c-MYC signatures in human tumours suggest that a wide range of tumour types might be amenable to the therapeutic disruption of the c-MYC-BPTF axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore propose that small molecules capable of disrupting this interaction may represent a valuable approach to treat c-MYC-addicted tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To conclude, we have identified BPTF as an important cofactor required for the full deployment of the biological activity of c-MYC in vitro and in vivo, including its oncogenic effects.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
