Structural investigation of heteroyohimbine alkaloid synthesis reveals active site elements that control stereoselectivity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Plants produce an enormous array of biologically active metabolites, often with stereochemical variations on the same molecular scaffold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes in stereochemistry dramatically impact biological activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the stereoisomers of the heteroyohimbine alkaloids show diverse pharmacological activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reported a medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase (MDR) from Catharanthus roseus that catalyses formation of a heteroyohimbine isomer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the discovery of additional heteroyohimbine synthases (HYSs), one of which produces a mixture of diastereomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystal structures for three HYSs have been solved, providing insight into the mechanism of reactivity and stereoselectivity, with mutation of one loop transforming product specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Localization and gene silencing experiments provide a basis for understanding the function of these enzymes in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work sets the stage to explore how MDRs evolved to generate structural and biological diversity in specialized plant metabolism and opens the possibility for metabolic engineering of new compounds based on this scaffold.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Heteroyohimbines are a prevalent subclass of the monoterpene indole alkaloids (Corynanthe type skeleton), having been isolated from many plant species, primarily from the Apocynaceae and Rubiaceae families1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These alkaloids exhibit numerous biological activities: ajmalicine is an 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist2,3,4,5, and mayumbine (19-epi-ajmalicine) is a ligand for the benzodiazepine receptor (Fig 1)6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxidized beta-carboline heteroyohimbines also exhibit potent pharmacological activity: serpentine has shown topoisomerase inhibition activity7 and alstonine has been shown to interact with 5-HT2A/C receptors and shows promise as an anti-psychotic agent8,9,10,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, heteroyohimbines are biosynthetic precursors of many oxindole alkaloids, which also display a wide range of biological activities14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a total of 16 heteroyohimbine stereoisomers are possible, only 8 are reported to be found in nature, at stereocentres C3, C19, C20 (Fig 1)14,15,16,17,18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How and why the stereoselectivity is controlled in the biosynthesis of these alkaloids remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Heteroyohimbine alkaloid biosynthesis.Heteroyohimbines with 3(S) stereochemistry derive from strictosidine aglycone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three diastereomers found in Catharanthus roseus, are highlighted with red arrows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alkaloids derived from heteroyohimbines are also shown.Full size image', 'The medicinal plant Catharanthus roseus produces three of these isomers, ajmalicine (raubasine), tetrahydroalstonine and 19-epi-ajmalicine (mayumbine) (Fig 1)21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These heteroyohimbines, along with the majority of monoterpene indole alkaloids, are derived from deglycosylated strictosidine (strictosidine aglycone)22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The removal of a glucose unit from strictosidine by strictosidine glucosidase (SGD) forms a reactive dialdehyde intermediate that can rearrange to form numerous isomers23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stabilization of these isomers by enzyme-catalyzed reduction is hypothesized to be the stepping stone for the extensive chemical diversity observed in the monoterpene indole alkaloids (Fig 1)21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recently reported the first cloning of a biosynthetic gene encoding an enzyme that acts on strictosidine aglycone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This zinc-dependent medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase (MDR), named tetrahydroalstonine synthase (THAS), produces the heteroyohimbine tetrahydroalstonine (Fig 1)24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these studies demonstrated that THAS is a key enzyme in heteroyohimbine biosynthesis, the mechanism by which this enzyme controls the stereoselectivity of the reduction remained unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, it is important to note that strictosidine aglycone serves as the precursor for many alkaloid scaffolds, and therefore represents a central branch point in the monoterpene indole alkaloid biosynthetic pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we set out to identify additional heteroyohimbine synthases (HYSs) with different stereochemical product profiles that would more clearly define how structural diversity, in this case the formation of different stereoisomers, is controlled in this system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we assayed 14 MDR homologues identified from the C. roseus transcriptome25,26 that have homology to THAS (Cr_024553).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This screen revealed three additional enzymes with THAS activity (Cr_010119, Cr_021691, Cr_032583a), and, importantly, an enzyme that produced a mixture of heteroyohimbine diastereomers (Cr_032583b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystal structures of THAS (here referred to as THAS1), a second representative THAS (Cr_021691, THAS2) and the structure of the promiscuous homologue (Cr_032583b, HYS) were solved and mutants revealed key residues that control the stereochemistry of the product profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, analysis of the subcellular localization of some of these HYSs indicates an unusual nuclear localization pattern and an interaction with the previous enzyme, SGD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These discoveries provide insight into the mechanism and evolution of a crucial branch point in a specialized metabolic pathway with both pharmacological and evolutionary importance.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Discovery of HYSs', 'Guided by our initial discovery of THAS1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24) we identified candidates from the MDR protein family in the C. roseus transcriptome25,26 based on amino acid similarity to this enzyme (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of these candidates was cloned from C. roseus cDNA and expressed in Escherichia coli, with the exception of Cr_017994, which could not be expressed and was not considered further.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining candidates were assayed with the substrate strictosidine aglycone, and product formation was monitored by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these, four (Cr_010119, Cr_021691, Cr_032583a, Cr_032583b) reduced strictosidine aglycone to a product corresponding to one of the heteroyohimbines (Fig 2, Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The products of the enzymatic reactions were identified based on LC-MS data and comparison to authentic standards (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enzymes that failed to produce a heteroyohimbine product were not studied further (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three of the enzymes (Cr_021691, THAS2; Cr_010119, THAS3; Cr_032583a, THAS4) produced tetrahydroalstonine in 85% yield, with small amounts of 19-epi-ajmalicine (mayumbine) ( less_than 15%) also observed in these reactions, similar to the previously reported THAS1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, one enzyme (Cr_032583b, HYS) produced a dramatically different product profile consisting of a mixture of ajmalicine/tetrahydroalstonine/mayumbine (55:27:15, at pH 6) (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discovery of this enzyme, HYS, now provides a molecular basis to understand the generation of stereochemical diversity in this alkaloid family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure

HYSs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  THAS1 and THAS2, which produce predominantly tetrahydroalstonine, were both crystallized, since their amino acid sequence identity is relatively low (55%) and the predicted active sites have numerous differences (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HYS, which has a distinctly different product profile, was also crystallized to explore the structural basis behind this distinct stereochemical outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structures (Supplementary Table 3) were obtained for THAS1 and THAS2 with NADP+ bound (THAS1, 1.05 Å resolution (Fig 4a,b; Supplementary Figs 35); THAS2, 2.10 Å

codes 1YQX and 1YQD) and the SAD homologue cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD; PDB accession codes 2CF5 and 2CF6)27,28,29, which reduce the aldehyde moiety of lignin precursors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, pairwise superpositions of subunits from these structures gave RMSD values of  less_than 2 Å (Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biological unit is an elongated homodimer, with each subunit divided into a substrate and cofactor-binding domain; the latter also being responsible for forming the dimer interface (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall structure of THAS1, with active site, cofactor and loops highlighted, is shown in Supplementary Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The active site cavities of the HYSs are framed by helix 2, the catalytic zinc coordination sphere, and loops 1 and 2, with the NADP(H) co-substrate binding at the base of the active site (Figs 3 and 4a,b,d,, Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loop 2, which is positioned above the active site, is highly variable in length and sequence (Figs 3 and 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both THAS1 and THAS2, a network of amino acids holds NADP+ in place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most notably, Glu59 of THAS1 anchors NADP(H) through a bidentate interaction with both ribose hydroxyls, with His59 playing a comparable role in SAD, although here the interaction is with the 3 OH only (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glu59 is conserved in HYS, but an aspartate residue (THAS3 and THAS2) or a tyrosine residue (THAS4) serves this role in other homologues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MDRs usually contain two zinc ions30, a distal structural zinc ion, which in this case is coordinated by four cysteine residues, and a proximal catalytic zinc ion near the active site, which is coordinated by two cysteines, one histidine and one glutamate residue (Figs 3 and 4b)27,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proximal zinc of THAS1 is 2 Å further away from the cofactor relative to SAD and thus may play no direct role in catalysis (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it may have a function in maintaining the tertiary structure since three of the liganding residues are in the substrate-binding domain and the fourth is in the cofactor-binding domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SAD/CAD utilize an active site serine that protonates the alkoxide that results from reduction of the aldehyde substrate27,29; this serine is replaced with a tyrosine residue in THAS1 (Tyr56) and HYS (Tyr53) (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In THAS2, this tyrosine on helix 2 is replaced with a tryptophan residue, but a tyrosine at position 120 points into the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, a non-proline cis-peptide is present in the THAS1-NADP+ and HYS apo structures (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Closer inspection of this region in THAS1 shows that when this bond is in the trans conformation, the side chain of Asp340 is projected into the cofactor-binding site such that it would prevent NADPH binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Strictosidine aglycone binding', 'Despite extensive efforts, both product and substrate failed to co-crystallize with any of the enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, molecular docking was used to visualize the position of strictosidine aglycone in THAS1 (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure that the correct substrate tautomer was used for docking, we identified the most predominant strictosidine aglycone isomer that forms in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although product precipitation prevented monitoring the SGD reaction in situ under aqueous conditions (Methods), 1H,15N-HMBC NMR showed that an enamine species was the predominant product in aqueous methanolic solution (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with literature reports that cathenamine is the major product of SGD, and is the proposed precursor of ajmalicine and tetrahydroalstonine (Fig 1)21,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In silico docking with THAS1 positions cathenamine between the nicotinamide of the NADP+ and Tyr56, which is located on helix 2 (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  THAS1 loop 1 contains Phe65 that also projects into the active site and may interact with the aromatic cathenamine substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mechanism of reduction and heteroyohimbine formation', 'In tetrahydroalstonine biosynthesis, we hypothesize that cathenamine tautomerizes to the iminium form by protonation at C20, followed by addition of the hydride at C21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protonation at C20 must occur from the bottom face to yield the S stereochemistry observed at this position (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While there does not appear to be an appropriately positioned active site residue to perform this role, the crystal structures of these enzymes reveal the presence of numerous water molecules in the active site that could potentially protonate this carbon (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1H,15N-HMBC measurements of strictosidine aglycone at different pH values show formation of the iminium species in solution when the pH was reduced to 3.5, indicating that this tautomer can readily form in the presence of an acidic moiety (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Mechanistic hypothesis for

tetrahydroalstonine from reactions using THAS1 and pro-R-NADPD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis by 1H-NMR showed that tetrahydroalstonine is labelled with deuterium in the pro-R position at C21, consistent with previously reported experiments performed in crude cell extracts (Fig 6a)32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that THAS1 could reduce the enamine directly, in which case hydride addition would occur at C21, followed by protonation at C20 by a water molecule as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of mayumbine/19-epi-ajmalicine in some of the enzymatic reactions suggests that small amounts of cathenamine can open and form 19-epi-cathenamine, either in solution or in the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Deuterium labelling of THAS1 and HYS products using pro-R-NADPD.Comparison of selected regions of 1H-NMR spectra of labelled (a) tetrahydroalstonine, (b) ajmalicine, (c) mayumbine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectra indicate that C21 is labelled with deuterium in the pro-R position.Full size image', 'In the case of HYS, which produces both ajmalicine (R C20) and tetrahydroalstonine (S C20), protonation must also occur from the opposite face to yield R stereochemistry at C20 (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Products of HYS generated with pro-R-NADPD were also isolated and analysed by 1H-NMR, and, as for tetrahydroalstonine from THAS1 in each case showed deuterium labelling in the pro-R position at C21 (Fig 6ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the stereochemical course of hydride addition is not altered in HYS compared with THAS1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The major difference between HYS and THAS1/THAS2 appears to be the extended loop over the HYS active site (D125-GHFGNN-F132 in HYS and D128-SN-Y131 in THAS1, loop 2 in Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The histidine residue in HYS loop 2 (His127) appears to be positioned appropriately to provide an alternative proton source for the opposite (top) face of the substrate, which could explain the appearance of ajmalicine in the product profile of HYS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reactions with THAS1 and HYS performed at different pH conditions (58) revealed that while changes in pH did not substantially impact the product profile of THAS1, HYS produced increased amounts of ajmalicine relative to tetrahydroalstonine at pH 6 compared with higher pH values (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increased level of ajmalicine in HYS at lower pH values is consistent with the pKa value of the histidine side chain and supports the role of this histidine in ajmalicine biosynthesis, though attributing pH dependence to specific residues must be approached with caution33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Switching stereoselectivity of HYSs', 'Since the major sequence and structural difference between HYS and THAS1 is the extended loop over the HYS active site, loop 2 (Fig 3), we swapped these loop regions in THAS1 and HYS to determine whether the stereochemical product profile could be switched (Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loop 1, which is near the active site, was also swapped (Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the THAS1 mutant containing the swaps displayed reduced activity rather than an altered product profile (Fig 7c), the HYS mutant containing the shorter THAS1 loop 2 resulted in a product profile similar to that of THAS1 (Fig 7b, Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since His127 is the only ionizable residue in this loop, we hypothesized that this residue protonates C20, as discussed above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we mutated this histidine to alanine or asparagine in HYS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both of these mutants gave the same THAS-like profile, suggesting that His127 is required for producing the ajmalicine (R C20) stereochemistry (Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutation of other conserved ionizable residues in the THAS1 active site (Tyr56, Ser102 and Thr166) did not result in substantial changes in the distribution of products (Supplementary Table 6, Supplementary Figs 10 and 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations to Glu59, which anchors the NADPH cofactor, resulted in a slight increase in product promiscuity (Supplementary Fig 11), perhaps by causing a shift in the cofactor position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reactivity of the substrate34 and precipitation at high concentrations during the assay makes obtaining accurate kinetic constants challenging24, so

was used for silencing both genes simultaneously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Successful silencing of the genes was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcriptionPCR (qRTPCR) (Supplementary Fig 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aside from a small degree of cross-silencing between THAS2 and THAS3 (12%), all of the target genes were silenced selectively, as measured by qRTPCR (Supplementary Fig 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Due to the inherent reactivity of the HYS substrate (strictosidine aglycone), changes in the level of this compound in planta are difficult to accurately detect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the effect of silencing must be established by quantitatively measuring decreases in heteroyohimbine levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously for THAS1, we measured the combined peak for heteroyohimbines, since the diastereomers were difficult to resolve on a reverse phase LC column under the reported conditions24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, after substantial optimization (see Methods), an LC-MS method was developed to separate ajmalicine and tetrahydroalstonine in crude leaf extracts (19-epi-ajamlicine/mayumbine is not observed in C. roseus leaves, Supplementary Fig 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ajmalicine and particularly tetrahydroalstonine are observed in low levels even in empty vector control samples compared with the major leaf monoterpene indole alkaloids vindoline and catharanthine, and in addition, heteroyohimbine composition varied substantially among individual leaves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, accurate measurement of decreases in ajmalicine and tetrahydroalstonine levels is challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no evidence for a decrease of ajmalicine or tetrahydroalstonine when THAS2 and THAS3 were silenced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for HYS, there was a statistically significant decrease (t-test 0.0275) in ajmalicine, and no change in tetrahydroalstonine levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, a statistically significant decrease in ajmalicine, as well as tetrahydroalstonine (t-test 0.0277 and 0.0276, respectively) was also noted for THAS1 (Supplementary Fig 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the results are statistically significant, the leaf-to-leaf variability, the low level of endogenous production, and the catalytic redundancy of these enzymes make it difficult to draw firm conclusions from these VIGS data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, regulatory factors that impact the ratio of ajmalicine and tetrahydroalstonine, such as transport mechanisms and/or further derivatization to other products, cannot be ruled out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional silencing systems, in different tissues, will be required to more firmly establish the physiological function of these enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, we can state that silencing of HYS and THAS1 impacts alkaloid production in C. roseus leaves.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Here we report several medium chain dehydrogenases/reductases that produce the heteroyohimbine stereoisomers ajmalicine and/or tetrahydroalstonine, thereby providing a framework to understand the enzymatic control over stereoselectivity in this metabolic pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is notable that we have identified four enzymes that generate tetrahydroalstonine, yet ajmalicine is the more abundant isomer in planta (Supplementary Fig 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression profile data of the genes identified in this study suggest that HYS, which produces ajmalicine, is not expressed at higher levels than the other synthases (Supplementary Fig 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There may be additional ajmalicine synthases that are not related to the MDR superfamily homologues identified in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, tetrahydroalstonine could be shuttled into another pathway or degraded, thereby resulting in the observed lower levels that accumulate in planta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Importantly, the pharmacological activity of heteroyohimbines is impacted by the stereochemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ajmalicine has recently been used in combination with almitrine in post-stroke treatments, though the side effects caused by almitrine resulted in widespread withdrawal of the drug in 2013 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While tetrahydroalstonine has no reported pharmacological function, its oxidized product, alstonine (Fig 1), has recently been shown to act by a unique mechanism for modulating dopamine uptake and shows potential as an anti-psychotic drug13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heteroyohimbines have excellent promise as a scaffold for pharmacological activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discovery of the HYSs, along with recently developed heterologous production platforms for monoterpene indole alkaloids36, now allows the possibility of generating these alkaloids and unnatural derivatives through metabolic engineering/synthetic biology strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The crystal structures of three HYSs reveal the potential of biosynthetic machinery to generate stereochemical variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flexible loop regions can be the key to unlocking chemical diversity: as we have demonstrated here, mutating the extended loop over the HYS active site (loop 2 in Fig 3) impacts stereochemical outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the MDRs that we have identified demonstrate high variability at this region (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phylogenetic analysis (Supplementary Fig 18) suggests that these HYSs, which appear to have originated from a common ancestor, may have undergone neo-functionalization through mutation in this loop region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This loop could potentially be harnessed in protein engineering efforts to generate novel catalytic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While the in planta function of heteroyohimbines is unknown, deglycosylated strictosidine is toxic and may act as a defense compound34, similar to the defense roles of the aglycones of the iridoids from which stictosidine is derived37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SGD is expressed in most tissues (Supplementary Fig 12), suggesting that the plant must have evolved mechanisms to control the levels of the toxic strictosidine aglycone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In directed overflow metabolism, excess reactive intermediates are converted into non-reactive byproducts39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is intriguing to speculate that monoterpene indole alkaloid biosynthesis may have initially arisen as a mechanism for handling overflow of strictosidine aglycone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HYSs perform a single, chemically straightforward reduction reaction that immediately neutralizes the reactivity of strictosidine aglycone/cathenamine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The co-localization and interaction of THAS1, THAS2 and HYS with SGD reinforces the hypothesis of an evolutionary mechanism deployed by strictosidine-accumulating plants to manage the reactivity of the strictosidine aglycone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also raises the question of a possible competition between HYSs for recruitment by SGD when distinct enzymes are co-expressed in the same tissue/cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether the heteroyohimbines serve an active biological function in the plant, or whether they are simply the end product of directed overflow metabolism, or both, remains to be investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless, it is clear that MDRs play an important role in the generation of a wide variety of chemical structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Duplication of the evolutionary dehydrogenase ancestor may have given rise to multiple HYSs, along with MDRs with other biosynthetic activities, such as tabersonine-3-reductase that is involved in the biosynthesis of the anti-cancer alkaloid vinblastine (Supplementary Fig 18)40.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
