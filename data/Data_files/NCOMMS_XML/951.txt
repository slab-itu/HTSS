Activation of the hypothalamic feeding centre upon visual prey detection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The visual system plays a major role in food/prey recognition in diurnal animals, and food intake is regulated by the hypothalamus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, whether and how visual information about prey is conveyed to the hypothalamic feeding centre is largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we perform real-time imaging of neuronal activity in freely behaving or constrained zebrafish larvae and demonstrate that prey or prey-like visual stimuli activate the hypothalamic feeding centre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we identify prey detector neurons in the pretectal area that project to the hypothalamic feeding centre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ablation of the pretectum completely abolishes prey capture behaviour and neurotoxin expression in the hypothalamic area also reduces feeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results suggest that the pretecto-hypothalamic pathway plays a crucial role in conveying visual information to the feeding centre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this pathway possibly converts visual food detection into feeding motivation in zebrafish.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Control of feeding behaviour is one of the roles for the hypothalamus of the vertebrate brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mammals, the feeding centre resides in the lateral hypothalamus1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In teleost fish, the inferior lobe of the hypothalamus (ILH) has been suggested to have crucial roles in feeding behaviour3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ablation of these areas in the hypothalamus abolishes feeding behaviour4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, stimulation of these areas leads to feeding behaviour in both mammals and teleost fish1,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the important role of the hypothalamus in the regulation of feeding behaviours is highly conserved among vertebrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Neuronal activity in the feeding centre of the hypothalamus is affected not only by internal signals such as blood sugar levels, but also by the recognition of the availability of food sources in the environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, neuronal activity has been observed in the hypothalamic feeding centre during appetitive and consummatory behaviours in rodents6 and at the sight of familiar food in monkeys7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because these studies used animals with prior feeding experience, it is not clear whether sensory-driven hypothalamic activity for appetitive behaviour is innate or learned through experience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In lower vertebrates that receive no parental care, larvae must attempt to catch prey, even at their first encounter, for their survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we use zebrafish larvae as a vertebrate model to identify the neuronal pathways linking the visual prey perception to prey capture behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zebrafish start to swim at 4 day post-fertilization (d.p.f.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and immediately start feeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, they can survive without feeding until 7 d.p.f.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  because they can utilize their yolk as an energy source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the zebrafish is a good model system to study the neuronal activity in feeding behaviour at the earliest stage of life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the zebrafish is a genetically tractable animal model, and the transparent larval brain enables the imaging study of functional neural circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To genetically label substructures in the brain or subpopulations of cells in specific neural circuits, we and other groups have established the use of the Gal4-UAS system in zebrafish8,9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activity of subsets of neurons that express Gal4 can be imaged with functional probes13,14 or silenced with neurotoxins8,15 to study the link between neuronal activity and behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Feeding in zebrafish larvae primarily depends on vision16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial step in the visual recognition of possible prey or other small objects takes place in the retina in lower vertebrates18,19, including zebrafish20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optic tectum of the midbrain, which is the largest retinorecipient structure, is involved in the computation of object size21,22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the optic tectum serves as a visuotopic map, on which the perceived prey is located14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although, direct projections from the visual system to the premotor reticulospinal neurons in the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle have been demonstrated20, the neural pathway from these visual prey detection centres to the hypothalamic feeding centre is not known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that there should be a neural pathway that conveys visual information about prey to the hypothalamic feeding centre and that the presence of possible prey evokes hypothalamic activity that drives appetitive behaviour in zebrafish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By imaging neuronal activity in free-swimming zebrafish larvae25, we investigate whether the visual detection of prey is sufficient for hypothalamic activation in naive zebrafish larvae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we aim to identify the neural connections between the visual system and the hypothalamus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report our findings on the role of a pretectal nucleus as the prey detector and its anatomical and functional connection to the hypothalamic feeding centre in zebrafish larvae.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The hypothalamus is activated at the sight of possible prey', 'To genetically define the postulated hypothalamic feeding centre, the ILH in zebrafish, we performed large-scale gene-/enhancer-trap screens26 and identified one enhancer trap line, hspGFFDMC76A, that expressed Gal4 in the ILH (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27) (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the adult zebrafish brain, UAS:EGFP reporter gene expression was observed throughout the entire structure of the ILH, including the dorsal zone of the periventricular nucleus, diffuse nucleus, central nucleus and corpus mamillare.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the reporter gene was also expressed in the torus lateralis and preoptic area (Supplementary Fig 1bg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar pattern of expression, in addition to epithelial expression, was observed at the larval stage (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although, the subdivisions of the ILH in the larval brain have not yet been described, we observed at least two large populations of cells in the ILH at 5 d.p.f..  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The anterior population projected posteriorly and formed a tract that passed through the vagal lobe28 to the caudal end (Supplementary Fig 1h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the ILH, two other populations of cells were labelled in the preoptic area both at the larval and adult stages (Fig 1a; Supplementary Fig 1d,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Activity in the ILH in the presence of prey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) UAS:EGFP reporter gene expression in the ILH in hspGFFDMC76A Gal4 fish at 5 d.p.f.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The left ILH is encircled by dotted lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ILH: the inferior lobe of the hypothalamus, POA: preoptic area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 50 m.

visualize neuronal activity in this hypothalamic feeding centre, we generated UAShspzGCaMP6s (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29) transgenic zebrafish and expressed the calcium (Ca) probe GCaMP6s in the hspGFFDMC76A Gal4 line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed calcium imaging in previously unfed zebrafish larvae to determine whether the ILH was activated during prey capture behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GCaMP6s fluorescence intensity was increased in the ILH when a paramecium approached the larva (just before eye convergence, F/F0=1.3±0.12 (mean±s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), n=24 events in 4 larvae), just before the rapid capturing movement (Peak F/F0=1.7±0.28, n=8 events in 4 larvae) and after completion of prey capture (Peak F/F0=3.46±0.40, mean±s.d., n=4 larvae; Fig 1b,c, Supplementary Fig 2, Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although, the ILH showed bilateral activation, the ILH on the opposite side of the paramecium location showed higher elevation of the calcium signal at the time of eye convergence (Supplementary Fig 2, in 19 cases out of 22 in 4 larvae, P=0.003, binominal test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As image registration could not completely eliminate movement artefacts in the quantification of the calcium signals, we performed control experiments with UAS:EGFP-expressing larvae to assess the extent of the movement artefacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our experimental conditions, the fluctuations in the intensity of the EGFP fluorescence in the ILH after image registration were negligible, which suggested that the changes in the GCaMP6s fluorescence reflected actual calcium signals (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, to examine the optimal positions of the prey in the visual field for the ILH responses, a larva was embedded in agarose, and a single paramecium was presented in the recording chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of a paramecium in front of the larva evoked a response in the ILH, regardless of the movement direction of the prey (Fig 1d, Supplementary Fig 4, Supplementary Movie 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Living paramecia may contain olfactory cues, as well as visual cues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine whether a visual cue was sufficient to evoke this hypothalamic activity, we showed a moving spot, which mimicked the paramecium, to a larva that was embedded in agarose, while the brain was imaged with a confocal microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The moving spot evoked the ILH responses that were comparable in amplitude to the calcium signals evoked by living prey (Fig 1e), which suggested that vision is the major sensory modality responsible for the activation of the ILH in prey capture behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To test the necessity of the neuronal activity in the ILH for the prey capture behaviour, we crossed this ILH Gal4 line with a botulinum toxin line, UAS:zBoTxBLCGFP and then assessed the prey capturing ability of the larvae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that paramecium consumption was significantly decreased in the larvae that expressed botulinum toxin in the ILH (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of the toxin did not affect the locomotor activity (Supplementary Fig 5a), and larvae carrying UAS:zBoTxBLCGFP alone or with another gal4 SAGFF(LF)27A (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30) did not show significant change in prey capture activity (Supplementary Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggested that the hypothalamic activity is important for the feeding behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not observe a significant reduction in eye convergence in the larvae that expressed the toxin in the ILH (Supplementary Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Neurons in the pretectum serve as prey detectors', 'To investigate the neuronal pathway that links visual prey recognition and hypothalamic feeding regulation, we next tried to identify the neuronal module in the brain that responded to prey, other than the optic tectum of the midbrain that shows visuotopic activity14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our collection of Gal4 gene-/enhancer-trap lines, we expressed GCaMP6s in various regions in the brain and then imaged the larval brains, while the larvae were in the presence of paramecia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach revealed that cells in the pretectal area in the gSAzGFFM119B line (hereafter, referred to as the 119B-pretectal cells) showed calcium signals that correlated with the proximal presence of a paramecium (Fig 2ac, Supplementary Fig 6, Supplementary Movie 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the pretectal area, gSAzGFFM119B expression was observed in the dorsal half of the forebrain, olfactory bulb, preglomerular nuclei, optic tectum and cerebellum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the pretectal cells, none of these areas showed apparent calcium signals at the sight of prey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As moving artefacts are inevitable, when imaging of free-swimming larvae, we performed control EGFP recordings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Smaller regions of interest (ROIs) in the pretectum generated much larger artefacts in the traces of fluorescence intensity than those observed in the ILH after the larvae started to move to capture the prey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even in this condition, the EGFP fluorescence did not increase before eye convergence (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These control experiments validated the GCaMP6s signals in a condition involving minimal movements of the larvae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To characterize the activity of the 119B-pretectal cells, we again used the experimental set up of the agarose-embedded larvae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Visually responsive neurons in the pretectal area were not selective for the swimming direction of the paramecium and their responses were not necessarily associated with behaviour (for example, eye convergence17), which indicated that this pretectal neuronal activity was involved in the visual detection of prey (Fig 2d, Supplementary Fig 8, Supplementary Movies 4 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Activity in a subset of

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this study, we observed neuronal activity in the inferior lobe of the hypothalamus (ILH) that was driven by the visual prey perception in zebrafish larvae without any prior feeding experience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also identified prey detector neurons in the pretectal area that projected directly to the ILH and were indispensable for prey capture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that visual information conveyed by this pretecto-hypothalamic circuit is essential for modulatory function of the hypothalamus in feeding behaviour (Supplementary Fig 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The ILH is a conspicuous structure bulging out on the ventral brain surface in adult zebrafish brain but at larval stage it has not been unequivocally identified due to the lack of a reliable marker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking advantage of our collection of the gal4 gene-/enhancer-trap lines26, we used hspGFFDMC76A Gal4 line to label the ILH, which showed subdivision into at least two areas, anterior and posterior, at larval stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells in the anterior part of the ILH formed an outgoing tract that passed along the vagal area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two tracts on the left and right sides converged at the posterior end of the vagal area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In goldfish and tilapia, the central nucleus and the nucleus of lateral recess of the ILH project to the vagal lobe and the commissural nucleus of Cajal34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent work on adult zebrafish also showed that the ILH forms a part of the gustatory circuit36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observations in larval zebrafish are consistent with those studies and demonstrate that these anatomical structures are conserved among these species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The posterior part of the ILH received gSAzGFFM119B Gal4-labelled pretectal efferents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on this input pattern and the expression in the adult brain, we identified this area as the corpus mamillare.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The ILH has been hypothesized to be the feeding centre, or hypothalamic feeding area3, in teleost fish based on surgical lesion4 and electrical stimulation5 experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the ILH has a complex structure with subdivisions and intricate fibre connections, perturbations of the ILH function by these classical experimental tools could not be very specific to the targeted areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specific interventions are required to determine exact roles for the ILH and its subdivisions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observation of neuronal activity in the ILH during initial prey perception and succeeding prey capture behaviour supports the notion that the feeding centre in teleosts resides in the ILH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we only used previously unfed larvae at 46 d.p.f., which probably corresponds to a hungry condition as zebrafish larvae start foraging at 4 d.p.f..  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the ILH activity represents feeding motivation, it would be lowered by feeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A study in monkeys indeed showed that satiety reduces hypothalamic visual response to the food37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In zebrafish, the feeding state was shown to modulate visual perception in the optic tectum by shifting the size-tuning property through a serotonergic system22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pretecto-hypothalamic circuit might serve as another target for the modulation of this visually driven behaviour by hunger/satiety state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Prey detector is a long standing notion in neuroethology, and its neural correlate has been a topic of great interest39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies in zebrafish and other species have suggested that prey detection is initiated in the retina and further elaborated in the optic tectum for the extraction of the visual features such as size and motion of the prey21,22,23,24,40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Being either retinorecipient or tectorecipient27, pretectal nuclei also participate in the neural circuit for prey perception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In zebrafish, the RGCs project to the optic tectum and also to distinct pretectal areas where they form arbourisation fields (AFs)32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A subpopulation of the RGCs that project to the AF-7 pretectal area are involved in prey capture20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pretectal area containing the cells that receive inputs from AF-7 was identified as the parvocellular superficial pretectal nucleus (PSp), and these cells project to the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle, motor area in the hindbrain and also to the optic tectum in zebrafish20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a perciform teleost, the retinorecipient cells in the pretectal nucleus corticalis (NC), which is absent in zebrafish42, show visual responses to a small moving spot and send projections to the optic tectum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The receptive fields of these NC neurons are large and cover the entire visual field43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast with the results of these previous studies, the 119B-pretectal cells seem not to receive direct inputs from the RGCs, respond to an object located in a relatively limited area in front of the larva, and project to the caudal part of the ILH (the corpus mamillare).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences suggest that 119B-pretectal cells are different cell populations from previously reported cell types that respond to small objects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the ILH projection, we observed another projection from the 119B-pretectal cells towards the precerebellar area, possibly to the nucleus lateralis valvulae44 (Supplementary Movie 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these morphological and functional observations, the 119B-pretectal cell group was identified as the magnocellular superficial pretectal nucleus (PSm)42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our study along with Semmelhacks20 suggest that two distinct pretectal nuclei, namely, PSp and PSm, are involved in prey perception in zebrafish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PSm-pathway might have modulatory role over the more directly motor-related PSp-pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significance of having a dual system of prey perception and its interrelationships remain to be elucidated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In neuroethology, prey-catching behaviour has been extensively studied in toads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thalamic-pretectal lesions in toads disinhibit the size-specificity of prey-catching behaviour, which results in enhanced prey-catching behaviour to larger stimuli that normally cause an avoidance response45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the pretectum in toads appears to function in a manner opposite to that observed in our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discrepancy might be due to differences in the ablated areas or to evolutionarily divergent functions of the pretectal nuclei27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In our calcium imaging in free-swimming zebrafish larvae, the elevation of the ILH activity started before the onset of behavioural response (that is, eye convergence).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this suggests correlation of the ILH activity with the initiation of the prey capture behaviour, we did not detect a significant reduction of the eye convergence time in the larvae with botulinum toxin expression in the ILH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could be partly due to an insufficient expression level of the botulinum toxin in the ILH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, other downstream pathways might be more crucial for the initiation of prey capture behaviour and the ILH silencing had an effect after prey capture was started.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further study is necessary to clarify the causality between the ILH activity and behavioural processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Both in the 119B-pretectal cells and the ILH, bilateral activity was evoked merely by the presence of prey and the activity was not necessarily associated with eye convergence (the initial step in the prey capture behaviour).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the cases where eye convergence occurred, the intensity of the GCaMP6s fluorescence was observed to increase before the eye movements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the activation of the pretecto-hypothalmic circuit, at least in the early phase, is solely evoked by visual prey detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is notable that larger calcium signals in the 119B-pretectal cells were often observed in the cases with the eye convergence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The119B-pretectal cells also projected to the precerebellar area which possibly relays information to the cerebellum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cerebellar activities were observed to be associated with eye movements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Existence of diverging neural pathways and their activity suggests more roles for the 119B-pretectal cells than initial perception of the prey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Prey capture circuit in zebrafish is a good model system to study goal-directed sensorimotor transformation and its modulation by internal states, external conditions and feeding experience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To fully understand this behaviour, we need to elucidate the entire circuit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the PSm receives input from the optic tectum in carps (a species that is closely related to zebrafish), the 119B-pretectal cells might also receive input from the optic tectum45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While progress has been made on the visuomotor circuit for prey capture, it is still largely unknown how gustatory information, that usually comes seconds after initial prey detection, can modulate the visual prey perception, a critical pathway for the reinforcement learning of food/non-food discrimination in a given feeding environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the ILH, much larger calcium signals were observed after the completion of prey capture compared with visually evoked calcium signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This massive neuronal activity in the late phase of the behaviour might be associated with gustatory sensations of the prey and/or chewing or swallowing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observation of a sustained activity in the ILH from the initial prey perception to completion of prey consumption, and the fact that the ILH receives visual input and gustatory feedback tempt us to speculate that the ILH might serve as the place for integration of visual and gustatory information of prey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The multimodal integration should be implicated in reinforcement of the behavioural decision based on the visual features of prey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we demonstrated hypothalamic activation upon visual prey detection and genetically identified prey detector neurons in the pretectal area that had direct projections to this hypothalamic feeding centre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the visual recognition of familiar food elicits neuronal responses in the lateral hypothalamus in primates7, visually driven hypothalamic activation seems to be a fundamental process in vertebrate feeding behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This innate motivational system is crucial for the survival of larvae that receive no parental care.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
