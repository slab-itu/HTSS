Pre-vaccination inflammation and B-cell signalling predict age-related hyporesponse to hepatitis B vaccination  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Aging is associated with hyporesponse to vaccination, whose mechanisms remain unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study hepatitis B virus (HBV)-naive older adults received three vaccines, including one against HBV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show, using transcriptional and cytometric profiling of whole blood collected before vaccination, that heightened expression of genes that augment B-cell responses and higher memory B-cell frequencies correlate with stronger responses to HBV vaccine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, higher levels of inflammatory response transcripts and increased frequencies of pro-inflammatory innate cells correlate with weaker responses to this vaccine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased numbers of erythrocytes and the haem-induced response also correlate with poor response to the HBV vaccine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A transcriptomics-based pre-vaccination predictor of response to HBV vaccine is built and validated in distinct sets of older adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This moderately accurate (area under the curve65%) but robust signature is supported by flow cytometry and cytokine profiling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study is the first that identifies baseline predictors and mechanisms of response to the HBV vaccine.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Aging confers elevated risk of illness and death from infection1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the number and proportion of older individuals increase worldwide2, prevention of severe or poorly treatable infections among the elderly is ever more pressing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though vaccination offers a proven approach to such prevention, well-described age-related vaccine hyporesponses (VHR) blunt its potential benefit3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To date, studies of responses to vaccination have revealed associations with human leucocyte antigen polymorphisms4, innate and adaptive immune cell phenotypes5, suggesting that VHR results from the simultaneous interplay of many elements6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The impracticality of sampling human lymphoid organs coupled with limited translatability of animal models7 poses a formidable challenge to the discovery of these mechanisms as well as biomarkers of VHR using single-hypothesis approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome this challenge, high dimensionality studies of cellular and molecular responses to vaccines have been proposed to speed convergence to actionable mechanistic and biomarker hypotheses; an approach termed systems vaccinology8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach has been used to discover early post-vaccination mRNA signatures of responses to yellow fever vaccine YF17D and to correlate strong immunogenicity with cross-lineage cellular activation9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies of influenza vaccination have yielded insights into new signalling pathways for B-cell regulation, the potential importance of early neutrophil responses to interferon exposure, and early predictors of post-vaccination immunity11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Systems vaccinology was applied to multi-vaccine comparisons11,13 as well as to identification of pre-vaccination transcriptomic14 and flow cytometric (FCM) correlates of response15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, biomarkers predictive of the response to vaccination have yet to be validated and more importantly mechanisms that control the response to vaccination remain to be defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we first identified a mRNA signature of aging that associated with the seroresponse to the hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) in naive older adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then transcriptomics, polychromatic FCM and serum cytokine profiling were used to generate an integrated model to inform on potential involvement of specific cellular and molecular pathways in nascent anti-HBsAg responses in older adults.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Clinical characteristics of the study cohort', 'Socio-demographic and serological characteristics of this studys cohort (designated as the EM131 cohort) appear in Supplementary Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One-hundred and seventy-four healthy adults received vaccines against Hepatitis A (HAV)/HBVs, Diphtheria/Tetanus toxoids and Cholera bacteria/toxin (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentage of study participants that mounted protective Ab titres (anti-HBsAg: 10 mIU ml1, anti-Tetanus toxoid: 0.1 IU ml1, anti-Diphtheria toxoid: 0.1 IU ml1 and anti-Cholera toxin: dilution 1:40)16,17,18 were, in decreasing order, 95% for Tetanus, 84% for Diphtheria, 71% for Cholera and 37% for HBV (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only the HBV vaccine involved an antigen to which all study participants were naive and presented the lowest response rate (37%, after two injections) even when we restricted the analysis to participants with undetectable Ab titres pre-vaccination (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focused our analysis on the HBV vaccine response (primary immunization).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kernel density estimation of anti-HBsAg titres showed that a cutoff of 5 mIU ml1 demarcated study participants as HBV vaccine responders (Ab titres5 mIU ml1) and poor-responders (Ab titres below detection threshold) (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Logistic regression between demographic variables and HBV vaccine response revealed that age and gender were significantly associated with response to the HBV vaccine on the EM131 data set (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we investigated the association of age-related transcriptomic changes with the response to HBV vaccination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Study design and antibody titres for

elderly participants', 'To identify the biological pathways associated to older age, we assessed the overlap between each of these modules and Ingenuity canonical pathways (Fishers exact test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a cutoff of P0.05, we identified 250 biological pathways enriched in the 20 modules (Supplementary Table 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the one hand, pathways positively associated with older age included pathways that regulate cell motility (M12 and M14) and genes downstream of integrin signalling (M15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A type II interferon signalling module (M17) characterized by the induced expression of TNF and IFNG was also enriched in elderly participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inflammatory responses that include complement genes (M16) downstream of interferons, as well as T-cell/natural killer (NK)-cells-mediated cytolysis (M19) markers such as perforin and granzyme B, were also positively associated with older age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Module M19 was highly enriched in NK-cell markers such as the killer cell immunoglobin-like receptors (KIR2DL2, KIR3DL1 and KIR3DL3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, pathways enriched in younger participants included immunological pathways such as B-cell signalling (M1) comprising several B-cell markers (CD79A, CD79B, CD19, CD20 and CD22), T-cell receptor signalling (M6) that included ZAP70, TRAF1, TCF7 a marker of memory T cells20 and antiviral response (M8) that included the antiviral signalling gene MAVS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MYC signalling (M3), which triggers metabolic pathways such as amino acid metabolism (M2 and M4), fatty acid biosynthesis (M9) and lipid metabolic pathways (M11), all critical for the induction of T- and B-cell memory, was enriched in younger participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that each of the 20 modules reflect a specific biological process that is positively or negatively associated to aging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results also confirm that elderly show constitutive upregulation of several pro-inflammatory pathways downstream of type I/II interferons which are suggested to favour immunosenescence21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An age-related signature is observed prior to vaccination', 'We developed an aggregate score that integrates transcriptomic changes associated with older age by subtracting the average expression of the 11 modules negatively associated with age from the average expression of the 9 modules positively associated with age (Methods formula 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated the BioAge score on the SAFHS cohort and as expected observed a significant correlation between the BioAge score and chronological age (Pearsons correlation: r=0.421, P less_than 2.2e16; Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same modules that discriminated elderly and young participants in the SAFHS cohort also distinguished the two age groups in the EM131 cohort (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a statistically significant association between chronological age and BioAge on the EM131 cohort (Fig 2c, Wilcoxon rank-sum test: P=1.01e05), confirming the validity of this score to reflect the impact of age on gene expression in whole blood cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While most young study participants had a low BioAge score, the BioAge predictor divided elderly patients (65, EM131 elderly cohort) into two groups designated as BioAge young (n=62, age65, 78) and BioAge old (n=76, age65, 83) (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'BioAge associated with HBV vaccine response pre-immunization', 'We determined if different BioAge scores correlated with different responses to HBV vaccination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the BioAge score (Supplementary Fig 3) and the two groups of elderly identified by the BioAge signature (Fishers exact test: odds ratio (OR)=2.14, P=0.0357; Fig 3a) were associated with the rate of response to the HBV vaccine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, in a multivariate analysis including available clinical parameters, the BioAge was both a better predictor of the HBV response than chronological age and independent of gender (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the 20 gene modules defined in the BioAge signature, 2 modules M1 (lower expression in BioAge old) and M16 (high expression in BioAge old) allowed the most accurate prediction of the response to the HBV vaccine (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pathway enrichment analysis showed that module M1 was enriched in genes encoding two critical components of the B-cell receptor, that is, CD79A and CD79B, B-cell activation markers such as CD19, CD22, the transcription factor POU2AF1 (a protein essential for the response of B cells to antigens and required for the formation of germinal centres)22 and MZB-1, a chaperone involved in assembly of IgM23 (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Module M16 includes genes of the acute phase response, that is, the complement gene C1, the mediator of type II interferon response MYD88 and the transcription factor IRF7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IRF7 target genes such as LILRA5 (a marker expressed by TNF-producing macrophages), S100 (a molecule associated to cellular senescence), IL-15 (a pro-inflammatory cytokine that triggers CD8 T-cell and NK-cell expansion), PILRA (an inhibitory receptor that acts through SHP-1) and PRELID-1 (a gene that negatively regulates the development of TH2 responses) were also present in module M16 (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, module M1 includes mostly genes involved in B-cell activation while module M16 includes genes linked to inhibition of the B-cell response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

albeit with a moderate accuracy, of participants that will mount a poor response to the HBV vaccine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This signature highlights the interplay between the innate inflammatory pathways and B cells in the response to the HBV vaccine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A 15-gene signature predicts the HBV vaccine response', 'We used an independent, supervised approach to identify other gene sets/pathways important for predicting the response to the HBV vaccine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The EM131 elderly cohort was randomly split into a training cohort (2/3 of the study participants) and a test cohort (1/3 of the participants).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were not able to identify a single transcript that was significantly differentially expressed between HBV vaccine responders and poor-responders of the EM131 training set (linear model for microarray (LIMMA): adjusted P0.05, Supplementary Table 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then tested if a combination of genes (multivariate model) could distinguish the two classes of responders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To that end, a naive Bayes classifier based on the top 15 differentially expressed genes between responders and poor-responders to the HBV vaccines was built on the EM131 training set (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The accuracy of the resulting 15-gene signature was assessed on the EM131 training set by 10-fold cross-validation and on the EM131 test set and found to be 62.6% and 62.2%, respectively (Fig 4b,c, Supplementary Fig 4 and Supplementary Table 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A permutation test was performed to assess the probability of building a signature of the same size (15 genes) with better or equal accuracy to the 15-gene signature on the EM131 test set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That probability was 0.0381, suggesting that building a better predictive model randomly is improbable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Network inference revealed that several members of this 15-gene signature included markers of B cells (for example, CD20, IGHG1), as well as downstream targets of B-cell receptor signalling (for example, BANK1) and molecules known to have functional interactions with IgG (for example, C1, FCGR3B; Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Network inference revealed that both the 15-gene signature and the BioAge signature shared members of the B-cell signalling (CD20, BANK1; Fishers exact test: P=7.99e07) and inflammation pathways (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both signatures showed upregulated expression of genes directly associated with inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the BioAge M16, IRF7 (the master switch of type I interferon) and its downstream targets IL-15 and OAS1, as well as NFkB and C1 (hallmarks of inflammation) were associated with lower Ab titres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the 15-gene signature, haptoglobin (HP), an acute phase protein and also a target gene of type I interferon signalling, was associated with low Ab titres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pathway analysis performed on a list of genes derived with a less stringent statistical cutoff of nominal P0.05 confirmed the positive association of B-cell signalling and the response to HBV vaccine (Supplementary Table 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, two independent

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this study, we provide an integrated model and propose mechanisms that could explain the response to vaccines prior to primary vaccination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study cohort included a training set of 95 elderly participants (Supplementary Table 1) that was used to identify biomarkers of the response to vaccines; a distinct set of 49 participants sharing similar demographic and clinical characteristics served as an independent test set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study design allowed the assessment of the accuracy and robustness of biomarkers that can predict the response to HBV vaccine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two types of signalling pathways, B-cell signalling and inflammation, were thus identified using two independent bioinformatic approaches as important regulators/predictors of the response to HBV vaccination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both classifiers, the BioAge signature and the 15-gene signature, were confirmed in an independent test cohort and showed for the first time that it was possible to distinguish high responders from low responder to HBV vaccination with accuracies  greater than 60%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this is lower than accuracies previously reported post vaccination10, it is well within the range of those reported for baseline predictors to cancer treatments (area under the curve=67.7% (50.0%, 80.4%))27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The opposing impacts of B-cell signalling and inflammation reflected in both classifiers were confirmed in independent set of participants and using three different experimental approaches: gene expression (Figs 3 and 4), FCM (Fig 5a,b) and cytokine profiling (Supplementary Fig 5b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that all three approaches identified these two major pathways as being associated to a successful or a failed response to vaccination highlight the robustness of these signatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Ab titres are the established correlates of vaccine efficacy for the HBV vaccine, implying that the presence of the appropriate subset of B cells prior to vaccination could favour a strong response to the vaccine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results confirm this observation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, FCM results show that the percentage of memory B-cell subsets (% switched IgG+ memory B cells and % IgG+ memory B cells) is a significant univariate predictor of HBV vaccine response (Fig 5a) although absolute counts of total B cells were not a significant predictor of the response to HBV vaccine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were reported by Tsang et al.15 where a specific B-cell phenotype, namely percentage of CD38+CD27+ memory B cells, was the main feature of a model that predicted the Ab response to H1N1 vaccine in participants with undetectable Ab titres to H1N1 prior to vaccination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcriptomic profiling shows that several B-cell markers including components of the BCR complex (that is, IGH, CD79A, CD79B and CD19) were also increased in responders and were positive predictors of the HBV vaccine response in our training and test cohorts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcriptional profiles show that a strong response to HBV vaccine additionally requires that B cells express transcription factors such as POU2AF1 and MZB-1 that programme B cells for Ab production and trigger the formation of germinal centres22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcriptional profiling further highlighted the role of TNFRSF13B, the receptor for BAFF and APRIL cytokines involved in the maturation of the humoral response, and a positive correlates of strong responses to vaccination13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that increased frequencies of CD4+ T cells, which can provide help to B cells in white blood cells, are associated with higher anti-HBsAg titres (Fig 5a)28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Integration of FCM and cytokine profiles highlights the role of elements of the pro-inflammatory response, which is negatively correlated to antibody production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased frequencies of activated innate immune cells (DR+CD40+ mDC and CD40+ pDCs) were associated with transcriptional signatures and cytokines that predicted the poor Ab response (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells produce type I interferons in response to inflammatory signals and this is confirmed by the induction of the transcription factors IRF7 and IRF9 in poor-responders to the HBV vaccine (Fig 4 and Supplementary Table 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of the interferon(s) transcriptional pathway was confirmed by the upregulation of several interferon-induced genes downstream of IRF7 including OASL29,30, and LILRA5 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29) in participants who responded poorly to the HBV vaccine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-15, downstream of type I interferon29,30, was confirmed at the gene and protein levels in poor-responders to the HBV vaccine (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pro-inflammatory complement complex (for example, C3, C1QA, C1QB) and VEGF, a positive regulator of angiogenesis that promotes the chronic inflammatory process31, are also negatively associated to antibody production (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased levels of MYD88 and TRAF, downstream of TLR and IL1 signalling, are observed in poor-responders to HBV vaccination (Supplementary Table 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both MYD88 and TRAF are negatively correlated to the frequency of CD4 T cells, a marker of good response to HBV vaccination (Supplementary Fig 6b, Pearsons correlation: r=0.347 P less_than 0.05 and r=0.353 P less_than 0.05, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, C3 and WARS, two target genes of type I interferons, were negatively associated to the frequencies of the two memory B-cell subsets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, anti-inflammatory protein-coding genes like CD200 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32) and BATF3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33) were repressed in HBV vaccine hyporesponders (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively our results highlight the importance of type I interferon and other pro-inflammatory pathways in the development of a poor response to HBV vaccine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Poor-responders to HBV vaccine showed higher numbers of RBCs than responders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly genes and pathways that correlate positively with HBV Ab titres including genes within module M1 were negatively correlated with RBC counts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely genes included in module M16 (Fig 6) and pro-inflammatory genes included in pathways enriched in poor-responders (Fig 5e) were positive correlates of RBC counts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HIF-1  pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  which controls erythropoietin expression, was significantly upregulated in poor-responders (Fishers exact test: P=0.0360, Supplementary Table 4c); target genes of HIF-1 were induced in poor-responders and their expression levels correlated with higher RBC counts (Pearsons t-test: P=0.0462, Fig 5e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RBC counts were positively correlated to the HMOX1 (haem oxidase catalysing the degradation of haem), HP (scavenger of free Hb) and CD163 expressions (scavenger receptor of the HbHP complex), all of which are interferon-regulated genes and were induced in HBV vaccine poor-responders (Supplementary Table 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The haem-induced response pathway was significantly enriched among genes differentially expressed between HBV vaccine responders and poor-responders (Fishers exact test: P=0.0461, Supplementary Table 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EIF2AK1 (Haem-Regulated Inhibitor) and several of its downstream targets (for example, EIF2, EIF3 and EIF4) were negatively associated with Ab titres (Supplementary Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results highlight a potential role for the haem-induced response and for hypoxia in the poor response to the HBV vaccine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These results suggest a mechanism whereby this aging-associated inflammation leads to induction of the HIF-1 pathway (Supplementary Table 4c) and other pro-inflammatory effector molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may upregulate erythropoietin, a known target of HIF-1, leading to increased RBC counts, release of cell free haemoglobin as suggested from the heightened levels of HP mRNA34 and the downstream upregulation of HRI (Supplementary Fig 6a), a trigger of type I interferon production by pDC and other innate immune cells (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This will further enhance inflammatory pathways that downregulate B-cell activation and hence hyporesponse to de novo vaccination with a vaccine such as HBV (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, these perturbations in RBC homeostasis and B-cell response could be the mark of a global hyperimmune inflammation observed in elderly (inflammaging)35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interplay between inflammation and B-cell signalling is supported by all the experimental approaches in this study (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Several strategies may help overcome the mechanisms impeding optimal response to vaccines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subjects having a pro-inflammatory signature prior to vaccination could benefit from vaccine regimens conferring improved immunogenicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, inflammatory bowel disease patients that did not respond to a first HBV vaccine course were more likely to mount an antibody response on receiving a second complete immunization schedule36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strategies used to overcome desensitization of the innate immune response including the use of more potent adjuvants37 or anti-inflammatory drugs could also improve immune responses to HBV vaccination in the elderly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the anti-inflammatory drug rapamycin improved Ab responses to influenza vaccination38 when used at low dose prior to vaccination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that different inflammatory pathways are at cross-purposes; these differential effects of inflammation will need to be further clarified to improve the response to vaccines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the predictive gene-expression signatures described herein might allow tailoring of vaccine regimens to older persons predisposed to VHR.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
