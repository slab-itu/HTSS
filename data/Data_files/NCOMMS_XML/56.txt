Artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum clinical isolates can infect diverse mosquito vectors of Southeast Asia and Africa  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum parasites are rapidly spreading in Southeast Asia, yet nothing is known about their transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This knowledge gap and the possibility that these parasites will spread to Africa endanger global efforts to eliminate malaria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we produce gametocytes from parasite clinical isolates that displayed artemisinin resistance in patients and in vitro, and use them to infect native and non-native mosquito vectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that contemporary artemisinin-resistant isolates from Cambodia develop and produce sporozoites in two Southeast Asian vectors, Anopheles dirus and Anopheles minimus, and the major African vector, Anopheles coluzzii (formerly Anopheles gambiae M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of artemisinin-resistant parasites to infect such highly diverse Anopheles species, combined with their higher gametocyte prevalence in patients, may explain the rapid expansion of these parasites in Cambodia and neighbouring countries, and further compromise efforts to prevent their global spread.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Artemisinin (ART) resistance in P. falciparum threatens to decrease the efficacy of all ART combination therapies (ACTs)1,2, severely compromising global efforts to eliminate this malaria parasite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, ART resistance has quickly led to the failure of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, the current frontline ACT for falciparum malaria in Western Cambodia3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although ART-resistant P. falciparum parasites have emerged and rapidly expanded in Cambodia and other Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) countries5,6,7,8,9,10, and may spread to Africa, nothing is known about their transmission to native or non-native mosquito vectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two recent findings in Western Cambodia, however, have important implications for the transmission of these parasites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, patients with ART-resistant parasites more often present with gametocytemia, or develop gametocytemia while taking an ACT, than those with ART-sensitive parasites9, suggesting that ART-resistant parasites have increased transmission potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, population genetics studies of P. falciparum clinical isolates have revealed that ART-resistant parasites often undergo population expansions, resulting in highly structured founder populations that are as differentiated from each other as they are from African parasites11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These founder populations display slow parasite clearance following ACTs in patients11,12, show resistance to ART in the Ring-stage Survival Assay in vitro13,14 and carry different kelch13 (K13) mutations8,12 that confer ART resistance15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The GMS hosts a great diversity of anopheline vectors capable of transmitting malaria17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The roles of these vectors in transmitting parasites from several ART-resistant founder populations and the ART-sensitive core population of Cambodia have not been investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that parasite clones within each ART-resistant founder population are nearly genetically identical11,12 and that P. falciparum strains can vary remarkably in their infectivity to Anopheles species in vitro20,21,22, we hypothesized that adaptation to native Anopheles species influences the spread of ART-resistant founder populations within the GMS and that failure to infect non-native vectors prevents their transmission in other regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Characterizing the ability of ART-resistant parasites to infect vectors in Africa is particularly critical in assessing the risks of their spread to this continent, where most of the worlds malaria transmission, morbidity and mortality occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The anopheline fauna in Cambodia and other GMS countries includes a large number of vector species, entirely distinct from the relatively few vector species in malaria-hyperendemic settings of Africa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diversity of Anopheles species in the GMS and the lack of knowledge about their bionomic characteristics complicate efforts to delimit, restrict and disrupt malaria transmission patterns in this region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the predominantly outdoor-biting and outdoor-resting behaviors of these mosquitoes undermine vector control strategies that rely on indoor interventions, such as insecticide-treated bednet use and indoor residual spraying17, placing the burden of malaria control primarily on clinical interventions that have repeatedly failed owing to drug resistance19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  dirus is believed to be the primary malaria vector in Cambodia, and other species including An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  minimus, An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  maculatus and An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  barbirostris are considered secondary vectors, the current roles of these vectors in transmitting malaria have not been adequately defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To investigate the current transmission dynamics of P. falciparum, we produced gametocytes from parasite clinical isolates that displayed ART resistance or sensitivity in patients6,11,12 and in vitro13,14, and used them to infect native and non-native mosquito vectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that contemporary ART-resistant isolates from Cambodia develop and produce sporozoites in two Southeast Asian vectors, An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  dirus and An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  minimus, and the major African vector, An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  coluzzii (formerly An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  gambiae M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of ART-resistant parasites to infect such diverse anophelines, combined with their higher gametocyte prevalence in patients9, may be contributing to the rapid expansion of these parasites in Cambodia and other GMS countries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings pose serious challenges to eliminating ART-resistant malaria from Southeast Asia and preventing its spread to Africa.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Despite the alarming potential of ART resistance spreading throughout the GMS and to Africa, we still do not know whether Cambodian founder populations can infect major Southeast Asian malaria vectors or An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  coluzzii and An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  gambiae23, the two major African vectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address these knowledge gaps, we used a standard membrane feeding assay to assess whether nine Cambodian P. falciparum clinical isolates can infect five different Anopheles species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P. falciparum mosquito-infective gametocytes were induced and matured in culture for 2 weeks and fed to mosquitoes using glass feeders with an artificial membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fed mosquitoes were dissected 1 week later to evaluate oocyst infection of their midguts (a standard measurement of mosquito infection), and the salivary glands of a subset of these mosquitoes were examined an additional 1 week later for the presence of human-infective sporozoites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parasite isolates were tested in recently adapted colonies of An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  dirus from Pursat Province, Western Cambodia, and An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  coluzzii from Theirola, Mali; a long-term-adapted colony of An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  minimus from Western Thailand; and two long-term-adapted Anopheles stephensi Nijmegen and An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  gambiae G3 lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These latter two lines are commonly used in laboratory investigations because they are highly permissive to infection by multiple P. falciparum strains, a phenotype for which they were artificially selected decades ago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These five vector species are highly evolutionarily distinct, having diverged from each other more than 30 million years ago24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For mosquito infection experiments, we selected three parasites from the ART-sensitive core population (KH-C) in Ratanakiri Province, Eastern Cambodia, which carry the wild-type (WT) K13 allele, and six parasites from three ART-resistant founder populations in Pursat, which carry different mutant K13 alleles: WKH-F02/R539T (n=3), WKH-F04/Y493H (n=2) and WKH-F03/C580Y (n=1)11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of these isolates were previously found to be either ART sensitive or ART resistant in patients6, in vitro14 or both (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a single exception, all nine parasite isolates infected all five mosquitoes tested (Fig 1 and Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous studies of laboratory-based infections of Southeast Asian and African vectors with P. falciparum clinical isolates22,25,26,27, mosquitoes infected with our Cambodian P. falciparum isolates showed relatively low oocyst counts: one or two oocysts per infected midgut were typically seen, whereas more than five oocysts per infected midgut were uncommon and infection prevalence was usually  less_than 30% (Fig 1 and Supplementary Figs 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found no indication that any of the five mosquito lines were refractory to infection; that is, we did not observe melanized parasites in the midguts of non-infected mosquitoes or infected mosquitoes with low numbers of oocysts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Characteristics of Cambodian P. falciparum clinical isolates used to infect Anopheles species.Full size table', 'Figure 1: Infection of different Anopheles species by Cambodian P. falciparum clinical isolates.Three ART-sensitive parasites carrying WT K13 alleles (KH-C/WT) and six ART-resistant parasites from three Western Cambodian founder populations carrying different mutant K13 alleles (WKH-F02/R539T, WKH-F04/Y493H and WKH-F03/C580Y) were used to infect malaria vectors of Africa (An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  coluzzii) and Southeast Asia (An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  dirus and An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  minimus) in parallel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection intensity was measured by counting the number of parasite oocysts per mosquito midgut in individual mosquitoes 8 days after they were fed gametocyte-infected erythrocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each dot represents the oocyst count in a single mosquito midgut;

005, P=0.0137; 957, P=0.0300; 887, P=0.0021; analysis of deviance), there were significant differences in infection prevalence between An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  dirus, An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  minimus and An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  coluzzii (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only the effect for isolate 887, however, remained significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons (Padj=0.019).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a different set of isolates (010, P=0.0327;

permutation test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences in infection prevalence suggest that highly related parasites within a given founder population possess genetic differences that mediate differential infection of anophelines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When considering only infected mosquitoes, we found that no isolate showed a significant difference in oocyst intensity between An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  dirus, An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  minimus and An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  coluzzii (overall P=0.1651;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Collectively, our data indicate that all nine ART-resistant and ART-sensitive parasites readily infect and produce sporozoites in highly diverse Anopheles species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although infections with multiple independently reared colonies of each Anopheles species may be necessary to determine their species-specific susceptibility to these parasite isolates, our preliminary study has two important strengths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, all of the ART-resistant clinical isolates we studied were clonal members of founder populations, which are the most relevant sources of the parasites that initially emerged and subsequently spread in the natural setting of Western Cambodiathe epicenter of ART resistance in Southeast Asia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we tested two recently colonized vectorsAn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  dirus from Western Cambodia and An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  coluzzii from Malithat are arguably more relevant to the current potential spread of ART-resistant parasites in Southeast Asia and Africa, respectively, than the laboratory-selected, highly permissive An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  stephensi Nijmegen and An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  gambiae G3 lines that are commonly used in infection studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our data show that several contemporary parasite isolates from Cambodia differentially infect Anopheles species in a laboratory setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although elucidating the molecular basis of this finding requires further investigation, we have excluded a possible role for polymorphism in the Pfs47 gene (PF3D7_1346800), which was recently shown to mediate the differential infectivity of the NF54, GB4 and 7G8 P. falciparum strains in the An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  stephensi Nijmegen and An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  gambiae G3 lines28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All six ART-resistant isolates we tested possess the same Pfs47 haplotype (Fig 3 and Supplementary Table 1), the most common among 22 haplotypes identified in our recent collection of 516 Cambodian parasite isolates (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the three ART-sensitive isolates we tested share the same Pfs47 haplotype (Fig 3 and Supplementary Table 1), the third most common in our parasite collection (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Distribution of Pfs47 haplotypes among Cambodian P. falciparum clinical isolates.The Pfs47 alleles of 516 parasite isolates were genotyped against the 3D7 reference genome (ver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure identified 22 different haplotypes, which are listed in order of decreasing prevalence in our sample collection (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Pfs47 haplotypes of parasites from the core population of Eastern Cambodia (KH-C) and multiple founder populations of Western (WKH), Northern (NKH) and Northeastern (NEKH) Cambodia are indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The six ART-resistant isolates we used in our study belong to the WKH-F02, WKH-F04 and WKH-F03 founder populations (*), all of which possess the same Pfs47 haplotype 1 (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three ART-sensitive isolates we used belong to the KH-C/WT population (**) and have the same Pfs47 haplotype 3 (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that Pfs47 haplotype 1 is present in four of five ART-resistant founder populations, whereas all 22 Pfs47 haplotypes are present in ART-sensitive isolates (Supplementary Table 2).Full size image', 'As all nine parasites infected nearly every anopheline we tested, it is possible that these two Pfs47 haplotypes do not strongly restrict parasitemosquito compatibility in Cambodia and may not prevent the spread of similar isolates within Africa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As ART-resistant founder populations circulate in areas of high anopheline diversity, they may have been naturally selected on a genetic background of Pfs47 alleles (or other genetic determinants) that collectively confer the ability to infect most native anophelines and thus to efficiently spread.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As all ART-resistant founder populations possess either of the two most common Pfs47 haplotypes we have observed in Cambodia (Fig 3 and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2), the lack of Pfs47 polymorphism among our ART-resistant isolates may simply reflect founder effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because Pfs47 is in close proximity to K13 on chromosome 13 and thus is likely to be genetically linked with the K13 haplotype in founder populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, our finding that all five mosquito lines are susceptible to parasite infection suggests that native and non-native vectors are likely to be competent in transmitting ART-resistant and ART-sensitive P. falciparum populations beyond Cambodia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed studies of field-relevant parasites and vectors, including whole-genome sequence analyses of multiple Southeast Asian P. falciparum isolates11,12,30 and recently colonized Anopheles species24, will undoubtedly help unravel the complex genetic and behavioral determinants of malaria transmission in regions where vector species are poorly characterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding that highly differentiated ART-resistant parasites infect highly diverse Anopheles species unveils a significant unanticipated challenge to the elimination of malaria in Southeast Asia and the prevention of ART-resistant malaria in Africa.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
