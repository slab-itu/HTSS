Surprise disrupts cognition via a fronto-basal ganglia suppressive mechanism  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Surprising events markedly affect behaviour and cognition, yet the underlying mechanism is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprise recruits a brain mechanism that globally suppresses motor activity, ostensibly via the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of the basal ganglia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we tested whether this suppressive mechanism extends beyond skeletomotor suppression and also affects cognition (here, verbal working memory, WM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recorded scalp-EEG (electrophysiology) in healthy participants and STN local field potentials in Parkinsons patients during a task in which surprise disrupted WM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For scalp-EEG, surprising events engage the same independent neural signal component that indexes action stopping in a stop-signal task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the degree of this recruitment mediates surprise-related WM decrements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intracranially, STN activity is also increased post surprise, especially when WM is interrupted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that surprise interrupts cognition via the same fronto-basal ganglia mechanism that interrupts action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This motivates a new neural theory of how cognition is interrupted, and how distraction arises after surprising events.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Surprising events often interrupt our ongoing train of thought and lead to forgetting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By what mechanism does this happen?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we test the hypothesis that surprising events recruit a brain system for widespread suppression of both ongoing motor and cognitive representations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suppose this brain system is the same one that is recruited by rapid motor stopping, which implicates a fronto-basal ganglia network including the pre-supplementary motor area1,2, the right inferior frontal cortex3,4,5,6 and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of the basal ganglia7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hypothesis that surprising events recruit this same system to interrupt cognition (in this case, working memory (WM)) is motivated by several observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'First, a recent study10 showed that when surprising events occur during a reaction time task, they induce motor slowing by recruiting the same neural suppressive neural mechanism that is recruited by outright motor stopping in a stop-signal task (SST11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the neural suppressive mechanism for outright motor stopping in the SST has a broad effect on the skeletomotor system: stopping one motor effector in the SST leads to reductions of corticomotor excitability in other, task-unrelated effectors, even those that are at rest12,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, such broad skeletomotor effects also occur after surprising events, consistent with the fact that surprising events recruit the same suppressive system as outright motor stopping10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, recent behavioural studies have shown that motor stopping has effects even beyond the motor system, as it affects stimulus value16 and WM encoding17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On this basis, we surmise that the impact of surprising events on cognition could relate, at least partially, to the same broad neural suppressive mechanism that is actively recruited to interrupt motor activity (e.g., in the SST).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To test this hypothesis, we developed a task in which WM maintenance was occasionally interrupted by surprising events (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On each trial, participants encoded a string of consonants into WM, maintained it across a delay, and were then tested with a probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the WM probe was preceded by a sound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On 80% of trials, a standard sine-wave tone was played, with which the participants were familiar from practicing the task before the main experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in 20% of trials of the main experiment, a surprising birdsong segment was played instead of the standard tone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Behaviourally, we predicted that WM accuracy would be reduced following surprising tones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further predicted that tones leading to WM failures would be more surprising than tones that were followed by correct WM probes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Behavioural task details and results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) WM task diagram.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Stop-signal task diagram.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) WM task, behavioural data from the behavioural experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Left panel: WM accuracy by trial type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WM accuracy is reduced following surprising compared with standard tones (paired samples t-test, N=20, t(19)=3.5, P=0.0026 , d=0.78).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Right panel: Bayesian surprise values of surprising trials split by WM accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprise is increased for tones that interrupted WM (paired samples t-test, N=20, t(19)=2.14, P=0.045, d=0.77).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars denote s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) WM task, behavioural data from the scalp-EEG experiment, description as in c (WM accuracy: paired samples t-test, N=20, t(19)=2.3, P=0.033 , d=0.49;

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Behavioural experiment', 'Twenty healthy volunteers performed the WM task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On each trial, they encoded a letter string and held it across a variable delay period, the end of which was announced by either a standard or novel tone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three-hundred millisecond after the tone, participants were probed for WM accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As predicted, WM accuracy was reduced followed surprising compared with standard tones, with medium-to-large effect size (paired samples t-test, N=20, t(19)=3.5, P=0.0026, d=0.78, Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WM accuracy for the 2,200 ms interval was 77.9% for standard tones and 71.4% for novel tones; the significance test was based on that interval (WM accuracy for the three other intervals, which had standard tones only, was 75.1% for 1,700 ms, 76.5% for 2,700 ms and 75.3% for 3,200 ms).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, this reduction was related to the degree of surprise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that the level of surprise wore off as the task progressed (even though all birdsong segments were unique) allowed us to model the effect of highly surprising compared with less surprising events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The level of surprise was quantified trial-to-trial using a Bayesian algorithm that compared the posterior probability of a surprising tone (i.e., the probability of a surprising tone on all trials up onto and including the current trial) with the prior expectation of a surprising tone (i.e., the probability of a surprising tone on all trials up onto  but excluding  the current trial) using the KullbackLeibler divergence (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the models surprise values, we found that surprising tones that were followed by erroneous probes were more surprising than those preceding correct WM, also with medium-to-large effect size (paired samples t-test, N=20, t(19)=2.14, P=0.045, d=0.77, Fig 1c), which shows that WM failures in this task were directly related to the degree of surprise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Source-level EEG experiment', 'We then tested whether a neural suppressive process recruited by surprising events could explain the WM failures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 20 new healthy volunteers, we recorded EEG for the WM task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first replicated the behavioural pattern that WM accuracy was reduced followed surprising compared with standard tones (paired samples t-test, N=20, t(19)=2.3, P=0.033 , d=0.49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WM accuracy for the 2,200 interval was 80% for standard tones and 75.4% for novel tones; the significance test was based on that interval (WM accuracy for the three other intervals, which had standard tones only, was 80.6% for 1,700 ms, 81.3% for 2,700 ms and 81.7% for 3,200 ms).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, surprising tones that were followed by WM failures were more surprising (paired samples t-test, N=20, t(19)=2.6, P=0.019, d=0.91).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the WM task, in the same session, we also recorded EEG during a version of the SST.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the SST (Fig 1b), on each trial, participants initiated a response, which they had to try to rapidly stop if a visual stop signal occurred (this happened on 33% of trials).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stop-signal delay was adjusted online to ensure that stopping was sufficiently difficult23 and that successful and failed stop trials were of equal frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The behavioural pattern was typical for healthy young volunteers: The probability of successful stopping was 0.5, owing to the online adjustment of the stop-signal delay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correct-go reaction time (RT) was 485 ms, and failed stop RT was significantly faster at 403 ms, as required by the race model of stopping11 (paired samples t-test, N=20, t(19)=12.81, P=8.5 × 1011 , d=2; correct-go RT was greater than failed-stop RT in all participants).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stop-signal reaction time (SSRT), which indexes the speed of the stopping process, was 237 ms.', 'In this experiment, we specifically used independent component analysis (ICA) to identify the brain source signal component that indexes successful motor stopping in the SST.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For present purposes, we call this the motor suppression-independent component (MS-IC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then aimed to investigate the activity of this MS-IC in the WM task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To achieve this, we computed an ICA on each participants combined EEG from both tasks (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ICA decomposes the scalp-EEG mixture into its underlying independent source signal components (ICs), each of which represents an independent neural process that contributes to the scalp-EEG mixture24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: EEG analysis schematic.The combined EEG from the WM task and the SST were subjected to ICA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One IC that represented the process underlying successful stopping in the SST was selected per subject.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activity of that component in the WM task was then analysed in three separate ways: by showing that its activity was increased following surprising tones in the WM task, by showing that its activity was correlated with the trial-by-trial effects of surprise on WM accuracy, and by showing that its activity positively mediated between the surprise of the tone and accuracy on the WM probe.Full size image', 'Crucially, the ICA logic allows us to test whether motor suppression in the SST and surprise-related activity in the WM task are independent processes or not: if motor suppression in the SST and surprise-related activity in the WM task are separable brain processes generated by independent sources, ICA on the combined data of both tasks will disentangle them into two separate ICs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this scenario, any IC that is exclusively related to either motor suppression or surprise will show activity related to only one of the two events (i.e., successful stopping in the SST or surprising tones in the WM task).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, any IC that is selected based on its activity related to one task event (e.g., successful stopping) but also shows significant activity following a different task event (e.g., surprising tones) must reflect activity of a common, non-separable brain mechanism represented by the same neural source (for other studies that use this inferential logic see refs 10, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29; for a review of the technique, see ref 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that this is not a null hypothesis test: this logic tests the alternative hypothesis that an independent component selected based on one type of experimental event also shows significantly increased activity following another, independent type of experimental event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it involves a purely data-driven procedure, in which an independent component is identified based on one part of the data (SST), and then investigated with respect to its activity on a separate part of the data that was not part of the selection process (WM task).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, it allows us to test a specific hypothesis about the involvement of a clearly circumscribed neural process, in the absence of any variance related to processes that are unrelated to our a priori hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To apply this logic to our data set, we identified one source-level IC for each participant that represented the fronto-central P3-ERP (event-related potential) induced by the stop signal in the SST (see Supplementary Fig 1 for complete ERP plots).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior research has shown that this ERP specifically indexes the motor suppression process in the SST: its onset occurs in the precise time window when motor suppression is implemented30, correlates strongly with the speed of stopping (a large sample of N=62 revealed correlations between P3 onset and SSRT in excess of r  greater than 0.618), and occurs earlier on trials on which stopping is successful18,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the neural generators of this fronto-central component have been shown to be independent of other neural processes that are involved in the stop-signal task, such as those that reflect the attentional detection of the stop signal19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We selected one IC per subject that reflected this ERP (see Methods section), which we denote the MS-IC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate our MS-IC selection, we ensured that the onset of these selected source-level MS-ICs in our current data set showed the same tight relation to the success of stopping as prior studies (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, in line with prior studies18,31, the onset of the MS-IC P3-ERP occurred significantly earlier on successful stop trials compared with failed stop trials (paired samples t-test, N=16, t(15)=3.62, P=0.003, d=0.77, Fig 3b), and was positively correlated with SSRT across participants (r=0.36, P=0.06, one-sided, Fig 3c; outliers were diagnosed based on Cooks d greater than 1, no outliers were present in the sample).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Source-level EEG results for the stop-signal task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) ERP back projection into channel space at components centre of gravity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inset: average topographical IC projection in channel space (rectified to show positive at FCz).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) MS-IC ERP onset on successful and failed stop trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Points represent participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four participants had no significant P3-ERP on failed stop trials (i.e., plot shows N=16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Points below the grey identity line demarcate participants whose MS-IC onset was earlier on successful compared to failed stop-signals (paired samples t-test, N=16, t(15)=3.62, P=0.003, d=0.77), which illustrates the relation of the MS-IC EEG activity to the speed of stopping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Correlation between MC-IC ERP onset on successful stop trials and SSRT in N=20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dashed line denotes least squares fit (r=0.36, P=0.06).Full size image', 'Following the MS-IC selection in each participant, we investigated its activity in the WM task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, all the following analyses were performed on EEG source space, i.e., on independent component activity instead of scalp channel activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized, based on our prior study10 that the MS-ICs would be engaged following surprising events, indicated by increased 113 Hz activity within MS-ICs on surprising versus standard tones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was indeed the case here (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, in line with our prior study10, we argue that the motor suppression process indexed by the MS-IC is active following surprising events (note that the MS-IC cannot reflect a process that is solely related to the surprise or infrequency of the tones, as it was identified based on its differential activity on successful versus failed stop trials in the SST.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stop-signals are not surprising, and successful and failed stop trials occur with equal frequency).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Source-level EEG results for the MS-IC WM task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) MS-IC ERSP following surprising versus standard tones in the WM task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant areas highlighted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plot shows increased MS-IC activity for surprising tones in the WM task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) MS-IC single-trial GLM results from the WM task;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We tested whether a putative fronto-basal ganglia suppressive mechanism involved in motor stopping is recruited to interrupt cognitive activity (here, specifically, verbal WM) following surprising events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a first experiment, we developed a behavioural paradigm in which surprising events led to WM failures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a second experiment, we used source-level EEG to isolate a brain component that (we argue) reflects motor suppression in the SST.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results show that this same brain component was engaged when surprising events occurred during WM maintenance, and they furthermore suggest that its activity mediated the negative influence of surprise on WM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was further corroborated by the third experiment, where we recorded LFPs through intracranial depth electrodes from the STN of the basal ganglia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed that activity in this key subcortical node of the motor suppression network was increased following surprising tones across several frequency bands, including the beta band, which has previously been proposed to be especially important for motor suppression8,9,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, STN gamma activity was increased when highly surprising tones were followed by WM failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This modulatory gamma-band activity occurred within 150 ms following the tone, consistent with the timing of the broad corticomotor suppression that also occurs at 150 ms after surprising events10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We interpret these results as showing that a fronto-basal ganglia neural suppressive mechanism that broadly affects motor representations also affects cognition (here, verbal working memory).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings widen the scope of a well-characterized neural system for motor suppression, provide new links between the literatures on response inhibition, working memory, surprise and attention, and also provide a mechanistic account of one type of distraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A key question is whether the motor stopping independent component (MS-IC) we identified in the SST truly reflects motor suppression, or rather low-level perceptual processing or attentional detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While all of these three candidate processes are necessary for successful stopping in the stop-signal task, we argue that the MS-IC specifically reflects the suppressive process, i.e., the last process in this chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is based on the following reasoning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the neural mechanism reflected in the MS-IC cannot be low-level stimulus perception, since the MS-IC was active following both visual stop-signals and unexpected tones, which occurred in different sensory modalities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This leaves higher-level attentional detection and response suppression as candidate processes indexed by the MS-IC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MS-IC was selected from our stop-signal data to reflect a fronto-central slow-wave (P3) potential, which has two key properties, as shown in previous studies and the current study (see refs 18, 31, and Fig 3): its onset occurs earlier for successful compared with failed stop trials and it correlates with SSRT across subjects (SSRT marks the end of the stopping process).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have also shown that the onset of this fronto-central slow-wave component occurs in the time period immediately preceding SSRT (i.e., 1020 ms before SSRT18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to an influential model of the SST, this very late timing is a key characteristic of the motor suppression process30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the late onset of this neural process in relation to SSRT makes it difficult to conceive that an additional process could realistically occur between this neural process and SSRT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet this would be necessary if the fronto-central slow-wave potential indexed attentional detection instead of motor suppression, since in that case, the actual motor suppression has yet to happen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, these considerations strongly support our assertion that the MS-IC represents motor suppression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further corroborating evidence comes from another study19, which showed that the fronto-central slow-wave potential explained gradual motor suppression in a complex visual stop-signal task, while attentional detection of a stop-signal, on the other hand, was indexed by a different independent signal component (a posterior component with a spectral peak in the alpha band).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shows that attentional detection maps onto an independent process that is markedly different from the fronto-central low-frequency potential we investigate in our current study, and is likely explained by a more posterior process with a different frequency characteristic (most likely in the alpha-band33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The foregoing argues that the MS-IC component reflects motor suppression, and wider aspects of the data suggest the motor suppression process is responsible for the cognitive interruption observed here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where does this leave stimulus-driven attention and attentional re-orienting, which also surely occur after unexpected tones in the WM task?34,35,36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this, we consider the relative timing of the individual processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown that surprising tones can be perceptually detected in sensory areas as early as 50 ms after tone onset38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies with single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (which has a time resolution at the millisecond level) have shown that the suppressive mechanism is active chronologically after this initial stage of low-level perceptual detection, namely, around 150 ms after the onset of the surprising tone10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, that study also showed the suppressive effect was transient, i.e., suppression was not observed at 175 or 200 ms post-tone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the timing of the suppressive mechanism occurs well-before signatures of top-down attentional re-orienting, which usually emerge around 250300 ms after a surprising event39,40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we propose the following model of how surprising events influence behaviour and cognition: After the initial perceptual detection of surprise (stimulus-driven attention, reflected in activity of early sensory areas), suppression is broadly exerted on both ongoing action and cognition (at least the verbal WM form of cognition studied here).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This momentary suspension of ongoing cognitive and motor activity is then followed by attentional re-orienting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suppose the suppressive mechanism has a useful function here, namely aiding the cognitive system to initiate an interrupt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could enable a disengagement from ongoing motor and cognitive processes, in favour of enabling the rapid processing and evaluation of the surprising event (following an attentional shift).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model implies a quite different perspective from usual on attentional re-orienting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, re-orienting is only done after an interruption induced by a suppressive mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fits a recent proposal that attention is more of an effect than a cause42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More generally, this model also has implications for understanding disorders of distraction, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (in which perhaps the interruption is recruited too readily), and disorders of cognitive inflexibility, such as Parkinsons disease (in which perhaps the interruption does not occur readily enough).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By what neurobiological mechanism did the putative-STN-mediated response suppression system influence cognition in this study?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Much research suggests that motor suppression is implemented via a hyperdirect pathway from frontal areas to the STN of the basal ganglia, which then activates GPi and suppresses thalamocortical drive43,44,45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The broad skeletomotor suppression that occurs for outright stopping12,13,14,15 could reflect the putative divergent innervation of the GPi by the STN, for which there is some evidence from neuronal tracing studies47,48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The engagement of this mechanism may also explain the broad skeletomotor suppression that occurs after surprising events10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that surprising events also interrupt cognition via the same brain mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility is that the STN-mediated impact on GPi is so divergent as to also interrupt WM information that is putatively maintained in the associative cortico-basal ganglia loop50,51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note however, that while this theory fits speculation that the STN has a massive impact, being at the nexus of motor, limbic and associative processing53,54,55, there is no direct evidence to our knowledge that one part of the STN can have such a divergent projection as to affect truly different sectors of the GPi (i.e., motor and associative).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, perhaps there is a divergent influence from STN to the motor GPi, enough to interrupt all motor-related processing, including, in this study, verbal WM, which is a form of cognition that is also motor based, being dependent on the language system56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another possibility is that surprising events recruit several cortical areas that then project to different sectors of the STN (motor and associative), thus resulting in a broad suppressive effect (each one of the projections to the STN could then result in a relatively broad impact of that part of the STN on motor or associative sectors of GPi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Either way, our study provides evidence for a functional recruitment of the STN by surprising events, and it argues that this activity mediates the influence of surprise on cognition, although we warrant that exactly how this is done awaits further research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also warrant that our hypothesis-driven ICA approach was non-exhaustive, i.e., it does not provide a complete picture of all commonalities and differences between surprise processing and action stopping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we focused from the outset on an IC that putatively reflects motor suppression, and tested whether its activity mediates the influence of surprise on WM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We acknowledge that there could be other surprise-related processes that we did not investigate here, which could further mediate or moderate this relationship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Still, our results suggest that the same suppressive mechanism recruited to stop action is recruited by surprise to disrupt WM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future research is necessary to provide a more complete picture of the neural processes, and also to provide causal evidence that the putative-STN-mediated effect is responsible for the WM decrement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, surprising events manifest the same brain signature as outright stopping, and this mediates the effect of surprise on WM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suppressive mechanism could interrupt thalamocortical processes in the same way it interrupts action, and allow the cognitive system to disengage from both behaviour and cognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such an interruption of ongoing cognition could facilitate (or even be necessary for) attentional re-orienting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This motivates a new neural systems theory of distraction, which is grounded in a cortico-basal ganglia network that underlies motor suppression, and can also affect cognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results broaden the scope of a well-characterized neural system for suppression, and they provide a critical link between response inhibition, working memory, surprise, and attention.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
