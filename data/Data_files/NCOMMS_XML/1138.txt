Instructing cells with programmable peptide DNA hybrids  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The native extracellular matrix is a space in which signals can be displayed dynamically and reversibly, positioned with nanoscale precision, and combined synergistically to control cell function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe a molecular system that can be programmed to control these three characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this approach we immobilize peptide-DNA (P-DNA) molecules on a surface through complementary DNA tethers directing cells to adhere and spread reversibly over multiple cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DNA can also serve as a molecular ruler to control the distance-dependent synergy between two peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we use two orthogonal DNA handles to regulate two different bioactive signals, with the ability to independently up- or downregulate each over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This enabled us to discover that neural stem cells, derived from the murine spinal cord and organized as neurospheres, can be triggered to migrate out in response to an exogenous signal but then regroup into a neurosphere as the signal is removed.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The environment of a cell is heterogeneous and dynamic, providing both structural and biochemical support.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the extracellular matrix (ECM) controls the dynamics, spatial positioning, and combinatorial synergies of signals in order to direct cell behaviour1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Artificial forms of this matrix for tissue regeneration need to recapitulate these three characteristics in a single system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most efforts in this area have effectively addressed only one of these three key phenomena, and focused mainly on static cell adhesion3 or irreversible switching of bioactivity4,5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, all of these systems have been designed to respond to one stimulus and promote one predefined cellular response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To better mimic the multi-responsive nature of the native ECM it is therefore necessary to design materials that are able to respond to multiple signals orthogonally and reversibly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA is a good candidate for anchoring bioactive signals to a substrate and mediating their interactions with cells due to its highly programmable nature, as highlighted in three recent reports that used WatsonCrick pairing as a molecular tension probe to measure integrin forces during cell adhesion8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work also utilized DNA hybridization to immobilize cells on surfaces11,12,13, and as an interesting approach to cluster cells in vivo14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we describe the use of DNA to dynamically control and spatially arrange multiple bioactive signals in order to mimic the features of the extracellular matrix in a single system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this approach, a peptide-DNA (P-DNA) molecule is immobilized on a surface through complementary DNA tethers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By engineering a series of tethers responsive to different stimuli, we show that cells can adhere and spread on the surface reversibly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of P-DNA in cell signalling allows multiple cycles of reversibility by simply adding soluble biologically compatible molecules such as DNA and enzymes, without the need for external stimuli like photons or electrochemical potentials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DNA can also be used as a molecular ruler to control the spacing between two adhesion peptides, or to tether both growth factors and bioactive peptides simultaneously in order to explore synergistic effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, by designing orthogonal DNA handles we were able to selectively and reversibly present two different peptide signals (a differentiation signal for neural stem cells and a growth factor-mimetic signal for their proliferation) with the ability to independently up- or downregulate each over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This enabled us to discover that neural stem cells organized as neurospheres derived from the postnatal murine spinal cord can be triggered to migrate out driven by the differentiation signal and then regroup as the signal is switched off.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenomenon was observed over multiple cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reveals for the first time that strong cellcell interactions persist in neurospheres to a degree that can reverse their migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, with this capability in hand, one can follow not only the phenotype of cells during these dynamic processes, but also their accompanying re-organization within the neurosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This platform presents an attractive model to study the important role cellmatrix interactions play within the stem cell niche and provides new avenues for developing rationally designed dynamic regenerative biomaterials.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Synthesis and bioactivity of peptide DNA modified surfaces', 'In the P-DNA platform, a peptide or protein is covalently linked to a DNA tether, resulting in a conjugate we term the bioactive strand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strand is then immobilized on a solid surface through a complementary DNA, which we term the surface strand (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells are plated on the modified surface and their membrane receptors interact with the bioactive strand to influence cell behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To promote cell adhesion, we attached the peptide RGDS15 (derived from fibronectin) to ssDNA using copper-free click chemistry16 (for a list of all DNA sequences used, see Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting RGDS-DNA conjugate (Fig 1b) was purified using reverse-phase HPLC and both polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and ESI-MS analyses confirmed its identity and high purity (Fig 1c; Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RGDS P-DNA was then hybridized to the complementary surface strand covalently linked to an alginate-coated glass surface7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We selected alginate due to its biocompatibility and its ability to resist cell adhesion while being easily modified with amine-functionalized DNA strands (see Supplementary Figs 2 and 3 for synthesis and characterization of surfaces).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Cell adhesion on RGDS P-DNA modified surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic representation of fibroblast adhesion and spreading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Chemical structure of RGDS P-DNA (DNA strand is represented schematically in red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of RGDS P-DNA: lane 1, molecular weight ladder, lane 2, unmodified DNA, lane 3, purified DNA-RGDS conjugate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Confocal microscopy images of fibroblasts 24 h after being plated on either RGDS P-DNA or alginate surfaces, (e) scanning electron micrographs of fibroblasts 24 h after being plated on either RGDS P-DNA or alginate surfaces .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars for fluorescent images; 20 m and for micrographs: 50 m.

Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, cells plated on RGES did not demonstrate any increase in cell area, again confirming the bioactive role of the peptide (Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether cell binding and spreading was mediated by RGDSintegrin activation, we used antibodies to block the relevant integrins (51, v3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions we observed poor attachment of cells and no spreading, indicating that bioactivity induced by the RGDS surfaces relies upon integrin engagement (Fig 1hj).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Reversible control of bioactivity', 'We next investigated the reversible switching of bioactivity using the unique properties of DNA to emulate the dynamic nature of ECMs in biological systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have used strategies like enzymatic cleavage5, thermoresponsive polymers18, electroswitching19, photocleavage4,20,21,22, photoisomerization20 or host-guest displacement6,7 to dynamically control cell adhesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of these approaches, however, are limited to one bioactive signal and rarely offer reversibility over multiple cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, using DNA as a functional tether allowed us to present and remove the bioactive signal in a programmable and highly reversible manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To control the bioactivity of the peptide we introduced a short single-stranded sequence (referred to as a toehold) into the bioactive strand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adding a fully complementary DNA trigger to the bioactive strand enables its removal from the surface using a mild process and in programmable manner, while regenerating the surface strand for binding a second P-DNA molecule (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We define the ON state as one where the RGDS epitope is functional, resulting in cell spreading, and the OFF state where the signal is removed or is otherwise inaccessible, which should inhibit spreading (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first analysed the kinetic response of the OFF state upon addition of the DNA stimulus (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the initial ON state cells were allowed to spread for 2 h (Fig 2d,e), and after addition of the displacement strand the cells reverted back to the area of cells on the unmodified surfaces (and some of the cells detached from the surface).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strand displacement required to transition between the ON and the OFF states is extremely fast (in the order of a few minutes) compared to the time it takes cells to react to the change of state (Supplementary Figs 6g and 7f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This dynamic behaviour was also followed by live cell time-lapse videos showing the dynamic response of the same cells to the presentation and subsequent removal of the RGDS signal (Supplementary Movies 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Dynamic reversible switching of cell bioactivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic representation of toehold-mediated strand displacement system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Engineering a toehold into the bioactive strand allows its removal by a fully complementary displacement strand, thus switching bioactivity OFF; this process regenerates the surface strand, allowing for a second addition of the RGDS-DNA to turn bioactivity back ON.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process can be repeated for multiple cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Three dimensional shadow projection image of confocal sections of fibroblasts on surfaces where RGDS was displayed (ON state after 2 h), and then removed using strand displacement (OFF state after 3 h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Representative time lapse images of fibroblasts on surfaces in the ON and OFF states (phase contrast).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar: 10 m.

Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We varied N to span both larger and smaller distances than the native separation of the signals in fibronectin (5 nm), and calculated the distance (d, in nm) using FRET with a donor and acceptor pair in place of RGDS and PHSRN, respectively (Fig 3b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed the greatest distance-dependent synergy between RGDS and PHSRN at a separation of 5.4 nm as indicated by an increase in cell number by 46% and cell area by 25% after 17 h relative to surfaces with RGDS alone (Fig 3df).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At both shorter and longer distances this synergy was no longer observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, replacing RGDS with the non-bioactive peptide RGES did not promote a synergistic effect, confirming the specific bioactive role of the peptide and demonstrating that both RGDS and PHSRN signals are required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We point out that the 5.4 nm value closely resembles the natural distance between the two peptide epitopes in fibronectin, highlighting the utility of DNA for probing natural distance-dependent synergies in the ECM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, this experiment demonstrates how this capability could be used to optimize signal display by artificial scaffolds or surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Synergy between RGDS and PHSRN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) DNA surface strands with variable spacer regions were used to tune the distance between the peptide signals RGDS and PHSRN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Fluorescence resonance energy transfer traces for DNA constructs modified with donor (D) and acceptor (A) dyes to probe the distance between them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Relationship between N and the distance d as determined by FRET.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Confocal microscopy images of cells on indicated surfaces;

FGF-2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequential proliferation followed by migration and differentiation of neural stem cells can prove interesting for transplanted stem cells in a biomaterial to generate more cells and then allow them to migrate outwards to repopulate a lesion, for example in the case of spinal cord or brain injuries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Dynamic control over multiple signals and its effect on neural stem cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Surfaces modified with both red and green fluorescent strands bearing orthogonal toeholds, allowing the selective removal of either signal using its complementary displacement strand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Bright-field microscopy images of neural stem cells on surfaces bearing indicated signals at different time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar: 50 m.

Supplementary Movies 6, 7 and 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We quantified migration as the total area of neurosphere normalized to the largest inner circle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cellular migration from the neurosphere as well as neuronal differentiation is in agreement with previous reports investigating NSC response when exposed to laminin-1 (refs 34, 35, 36) or IKVAV-containing materials40,44,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presentation of the FGF-2 mimic peptide signal promoted proliferation of the cells, while maintaining the spherical nature of the aggregate (Supplementary Figs 13, 14 and 18a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is evident by the larger sizes of the neurospheres as well as the increased number of cells expressing ki67, a marker for proliferating cells46 (Fig 4b; Supplementary Figs 13 and 18a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At later time points (after 72 h) cell migration was also observed in these neurospheres (Fig 4b; Supplementary Fig 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By presenting both IKVAV and FGF-2 peptide signals we observed migration as well as proliferation (Fig 4b,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also confirmed that cells remained viable for at least 3 days when they were cultured on the different bioactive surfaces (Fig 4f; Supplementary Fig 18c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we found that the effects shown were specifically triggered by the bioactive peptide signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Substrates modified with surface DNA and treated with scrambled peptide sequences (scrIKVAV; scrFGF-2) resulted in poor cellular adhesion, similarly to cells plated on alginate, validating the specificity of the bioactive peptides (Supplementary Figs 15 and 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When neurospheres were plated on surfaces modified with two different peptides, a bioactive peptide signal and a scrambled one (IKVAV and scrFGF-2 or FGF-2 and scrIKVAV), the cells showed similar effects to the ones observed on surfaces modified with solely the bioactive peptide, further confirming the bioactive role of the peptide signal (Supplementary Fig 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next examined whether the IKVAV- and FGF-2- modified surfaces promote cell migration and proliferation through the 1-integrin and FGF receptor 1, respectively by following their expression by western blot analysis after 24 h (Fig 4i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1-integrin was highly expressed in cells cultured on IKVAV-modified surfaces as well as on laminin, while FGF receptor 1 was expressed only in cells plated on surfaces presenting the FGF-2 peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, when the FGF-2 peptide was displayed cells exhibited a higher expression of the phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK1/2), which is a downstream marker for the FGF-2 signalling pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also measured laminin expression in the various conditions in order to determine the effect of ECM proteins secreted by the cells on neural cell behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low levels of laminin were detected when IKVAV signal was displayed, while high expression of laminin was observed for the surfaces presenting solely the FGF-2 peptide signal (Fig 4i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results demonstrate that by altering the exogenous environment of NSCs, expressions of the ECM protein laminin and of 1-integrin within the neurosphere are modified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed (even after a short time point, 24 h) differences in the phenotypic profiles as well as their distributions throughout the neurospheres when comparing cells plated on IKVAV versus those exposed to the FGF-2 peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IKVAV signal triggered higher expression of differentiated neuronal (Tuj-1 positive) and astroglial (GFAP positive) cell markers whereas expression of the neural stem cell marker sox-2 was reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, FGF-2 promoted the opposite response, resulting in augmented production of immature cell markers and reduced levels of mature neural cell markers (Fig 4j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We utilized next the P-DNA platform to probe the dynamic presentation of the IKVAV and FGF-2 signals on neural cell behaviour (migration, proliferation, differentiation and organization) by displaying and removing each signal at defined time points using DNA-mediated strand displacement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, after cells migrated out of the neurosphere driven by IKVAV signal presentation (ON state), we observed a surprising regrouping of the cells into a neurosphere after the signal was removed (OFF state) (Fig 4c,d;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The P-DNA platform was able to induce reversible biological cell adhesion over multiple cycles, optimize at the nanometre scale the distance between two signals in the matrix for synergistic signalling of the cell, and probe the individual roles of two different localized signals in the matrix, a biological adhesion epitope and a growth factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the P-DNA strategy has enabled experiments in which neurospheres can be subjected to different temporally active signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allowed us to discover that once cells are triggered to migrate out of neurospheres, they remain engaged by cell-cell interactions that unexpectedly reverse their migration upon removal of the signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identifying the nature of these cell-cell interactions is however beyond the scope of this paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the capability to dynamically switch signals ON and OFF reversibly allowed us to follow the phenotype of cells during these dynamic processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This unprecedented observation on a neurosphere was uniquely enabled by our dynamic platform controlling the temporal presentation of the signals and would not have been possible by merely subjecting the cells to a persistent signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that the strategy described here to control dynamic bioactivity will open opportunities in the manipulation of cells and their phenotypes as signals are displayed reversibly with temporal control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The P-DNA technology is not limited to the display of peptide cues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since for many biological signals and matrix proteins such mimetic peptides are not available, this approach can also be adopted for the display of proteins by modifying the protein with a DNA tether, as exemplified in Supplementary Figs 10 and 11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the synthetic modification of proteins can potentially limit their activity or availability, these steps should be carefully optimized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, certain biological signals need to be internalized by cells in order to function effectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, our approach can be utilized to display specific binding ligands for proteins which will not require the modification of the proteins and will enable their internalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, the number of possible on-off cycles enabled by our approach may differ for various cell types for several reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the dynamic switching is driven by toehold-mediated strand displacement, leading to dissociation of a double-stranded waste product.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The accumulation of waste after several cycles may lead to a progressive loss in the switching efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, after extended time in culture, ECM matrix proteins secreted by the cells may limit the effect of the synthetic signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, DNA conjugated to peptides and proteins has great potential in the control of interactions between cells and their matrix environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our platform addresses the challenge of controlling the dynamics of bioactivity on synthetic scaffolds, an essential feature of extracellular matrix biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect this approach will uncover mechanistic information for crafting specialized environments that guide processes such as stem cell proliferation and differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Use of the P-DNA conjugates can be extended from surfaces to bulk materials of any chemistry, thus rendering them dynamic systems for cell signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the building blocks of P-DNA degrade into naturally occurring structural units and therefore will easily clear after a finite period of time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The programmability of DNA will also allow probing the effect of many different signals independently, as well as their synergies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, coupling this capability to the mature field of DNA micropatterning affords additional opportunities, such as single-cell resolution and high-throughput screening to discover the behaviour of cells in their niche.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, this platform has the potential to control dynamically the presentation of biological signals in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By modifying an implanted soft biomaterial with DNA handles, signals could be added or removed by injecting small molecules and allowing them to interact with the biomaterials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it should be possible to tune the in vivo microenvironment dynamically.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
