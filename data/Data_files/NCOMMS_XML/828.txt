Bacterial community dynamics are linked to patterns of coral heat tolerance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Ocean warming threatens corals and the coral reef ecosystem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, corals can be adapted to their thermal environment and inherit heat tolerance across generations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the diverse microbes that associate with corals have the capacity for more rapid change, potentially aiding the adaptation of long-lived corals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that the microbiome of reef corals is different across thermally variable habitats and changes over time when corals are reciprocally transplanted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exposing these corals to thermal bleaching conditions changes the microbiome for heat-sensitive corals, but not for heat-tolerant corals growing in habitats with natural high heat extremes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, particular bacterial taxa predict the coral host response in a short-term heat stress experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such associations could result from parallel responses of the coral and the microbial community to living at high natural temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A competing hypothesis is that the microbial community and coral heat tolerance are causally linked.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Bacterial microorganisms play important roles in shaping animal biology in many systems1,2,3, emphasizing the diversity and functional capacity of bacteria, and challenging our views on what constitutes a genome or an organism2,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, long-lived sessile stony corals are dependent on an endosymbiosis with photosynthetic algal symbionts in the genus Symbiodinium5 and, more recently, are shown to associate with a diverse set of bacteria that contribute important functions to the coral host6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coral animal and associated organisms together comprise the coral holobiont9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The composition of the coral holobiont varies across environments, which may entail coral host genomic10 and Symbiodinium community11,12 changes that influence the resilience of the coral holobiont to environmental stressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, changes in the bacterial community also represent an opportunity for a yet unexplored source of organismal adaptation that may occur within the reproductive lifetime of the host7,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, it remains unknown to what extent the microbial community may contribute to coral host resilience in a changing environment, for example, under ocean warming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Understanding and disentangling how the coral host and symbiont compartments interact and are affected by environmental change require a study system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a system can be found in the coral Acropora hyacinthus in the back reef pools of Ofu Island of the U.S. National Park of American Samoa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These back reef pools feature thermally distinct environments in direct vicinity that allow exploring the effects of the environment on coral holobionts without the confounding factor of site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, A. hyacinthus is a thermally sensitive cosmopolitan species with high prevalence on Pacific reefs15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies on A. hyacinthus in the back reef pools of Ofu Island could show that Symbiodinium communities differ between corals from two thermally distinct environments (i.e., a highly variable HV pool and a moderately variable MV pool), although under heat stress MV corals bleached irrespective of which symbiont type they harboured16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has been explained in part by contrasting genomic adaptation between corals from the HV and MV pool10,17, but the data also show strong acclimatization between the thermal environments after reciprocal transplantation18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, acclimatization of individual colonies after transplantation was not due to changes in intracellular symbiont genotypes18, but could have involved changes in other symbionts or associated microbes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with this, recent work has shown strong association of coral colonies with species-specific communities of typically 100s of bacterial taxa6,19, some of which might mediate sensitivity to environmental variation such as nutrient concentrations or perhaps temperature13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given the importance of bacteria to holobiont function1,2,3, we sought to investigate bacterial community composition and its potential role in contributing to thermal resistance of the coral holobiont.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do this, we conducted a long-term reciprocal transplantation experiment of A. hyacinthus corals at Ofu Island between the HV and MV pools, which experience strong differences in their absolute and daily temperature regimes, and assessed bacterial community changes as a result of transplantation to different environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, we assessed bacterial dynamics in a short-term heat stress experiment and how they differed as a result of prior residence in different thermal habitats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our study shows that bacterial community composition and underlying functional profiles associated with reef corals are different across thermally variable habitats and adapt to the new environment when corals are reciprocally transplanted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent exposure of these corals to thermal bleaching conditions changes the microbial community of heat-sensitive corals coming from a more stable, cooler environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, heat-tolerant corals from a highly variable, warmer environment frequently exposed to heat stress harbour a stable microbial community and bleached less.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect is irrespective of the origin of the corals and the coral genotype, but rather determined by the environment that transplanted corals where exposed to prior to the short-term heat stress experiment.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Host genetic adaptation10 and differences in the Symbiodinium community composition24 align with differences in thermal sensitivity in corals, yet the role of bacteria in coral thermal resilience is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies in other systems argue for a role of bacteria in conferring heat tolerance2 and disease resilience1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To begin to address this question for corals, we conducted a long-term reciprocal transplantation experiment of A. hyacinthus between two thermally distinct environments (i.e., a highly variable HV pool and a moderately variable MV pool) on Ofu Island, located in the U.S. National Park of American Samoa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Native coral colonies in the two pools had different microbial communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, after 17 months of transplantation, microbiomes of non-native corals transplanted into each pool adjusted to the new environmental conditions and were not significantly different from native corals in the same pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a short-term heat stress experiment, the microbial community responded within 20 h for corals that had been transplanted to a more stable, cooler environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But colonies living in the warmer, more variable environment for 17 months bleached less and maintained their microbial communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The robust and stable microbiome of corals from the highly variable HV pool was characterized by a consistent set of microbial taxa across all control and heat treatments that were not (or only rarely) present in the susceptible corals transplanted to the more stable, cooler MV pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'What remains to be determined is whether corals and microbes are solely responding to the same environmental changes, or whether differences in the bleaching response of the corals have a direct relationship to the differences in the associated microbiomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental replacement of obligate symbionts from corals in the HV pool to corals in the MV pool with a subsequent demonstration of acquired heat tolerance would ultimately demonstrate the effect of host-associated bacteria on host ecology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was recently shown for Aphids harbouring a single predominant bacterial strain2, but these methods are currently unavailable for corals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, while we did not transfer microbiomes between HV and MV corals, the long-term transplantation effectively resulted in HV corals harbouring an MV microbiome and MV corals harbouring an HV microbiome associated with higher and lower susceptibility to coral bleaching, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Taxonomy-based functional profiling of the distinct microbial communities of HV and MV corals provided insight into the associated cellular processes underlying the differences in the coral heat stress response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the differences in microbial community composition, functional profiles were different between HV and MV corals, with an enrichment of several protein functions related to carbohydrate metabolism in HV coral microbiomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These may represent signatures of bacterial heat tolerance, as indicated by the role of altered carbohydrate composition in the mucus of heat-stressed corals25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, an enzyme of Fucose, shown to undergo the largest increase of carbohydrates in coral mucus under heat stress25, was enriched in HV corals from our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found three additional proteins that are part of the Fructose transport system to be enriched in HV corals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of these results, carbohydrate transport and metabolism (for example, the enzyme fructose-1-phosphate kinase) are under strong regulation in Streptococcus mutans to cope with heat stress26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other enriched proteins that provide a link to increased thermal tolerance of bacteria in HV corals included the nitrogen-fixation protein NifW27, ferredoxin, a scavenger of reactive oxygen species that increases heat tolerance in Chlamydomonas28 and also in coral larvae29,30, and the bacterial chaperonin GroES, which is a homologue to Hsp10 and assists in correct folding of proteins under heat stress31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data support a functional restructuring of the microbial metabolic network in stress-resistant corals32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The identification of candidate bacterial indicator taxa that characterize the unchanged microbiome of heat-tolerant corals in the HV pool represents spatially explicit bacteria that are hypothesized to fulfil functional niches21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These bacteria remained stably associated even throughout the short-term heat stress experiment, and thus, they may contribute to the resilience of the coral holobiont to the challenging prevailing temperatures in the HV environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison, corals in the MV pool had no consistently distinct associated bacterial taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, we found heat-associated changes in the microbiome of MV corals characterized by bacterial taxa that were previously recorded in diseased or stressed marine organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Integrating the results of the different analyses, Alphaproteobacteria were responsible for a large fraction of the functional enrichment in the HV pool, with the family Rhodospirillaceae and the genus Inquilinus as prevalent contributors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation relates well with the significantly higher abundance of Rhodospirillaceae in the HV pool and the identification of indicator bacteria from the genus Inquilinus in the HV pool, and thus suggests a possible role of Rhodospirillaceae in the thermal tolerance of the corals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Encountering the bacterium Inquilinus in the heat-tolerant corals may seem unusual, because it has been initially isolated from the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far, Inquilinus has very rarely been reported from other environments33 and its putative role in corals requires experimental verification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, however, despite the arguably pronounced differences between both habitats, the human lung and the coral host are both mucous environments and Inquilinus is thermotolerant with a maximum cultivation temperature of up to 42 °C (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, Gammaproteobacteria were associated with more than half of the bacterial functional traits of corals in the MV pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main contributing families in the Gammaproteobacteria were Hahellaceae, containing the well-known coral symbiont Endozoicomonas19,35, and Alteromonadaceae, which was represented by strain BD2-13 and the genera Alteromonas and Glaciecola.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Members of Glaciecola are better known for their occurrence in polar regions and the cold adaptation of their genomes36, representing another link to the differences in thermal tolerance between the different environments of the HV and MV pools.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A third family of Gammaproteobacteria that comprises many disease agents and sources of virulence for corals, the Vibrionaceae, further contributed to the functional profile of microbial communities in the MV pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among them was Vibrio shilonii, a bacterium that has been associated with coral bleaching in the coral Oculina patagonica37,38, providing another possible connection to the higher incidence of bleaching of the MV corals during the heat stress experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the face of rapid climate change, long-lived sessile animals such as corals are considered particularly susceptible, and it is important to understand the mechanisms contributing to their resilience39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond physiological acclimatization18, host adaptation10,18, and assisted migration of heat-tolerant alleles40,41, microbial adaptation constitutes another possible mechanism to counteract the effects of environmental change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This idea is formulated in the coral probiotic hypothesis that posits a dynamic relationship between microorganisms and environmental conditions, which selects for the most advantageous coral holobiont13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data provide evidence for a community of microbes associated with coral thermal resilience patterns across variable habitats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, our analyses from spatially close, but different thermal environments emphasize the flexibility of coral microbiomes, even within the same coral species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data demonstrate that differences in coral microbial communities are largely independent of the underlying coral genotype, but rather align with the prevailing environment as corroborated by our long-term transplantation experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, microbiomes from a more stable cooler environment show a pronounced microbial change during bleaching conditions, while microbiomes from a highly variable warmer environment frequently exposed to heat stress maintain their original bacterial community composition throughout the heat stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result highlights that the response to heat stress differs with microbial community composition and potentially suggests a role of the bacterial community in the response of corals to heat stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the current data do not allow us to discern whether these microbial community differences influence host thermal resilience or are influenced by it, the observed patterns align well with the notion that microbial adaptation may constitute a fast response mechanisms of corals to cope with environmental changes.'
