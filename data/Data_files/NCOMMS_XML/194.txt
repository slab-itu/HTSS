Nickel supported on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes as hydrogen oxidation reaction catalyst in alkaline electrolyte  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The development of a low-cost, high-performance platinum-group-metal-free hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell is hindered by the lack of a hydrogen oxidation reaction catalyst at the anode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that a composite catalyst, nickel nanoparticles supported on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes, has hydrogen oxidation activity similar to platinum-group metals in alkaline electrolyte.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes are a very poor hydrogen oxidation catalyst, as a support, it increases the catalytic performance of nickel nanoparticles by a factor of 33 (mass activity) or 21 (exchange current density) relative to unsupported nickel nanoparticles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Density functional theory calculations indicate that the nitrogen-doped support stabilizes the nanoparticle against reconstruction, while nitrogen located at the edge of the nanoparticle tunes local adsorption sites by affecting the d-orbitals of nickel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to its high activity and low cost, our catalyst shows significant potential for use in low-cost, high-performance fuel cells.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The hydrogen economy provides an efficient and environmentally friendly pathway to store and consume energy1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fuel cells, especially the recently developed polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells, are considered as the most promising device to convert the chemical energy of hydrogen to electricity3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hydrogen fuel cells are based on two half-cell reactions: hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) at the anode and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, Pt is the most active catalyst for both HOR and ORR4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the commercialization of fuel cells is hindered by the high price of Pt ($50 g1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the total content of platinum-group metals (PGMs) in the state-of-the-art proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stacks has decreased significantly in the past decades, more than 0.137 gPt kW1 is still needed5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One promising approach to reduce the cost of fuel cells is to switch the operating environment from an acidic to a basic one (that is, a hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell, HEMFC), thus opening up the possibility of using PGM-free catalysts and other cheaper components6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the cathode of the HEMFC, some PGM-free and metal-free ORR catalysts have been developed that show comparable activity to Pt in alkaline media7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for the anode side, only a few PGMs (for example, Pt, Ir and Pd) show adequate activity11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HOR catalysed by Pt is very fast in acidic conditions so that a very low loading of the Pt catalyst could be used relative to the cathode side in PEMFCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the HOR activities of PGMs are 100 times slower in alkaline solutions11,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, a much higher loading of the HOR catalyst is required (0.4 mgPt cm2 in a HEMFC compared with 0.03 mgPt cm2 in a PEMFC) to achieve similar performance5,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is highly desirable to develop PGM-free anode catalysts for the HOR in alkaline electrolyte.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Unlike its reverse reaction (hydrogen evolution reaction, HER)15,16,17, only a few PGM-free HOR catalysts have been reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility is to use Raney Ni as the HOR catalyst in liquid alkaline fuel cells18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is functional only under very high alkalinity (6 M KOH) while the activity remains low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not catalytically active for a HEMFC, which can be mimicked as 0.11 M KOH21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Efforts have been made to improve the HOR activity of the Ni-based catalyst in the last decade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ni alloys, such as NiMo and NiTi, have been shown to enhance the HOR activity20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our recent work has also shown that electrochemically deposited NiCoMo on an Au substrate has a high HOR activity22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zhuang and co-workers decorated Ni particles with CrOx to weaken the NiO bond and stabilize the Ni catalysts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A HEMFC incorporating this PGM-free catalyst has been fabricated, and it exhibits a peak power density of 50 mW cm2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21) Although the power density is still low (compared with the peak power density of more than 1,000 mW cm2 for PEMFCs), it demonstrates the possibility to fabricate low-cost PGM-free fuel cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, their activities are still incomparable with PGM-based catalysts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the current study, we synthesize Ni nanoparticles supported on N-doped carbon nanotubes (Ni/N-CNT) by a wet chemical method, and the Ni/N-CNT shows a high HOR catalytic activity in 0.1 M KOH solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  N-CNTs are not only the support for the Ni nanoparticles, but also a promoter for the catalytic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to its special electronic properties, the N-doped carbon structure has been employed to enhance the catalytic activity of the methanol oxidation reaction and the ORR23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use N-CNT as a support for the HOR catalyst and demonstrate that, relative to Ni nanoparticles, the mass activity and exchange current density of Ni/N-CNT increases by a factor of 33 and 21, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand the interaction between the Ni nanoparticle and the N-CNT support, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are undertaken.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DFT calculations indicate that, when nitrogen dopants are present at the edge of the nanoparticle, the Ni nanoparticle is stabilized on the support and locally activated for the HOR because of modulation of the Ni d-orbitals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the volcano relationship between the HOR activity and the hydrogen adsorption energy, predicted first-principles exchange current densities of the model systems are in good agreement with the measured exchange current densities of the experimental catalysts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to its high activity and low cost, Ni/N-CNT has great potential to be used as the anode in HEMFCs, thereby finally bringing to fruition a high-performance and low-cost PGM-free HEMFC.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

a cuboctahedral geometry, exposing the {111} and {100} facets36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To model the nanoparticle, a 13-atom Ni nanocluster (Ni13) was chosen, as this was the smallest of the cuboctahedral magic numbers (a larger nanoparticle, Ni37, was also studied and is discussed below)37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the relatively large size of both the Ni nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes used experimentally, previous studies suggest that the curvature of the CNT support has a minimal effect38; as such, the CNT support is approximated with a graphene sheet to reduce the complexity of the

from either an electronic (that is, charge transfer) or a geometric (that is, relaxation) origin47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the strong binding sites, the nanocluster undergoes reconstruction as shown in Supplementary Fig 9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative contributions of the electronic and the geometric support effects are decoupled by considering a nanocluster which is treated as rigid during hydrogen binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a rigid nanocluster, any differences in the binding energies result from the differences in the electronic structure of the Ni13 nanocluster because of the support.

Ne-graphene).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Next, we examine what fundamental electronic properties of the Ni13 nanocluster are being affected by the support.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A commonly employed electronic descriptor for the binding energies on metal surfaces is the energy of the d-band centre, d, relative to the Fermi level, F (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The d-band centre describes the relative filling of the hybridized (ds) and antibonding (ds)* states of the NiH system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For an adsorbate, such as atomic hydrogen with a low-lying electronic state, the stabilization of the bonding states between the metal d-states and the hydrogen s-states decreases when the d-band of the metal is shifted up in energy (dF is more positive) because of the energy mismatch between the metal d-band and the hydrogen s-state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the resulting antibonding part of the band is pushed up just above the Fermi level, which leads to stronger binding between the metal atoms and the adsorbate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 4c, we see an upshift in the d-band centre of adjacent Ni-binding sites when an edge nitrogen atom is present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to these sites originally lying in the weak binding region of Fig 4a, the upshift in the d-band centre consequently activates these sites adjacent to Ne for the HOR by strengthening the binding energy by 0.1 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  XPS valence band spectra, which are related to the d-band centres, were also studied (Supplementary Fig 10)49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, while the geometric effect of the support is responsible for the decrease in strong binding sites, edge nitrogen further tunes local binding sites by modulating the electronic properties of Ni.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using the hybrid activity model for the HOR, we can now predict the intrinsic exchange current density of each of the model systems that were investigated (Supplementary Fig 11 and Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with experimental measurements, Fig 5 shows that an order of magnitude increase in the exchange current density is predicted for a graphene-supported nanocluster compared with an unsupported Ni catalyst.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional improvement occurs when doping the graphene support with nitrogen, where having nitrogen at the edge of nanocluster (that is, directly interacting with surface Ni atoms) appears to be more effective than having nitrogen at the centre of the nanoparticle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relating this discovery to the current experimental procedure, it is expected that edge nitrogen is predominant in the experimental material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because nitrogen doping is performed after the Ni nanoparticle was grown from the CNT surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is expected that only sites at the edge of the nanoparticle are available for nitrogen doping, and that lattice diffusion is the only mechanism by which nitrogen could be transported to the centre of the
