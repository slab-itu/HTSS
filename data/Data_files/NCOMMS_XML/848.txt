Strong electronic interaction and multiple quantum Hall ferromagnetic phases in trilayer graphene  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Quantum Hall effect provides a simple way to study the competition between single particle physics and electronic interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, electronic interaction becomes important only in very clean graphene samples and so far the trilayer graphene experiments are understood within non-interacting electron picture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report evidence of strong electronic interactions and quantum Hall ferromagnetism seen in Bernal-stacked trilayer graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to high mobility 500,000 cm2V1s1 in our device compared to previous studies, we find all symmetry broken states and that Landau-level gaps are enhanced by interactions; an aspect explained by our self-consistent HartreeFock calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we observe hysteresis as a function of filling factor and spikes in the longitudinal resistance which, together, signal the formation of quantum Hall ferromagnetic states at low magnetic field.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mesoscopic experiments tuning the relative importance of electronic interactions to observe complex ordered phases have a rich past1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While one class of experiments were conducted on bilayer two-dimensional electron systems (2DES) realized in semiconductor heterostructures, the other class of experiments focussed on probing multiple interacting sub-bands in quantum well structures2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is an increasing interest in the electronic properties of few-layer graphene3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 as it offers a platform to study electronic interactions because the dispersion of bands can be tuned with number and stacking of layers in combination with electric field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bernal/ABA-stacked trilayer graphene (ABA-TLG) provides a natural platform to observe such multi-subband physics as the band structure gives rise to monolayer-like (ML) and bilayer-like (BL) bands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of the multiple bands and their Dirac nature lead to the possibility of observing an interesting interplay of electronic interactions in different channels leading to novel phases of the quantum Hall state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we study the Landau-level (LL) spectrum on edge contacted ABA-TLG samples encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) flakes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe the coexistence of both massless and massive Dirac fermions in the form of parabolically dispersed LL crossing points at low magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At intermediate magnetic field we show that the LL fan diagram indicates that the electron-electron interactions lead to formation of symmetry broken spin and valley-polarized states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our self-consistent HartreeFock calculation supports the observed interaction enhanced LL gaps at the symmetry broken states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observe hysteretic transport showing the formation of quantum Hall ferromagnetic (QHF) states.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The crossing between NM=0 and NB=2 LLs gives rise to three ring-like structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calculated LL energy spectra near the topmost crossing (Fig 3e, inset) shows that spin splitting is larger than valley splitting for NB=2 LL but valley splitting dominates over spin splitting for NM=0 LL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that valley splitting of NM=0 is very large compared with other ML LLs; which arises because ML bands are gapped in ABA-TLG unlike in monolayer graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As one follows the NM=0 LL down towards B=0 one observes successive LL crossings of NM=0 with NM=2, 3, 4.....  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sharp abrupt bends in the fan diagram occur due to the change of the order of filling up of LLs after crossings and the fact that the horizontal axis is charge density (proportional to Vbg and not LL energy).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When these crossings are extrapolated to B=0, we see that NM=0 LL is valley split as expected from the LL energy diagram Fig 3a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Role of electronic interaction and theoretical simulation', 'We next discuss experimental signatures that point towards the importance of interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Observation of spin split NM=0 LL at B2 T cannot be explained from the non-interacting Zeeman splitting for 1.5 meV on electron side, estimated from the Dingle plot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the large ratio of transport scattering time  to quantum scattering time  indicates that small angle scattering is dominant, a signature of the long-range nature of the Coulomb potential22,23,24 (see Supplementary Fig 5 and Supplementary Note 5 for Dingle plot analysis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also measure activation gap for the symmetry broken states =2, 3, 4, 5, 7 at B=13.5 T, and find significantly higher gaps than the non-interacting spin-splitting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For =3 and 5, Fermi energy (EF) lies in spin-polarized gap of NM=0 LL in K and K+ valley respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measured energy gap at =3 is 5.1 meV and at =5 is 2.8 meV, whereas free electron Zeeman splitting is 1.56 meV at B=13.5 T (see Supplementary Fig 6, Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Note 6 for determination of LL energy gaps from Arrhenius plots).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that typically the transport gap tends to underestimate the real gap due to the LL broadening, so actual single particle gap might be even larger.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shows the clear role of interactions even with a conservative estimate of the LL gap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interaction results in symmetry broken states at low B that are QHF states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the data in Fig 3d, =2, 3, 4, 5 are QHF states for B greater than 5.5 T.

In fact the LLs associated with =3, 4, 5 after crossing are the same ML LLs which are responsible for =7, 8, 9 before crossing (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crossings result in three ring-like structures marked by plus, triangle and hexagon in Fig 3f.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Now we discuss theoretical calculations to show that electronic interactions are crucial in obtaining a quantitative understanding of the experimental data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The theoretical calculations focus on the NM=0 and NB=2 LLs, which form the most prominent LL crossing pattern in our data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of disorder is incorporated within a self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA)25,26, while electronic interactions are included by considering the exchange corrections to the LL spectrum due to a statically screened Coulomb interaction27,28 in a self-consistent way.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 4a shows the DOS at EF as a function of Vbg and B, which matches with the experimental results on the Gxx.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Theoretical calculation of DOS and spin polarization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) DOS at the Fermi level as a function of Vbg and B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This matches the fan diagram seen in the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) The magnetization in the system as a function of Vbg and B, where density is converted to an equivalent Vbg, described in Fig 2b caption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LL crossing regions clearly show the presence of spin polarization in the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inset shows calculated enhanced spin g-factor above the bare value 2 for NM=0 spin and valley split LLs.Full size image', 'Our calculations also provide insight about the polarization of the states inside the ring-like structures (Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that although the filling factor of region  is the same as that of regions =6 above and below, electronic configurations of these states are different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 4b shows the spin-resolved DOS at EF as a function of Vbg and B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find total spin polarization (integrated spin DOS) in region  is non-zero (see Supplementary Fig 7 and Supplementary Note 7 for the details of theoretical calculation), but it vanishes in regions =6 above and below the ring structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 4b inset shows the calculated exchange enhanced spin g-factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shows a significant increase over bare value of g in the spin-polarized statesin agreement with the large gap observed at =3 and 5 in the experiment.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The key role of interactions is also reflected in the hysteresis of Rxx in the vicinity of the symmetry broken QHF states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though QHF has been extensively studied in 2DES using semiconductors2,29 there are only a few reports of studying QHF in graphene30,31,32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our experiment, we vary filling factor by changing Vbg at a fixed B (Fig 5a) and observe that the sweep up and down of Vbg shows a hysteresis in Rxx, which can be attributed to the occurrence of pseudospin magnetic order at the symmetry broken filling factors34 (see Supplementary Fig 8 and Supplementary Note 8 for more hysteresis data).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Corresponding hysteresis is absent in simultaneously measured Hall resistance Rxy (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hysteresis in Rxx with Vbg is also absent without magnetic field (see Supplementary Fig 8 and Supplementary Note 8 for more detail).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pinning, that causes the hysteresis could be due to residual disorder within the system as the domains of the QHF evolve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along a constant filling factor =6 line (Fig 5c) transport measurements show an appearance of Rxx spikes around the crossing of NM=0 and NB=2 LLs (Fig 5d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possible explanation for the spike in Rxx (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  35) is the edge state transport along domain wall boundaries as studied earlier in semiconductors29,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Hysteresis in the longitudinal resistance as a function of the filling factor and observation of resistance spikes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Measurement of Rxx as a function of Vbg at B=13.5 T in the two directions as shown in (inset) the measurement parameter space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Largest hysteresis is seen for the spin and valley-polarized NM=0 LL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have done gate sweep as slow as 3 mV s1 to check if the hysteresis goes away, however, it stays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nature of hysteresis does not change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sweep up and sweep down rates were same.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Simultaneously measured Rxy that exhibits clear quantization plateaus in the two sweep directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) The laid white dashed line on the fan diagram shows the parameter space along which the Rxx is plotted in the next panel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Rxx plotted along the dashed line shown in the parameter space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spikes in resistance, shaded in yellow, correspond to boundaries of the region marked  in c.Full size image', 'In summary, we see interaction plays an important role to enhance the g-factor and favours the formation of QHF states at low B and at relatively higher temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ABA-TLG is the simplest system that has both massless and massive Dirac fermions, giving rise to an intricate and rich pattern of LLs that, through their crossings, can allow a detailed study of the effect of interaction at sufficiently low temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability to image these QHF states using modern scanning probe techniques at low magnetic fields could provide insight into these states that have never been imaged previously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In future, experiments on multilayer graphene, exchange coupled with a ferromagnetic insulating substrate37, can lead to the possibility of observing an exciting interplay of QHF with the proximity induced ferromagnetic order.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
