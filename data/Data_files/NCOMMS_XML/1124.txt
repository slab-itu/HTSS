Acylated heptapeptide binds albumin with high affinity and application as tag furnishes long-acting peptides  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The rapid renal clearance of peptides in vivo limits this attractive platform for the treatment of a broad range of diseases that require prolonged drug half-lives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An intriguing approach for extending peptide circulation times works through a piggy-back strategy in which peptides bind via a ligand to the long-lived serum protein albumin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with this strategy, we developed an easily synthesized albumin-binding ligand based on a peptide-fatty acid chimera that has a high affinity for human albumin (Kd=39 nM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ligand prolongs the elimination half-life of cyclic peptides in rats 25-fold to over seven hours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conjugation to a peptide factor XII inhibitor developed for anti-thrombotic therapy extends the half-life from 13 minutes to over five hours, inhibiting coagulation for eight hours in rabbits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This high-affinity albumin ligand could potentially extend the half-life of peptides in human to several days, substantially broadening the application range of peptides as therapeutics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Peptides combine a range of favourable qualities such as suitable affinity and selectivity, low inherent toxicity, and access to chemical synthesis which make them an attractive modality for therapeutic development1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many peptides with desired binding specificities and biological activities have been identified in organisms such as bacteria, fungi or plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peptides with tailored binding specificities can also be developed by in vitro evolution techniques such as phage display or mRNA display2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modularity of peptides, the large number of commercially available amino acid building blocks, and their compatibility with automated synthesis allow for fast development from lead structures to high-affinity ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A major obstacle remaining for developing peptides as therapeutics is their rapid clearance from the circulation due to proteolytic degradation and/or fast renal filtration through large pores of the glomeruli in the kidney.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This limits the development of peptide drugs that need to block targets over extended time periods such as enzyme inhibitors or receptor antagonists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While strategies exist for improving the stability of peptide leads, the fast renal clearance remains a great challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not surprisingly, most of the approved peptide drugs are agonists that act in minutes and thus do not need to linger in the body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To give some indication of the fast renal clearance of proteolytically stable peptide drugs, insulin, once in the blood stream has a half-life of 46 min4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hormone drug oxytocin has a half-life of 1015 min when applied intravenously5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A piggy-back strategy provides an attractive approach for prolonging the residence times of peptides in circulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this method, peptides are conjugated to ligands that bind serum proteins, such as albumin, with long plasma half-lives6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Albumin, for example, has a half-life of 19 days in humans, largely due to its size above the renal filtration threshold and its unique ability to interact with the neonatal FcRn receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is the most abundant protein in plasma, present at 40 mg ml1 (600 M)8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three peptide drugs containing albumin-binding fatty acids in their structures, insulin detemir, insulin degludec and liraglutide, are already used in the clinic9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insulin detemir is an insulin mutant to which the albumin-binding ligand myristic acid was appended.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The drug binds albumin with a Kd of 4.2 M (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adding the fatty acid slows absorption of insulin from the subcutaneous injection site, and its affinity for albumin extends the circulating half-life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conjugation of the same insulin mutant via a glutamic acid spacer to a fatty di-acid yielded the drug insulin degludec which has a 2.4-fold higher affinity for albumin and a further prolonged half-life12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Liraglutide is a GLP-1 peptide with a prolonged half-life due to the incorporation of a palmitic acid moiety13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the attraction of fatty acid conjugation, the relatively weak affinity for albumin and the low solubility of lipidated polypeptides in physiological solutions can be significant limitations14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small molecule albumin ligands resembling the structures of fatty acids were recently identified through compound library screening15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively to small molecules, peptide and protein-based albumin ligands were developed7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An albumin-binding 18-amino acid peptide developed by phage display, SA21 efficiently prolonged the half-life and the stability of a range of peptides in animal studies17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Limitations of the SA21 albumin-binding peptide include low solubility caused by the presence of many hydrophobic amino acids, its complex synthesis resulting from the long sequence, and the presence of a disulfide bridge17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this work, we set out to develop an albumin-binding ligand more in line with our needs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ligand would take into account previously mentioned limitations in areas such as albumin-binding properties, solubility, and ease of synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we aimed at engineering a ligand that has a high affinity for albumin with a Kd in the medium to low nanomolar range, has high solubility in physiological solutions, ideally at least 1 mg ml1 in PBS, and can efficiently be synthesized in conjunction with therapeutic peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Towards this end, we conceived a ligand design in which a fatty acid is conjugated to a short peptide via an amino acid side chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fatty acid alone should bind to albumin with an affinity in the low micromolar range and the peptide moiety should enhance this affinity by forming additional contacts to albumin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polar or charged amino acids, which would be favoured in the screening process, should also help to increase the solubility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peptide-fatty acid format provides for an efficient synthesis, as it can be added robotically during the solid phase synthesis of therapeutic peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By following an approach based on iterative rounds of modification of the peptide moiety and affinity testing by fluorescence polarization, we indeed identified a high-affinity albumin ligand that substantially prolongs the in vivo half-life of peptides.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

that the peptide-fatty acid format binds albumin with a low micromolar Kd, we synthesized heptapeptides of the sequence (F)-SSSKSSS-NH2 (where F is fluorescein) and conjugated one of three fatty acids to the lysine side chain (Supplementary Figs 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A fluorescein on the N-terminus enabled the measurement of the binding affinity for albumin by fluorescence polarization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heptapeptides carrying a myristic, palmitic or stearic fatty acid bound to human albumin with Kds of 1.9±0.2, 1.08±0.12 and 1.48±0.15 M, demonstrating comparable affinities to the therapeutic peptides insulin and GLP-1 acylated with fatty acids (Fig 1c)11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar affinities were measured when the binding assay was performed in human serum (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although all of the fatty acids demonstrated similar Kds for albumin, palmitic acid had the highest affinity and was the only one carried forward to future tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fatty acid is abbreviated Kpalm when conjugated to lysine in the peptide sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We then tested to what extent the peptide-palmitoyl tag reduces the solubility of peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As described above, poor solubility has been a major limitation of peptides tagged with fatty acids or the albumin-binding peptide SA21 (refs 14, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We synthesized the two well-characterized phage display-derived bicyclic peptides UK18 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19) and PK15 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20) as fusions with the peptide-palmitoyl tag GGGKpalmGGG or SSSKpalmSSS (Fig 1d and Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solubility in PBS dropped from 10 mg ml1 for both UK18 and PK15 to 0.22 and 0.68 mg ml1, respectively, with the GGGKpalmGGG tag and to 1.83 and 2.96 mg ml1, respectively, with the SSSKpalmSSS tag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large difference between the glycine- and serine-based tags indicated that the solubility is greatly influenced by the amino acid composition of the peptide and that it might be improved with suitable sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Improving the affinity of the heptapeptide-palmitoyl tag', 'To identify an amino acid sequence for the heptapeptide-palmitoyl tag that improves both the binding affinity for albumin and the solubility in aqueous solution, we devised the following iterative synthesis and screening approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variants of the lead structure (F)-SSSKpalmSSS-NH2 were synthesized wherein one of the six serine residues at a time was substituted to either W, Y, L, D, E or G (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These amino acids were chosen to the exclusion of the others because the presence of both hydrophobic and negatively charged groups are basic structural requirements for ligand binding to albumin21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The binding affinity for each of these peptides for human albumin was measured in triplicate by fluorescence polarization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The s.d.s generally fell below 15% of the Kd value which allowed detection of relatively small affinity improvements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variant with the best affinity for albumin was selected for the next cycle of amino acid substitution and affinity testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If several amino substitutions showed a similar affinity improvement, a change to D or E was preferred as a charged amino acid could enhance the solubility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All results being equal, E was chosen due to the propensity of D to isomerize to iso-Asp or to racemize to D-Asp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If different positions provided similar affinity improvements, the one closest to the lysine was fixed in order to evolve the peptide from the central palmitoyl anchor to the peptide ends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The iterative process of tag synthesis and affinity screening was repeated until optimal residues were found for all serine positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Evolution of peptide moiety of the tag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Six cycles of iterative heptapeptide-palmitoyl tag synthesis and affinity measurement are shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each cycle, the sequence of the starting peptide (for example, (F)-S1S2S3 KpalmS5S6S7) is shown together with its dissociation constant Kd for human albumin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One serine was substituted at the time to the indicated amino acids (W, Y, L, D, E and G) and the affinity of the different heptapeptide-palmitoyl variants are indicated in the boxes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dark blue or red shaded boxes indicate variants with the best binding affinities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variants in

#@NEW_LINE#@#  Average values of at least three measurements and s.d.s are indicated.Full size image', 'In the first cycle of synthesis and screening, six out of the 36 tag variants, all with D or E amino acid replacements, showed an approximately twofold improvement in binding affinity (greater than twofold improved Kds are highlighted in dark blue in Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We fixed E in position five (fixed substitutions carried through to further cycles are highlighted in red in Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the second cycle, six of the 30 variants of (F)-SSSKpalmESS-NH2 showed an approximately twofold improvement in binding affinity again in the substitutions to D or E. We fixed E in position three and varied the remaining four serine positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the third cycle, six out of the 24 variants of (F)-SSEKpalmESS-NH2 had an approximately twofold improved affinity, wherein three were substituted to W or Y, and three to D or E. We followed two paths for further optimizations, one by fixing E in position two (cycle 4a) and one by fixing Y in position two (cycle 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following path 4a, no large improvements could be achieved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, path 4b enhanced the binding affinity by nearly another factor two when any of the three serine positions were occupied by E. We subsequently followed three paths (cycles 5ac) and substituted the remaining two serine positions to Y or E. Two of the paths converged to the same best binder, delivering the sequence (F)-EYEKpalmESE-NH2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the last serine position, Y gave a slightly better affinity than E. This final ligand EYEKpalmEYE had a Kd of 39±3 nM and was thus 27-fold improved compared to the starting peptide-palmitoyl tag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evolved amino acid sequence did not share any homology with binding regions of natural albumin-binding proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The affinities of the best tag variants from each cycle were measured on the same assay plate using the same dilutions of albumin to exclude inaccuracies rising from the separate preparation of albumin solutions (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The graphic shows that the binding was improved by around a factor two in the first rounds of evolution, and that affinity enhancements decreased in the last cycles as we sharpened the affinity to the final peptide sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transferring the fluorescein in the final peptide EYEKpalmEYE from the N- to the C-terminus reduced the binding affinity several fold, which suggested that the fluorescein moiety is participating in the binding to albumin when attached to the N-terminus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the following characterization studies and applications, fluorescein is conjugated to the N-terminus, and the evolved peptide-palmitoyl tag (F)-EYEKpalmEYE is abbreviated to tag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In blood, fatty acids bound to albumin could potentially compete with the binding of the palmitoylated heptapeptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incubation of the evolved tag and best variants with human serum showed efficient binding in the context of fatty acids and other blood components (Fig 3a and Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To apply the tag in pre-clinical studies, it is necessary that it binds to the albumin of other species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence polarization assays with rat and rabbit albumin showed that the tag binds to the orthologous albumins with lower affinity (rat: Kd=220±30 nM, rabbit: Kd=320±40 nM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the best tag variants in the same assay showed that the binding to rat albumin was also improved in each evolution cycle but to a smaller extent (Fig 3a and Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Application of evolved tag to bioactive peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Binding of peptides from different evolution cycles to human and rat albumin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Average values and s.d.s of three measurements are shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Structures of tag-PK128 and tag-UK18 and their purity after automated synthesis and a single HPLC purification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Stability of tagged and non-tagged bicyclic peptide PK128 and UK18 in human plasma at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residual inhibition activities were quantified in protease activity assays using fluorogenic substrates of plasma kallikrein and urokinase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Average values and s.d.s of three measurements are shown.Full size image', 'Application of the evolved tag to bioactive peptides', 'We applied the tag to the bicyclic peptide PK128, an inhibitor of plasma kallikrein (Ki=300 pM)22 and to the bicyclic peptide UK18, an inhibitor of urokinase (Ki=53 nM)19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both protease inhibitors suffered from fast renal clearance upon previous tests in mice18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, PK128 has a poor stability in plasma (t1/2 human plasma=1.8±0.3 h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We synthesized the two peptides by appending the tag (F)-EYEKpalmEYE to the peptides N-termini during SPPS, spaced by a short polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescein was included in the tag for binding purposes as well as for the facile measurement of the Kd by fluorescence polarization and the detection of the tagged peptides in blood samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single step of purification by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) provided a 40% yield of tag-PK128 and tag-UK18 with 95% purity, reconfirming the high efficiency of the synthesis strategy (Fig 3b and Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two conjugates showed a solubility in PBS of 1.23±0.35 and 1.18±0.18 mg ml1, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The two tagged bicyclic peptides bound to human albumin with four to fivefold weaker dissociation constants than the tag alone (Kd tag-PK128=194±16 nM, Kd tag-UK18=168±13;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Lipidation is an established strategy for extending the circulation time of peptide drugs as showcased by the approved drugs insulin detemir, insulin degludec and liraglutide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all of these peptide drugs, fatty acids such as myristic or palmitic acid are appended to an amino acid within the peptide sequence itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be expected that the plasma half-life of these or other peptide drugs could be substantially prolonged by applying the concept of embedding the fatty acid into a peptide sequence that enhances the binding to albumin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies on fatty acid-modified insulin analogues and peptide-based albumin binders showed that a stronger affinity for albumin correlated with a prolonged half-life27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Herein, we demonstrate that a peptide sequence as short as seven amino acids (including the lipidated lysine) can improve the binding of a fatty acid conjugated to a peptide by 27-fold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peptide was evolved with a simple and efficient strategy based on six rounds of iterative amino acid substitution and affinity measurement, in which more than 150 heptapeptide-palmitoyl tags were tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, amino acids with negatively charged or hydrophobic side chains were essential for the increased binding affinity, although the specific sequence of these amino acids was also an important factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the four negative charges in the peptide, the tagged conjugates have a good solubility in aqueous solution, despite the long hydrophobic tail of palmitic acid, preventing solubility issues of the lipidated peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We showed that the tag can be appended conveniently to cargo peptides by automated synthesis on a standard peptide synthesizer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied the evolved tag to three bioactive peptides and presented that the conjugates bind with the desired affinity to both the peptides targets and albumin, and that the cargo peptides have an improved proteolytic stability over the non-tagged peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we demonstrated that the tag prolongs the circulation time of the peptides in rats and rabbits around 24-fold, reaching half-lives of 7 and 5 h. Application of the tag to a bicyclic peptide FXIIa inhibitor allowed efficient blockage of the intrinsic coagulation pathway in rabbits as long as eight hours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that the tag has a weaker affinity for rat and rabbit than for human albumin (five to sevenfold).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking this difference and allometric scaling considerations into account, it is likely that peptide drugs modified with the tag can achieve half-lives of more than one day in human.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If such conjugates are administrated as a depot, an even longer exposure may be reached.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'With this tag in hand, it should be possible to expand the application range of peptide therapeutics from the current mostly short-lived agents that act mainly as receptor agonists to long-acting peptide drugs that can also address targets that require actions over extended time periods, such as the inhibition of enzymes or receptors.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
