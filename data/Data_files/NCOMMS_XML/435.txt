Social inheritance can explain the structure of animal social networks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The social network structure of animal populations has major implications for survival, reproductive success, sexual selection and pathogen transmission of individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But as of yet, no general theory of social network structure exists that can explain the diversity of social networks observed in nature, and serve as a null model for detecting species and population-specific factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we propose a simple and generally applicable model of social network structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consider the emergence of network structure as a result of social inheritance, in which newborns are likely to bond with maternal contacts, and via forming bonds randomly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compare model output with data from several species, showing that it can generate networks with properties such as those observed in real social systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model demonstrates that important observed properties of social networks, including heritability of network position or assortative associations, can be understood as consequences of social inheritance.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The transition to sociality is one of the major shifts in evolution, and social structure is an important and ever-present selective factor, affecting both reproductive success1 and survival2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sociality affects individual health, ecological dynamics and evolutionary fitness via multiple mechanisms in humans and other animals, such as pathogen transmission4,5, and promoting or hindering of particular social behaviours6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The social structure of a population summarizes the social bonds of its members9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, understanding the processes generating variation in social structure across populations and species is crucial to uncovering the impacts of sociality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recent years have seen a surge in the study of the causes and consequences of social structure in human and animal societies, based on theoretical and computational advances in social network analysis10,11,12,13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new interdisciplinary network science provides many tools to construct, visualize, quantify and compare social structures, facilitating advanced understanding of social phenomena.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Researchers studying a variety of species, from insects to humans, have used these tools to gain insights into the factors determining social structure13,17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using social network analysis provided evidence for the effects of social structure on a range of phenomena, such as sexual selection20 structure and cultural transmission21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'At the same time, most applications of social network analysis to non-human animals have been at a descriptive level, using various computational methods to quantify features of social structure and individuals position in it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These methods, combined with increasingly detailed data reality mining23 about social interactions in nature, provided valuable insights about the complex effects of social interaction on individual behaviours and fitness outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, we still lack a comprehensive theory that can explain the generation and diversity of social structures observed within and between species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There have been only a few efforts to model animal social network structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, Seyfarth24 used a generative model of grooming networks based on individual preferences for giving and receiving grooming, and showed that a few simple rules can account for complex social structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model and related approaches, for example ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25, have been very influential in the study of social structure and continue to drive empirical research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, they mostly focused on primates and were geared towards specific questions such as the effects of relatedness, social ranks or ecological factors in determining social structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Independently, a large body of theoretical work in network science aims to explain the general properties of human social networks through simple models of how networks form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet these models tend to focus either on networks with a fixed set of agents26, or on boundlessly growing networks27, with few exceptions28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These network formation models therefore have limited applicability to animal (and many human) social groups where individuals both join (through birth of immigration) and leave (through death or emigration) the network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, most work in network science concentrates on the distribution of number of connections individuals have (the degree distribution).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Models that fit the degree distribution of real-world networks tend to be a poor fit to other important properties, notably the tendency of social connections to be clustered27,30, that is, two individuals to be connected with each other if they are both connected to a third individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Real-world human and animal networks exhibit significantly more clustering than random or preferential attachment models predict13,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Simple generative models of complex systems have been highly useful in other fields, such as metabolic networks31 and food webs32, but there has been little effort to build such models applicable to animal social networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this paper, we provide a widely applicable network formation model based on simple demographic and social processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model assumes a simple neutral demography and focuses on a central social process that is in operation in many social species: the inheritance of social connections from parents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This central component of our model is based on the observation that in many species with stable social groups, individuals interact with the social circle of their parents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is essentially the case in all mammals, where newborns stay close to their mothers until weaning, but also found in many other taxa, such as birds33, fish34 and arthropods35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After positively interacting with the parents social contacts, young individuals are likely to form social bonds with these conspecifics, as was found in African elephants, Loxodonta africana36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We demonstrate that this simple social inheritance process can result in networks that match both the degree and local clustering distributions of real-world animal social networks, as well as their modularity (which measures the strength of division of a network into modules or subgroups).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show that social heritability of connections can result in the appearance of genetic heritability of individual social network traits, as well as assortativity in the absence of explicit preference for homophily.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach highlights commonalities among groups, populations and species, and uncovers a general process that underlies variation in social structure.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Model description', 'Our departure point is the model by Jackson and Rogers27, in which role models in a network introduce their new contact to their other contacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model can reproduce many attributes of large-scale human social networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar models reconstruct the structure of other systems, such as protein interaction networks37 and the World Wide Web38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the model of Jackson and Rogers27 (like most other models in this family) is based on a constantly growing network with no death or emigration of agents and their results hold asymptotically for very large networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since we are interested in small-scale animal networks that do not grow unboundedly, we model a population where existing individuals die and get replaced at an equal rate with newborn individuals28 (see Methods and Supplementary Figs 13 for results for slowly growing and shrinking networks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We model binary and undirected networks, so implicitly assume social bonds are neutral or cooperative, but our model can be extended to weighted networks that describe the strength of each social bond, and to directed ones, such as agonistic networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Consider a social group of size N. Suppose that each time step an individual is born to a random mother and one individual is selected to die at random.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With probability pb, the newborn will meet and connect to its mother (generally, pb will be close to 1, but can be low or 0 in species such as some insects, where individuals might not meet their mothers).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A crucial component of our model is the general assumption that the likelihood of a newborn A connecting with another individual B depends on the relationship between As mother and B: the probability A will connect to B is given by pn if As mother is connected to B, and pr if not (n and r stand for neighbour and random node, respectively; Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, pn is the probability an offspring inherits a given connection of its parent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we focus on the case where A always connects to its mother (pb=1), but the model can be extended to include a lower probability to connect to the contacts of As mother if A does not connect to its mother, when pb less_than 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If pn greater than pr, the population exhibits a tendency for clustering, a well-established and general phenomenon in social networks13,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Methods section, we present an extension of this basic model to account for two sexes, where only females reproduce.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that if newborns are likely to copy only their mothers, the resulting social network is similar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "Figure 1: Graphical illustration of the model.A newborn individual is connected to its parent with probability pb, to its parent's connections with probability pn and to individuals not directly connected to its parent with probability pr.Full size image", 'Network statistics', 'We simulate social network dynamics to test how social inheritance and stochastic social bonding affect network structure, heritability and assortativity (see Methods for simulation details and the Supplementary Data 1 for the code).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also provide analytical expressions for the degree distribution, and approximations for mean degree and mean local clustering coefficient in the Methods section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all of our numerical results, we assume pb=1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the network density (the number of edges out of all possible edges) depends on pn and pr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean clustering coefficient, a measure of the extent to which nodes tend to cluster together, also depends on these parameters, but not monotonically; high levels of clustering were observed in simulations with low or high pr, but not at intermediate levels (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also test how changes in network size, caused by increased or decreased probabilities of death during the simulations, affected its properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These tests do not provide a general conclusion, but suggest that the network structure might be moderately influenced by whether the network is growing or not (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Mean degree and clustering coefficient as a function of model parameters.The dependency of mean degree (a,b) and clustering coefficient (c,d) on social inheritance, pn (a,c), and probability of random bonding, pr (b,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each panel, the black curves depict our analytical approximation while the blue dots with error bars are mean and s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of 50 replicate runs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the two panels on the left, the curves correspond to, from top to bottom, pr=0.5, 0.3 and 0.1;

see Methods) for a set of social inheritance (pn) values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As Fig 4 shows, high probabilities of social inheritance result in a pattern of heritability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, when individuals are likely to copy their parents in forming social associations, the resulting network will exhibit heritability of centrality traits, although the only heritability programmed into the model is that of social inheritance and stochastic bonding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar patterns obtain for local clustering coefficient and eigenvalue centrality (Supplementary Figs 13 and 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Heritability as a consequence of social inheritance.The regression of betweenness centrality among parents and their offspring as a function of the strength of social inheritance (pn).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bottom and top of the box mark the first and third quartiles, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The upper whisker extends from the hinge to the highest value that is within 1.5 × IQR of the hinge, where IQR is the inter-quartile range, or distance between the first and third quartiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lower whisker extends from the hinge to the lowest value within 1.5 × IQR of the hinge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data beyond the end of the whiskers are outliers and plotted as points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten replications were run for each pn value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parameter values: simulation steps=2,000, N=100, pr=0.01.Full size image', 'Social inheritance causes assortativity', 'Finally, we test the effect of social inheritance on assortativity, that is, the preference of individuals to bond with others with similar traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We simulate networks where each individual had one trait with an arbitrary value between 0 and 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Newborns inherit their mothers trait with probability 1, where  is the rate of large mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If a large mutation happens, the newborn has a random uniformly distributed trait value; otherwise, its trait is randomly picked from a Gaussian distribution around the mothers trait, with variance 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individuals follow the same rules of the basic model when forming social bonds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, individuals do not explicitly prefer to bond with others with the same trait value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, we observe that the assortativity coefficient is significantly higher than in random networks, in which the trait values were re-assigned randomly (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Assortativity as a consequence of social inheritance.Illustration of assortativity without explicit assortative preference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dots and notches note assortativity coefficients and standard errors, respectively, for model networks (red) and shuffled networks, where trait values were re-assigned randomly (black).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inset networks illustrate examples from the two groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Circle colours represent arbitrary continuous trait values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lines represent social bonds between individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parameter values are the same as in Fig 4, with mutation probability =0.05.Full size image', 'As an alternative model generating assortativity, we consider an explicit assortativity model, in which newborns explicitly prefer bonding with those with similar traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this model (unsurprisingly) generates networks with high assortativity (mean assortativity coefficient±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  : 0.53±0.006 compared with 0.01±0.002 in networks with randomly shuffled trait values), it fails to recover the high clustering and modularity observed in networks generated by social inheritance and in the data (Supplementary Figs 9 and 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result further suggests that assortativity might be a byproduct of social inheritance rather than a driving force of social network structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more generalized preferential attachment model, described in the Methods section, shows the converse is not true (Supplementary Fig 11), that is, the network patterns generated by social inheritance do not arise as a byproduct of genetically inherited traits and association preferences (see Discussion for more).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our model provides a step towards a general theory of social structure in animals that is grounded in social and demographic processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach is to use dynamic generative models based on simple processes to predict network-scale patterns that those processes are expected to produce, and compare them with observed networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such an approach has been widely and productively used in network theory and social sciences27,43,44, as well as other subfields of ecology31,32 but not in animal social networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work addresses this gap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our main result is that the combination of neutral demography and social inheritance can replicate important properties of animal social networks in the wild.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In particular, we show that our model can capture essential features of social networks of four different species in the wild, including not just the degree distribution and modularity, but also the clustering coefficient distribution, in contrast to most studies of social network formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clustering is an important feature of social networks, distinguishing them from other types of networks, such as transportation networks and the internet30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theory predicts that clustered networks are more conducive to cooperation45, and empirical studies document a tendency to close triads13,40, suggesting that it might be a generally adaptive feature of social structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, many previous models of sociality and network formation fail to account for the high clustering observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, while preferential attachment can reconstruct the degree distribution of social networks, it fails to capture their high degree of clustering27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The social inheritance process is crucial to the formation of cohesive clusters in social networks because it biases newly formed connections to those that close triads of relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Social inheritance requires a behavioural mechanism that facilitates introduction of newborns to their mothers social partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in many species, young individuals tend to follow their mothers, it is easy to think about such a passive mechanism: young individuals are introduced to other individuals by spending time with their mothers partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process is consistent with the long-held view that motheroffspring units are fundamental to social structure46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct evidence for social inheritance comes from the study by Goldenberg et al.36, who documented the tendency of female African elephants to inherit the social bonds of their mothers, driving network resilience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in many species group members show active interest in newborns47, promoting the initiation of a social bond between newborns and their mothers partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further work can test if initial interest in newborns later translates to stronger social bonds with individuals reaching adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that social inheritance does not necessarily require an active process of introductions but can also happen passively, for example, as a result of spatial fidelity among group members.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model is agnostic with regard to the mechanism of social inheritance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That being said, the fitted model parameters for the four networks vary in ways that are suggestive for socio-ecological factors: for hyenas and hyraxes, we find high pn values, which may reflect the strong philopatry in these societies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the relatively low fitted value of pn in dolphins may reflect their multi-level society featuring motherson avoidance48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We make a number of simplifying assumptions, such as no individual heterogeneity, or age- or stage-structure in our demography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Models of this type have a long and distinguished history in ecology and evolution49, and in the same spirit, we do not believe that nature is actually as simple as we model it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the fact that this very simple model (but not other simple models, for example, the explicit assortativity and generalized preference models) can reproduce important aspects of real networks suggests that the social inheritance of connections is likely to be important in structuring social networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though the details will no doubt vary across species and contexts, this simple, quantifiable process can explain observed variation in social networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, our model does not treat sex-specific dispersal, a mechanism that results in different social environments for the two sexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, there is evidence for social bonding with familiar individuals after dispersal50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that even after dispersal, individuals may inherit the social bonds of certain conspecifics serving as role models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another use of simple models such as ours is to serve as a base model to test the effect of additional factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, after fitting the model to an observed social network, one could test whether personality can explain the variance not explained by social inheritance and stochasticity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be attained by adding personality to the agent-based model as a factor that influences individual bonding decisions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our model has implications for how the inheritance of positions in social networks, which has important implications for social dynamics, is to be interpreted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Fowler et al.51 found that in humans, network traits such as degree and transitivity were heritable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In rhesus macaques, Brent et al.52 found that indirect network traits such as betweenness are more heritable than direct ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, a study of yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventris, presented evidence for heritability of social network measures based on direct interactions53, but not indirect interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these studies show that network position can be heritable, but have not been able to elucidate the mechanism of inheritance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not unlikely that some social network traits are genetically inherited; for example, individuals might genetically inherit social preferences from their parents that lead them to connect to the same individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the generalized preference model, we show that such a mechanism is unlikely to account for the observed levels of clustering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our work suggests that at least some of the heritability of network traits might be social (as opposed to genetic), from individuals copying their parents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This prediction is borne out by recent studies in elephants36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, while these previous studies attempt to control for effects of the social environment at the group or lineage level using quantitative genetics methods, for example ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  54, they were not designed to distinguish social inheritance at the individual level from genetic inheritance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studying the dynamics of social bond acquisition can be a way to separate genetic and social inheritance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Another robust finding in network science and animal behaviour is that individuals tend to connect to others with traits similar to themselves (for example, refs 55, 56, 57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assortativity is crucial for social evolutionary theory, as the costs and benefits of social interactions depend on partner phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent work has found that assortative mating can arise without assortative preferences, as a result of dynamic processes in a closed system58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that social inheritance can lead to high assortativity in the absence of explicitly assortative preferences for social bonding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, an alternative model based on explicit assortativity failed to reconstruct topological features of observed networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Empirically, our results call for a careful assessment of networks with apparent phenotypic assortment and controlling for social inheritance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This will be difficult to do with only static network data, but will be feasible for species with long-term data on the network dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our work points to several interesting avenues to be explored in future research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we used binary networks to describe the strength of social bonds that are inherently on a continuous scale11,59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Weighted networks that can describe the delicate differences in the strength of social bonds between individuals would be more relevant in some cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future generative models can consider varying bond strength by coupling a weighted network model with a model of behavioural dynamics of social bond formation for pairs of individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, even though our model is extremely simplistic, most of its mathematical properties (including probability distributions over network measures such as the degree distribution) are analytically intractable, which makes model-fitting a challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Methods such as approximate bayesian computation60, coupled with dimensionality reduction techniques61 can be used to develop algorithms for estimating parameters of the model and also incorporate more information about individual variation and environmental effects (See Methods for more).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, long-term data sets on social network dynamics can allow estimation of the social inheritance and random bonding parameters pn and pr directly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Last, our model does not consider changes in social bonds after these were established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this assumption is supported by empirical findings concerning bond stability in some species12,13, future models in which this assumption is relaxed should be developed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also assume a single type of bond between individuals, whereas in nature different social networks exist for different kinds of interactions (for example, affiliative, agonistic and so on).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such multilayer networks62 represent an important future direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, the theory we present here is based on the idea that social networks should be regarded and analysed as the result of a dynamic process63 that depend on environmental, individual and structural effects13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work represents a first step in developing a theory for the structure of social

association preferences and traits might mimic the process of social inheritance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To generalize the assortative preferences model, we now assume each individual carries two traits, one describing a real-valued attribute (as in the assortment model above; we call this the display trait), and the other the preference for that trait (the preference trait).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, if a focal individual has display and preference trait values (0.1,0.5), it is being preferred most by others with preference trait 0.1 but the focal individual prefers to associate with those having

individual is born, with (independent) deviations in each trait from parental values distributed according to N(0,).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When an offspring j is born, it makes a connection to each existing individual i in the population with probability , where k is a positive constant and dij is the shortest distance on the circle between the offspring j's preference trait and the individual i's display trait.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individuals are selected to die and give birth at random as in the basic model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ", 'Supplementary Figure 11 illustrates the results from this alternative model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It shows that although model parameters exist that generate realistic looking degree distributions, these generate networks that are far less clustered than the real-life

well as others with similar traits that are not connected to their parents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter connections do not close triads, and hence the resulting network is much less clustered.
