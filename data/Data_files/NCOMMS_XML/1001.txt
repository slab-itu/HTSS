Exploiting the kinesin-1 molecular motor to generate a virus membrane penetration site  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Viruses exploit cellular machineries to penetrate a host membrane and cause infection, a process that remains enigmatic for non-enveloped viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we probe how the non-enveloped polyomavirus SV40 penetrates the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane to reach the cytosol, a crucial infection step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the microtubule-based motor kinesin-1 is recruited to the ER membrane by binding to the transmembrane J-protein B14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, this motor facilitates SV40 ER-to-cytosol transport by constructing a penetration site on the ER membrane called a focus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither kinesin-2, kinesin-3 nor kinesin-5 promotes foci formation or infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specific use of kinesin-1 is due to its unique ability to select posttranslationally modified microtubules for cargo transport and thereby spatially restrict focus formation to the perinucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings support the idea of a tubulin code for motor-dependent trafficking and establish a distinct kinesin-1 function in which a motor is exploited to create a viral membrane penetration site.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Viruses co-opt cellular machineries to cause infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An essential infection step is virus penetration across a host membrane, to gain access into the cytosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For enveloped viruses, fusion between the viral and a host membrane delivers the core viral particle into the cytosol1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the molecular mechanism driving membrane penetration of a non-enveloped virus remains poorly understood3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, a key question is whether the virus passively exploits a pre-existing protein-conducting channel to cross a membrane or actively remodels a membranes property to promote its translocation across the lipid bilayer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, membrane translocation of the non-enveloped polyomavirus (PyV) highlights this enigma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'PyVs are responsible for many debilitating human diseases, especially in immunocompromised individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prominent human PyVs include the BK PyV that induces haemorrhagic cystitis and nephropathy, JC PyV that triggers progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and the Merkel cell PyV that causes Merkel cell carcinoma4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simian virus 40 (SV40) represents the archetype PyV, possessing not only structural and genetic similarities to human PyVs, but also shares the same infection pathway as its human counterparts4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not surprisingly, studies on SV40 entry have historically illuminated the cellular basis of human PyV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SV40 consists of 72 pentamers of the structural protein VP1 that encases its DNA genome, with each pentamer harbouring an internal hydrophobic protein VP2 or VP3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When properly assembled, the viral particle displays a diameter of 45 nm5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To infect cells, SV40 binds to the ganglioside GM1 receptor on the plasma membrane, is endocytosed and targets to endolysosomes7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The virus then sorts to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it penetrates the ER membrane to access the cytosol10,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the cytosol, SV40 traffics to the nucleus where transcription and replication of the viral genome lead to lytic infection or cellular transformation14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the molecular basis by which this non-enveloped virus penetrates the ER membrane, a decisive infection step, remains largely mysterious, aspects of this process are being revealed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'SV40 was initially proposed to hijack a cellular quality control pathway called ER-associated degradation (ERAD) to reach the cytosol12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During ERAD, a misfolded ER protein is translocated across a protein-conducting channel to reach the cytosol where the misfolded client is degraded by the proteasome15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as SV40 penetrates the ER membrane as a relatively large (45 nm) particle that is unlikely to thread through the pore of a typical channel, a different model describing its membrane transport has emerged17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this alternative model, incoming SV40 is hypothesized to remodel the ER membrane to create a membrane penetration site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, SV40 was found to reorganize select ER membrane proteins into discrete puncta called foci where the viral particles enter the cytosol18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the transmembrane proteins B-cell receptor-associated protein 31 (BAP31) and BAP29 mobilize into the foci during infection18; these membrane factors serve as sensors to detect membrane-embedded SV40 and initiate the membrane translocation event18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, during SV40 infection, the transmembrane J-proteins DNAJ homologue subfamily B member 14 (B14), B12 and C18 accumulate in the foci where they recruit the cytosolic chaperone complex composed of heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70), small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein- (SGTA) and heat shock protein 105 (Hsp105); this complex extracts SV40 into the cytosol to complete the membrane translocation process19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although increasing evidence supports the notion that virus-induced foci function as cytosol entry site during SV40 ER membrane transport21, how this sub-organellar structure is constructed remains completely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, what cellular mechanisms are hijacked to accomplish this feat?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using a combination of biochemical, cell-based and microscopy approaches coupled with a chemical-induced dimerization strategy, our results demonstrate that the force generated by the kinesin-1 molecular motor is harnessed to promote foci formation during SV40 cytosol entry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this molecular motor is known to regulate viral intracellular trafficking and disassembly22,23,24, our report here ascribes a distinct function to kinesin-1 in which the ability of this motor to read the tubulin code is exploited to promote the localized construction of virus membrane penetration site.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Kinesin-1 promotes SV40 infection', 'An RNA interference screen identified B14 as an ER membrane J-protein required for SV40 membrane penetration11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a HEK 293T cell line (293T-REx) stably expressing 3x-FLAG tagged B14 (B143xFLAG), we immunoprecipitated B143xFLAG and subjected the precipitated sample to mass spectrometry analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pinpointed the cytosolic Hsc70-SGTA-Hsp105 chaperone complex as B14-interacting partners that extract SV40 into the cytosol11,19,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the kinesin family proteins kinesin-1 (KIF5B and KIF5A) and kinesin-5 (KIF11) were also found in the same precipitated material21, we asked whether they also play a role during SV40 infection, in particular during the ER membrane penetration phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As kinesin motors rely on microtubules to transport cargos, we first tested whether an intact microtubule system is required during SV40 infection after the virus has reached the ER from the cell surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simian CV-1 cells are the normal permissive cell line used to study SV40 infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, CV-1 cells were infected with SV40 and at 5 hpi (hours post infection), treated with the microtubule depolymerizing agent nocodazole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose this post-infection time point to add the drug, because a majority of SV40 reaches the ER from the plasma membrane 56 hpi12,17 (see also Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, any effect nocodazole exerts on virus infection should reflect a requirement of microtubules post ER arrival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this protocol, we found that nocodazole blocked expression of large T antigen (TAg) in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig 1a, top panel); TAg is a virally encoded protein expressed only after the virus reaches the host nucleus and is the earliest marker of successful infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that microtubules are important during SV40 infection at a step after virus arrival to the ER from the cell surface, raising the possibility that motor proteins execute a function at this later entry stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If nocodazole was simultaneously added at infection, virus arrival to the ER was blocked17, indicating that an intact microtubule network also controls SV40 trafficking from the plasma membrane to the ER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Kinesin-1 promotes SV40 infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) CV-1 cells were infected with SV40 (MOI 0.5) at 5 hpi, treated with different concentrations (0, 0.5, 1 and 2.5 M) of nocodazole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells (48 hpi) were lysed and the resulting whole-cell lysate was immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) CV-1 cells infected with SV40 for 24 h were fixed and immunostained against TAg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were captured by immunofluorescence microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 20 m.

investigate whether the kinesin-5 family motor KIF11 facilitates SV40 infection, we immunostained for TAg expression in infected cells treated or not with the highly specific KIF11 inhibitor S-Trityl-L-cysteine (STLC)25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Representative images of TAg in infected and uninfected CV-1 cells are shown in Fig 1b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, when STLC was added 5 hpi, SV40 infection was unaffected, whereas addition of nocodazole (1 M) or the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (20 M) at 5 hpi potently blocked infection as expected (Fig 1c,d); MG132 was previously shown to impair SV40 ER-to-cytosol transport17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that kinesin-5 does not regulate SV40 entry into the cytosol from the ER to facilitate infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We next examined the role of kinesin-1 in SV40 infection by using a dominant-negative (DN) overexpression approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we used a motor-less version of wild-type (WT) kinesin-1 motor KIF5B that contains the cargo-binding tail domain and acts in a DN manner (KIF5 DN) to suppress endogenous kinesin-1 activity28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This construct was tagged with mCherry (mCh) at its amino terminus, generating mChKIF5 DN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full-length WT KIF5B tagged with mCh at its N terminus (mChKIF5 WT) and mCh were used as controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of these proteins was examined by subjecting CV-1 cell lysates to SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) followed by immunoblotting against a mCh antibody (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When TAg expression was scored in cells expressing the mCh-tagged proteins, we found that overexpression of mChKIF5 DN, but not mChKIF5 WT, significantly impaired SV40 infection when compared with cells expressing mCh, regardless of the multiplicity of infection (MOI) (0.5, 5 and 20) used in the experiment (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hereon, all infection assays were performed at MOI 0.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using an independent approach, we depleted KIF5B in CV-1 cells using two different small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (KIF5B#1 and KIF5B#2) (Fig 1g, first panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the TAg level was analysed by immunoblotting, we found that depleting KIF5B robustly blocked SV40 infection (Fig 1g, second panel), similar to results analysed by immunofluorescence (Fig 1h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To demonstrate that the KIF5B siRNA is not exerting off-target effects, we performed a rescue experiment by expressing the KIF5 family member KIF5C in KIF5B#1 siRNA-transfected cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plasmid that drives the expression of KIF5C additionally drives the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP), allowing the detection of transfected cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were then infected with SV40, fixed and scored for the presence of TAg only in GFP-positive cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrated that expressing KIF5C restored SV40 infection in KIF5B#1 knockdown cells (Fig 1i), unambiguously establishing that the block in SV40 infection due to transfecting the KIF5B siRNA results from KIF5B depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These collective findings strongly support the importance of kinesin-1 during SV40 infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Kinesin-1 complexes with the ER membrane J-protein B14', 'Because of kinesin-1s role in SV40 infection, we assessed the putative interaction between kinesin-1 and the transmembrane J-protein B14, as initially suggested by our mass spectrometry analysis21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  293T-REx cells stably expressing B143xFLAG and control 293T cells were transiently transfected with mChKIF5 WT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lysates derived from both cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation using FLAG-conjugated agarose beads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that mChKIF5 WT was pulled down only when B143xFLAG was precipitated from 293T REx but not 293T cells (Fig 2a top panel, also see Supplementary Fig 5 for uncropped western blottings), demonstrating that KIF5 interacts with B14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, when FLAG-tagged B14 (FLAGB14) was co-transfected with either mCh or mChKIF5 WT in (CV-1-derived) COS-7 cells, precipitating FLAGB14 pulled down mChKIF5 WT but not the mCh control protein (Fig 2b, first and second panels).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  COS-7 cells were used instead of CV-1 cells due to their higher transfection efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, endogenous Hsc70, Hsp105 and SGTA also co-precipitated with FLAGB14 (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, other cytosolic HSPs including HspBP1, Hsp27 and HspB5 did not (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The level of mChKIF5 WT that co-precipitated with FLAGB14 was unaffected by SV40 infection (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that the KIF5B14 interaction occurs in both human and monkey cells, and is specific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Kinesin-1 facilitates SV40 translocation into the cytosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Flp-In 293T-REx cells expressing B143xFLAG were

FLAGB14 WT, binding between FLAGB14 H136Q and mChKIF5 WT remained intact (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest kinesin-1 is recruited to B14 in a J-domain-independent manner, although they do not rule out the involvement of other unknown B14 partners in mediating this interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to full-length WT KIF5, our results revealed that the truncated KIF5 DN can

monitor cytosol arrival of SV40, we used a previously established cell-based, semi-permeabilized ER-to-cytosol transport assay17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this assay, COS-7 cells expressing mCh, mChKIF5 WT or mChKIF5 DN were infected with SV40, harvested and treated with a low concentration of digitonin to permeabilize the plasma membrane without damaging the ER membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were then centrifuged to generate two fractions, a supernatant fraction that contains cytosolic proteins and virus that reaches the cytosol (cytosol fraction), and a pellet fraction that harbours membranes including the ER as well as virus associated with membranes (membrane fraction).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The integrity of the fractionation procedure can be monitored in the release of Hsp90 to the cytosolic fraction, and the pelleting of ER-resident protein disulfide isomerase with the membrane fraction (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this assay, we found that expression of mChKIF5 DN but not mChKIF5 WT potently reduced the SV40 VP1 level in the cytosol when compared with cells expressing mCh (Fig 3a, top panel; the VP1 band intensity is quantified in Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Successful viral entry requires penetration of a host membrane, a process that remains mysterious for non-enveloped viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For SV40, a non-enveloped virus, the ER membrane must be breached to gain access to the cytosol and cause infection10,11,12,18,19,20,21,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A major gap in our understanding is whether the virus hijacks a preformed channel or remodels the ER membrane to create a membrane penetration site, to access the cytosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A series of reports support the latter scenario in which SV40 was found to remodel the ER membrane by inducing reorganization of several ER transmembrane proteins into discrete puncta called foci18,19,20,21these structures in turn serve as sites from where the virus enters the cytosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this provides the first example of a viral particle creating its own membrane penetration site, a key question is how this sub-organellar structure is constructed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings here reveal two new aspects of how SV40 co-opts the cellular machinery to penetrate the ER membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we demonstrate that microtubule-based motility is required for the movement and subsequent coalescence of ER-localized viral particles into large focal structures essential for membrane penetration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we demonstrate that the kinesin-1 molecular motor is specifically selected for this transport as its unique property of selecting modified microtubule tracks enables the spatial restriction of the viral particle to the perinucleus, as depicted in Fig 8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 8: SV40 exploits kinesin-1s activity to promote foci maturation.During SV40 ER membrane penetration, the virus (blue) engages the ER membrane J-protein B14 (dark green), which in turn recruits the cytosolic Hsc70-Hsp105-SGTA extraction complex (light green) and kinesin-1 (purple).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This motor then powers the local movement of SV40, B14, and the cytosolic chaperones present in small immature foci (magnified circle on the top), reorganizing them into large mature foci (magnified circle on the bottom).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These large focal structures are predominantly found proximal to the nucleus where acetylated microtubules (bent and curved yellow lines) are enriched.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Formation of mature foci locally concentrates the cytosolic chaperones to enable efficient extraction of the viral particle into the cytosol.Full size image', 'Our biochemical analyses unveiled a physical connection between the ER membrane J-protein B14 and the cytosolic kinesin-1 motor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the precise nature of the B14kinesin-1 interaction remains unclear, this interaction occurs independent of B14s J-domain, a motif used to recruit the cytosolic Hsc70-SGTA-Hsp105 complex that extracts SV40 into the cytosol11,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that unidentified cellular adapters facilitate complex formation between these two proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analyses further revealed that kinesin-1 is recruited to B14 in the absence of virus infection, suggesting that binding between kinesin-1 and B14 sub-serves an endogenous function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kinesin-1 has previously been implicated in ER tubule extension along microtubules28, perhaps via association with the ER membrane proteins kinectin and/or protrudin55,56,57,58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interaction with B14 (and its binding partner B12) thus implies an additional kinesin-1 function in major ER quality control pathways including ERAD and ER-associated autophagy59,60,61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By expressing an established KIF5 DN (motor-less kinesin-1) and using a knockdown strategy in the context of cell-based assays, our results demonstrate that kinesin-1 promotes SV40 ER membrane-to-cytosol transport leading to successful infection, without affecting viral trafficking from the plasma membrane to the ER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, this motor does not appear to be involved in murine PyV infection62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this virus shares a similar entry pathway as SV40 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4), it is not known whether murine PyV co-opts B14 or creates foci to access the cytosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The key finding that kinesin-1 executes a critical role during SV40 infection is not without precedentthis motor is also used by other viruses including the human adenovirus-2/5, human immunodeficiency virus-1 and herpes simplex virus-1 during entry22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To dissect the molecular basis by which kinesin-1 promotes SV40 cytosol entry from the ER, we used a chemical-induced dimerization strategy and found that this motor is essential for maturation of the foci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this process, kinesin-1s cargos consist of structural components of the foci including B14, B12, C18 and BAP31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Motor-driven, microtubule-based transport of these cargos enables them to come in contact and accumulate, gradually assembling into a mature structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Precisely when kinesin-1s activity is needed to mobilize these cargos during foci maturation is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as kinesin-1 is responsible for transforming small to large foci, we posit that formation of the small foci is unlikely to require kinesin-1s activity (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another outstanding question is the nature of the virus-induced signal that activates kinesin-1s motor activity to initiate cargo transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Can the virus directly bind to and enhance the motor activity, or does it trigger a signalling cascade that in turn stimulates kinesin-1s function?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future experiments are required to address these questions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, in contrast to promoting an assembly event during SV40 infection, kinesin-1 can support a disassembly reaction in the case of adenovirus entry24; in this instance, kinesin-1 is able to terminally disassemble the viral particle to liberate the viral genome for nuclear import and subsequent replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our analyses further revealed that other kinesin motors cannot replace kinesin-1s function in SV40-induced foci formation, as only the motor domain of kinesin-1, but not kinesin-2 or kinesin-3, was able to rescue foci formation and infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The selection of kinesin-1 to build the foci does not appear to require this motors unique property of persistent transport under load.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the kinesin-1 motor domains unique ability to selectively recognize modified microtubules provides at least part of the explanation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kinesin-1s motor domain is known to preferentially transport along acetylated and detyrosinated microtubules in cells39,63,64,65, modifications that are predominantly found on microtubules in a cells perinuclear region50,66 where SV40-induced foci are typically found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, increasing the levels of acetylated modified microtubules stimulated virus-induced foci formation and infection, strengthening the notion that kinesin-1s selective recognition of modified microtubules is important for its ability to promote foci maturation essential for stimulating infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings support the idea of a tubulin code wherein post-translational modifications of tubulin subunits within specific microtubule populations provide spatial cues for microtubule-based activities67,68.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As a plus end-directed microtubule motor, kinesin-1 generally transports cargos from a cells centre to its periphery69.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SV40s transport from the ER to the cytosol (and then the nucleus) might therefore appear to move opposite to the direction guided by kinesin-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To reconcile this, we envision that within the convoluted ER membranous network, local transport of foci components powered by kinesin-1 can occur in a plus-end direction along modified sections of microtubules that do not extend to the cell periphery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with this idea, acetylated microtubule tracks localize to the perinucleus due to their propensity to bend and curve70, and the use of these modified microtubules by kinesin-1 to form foci should deposit the virus in the cytosol proximal to the nucleus, enabling efficient nuclear entry leading to infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a scenario elegantly illuminates how a virus exploits a unique relationship between a specific molecular motor and its track to catalyse the cytosol entry process.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
