Inhibition of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The precise molecular alterations driving castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) are not clearly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a novel network-based integrative approach, here, we show distinct alterations in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) to be critical for CRPC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of HBP enzyme glucosamine-phosphate N-acetyltransferase 1 (GNPNAT1) is found to be significantly decreased in CRPC compared with localized prostate cancer (PCa).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic loss-of-function of GNPNAT1 in CRPC-like cells increases proliferation and aggressiveness, in vitro and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is mediated by either activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway in cells expressing full-length androgen receptor (AR) or by specific protein 1 (SP1)-regulated expression of carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) in cells containing AR-V7 variant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, addition of the HBP metabolite UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) to CRPC-like cells significantly decreases cell proliferation, both in-vitro and in animal studies, while also demonstrates additive efficacy when combined with enzalutamide in-vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations demonstrate the therapeutic value of targeting HBP in CRPC.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Recent scientific and technological advances have enabled biomedical researchers to collect high-throughput genomic, proteomic and metabolomic data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional interactions of these biomolecules have been obtained and catalogued in carefully curated databases, often in the form of networks1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A growing body of evidence suggests that combining information from such high-throughput data in the context of their molecular interactions may shed light on the biology of complex diseases, including cancer3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The development and progression of prostate cancer (PCa) from the androgen-dependent (AD) to castration-resistant state is thought to be driven by multiple events6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial treatment of choice for advanced disease is androgen ablation, which while initially effective often leads to therapy resistance (that is, the castration resistant state).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Better and more effective therapies are needed for CRPC, a lethal condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our previous studies10 identified specific metabolic alterations associated with localized PCa (treatment naive) and CRPC tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are particularly important as they provide new insights into PCa progression and suggest metabolic targets for therapeutic intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Building on this work, we employ a novel network-based integrative approach that combines patient-derived PCa gene expression with metabolomic data and identify a vital role for hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) in the castration-resistant state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, downregulation of HBP enhances tumorigenicity of CRPC-like cells via activation of cell cycle genes regulated by either the PI3K-AKT or the SP1-ChREBP axis in cells containing either AR-full length (AR-FL) or AR-V7, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, treatment with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) significantly decreases proliferation and tumour growth of CRPC-like cells while also increases efficacy of the anti-androgen enzalutamide in in-vitro experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are especially significant given that the CRPC-like cells tested, inclusive of those containing AR-V7, are inherently resistant to enzalutamide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In aggregate, our data provide novel perspectives on the influence of HBP on the castration-resistant state and supply rationale for targeting the HBP in CRPC.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results and Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Novel integrative analysis uncovers a role of HBP in PCa', 'To define key biochemical pathways altered in PCa, we used metabolomic and transcriptomic profiles from our previous study containing 12 treatment-naive localized PCa specimens and 16 benign adjacent prostate tissues (Ben)10 (Supplementary Fig 1A, clinical information in Supplementary Table 1) and integrated these using a novel pathway-centric analytical framework (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach combines two rankings for each pathway calculated from gene expression and metabolic data, while adjusting for variations in each of the two data sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we used methods of Gene Set Analysis (GSA11,12) and a modified version of Network-Based Gene Set Analysis (NetGSA)13 to obtain rankings of each pathway based on genetic and metabolic data, respectively (overview in Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modified NetGSA framework, unlike GSA-type methods, incorporates reactome-derived interactions and associated stoichiometry between metabolites allowing for adequate statistical power13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Integrative analysis of gene expression and metabolic data sets identifies alterations in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway in prostate cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Overview of integrative methodology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Top pathways identified after integrative analysis using combined gene/metabolite-derived enrichment scores using our previously published10 data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Black dots indicate top six pathways identified as outliers and coloured arrows indicate the top five enriched pathways chosen for secondary analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Network representation of pathways shown in b (solid coloured circles: enriched pathways after integrative analysis using combined gene/metabolite-derived enrichment scores;

HBP), valine-leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis and cysteine metabolism (Fig 1b, P-values in Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Next, to further select a pathway from those obtained using our integrative approach for follow-up functional studies, we employed a network-based permutation test using transcriptomics data to identify pathways that have the highest likelihood of playing a key role in coordinated biochemical pathway activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we carried out an enrichment analysis using transcriptome data focusing on pathways that interacted with our primary list of enriched pathways (Supplementary Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding enrichment score was used as a measure of the likelihood of coordinated activity among the interacting pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, the primary pathway exhibiting the highest likelihood was nominated for validation studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results of this network-based permutation test, which assesses the likelihood of observing particular connectivity patterns in a given network, are shown in Fig 1b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HBP exhibited the smallest P-value (P=0.0060) among the top five pathways interrogated (Fig 1b,c and Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that significant alterations in HBP are associated with PCa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, these results also imply that pathways interacting with HBP, namely glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, fructose and mannose metabolism, ascorbate and aldarate metabolism and glutamine and glutamate metabolism (Fig 1c), are also important in PCa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'HBP activity is downregulated in CRPC compared with AD PCa', 'HBP, a nutrient sensing pathway14, generates amino sugars by combining elemental carbon and nitrogen from glucose and glutamine (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glutamine-Fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 (GFPT1) has been described as the rate-limiting enzyme for this pathway15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The acetylation step represents a key entry point for carbon and nitrogen into the HBP and is catalysed by glucosamine-phosphate N-acetyltransferase 1 (GNPNAT1, Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  UDP-N acetyl glucosamine pyrophosphorylase 1 (UAP1) catalyses the final enzymatic reaction of HBP, resulting in the synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc, that is required for N-linked and O-linked glycosylation reactions17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In silico analysis showed that GNPNAT1 and UAP1 were significantly elevated in PCa compared with Ben in multiple publically available gene expression data sets including the one used here for integrative analysis (Supplementary Fig 2AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GNPNAT1 and UAP1 were also significantly elevated at the transcript level (Supplementary Fig 2D) in PCa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, increased activity of HBP in PCa was confirmed in 15 matched tumourbenign pairs by measuring the product to substrate ratio for the reaction carried out by GNPNAT1 (N-acetylglucosamine-6-P to glucosamine-6-P; Fig 1e) and levels of UDP-GlcNAc (Supplementary Fig 2E), the end product of HBP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissue microarray analysis further confirmed significantly higher expression of both GNPNAT1 and UAP1 in PCa compared with Ben, whereas, interestingly, their expression was significantly lower in sites of lymph node metastasis and CRPC tissues compared with localized PCa (Fig 1f,g and Supplementary Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the findings in CRPC, transcript levels of HBP genes were also significantly downregulated in CRPC tissues across multiple independent publically available microarray data sets (Supplementary Fig 3BE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results suggest significantly diminished activity of HBP in CRPC tumours compared with AD organ-confined PCa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'HBP modulates aggressivity in CRPC', 'Next, we studied the role of HBP in CRPC progression by examining the role of the proximal enzyme GNPNAT1 previously observed to be consistently downregulated in CRPC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Towards this end, we utilized a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) strategy to knockdown (KD) GNPNAT1 expression in three CRPC-like (that is, androgen responsive, but not AD) cell lines LNCaP-ABL19 and C4-2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20;

(Supplementary Figs 6CE and 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, histological analysis revealed KD tumours to be slightly more pleomorphic, with loss of glandular architecture and significantly higher number of mitotic figures compared with their NT counterparts (Supplementary Fig 6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, KD cells in LNCaP-ABL (Fig 2j) also showed a significant increase in their tumorigenic

proliferation and reduce cell viability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, addition of 60 mM UDP-GlcNAc for 96 h to both 22Rv1 and LNCaP-ABL cells resulted in a significant decrease in both viability and cell numbers by MTT and Celigo-based quantification assay (Bonferroni corrected P=0.01, Fig 4c,d and Supplementary Fig 14A,B), with a concomitant downregulation of predicted cell cycle genes (Supplementary Fig 14C, in 22Rv1 cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mass spectrometry-based quantification confirmed internalization of UDP-GlcNAc into both LNCaP-ABL and 22Rv1 cells (Supplementary Fig 14D).

effect on cell numbers (Celigo: Supplementary Fig 14B) but a statistically significant effect on viability (MTT: Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This modest cytostatic effect seen in 22Rv1 cells was primarily due to inhibition of AR signalling by enzalutamide as evidenced by significant reduction in expression of two candidate AR targets, PSA and Hexokinase 2 (HK2, Supplementary Fig 14E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, combination of 20 or 60 mM UDP-GlcNAc with 10 M enzalutamide displayed a significant additive cytostatic effect in both 22Rv1 and LNCaP-ABL cells (MTT assay: Fig 4c,d and

method overcomes the potential lack of agreement between data points in transcriptomics and proteomics/metabolomics data sets, which has been an inherent bottleneck for concordance-based integrative approaches29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our method relies on networks of reactomes that constitute pathways, as well as the interactions of these pathways with each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on this approach, we identified HBP as a key biochemical mediator of CRPC progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HBP-associated metabolic re-wiring observed in CRPC supports cell cycle via PI3K-AKT/SP1-ChREBP-axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, replenishing the HBP in these cells via the addition of a downstream metabolite rescues the KD phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a contrasting effect of HBP on growth of AD PCa and CRPC cells further suggesting the existence of metabolic re-wiring during PCa progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, HBP has been known to be a nutrient sensor and shown by others to regulate glycolysis30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In light of this, one may speculate that reduction in HBP in CRPC could be a selective adaptation to the increased need for glycolysis required to meet the bioenergetic demands of an invasive tumour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is supported by our recent publication that describes increased glycolysis as one of the main metabolic adaptations seen in CRPC-like cells31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Provocatively, treatment of CRPC with HBP metabolites UDP-GlcNAc and GlcN, in vitro and UDP-GlcNAc in vivo, significantly reduced the proliferation of CRPC-like cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The therapeutic effect in vitro was further enhanced by combining the metabolite with the anti-androgen enzalutamide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are particularly noteworthy given that CRPC cells containing the AR-V7 variant (that is, 22Rv1) are essentially resistant to enzalutamide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although preliminary, our results introduce the innovative concept of using

testing procedure for pathway enrichment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our earlier study13,34 using NetGSA to enrich pathways using gene expression data, we used existing gene network databases, such as BioGrid, YeastNet and BioCarta, to create the interaction network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, to apply NetGSA to metabolomics data, biochemical reactions among metabolites from KEGG were used to define their respective interaction network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this network, the nodes are metabolites and edges between metabolites are drawn based on information from biochemical reactions.

pathways that are most likely to be activated in the near term.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Procedurally for this secondary analysis, we first constructed the interaction network between 87 KEGG-defined

the other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then used this information to determine the number of interacting pathways for each of the top five pathways obtained using the primary enrichment analysis.

for enrichment of these 20 interacting pathways and rank ordered them based on their enrichment score.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this list, we next selected the top ten interacting pathways (that is, pathways that were ranked within the top 50%) and asked how many of these interact with the top five pathways derived from the primary enrichment analysis (Supplementary Fig 1D) and used a network-based permutation test to assess their significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure identified the HBP as the key pathway in PCa (Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To carry out the network-based permutation test, we denoted by N(1), , N(5) the number of enriched neighbours of each of the top five pathways based on the gene expression data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then generated B=10,000 random networks by scrambling the patterns of interactions among pathways, while preserving the number of interactions for each pathway as defined based on KEGG (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is to say that the randomization process maintained the number of interacting nodes (pathways) and their degree distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Procedurally, this was done as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
