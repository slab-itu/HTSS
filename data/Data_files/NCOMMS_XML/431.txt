Large-scale ordering of nanoparticles using viscoelastic shear processing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Despite the availability of elaborate varieties of nanoparticles, their assembly into regular superstructures and photonic materials remains challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show how flexible films of stacked polymer nanoparticles can be directly assembled in a roll-to-roll process using a bending-induced oscillatory shear technique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For sub-micron spherical nanoparticles, this gives elastomeric photonic crystals termed polymer opals showing extremely strong tunable structural colour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With oscillatory strain amplitudes of 300%, crystallization initiates at the wall and develops quickly across the bulk within only five oscillations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting structure of random hexagonal close-packed layers is improved by shearing bidirectionally, alternating between two in-plane directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our theoretical framework indicates how the reduction in shear viscosity with increasing order of each layer accounts for these results, even when diffusion is totally absent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This general principle of shear ordering in viscoelastic media opens the way to manufacturable photonic materials, and forms a generic tool for ordering nanoparticles.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Nanostructural organization elicits useful material properties for a wide range of composites, ranging from colloids to granular systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While extensive studies have focussed on nanoparticles equilibrated in low viscosity solvents1,2,3, these are transient and do not deliver permanently fixed architectures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particulate-filled polymers, such as silica sphere reinforced resins, produce enhanced mechanical properties4,5,6, but particle concentrations are low and the packing order is not of concern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, it is known that when high concentrations of particles are regularly packed, the system can exhibit interesting properties such as photonic bandgaps7,8, slow light propagation, or refractive index modification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More generally with increasing demand for flexible functional composites in wearable devices, sensors, electrodes and solar cells9,10,11, there is a strong need for progress in ordering dense particulate elastomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Shearing has long been known to induce transient order in solutions of colloidal particles, though excessive shear is found to break up any ordering12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oscillatory shear has frequently been applied to colloidal and granular systems as a driving force for structural transitions13,14,15,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Various transient ordered structures such as strings, sliding layers and crystallites have been generated in colloidal suspensions19, while crystals have also been induced by oscillatory shear in colloidal glasses and granular systems near the jamming point20,21, showing its potential for dense particulate assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recent studies of the kinetics involved suggest that shearing induces banding with regions of high and low order, possessing different viscosities that are separated by a sharp boundary that can move22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Photonic crystals constructed of spherical nanoparticles are excellent prototypical ordered superstructures as they give strong opaline structural colours from the multiple scattering of light off the periodic planes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite great endeavour, no manufacturing technique has yet been able to create continuous roll-to-roll opal sheets on any significant scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show how, unlike typical colloidal assembly routes, it is advantageous to remove all solvent to produce permanent nanostructures, which are locked in place, avoiding the phase separation of particles and solvent that quenches local annealing of sphere positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Core-shell nanoparticles are thus employed to produce a 50 vol% dispersion phase of 200-nm-scale hard cross-linked spheres and a continuous phase of a gum-like medium, creating polymer opals (POs)23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These optical composites behave mechanically like rubbers and exhibit strain-sensitive colours due to Bragg diffraction from the opaline packing of the spheres24, leading to various promising applications25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to recognize that POs are distinct from colloids and granular systems (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colloids are entropy-driven systems comprised of sub-micron spheres exhibiting Brownian motion in low viscosity media such as water (103 Pa·s)14,27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Granular systems are athermal gravity-driven suspensions with much larger spheres ( greater than 1 m) in media such as air and slurry (approaching the jamming limit)29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, our POs are comprised of sub-micron polystyrene (PS) spheres in a gum-like polyethylacrylate (PEA) matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PEA is bonded to each PS sphere as a shell and is viscoelastic above its glass transition temperature Tg0 °C with 103104 Pa·s at 100 °C (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a Reynolds number 106 times smaller, and a characteristic Péclet number  (where  is the shear rate, a the particle radius and D the StokesEinstein diffusion coefficient) 106 times larger than colloids, the PS sphere mobility is strongly inhibited and Brownian motion suppressed, precluding any self-assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the structural stabilization of particles by gravity-driven bridging as in granular systems31 is also absent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, interactions in POs are dominated by inter-particle collisions and the matrixparticle elastic interactions that stick the spheres together, enabling the generation of non-equilibrium structures such as strings and sliding layers after shear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Comparison of polymer opals with colloidal and granular systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Dielectric spheres in water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b)

#@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Granular spheres piled together give bridging networks.Full size image', 'We show how shearing such a highly viscoelastic composite (E1 MPa, 106 Pa·s at low oscillation frequency, Supplementary Figs 1 and 2) provides strong forces for ordering in three dimensions at high speed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While some other ordering rheological systems (for example, colloidal glasses, gels) may exhibit a degree of viscoelasticity, as they are both viscous and elastic under deformation, the final PO structures here have a fully reversible stretch-tunability and mechanical stability/robustness, which is manifestly lacking in photonic crystals derived from either colloidal assembly or monolithic top-down methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The key characteristics of POs in this context are: first, a high volume fraction, which is here above 50%; second, they are highly viscoelastic, with modulus some 105 higher than the other cases described above; and third, very strong particlemedium interface bonding, with no continuous fluid medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our bending-induced oscillatory shear (BIOS) technique provides a controlled roll-to-roll process (for  greater than 100 m scale opal films), and allows us to study the mechanism of ordering as well as develop a general purpose model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that POs crystallize only with sufficient strain, 300%, improving exponentially with the number of shear oscillations and reaching equilibrium after 40 oscillations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting nanoarchitecture is predominantly randomly stacked hexagonal close-packed r-hcp, with hcp layers randomly shifted to one of the two possible hollow-site positions, which in turn redistributes some of the X-ray Bragg peaks into characteristic extended one-dimensional features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with previous methods, this BIOS technique is a significant development for large-scale bulk manufacturing of ordered dense nanoparticle composites, is a generic approach, and can be generally applied to a very wide range of precursors (although requiring shell encapsulation).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'PO film fabrication and the mechanism of BIOS', 'Instead of simply blending PS spheres and PEA matrix (as they cannot be suitably mixed), POs are fabricated from PS-PMMA-PEA core-shell particles 223 nm in diameter (Fig 2a), and volume ratio between the components of 34:10:56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The core-shell spheres are synthesized by emulsion polymerization (Fig 2b)26,32, and put through our standard extrusion-rolling-lamination procedure for film production (Fig 2d)25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PEA shell softens when heated, and fills all the interstices between the spheres under stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this stage the films exhibit only faint colours from incoherent Mie scattering off the randomly packed low-index contrast spheres33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PMMA interlayer covalently grafts the PEA chains to the PS spheres, providing strong particlematrix interactions so that the spheres contribute to the resistance against stress34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Otherwise, as in template infiltration35, the weak bonding between spheres and matrix concentrates deformation energy in the matrix instead of onto the spheres which loses all crystallization (Supplementary Fig 3)36,37.

sandwich theory, an extension of the Timoshenko linear beam theory), as the PET is far more rigid than the PO, with deformation occurring due to core shear (Supplementary Fig 2)38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By bending this laminate around a cylinder, strong shear is created inside the PO purely parallel to the surface, as shown in the composite optical microscope image of the sample shear strain

180° bend of the PO film around the roller depicted, this gives  increasing up to 300% in accordance with both experimental and Abaqus finite element analysis simulation results (Fig 3b,c, Supplementary Discussions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we discuss below, the direction of shear orients the close-packed lines of spheres in each hcp plane controlling the in-plane ordering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus employ two variants of the BIOS process in which either the shear direction through the rollers is maintained as unidirectional (U-BIOS), or we provide a bidirectional roller alignment (B-BIOS) where it is first sheared along the x direction and then along a 30° twisted direction (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allows us to investigate also the effects of shear direction on the anisotropy of the ordering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Ordered PO films are obtained after this BIOS process, exhibiting bright structural colours (Figs 2e and 4) from Bragg diffraction at wavelength , where dhkl is the plane spacing,  is the mean refractive index for POs, and  is the incident angle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After BIOS, the spheres are found to be packed in hcp planes with the most close-packed direction parallel to the x direction (Fig 2e, inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BIOS effects depends on shear strain , shear rate  and temperature T (Supplementary Figs 5 and 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with colloids and granular systems where crystals are obtained with  less_than 100% (refs 40, 41), here crystallization of POs demands larger  because sufficient shear stress is needed to shift particles well beyond the yield strain to facilitate their repositioning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be further seen in terms of the microscopic forces between particles in the specific case of POs; the elastic nature of the shells dictate that frictional contact forces between adjacent particles are extremely high.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, small movements are accommodated by the elastic shell, without resulting in any permanent repositioning of the shellshell boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Above a critical strain (and shear), however, the frictional shell forces are overcome (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use T=120 °C, =300% and  s1 for the samples discussed below unless stated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'BIOS-induced crystallization', 'Understanding how oscillatory shear works in the PO system to produce crystallization is daunting due to the complex interactions and challenging structural characterization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed understanding is obtained here by combining optical spectroscopy and microscopy in k-space, focussed ion beam plus scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) in real space42, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) in reciprocal space43 and simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Optical spectra demonstrate that crystallization occurs rapidly during BIOS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By measuring normal incidence reflection and transmission of PO samples (Fig 5), we observe a steady opening of the photonic stopband with increasing passes of BIOS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In reflection, a Bragg diffraction peak appears immediately after one pass of U-BIOS and B-BIOS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peak intensity increases and the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) decreases, both with exponential rates of 5±1 passes reaching full equilibrium after 40 passes (Fig 5f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the U-BIOS films saturate with resonant reflectivity near 0.4 at =565 nm and FWHM of 40 nm, the B-BIOS samples have larger reflectivities near 0.5, longer wavelength of 570 nm and narrower resonance of 30 nm indicating a slightly larger lattice spacing and greater order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar trends are found in transmission, with the B-BIOS dip at 562 nm red-shifted from the U-BIOS dip at 558 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in contrast to reflection, the U-BIOS transmission dip is now both deeper and sharper than that from B-BIOS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the surface planes of the sample (of which =20 layers are probed by reflection, dependent on refractive index contrast n=0.11) are more ordered in B-BIOS, while the deep bulk of the sample that is probed in transmission is better ordered in U-BIOS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is also supported by the better short wavelength transmission (around 450 nm) in U-BIOS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This trade-off between surface and bulk order will be accounted for below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expected angle dependence of the Bragg peak in specular reflection is seen (Supplementary Figs 79) indicating the dominant layered ordering produced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only evidence of additional bandgaps is seen at high angles along the y direction in U-BIOS samples44,45, suggesting the presence of (200)-type planes from more three-dimensional (3D)-ordered fcc crystals (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirm that optical properties of both the top and bottom surfaces of the films are identical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Normal incidence reflectance and transmittance of polymer opal films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Reflectance of B-BIOS samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Reflectance of

et al.)25,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While more difficult to precisely quantify in these earlier experiments, this threshold level of strain clearly exceeds the critical yield strain (25%) beyond which the lattice planes in the opal are found to start slipping past each other (see Kontogeorgos et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  )24, and optimal processing strain values are consistently found to be  greater than 100%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experiment results, especially with regard to the optical properties, show significant improvements in ordering going from 75 to 150% up to 300% strain amplitudes (Fig 5e,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We use FIB-SEM for characterising the real space structure of POs (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples are stained with RuO4 to enhance the electron density contrast (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slices in xy planes normal to the sample surface are successively cut with FIB, and imaged by in situ SEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 3D equilibrium structure of the sample with 40

We identify  greater than 200 well-ordered hcp layers after 40 passes, which theoretically should produce  greater than 90% Bragg reflection at normal incidence but the dislocations scatter a significant fraction of this light into a wider angular cone25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: FIB-SEM characterization of sphere locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Reconstructed 3D structure of PO sample

frequency, which gives the average layer spacing over the area (F=dhkl1) and the refractive contrast neff (Fig 6c,d, Supplementary Fig 20) reveal details of the BIOS mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Near the surface the initially disordered arrangement rapidly crystallizes, but with a spatial frequency F, which is 15% smaller in the surface layers compared with the bulk, emphasising the role of the nonlinear shear strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use the neff(z) distribution to predict the optical properties using a transfer matrix model (Supplementary Fig 21, Supplementary Discussions), which reveals that mainly the hcp layers between z=816 m contribute to the reflection peak at =570 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find excellent correlation (Fig 5f) between the average neff(z=1224 m) for different samples and their corresponding measured reflectivity amplitude (with background subtracted), which agrees well with simulations and explains why reflection from B-BIOS is higher than U-BIOS (Fig 5f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some samples, the rapidly changing distribution of layer spacings near the surface can elicit double-peak reflection features from deep and shallow layers, which are seen in both predictions and experiment (Supplementary Figs 6 and 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The average stacking and in-plane packing order of the hcp planes can be characterized with SAXS (relying on such large and uniform samples)47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extracting the form factor from disordered samples, allows the SAXS scattering to be normalized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indexing in the hexagonal coordinate system (Fig 7a)49, the scattering intensity in reciprocal space is obtained for different samples at normal incidence (Fig 7, Supplementary Figs 23 and 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before shearing, diffraction rings from the amorphous structures are seen, but these steadily organize into hexagonal patterns of diffraction spots with increasing BIOS passes, tracking the crystallization process and formation of hcp planes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The in-plane order can be assessed from the shapes of the spots, primarily from the (100) and () spots on the first-order ring, which are subject to detailed analysis (Supplementary Fig 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the FWHM of the spots in the azimuthal direction (long axis) s and in the radial direction (short axis) r both decrease exponentially with increasing passes of BIOS, indicating clear improvement of the hcp plane packing order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the results also show that U-BIOS induces better orientational order than B-BIOS, while B-BIOS induces better positional order in the y direction than U-BIOS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that U-BIOS creates more line dislocations with Burgers vector parallel to y while B-BIOS anneals these dislocations but orders the bulk less well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These line dislocations are confirmed by analysing the Bragg spot () from optical scattering experiments (Supplementary Figs 26 and 27)50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strong anisotropy is observed in the strength of spots on the same diffraction ring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The integrated intensity of the () spots is much higher than those of (100) spots in both B-BIOS and U-BIOS samples, with a contrast increasing with more passes (and twice as strong in U-BIOS as in B-BIOS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contrast is reversed for second-order spots (200) and (020).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using simulations49, we explain this anisotropy from a sliding layer model (Supplementary Figs 2831) in which the hcp layers are shifted in both x and y directions from their ideal close-packed lattice registries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These shifts create different phases for the layers and strongly modulate scattering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The layers in U-BIOS and B-BIOS shift differently, thus resulting in different anisotropies in SAXS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our models agree with the FIB-SEM results, which show that spheres of nearest layers are shifted away from the

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In addition to a clear demonstration of large-scale assembly using this BIOS method, our work provides the first experimental determination of the detailed PO structure, and new physical insights into the microscopic mechanisms behind crystallization of this rheologically unique system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The general principles underpinning BIOS can thus be applied in many ways including ordering of widely varying nanoparticle sizes, and even mixtures with polydispersity exceeding 20% which are normally impossible to order54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, anisotropic nanoparticles should have even further improved degrees of ordering, delivering a range of nematic phases in flexible films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be particularly interesting in the case of cellulose nanorods, which are known to produce intense structural colours but take days to form chiral nematic phases55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shearing of nanoparticle systems in this fashion also acts to segregate nano components into stacks of ordered two-dimensional layers, opening up many new possible architectures.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
