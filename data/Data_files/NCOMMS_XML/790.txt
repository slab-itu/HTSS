Sec3 promotes the initial binary t-SNARE complex assembly and membrane fusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) constitute the core machinery for membrane fusion during eukaryotic cell vesicular trafficking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, how the assembly of the SNARE complex is initiated is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that Sec3, a component of the exocyst complex that mediates vesicle tethering during exocytosis, directly interacts with the t-SNARE protein Sso2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interaction promotes the formation of an Sso2-Sec9 binary t-SNARE complex, the early rate-limiting step in SNARE complex assembly, and stimulates membrane fusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystal structure of the Sec3-Sso2 complex suggests that Sec3 binding induces conformational changes of Sso2 that are crucial for the relief of its auto-inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, specific disruption of the Sec3Sso2 interaction in cells blocks exocytosis without affecting the function of Sec3 in vesicle tethering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study reveals an activation mechanism for SNARE complex assembly, and uncovers a role of the exocyst in promoting membrane fusion in addition to vesicle tethering.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Intracellular membrane fusion in eukaryotic cells is mediated by the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SNARE proteins reside on the targeting membrane (t-SNAREs) and vesicles (v-SNAREs), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They interact with each other to form a complex of four-helix bundle through their membrane-proximal SNARE motifs2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SNARE complex brings the vesicle and the target membrane to close apposition for fusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For exocytosis, the t-SNAREs include two sets of proteins, syntaxins and SNAP-23 homologues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most syntaxin proteins contain an N-terminal region that autonomously folds into a three-helix bundle (the Habc domain) that interacts intramolecularly with their SNARE motif to generate a closed conformation, which, in many cases, blocks its assembly into the SNARE complex3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the best-documented examples is the yeast exocytic SNAREs, which include Sso1/2 (syntaxin homologues), Sec9 (SNAP-23 homologue) and Snc1/2 (the v-SNARE)4,6,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies demonstrated that their assembly into a full complex consists of two steps: (1) binary interaction between the two t-SNAREs, Sso and Sec9; (2) the ternary interaction between the Sso/Sec9 t-SNARE complex and the v-SNARE protein Snc4,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rate-limiting step is the interaction between Sso and Sec9, which is hindered by the auto-inhibition of Sso.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Removal of the Habc domain of Sso or mutating the linker region between Habc and the SNARE motif significantly accelerates SNARE assembly4,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies also suggest that a similar auto-inhibition exists in mammalian and worm syntaxins, and it has been speculated that an activation mechanism exists to relieve their auto-inhibition3,5,7,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Elucidating the molecular mechanisms that control SNARE assembly is fundamental to our understanding of exocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the years, regulators of membrane fusion have been intensively studied in the exocytosis field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, most of these studies investigate fusion at a stage when the binary t-SNARE complexes are already assembled, a situation that is adapted for fast modes of secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanisms that control the initial assembly of the binary t-SNARE complex, which applies to membrane fusion in most eukaryotic cells, remain elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While the SNAREs drive fusion, the initial contact between the vesicles and their target membranes is mediated by proteins called tethers12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exocyst is an evolutionarily conserved octameric protein complex that mediates the tethering of post-Golgi secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exocyst consists of Sec3, Sec5, Sec6, Sec8, Sec10, Sec15, Exo70 and Exo84.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Work in budding yeast showed that mutations in the exocyst led to an accumulation of secretory vesicles and a block in secretion18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exocyst is specifically localized to the growing end of daughter cell (the bud tip) or mother-daughter cell junction (the bud neck), site of active exocytosis and surface expansion19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern of localization stands in contrast to that of the t-SNARE proteins Sso1/2 and Sec9, which are distributed throughout the plasma membrane20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is thought that the exocyst tethers the vesicles at specific regions of the plasma membrane before SNARE-mediated fusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report that the exocyst subunit Sec3 directly interacts with Sso1/2, and promotes the initial assembly of the Sso-Sec9 t-SNARE complex and stimulates membrane fusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have obtained the crystal structure of the Sec3Sso2 complex under two different crystallization conditions, both of which demonstrate that the binding of Sec3 leads to conformational changes on Sso that is crucial for the relief of its auto-inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cells, specific disruption of the Sec3Sso interaction blocks exocytosis without affecting vesicle tethering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study reveals a novel mechanism for the early rate-limiting step of SNARE complex assembly and membrane fusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it identifies a new role for the exocyst during exocytosis that is different from vesicle tethering.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Sec3 binds to the t-SNARE protein Sso2', 'Using the yeast 2-hybrid assay, we performed a pair-wise testing of all eight yeast exocyst subunits with the yeast t-SNARE protein Sso2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A positive interaction was found between Sec3 and Sso2, and the binding site was mapped to amino acid 1-320 of Sec3 (Sec3N) (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biochemical binding assay shows that in vitro translated Sec3 binds to Sso2 but not the endosomal SNARE protein Pep12 (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sso2 also co-immunoprecipitated with Sec3 from cell lysates, suggesting their interaction in cells (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recombinant Sec3N bound to both Sso2 (Fig 1c) and Sso1, a close paralog of Sso2 in yeast (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a negative control, glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged Exo70 fragment (a.a. 358623), which is of similar molecular weight to GST-Sec3N, did not bind to Sso2 (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have also examined the Sec3NSso2 interaction using size exclusion chromatography (SEC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two purified proteins were applied to a Superdex-200 16/60 column either individually or in mixture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1d, Sec3N and Sso2 formed a stable complex, which was later used for crystallization (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Sec3 interacts with Sso2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Full-length Sec3

unbound Sec3N.Full size image', 'Sec3 promotes the interaction between Sso2 and Sec9', 'Given that Sec3N directly interacts with Sso2, we tested whether Sec3 affects the formation of the binary Sso2-Sec9 t-SNARE complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GST-tagged Sec9 C-terminal SNARE domain (a.a. 414651) (Sec9C) was mixed with either His6-Sso2 alone or His6-Sso2 that was pre-incubated with Sec3N.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The binding of Sso2 to Sec9C was analysed by SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sec9C and Sso2 alone were found to form a complex slowly (Fig 2a, top panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of Sec3 significantly accelerated this interaction (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rate constant for the Sec9CSso2 interaction is 15.2±0.6 M1s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rate constant for the reaction with Sec3N pre-incubation is 200.3±90 M1s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We noticed that Sec3N dissociated from the assembled t-SNARE complex (Fig 2a, bottom panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further examine the relationship among these proteins, we immobilized GST-Sec3N on glutathione Sepharose, and tested its binding to Sso2 in the absence or presence of Sec9C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GST-Sec3N bound directly to Sso2, but not to Sec9C (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sec3N binding to Sso2 was lost when Sec9C was added in the binding reaction in different orders tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that while Sec3N promotes Sso2Sec9C interaction; Sec9C later displaces Sec3N from Sso2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result also suggests that Sec3 does not directly affect later v-SNARE

vitro fusion assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiment was first carried out using liposomes, into which both Sso2 and Sec9C had been incorporated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fusion was monitored as the de-quenching of NBD (N-7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole) fluorescence from rhodamine-conjugated phospholipids as previously described21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under this condition, Sec3N had no effect on the rate of fusion (Fig 3a, compare red and blue lines).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a control, addition of the dominant-negative cytoplasmic domain of the Snc2 inhibited the fusion reaction (Fig 3a, green line).

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'To date, a number of studies, especially those from the field of neurotransmission, have contributed tremendously to the understanding of SNARE assembly34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, mechanisms that control the initial binary t-SNARE formation remain elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In many cell types the t-SNAREs are not pre-assembled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in yeast, the majority of the t-SNARE proteins Sso and Sec9 are not in a complex with each other20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mammals, syntaxins and SNAP-25 only partially co-localize at the plasma membrane36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Factors promoting the initial t-SNARE interaction are clearly needed in cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we find that Sec3 promotes the assembly of the Sso2 and Sec9 binary t-SNARE complex, the first rate-limiting step in SNARE assembly during exocytosis4,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our liposome reconstitution assay demonstrates that Sec3 promotes fusion at a step before the Sec9Sso2 interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystal structure shows that Sec3 binds to the Hc and SNARE motif of Sso2, and causes 22° bending of the N terminus of the SNARE motif.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bending renders significant conformational changes at a region that links these two domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This region, consisting of HL1 and HL2, form a hydrophobic core that stabilizes the closed conformation of isolated Sso2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, HL2 occludes a significant portion of Sec9/SNAP-23-binding site on H3 for both yeast and mammalian SNAREs8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relaxation of the HL2 helical structure upon Sec3 binding disrupts the stability of the closed conformation of Sso2, and poises Sso2 for subsequent Sec9 binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supporting this model, our in vitro binding experiment shows that Sso2 with mutations that disrupt helix formation in HL2 has faster rate of assembly with Sec9 than the wild-type Sso2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Liposomes incorporated with the Sso2 HL2 mutant are faster than those with wild-type Sso2 in fusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, it was previously shown that mutations in Sso1 in the hydrophobic region, including I172A located in the HL2 of Sso1, destabilized the hydrophobic core and markedly accelerated the interaction between Sso1 and Sec9 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mammals, the L165A/E166A mutations in the linker region of syntaxin-1a promoted its transition from the closed to open state5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that the bending of the SNARE motif was not observed in either free Sso1 or the assembled SNARE complex2,8,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that Sec3 binding renders Sso2 to an intermediate state between the free and assembled SNARE, in which the SNARE motif is poised to dissociate from the inhibitory Habc domain when Sec9 is available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After Sec9 binding, Sec3 is displaced from the t-SNARE complex so that the final v- and t-SNARE complex can assemble.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the crystal structure, Sec3N has a PH-domain like structure that is well conserved from yeast to plants and human23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will be interesting to test whether the Sec3SNARE interaction is conserved in other eukaryotic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The exocyst belongs to the CATCHR family of multi-subunit tethering proteins14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These proteins may promote fusion by physically bringing the vesicles and the target membrane together before the action of the SNAREs, a function consistent with the concept of tethering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the Dsl1 complex forms a long tower-like structure that interacts with the t-SNAREs at the ER and the COPI vesicles39,40; Dsl1 may promote v- and t-SNARE assembly by capturing the vesicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During homotypic vacuolar fusion in yeast, the HOPS complex may promote fusion by tethering vacuoles and by the recruitment of the soluble SNARE Vam7 to the vacuolar membrane41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the exocyst may also contribute to fusion by tethering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sec6 has been found to interact with both Sec9 and the v-SNARE protein Snc1/2 (refs 43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Sec6 does not have any stimulatory effect on SNARE assembly or membrane fusion43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study showed that Sec6 binds to fully assembled SNAREs45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we propose a different model, in which Sec3 affects fusion by catalysing the binary t-SNARE interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This function is mediated by the N terminus of Sec3, which is separate from the C-terminal domain that mediates exocyst complex assembly and vesicle tethering29,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, disruption of the Sec3Sso2 interaction does not affect its ability to interact with Cdc42 and PI(4,5)P2, and its polarized localization to the bud tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ectopic tethering assay using mitochondria as a surrogate target organelle demonstrates that the Sso-binding-deficient sec3 mutant retains its ability to recruit other exocyst subunits as well as the secretory vesicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that the function of Sec3 in promoting fusion is distinct from its role in vesicle tethering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Golgi, it was previously reported the tethering protein p115 promotes SNARE assembly46,47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It would be interesting to examine whether such a catalytic role in membrane fusion exist for tethers in other stages of vesicular trafficking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Besides the exocyst, the Sec1/Munc18 (SM) family of proteins also has important roles in SNARE-mediated fusion, although different models have been proposed, depending on the cell type and stage of membrane trafficking49,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study showed that SM protein Sly1 accelerates the ER-Golgi SNARE assembly10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During homotypic fusion of yeast vacuoles, Vps33, the SM protein and a member of the HOPS tethering complex, binds to SNARE proteins in each vacuole, and registers them in the correct orientation for subsequent SNARE complex assembly51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sec1 in yeast binds to the fully assembled SNARE complex52; genetics analyses suggest that Sec1 functions both before and after SNARE assembly53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic analyses also place Sec1 at a step after the exocyst54,55,56, and it was shown that Sec1 binds to the exocyst57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is, therefore, possible that Sec3 first acts on Sso2 on its auto-inhibitory state and promotes the SNARE assembly before the action of Sec1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Beside the SM family, proteins with the MUN domain were also shown to regulate SNARE assembly during synaptic transmission58,59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was proposed that, during neuronal exocytosis, Munc13 relieves the inhibition of syntaxin-1 imposed by the SM protein Munc18 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In yeast, Sec3 does not work through a similar mechanism as observed in neurotransmission because Sec1 binds to Sso2 only when it is in the later fully assembled ternary SNARE complex49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, some members of the exocyst contain regions that are structurally similar to the MUN domain61,62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is, therefore, possible that, in addition to Sec3, other members of the exocyst also contribute to SNARE assembly during exocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this possibility, sec3N displays defects in exocytosis at 37 °C, but the defects is not clear at 25 °C (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29 and this study), and sec3N is synthetic lethal with a number of mutants including exo70 (refs 28, 63, 64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will be interesting to examine the role of other exocyst subunits in SNARE assembly and membrane fusion.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
