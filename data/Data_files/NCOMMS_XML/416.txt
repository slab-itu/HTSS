Laminin regulates PDGFR+ cell stemness and muscle development  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Muscle-resident PDGFR+ cells, which include pericytes and PW1+ interstitial cells (PICs), play a dual role in muscular dystrophy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They can either undergo myogenesis to promote muscle regeneration or differentiate into adipocytes and other cells to compromise regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How the differentiation and fate determination of PDGFR+ cells are regulated, however, remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, by utilizing a conditional knockout mouse line, we report that PDGFR+ cell-derived laminin inhibits their proliferation and adipogenesis, but is indispensable for their myogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we show that laminin alone is able to partially reverse the muscle dystrophic phenotype in these mice at the molecular, structural and functional levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further RNAseq analysis reveals that laminin regulates PDGFR+ cell differentiation/fate determination via gpihbp1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data support a critical role of laminin in the regulation of PDGFR+ cell stemness, identify an innovative target for future drug development and may provide an effective treatment for muscular dystrophy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive degeneration and weakness of muscles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD), a severe type of MD, usually has its onset at or near birth and affects almost all the voluntary muscles in the body1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although physical therapy and other medical management have been found beneficial, there are no effective treatments for this devastating disorder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stem cells with myogenic activity have been suggested as a promising therapy for MD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Satellite cells, postnatal myogenic precursor cells, demonstrate great potential by actively repairing muscle damage and promoting regeneration after injury2,3,4,5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their clinical application, however, is hampered by their limited migration ability8, low survival rate after injection9,10 and reduced differentiation potency after expansion11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to satellite cells, muscle-resident PDGFR+ cells also have myogenic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using lineage-tracing technique, we found that PDGFR+ cells include two populations: pericytes and PICs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is evidence showing that pericytes, multipotent perivascular cells12, can differentiate into myogenic cells and repair damage after muscle injury12,13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pericytes, on the other hand, can also differentiate into adipocytes, which contribute to muscle degeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been demonstrated that PICs are myogenic in vitro and contribute to skeletal muscle regeneration efficiently in vivo17,18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that PDGFR+ cells may be used to treat MD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How PDGFR+ cell stemness (self-renewal, differentiation and fate determination) is regulated remains unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under physiological conditions, these cells are embedded in the basement membrane21, which usually gets degraded upon injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This direct contact suggests that the basement membrane may regulate the stemness of PDGFR+ cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Laminin, a trimeric protein containing -, - and -subunits, is a major component of the basement membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of laminin 2 (Lama2) subunit leads to progressive MD and has been used as a mouse model of CMD22,23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent research demonstrates that laminin-111 (laminin-111) is able to reduce muscle pathology, enhance viability and improve muscle repair in a Lama2-deficient CMD model26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, laminin-111 also significantly improves muscle pathology and increases muscle strength/resistance in mdx mice28,29, a Duchenne muscular dystrophy model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data strongly suggest a therapeutic function of laminin in MD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanism underlying laminins beneficial role in CMD, however, remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies in our lab showed that (i) astrocyte-derived laminin maintains the bloodbrain barrier integrity by preventing brain pericytes differentiating from the resting stage to the contractile stage30 and (ii) aortic stem/progenitor cell-derived laminin modulates their proliferation and differentiation, contributing to blood pressure regulation31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that PDGFR+ cells also produce laminin that covers themselves in skeletal muscles, we hypothesized that PDGFR+ cell-derived laminin regulates their stemness in skeletal muscles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By using conditional knockout mice with laminin deficiency in PDGFR+ cells and RNAseq analysis, we show that (i) PDGFR+ cell-derived laminin negatively regulates their proliferation and adipogenesis, but promotes their myogenesis, (ii) gpihbp1 is an important mediator of these effects and (iii) laminin-111 is able to partially rescue the muscle phenotype in these mice at molecular, structural and functional levels.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Loss of PDGFR+ cell-derived laminin leads to MD', 'We generated homozygous Laminin 1 (Lamc1) floxed (F/F) mice by targeting the exon 2 of Lamc1 gene as described previously32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The F/F mice were then crossed with Pdgfr-Cre transgenic mice to generate F/F:Pdgfr-Cre+ (termed PKO) mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PKO mice were born at the Mendelian ratio and were indistinguishable from their heterozygous and wild-type littermates at early postnatal stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starting from approximately postnatal day (P)10, the PKO mice became significantly smaller than their littermate controls (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PKO mice usually died within 4 months as demonstrated by their survival rate (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the PKO mice developed a severe skeletal muscle deficit (Fig 1d), similar to that in Lama2-deficient mice, a widely used genetic model of CMD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All hindlimb muscles, including tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, soleus, plantaris and gastrocnemius, were significantly smaller in the PKO mice 7 and 24 weeks after birth (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining revealed well-developed myofibres in 2-month-old control muscles (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The myofibres in age-matched PKO muscles, however, varied in size and contained centrally nucleated nuclei (Fig 1f), suggesting active muscle degeneration/regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like the Lama2-deficient mice33,34,35,36,37, the PKO mice also showed signs of muscle necrosis and fibrosis in pathological analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a large number of nuclei were observed in the interstitium of the PKO muscles (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further immunohistochemical analyses revealed significantly increased infiltration of T cells (Fig 1g,i) and macrophages (Fig 1h,i) in the PKO muscles, compared with the controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inflammatory cell infiltration, a hallmark of CMD38, is also observed in the Lama2-deficient mice33,35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these changes, electron microscopy study revealed well-developed myofibres wrapped by a clearly defined basement membrane in control mice (Fig 1j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the PKO muscles, however, well-developed myofibres and a clearly defined basement membrane were missing and were instead replaced by gaps (#, Fig 1j) containing adipocytes with lipid droplets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we also performed CD31 staining and found no differences in CD31 density or intensity between the control and PKO mice (Fig 1k,l), suggesting that the observed phenotype is less likely due to vascular defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the muscle pathology (Supplementary Fig 1a and b) and inflammatory cell infiltration (Supplementary Fig 1c) were absent in the PKO mice at P6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A time-course study showed that the PKO phenotype started at approximately P10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous study demonstrated that in the Lama2-deficient mice, muscle pathology appeared at P9 and became apparent at P14 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our data demonstrate that the gross phenotype, muscle pathology and timing of disease onset/development are comparable between the PKO mice and Lama2-deficient mice, suggesting that the PKO mice may be used to study CMD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

the Ai14 reporter line, which contains a floxed STOP sequence before tdTomato (TdT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the resulting Ai14:Pdgfr-Cre+ mice, TdT expression co-localized with pericyte marker PDGFR (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Satellite cell maker Pax7 (Fig 2b), fibro/adipogenic progenitor (FAP) marker PDGFR (Fig 2c) and endothelial marker CD31 (Fig 2e) rarely co-localized with TdT, suggesting that Lamc1 is not targeted in these cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, PW1, a marker for PICs, co-localized with TdT (Fig 2d), suggesting that Lamc1 in PICs is also targeted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we also examined the expression pattern of these markers with TdT in F/F:Ai14:Pdgfr-Cre+ mice and similar results were found (Supplementary Fig 2a-e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these mice, hematopoietic (CD45+) cells infiltrated into the muscles and they were not labelled by TdT (Supplementary Fig 2f), suggesting that the floxed allele is not targeted in these CD45+ cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these data, we found dramatically reduced laminin 1 expression in PDGFR+ cells in the PKO muscles (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The western blots showed similar results (Fig

expression on these cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence-minus-one control for PDGFR-PE was used to set its gating (Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Laminin 1 expression was observed in sorted control but not the PKO cells (Fig 3b), indicating that laminin expression is indeed diminished in PDGFR+ cells in the PKO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the cell types in PDGFR+ population, we checked the expression of various markers on these cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sorted PDGFR+ cells expressed either pericyte markers, including NG2, CD13, SMA and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or PIC marker PW1 (Fig 3c and Supplementary Fig 4a and b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These PDGFR+ cells, however, were negative for satellite cell marker SM/C-2.6 and FAP marker PDGFR (Fig 3c), suggesting that sorted PDGFR+ cells contain pericytes and PICs, but not satellite cells or FAPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we also isolated satellite cells39,40, FAPs41,42,43 and PICs17 from the control and PKO muscles by FACS (Fig 3d,g,j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Representative plots and gating boundaries were shown in Supplementary Fig 3bd.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sorted satellite cells expressed SM/C-2.6 and Pax7, but were negative for PDGFR, CD13, PDGFR and fibroblast marker Reticular (Fig 3e and Supplementary Fig 4c and d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparable levels of laminin 1 were observed in satellite cells from the control and PKO mice (Fig 3f), suggesting that laminin expression is not affected in satellite cells in the PKO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sorted FAPs expressed PDGFR, but were negative for PDGFR, CD13 and Pax7 (Fig 3h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like satellite cells, laminin 1 expression was unaffected in FAPs isolated from the PKO mice (Fig 3i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous report, sorted PICs were PW1+Pax7 (Fig 3k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells also expressed PDGFR (Fig 3k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to satellite cells and FAPs, laminin 1 expression was absent in PICs isolated from the PKO mice (Fig 3l).

whether this is due to proliferation, we examined the incorporation of Edu, a BrdU analogue, in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the control, 10-fold more Edu+ cells were found in the PKO muscles (Fig 4a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Double immunostaining revealed significantly more proliferating pericytes (PDGFR+Edu+ and ALP+Edu+) in the PKO muscles (Fig 4a,c), suggesting that loss of PDGFR+ cell-derived laminin leads to proliferation of these cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the time-course study, no differences in PDGFR expression and PDGFR+Ki67+ cell count were observed at P6 (Supplementary Fig 5a-c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next examined the proliferation of PDGFR+ cells in vitro and found that the PDGFR+ cells freshly isolated from PKO muscles incorporated significantly more Edu than those from control muscles (Fig 4d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, exogenous laminin (laminin-111) dramatically decreased Edu incorporation in the PDGFR+ cells isolated from the PKO but not control mice (Fig 4d,e), suggesting that laminin negatively regulates the proliferation of PDGFR+ cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, although more caspase-3+ cells were found in the PKO muscles,

anterior, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four days after the injury, a large number of Edu+ and PDGFR+ cells were observed in saline-injected tibialis anterior (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells, however, were dramatically reduced in laminin-injected tibialis anterior (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification revealed over 50% reduction in PDGFR intensity (Fig 4g), total Edu+ cells (Fig 4h) and

whether reduced gpihbp1 expression is responsible for loss of laminin-induced differentiation of PDGFR+ cells, we knocked down gpihbp1 expression in wild-type PDGFR+ cells by RNAi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

gpihbp1 using this construct (Fig 7f,g), we observed a significant increase in perilipin expression (Fig 7f) and a significant reduction in S-Myosin expression (Fig 7g), suggesting that gpihbp1

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this study, we show that PDGFR+ cell-derived laminin participates in muscle development/regeneration by negatively regulating the proliferation of PDGFR+ cells, inhibiting their adipogenesis and promoting their myogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are summarized in Fig 9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The novelty and significance of this work are (i) we generated a new mouse line, which can be used in CMD research; (ii) we found that laminin actively regulates the stemness of PDGFR+ cells; (iii) we showed that exogenous laminin is able to partially rescue the muscle deficit in the PKO mice at the molecular, structural and functional levels; and (iv) we performed RNAseq analysis and identified gpihbp1 as a key regulator and molecular target for the differentiation of the PDGFR+ cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 9: Schematic description of laminins role in the stemness of PDGFR+ cells.Laminin negatively regulates the proliferation of PDGFR+ cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, laminin promotes myogenesis and inhibits adipogenesis of PDGFR+ cells via gpihbp1.Full size image', 'One of the most widely used CMD models is the dy2J mice, which express near-normal amount of truncated protein due to a point mutation in the Lama2 gene22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although they replicate most of the pathological changes observed in human CMD patients, these dy2J mice develop muscle symptoms at late (about 3.5 weeks after birth) rather than early postnatal stage22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more aggressive CMD model is the Lama2-deficient mice33,34,56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mice show muscle defects at early postnatal stage, but have a severe deficit in myelination33,34,56, which contributes to the MD phenotype and makes the interpretation of data difficult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, most Lama2-deficient mice die within 24 weeks after birth33,34,56, preventing their use at a later stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like the Lama2-deficient mice, our PKO mice show muscle pathology in all voluntary muscles beginning at early postnatal stage (about P10) and progress rapidly, which closely replicates the time course observed in CMD patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, since only PDGFR+ cell-derived laminin is abrogated in the PKO mice, myelination defect is not detected in these mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the PKO mice have a longer life span compared with the Lama2-deficient mice, enabling research at an older age possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted, however, that (i) there are no known human CMD patients with Lamc1 mutations and (ii) like the dy2J and Lama2-deficient mice, the PKO mice are smaller in size, a phenotype not associated with human CMD pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data suggest that the PKO line may be used as an alternative, if not better, model in CMD research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Lineage-tracing experiment and immunocytochemical analyses reveal that the PDGFR+ population we isolated contains pericytes and PICs, but not satellite cells or FAPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our model, wild-type PDGFR+ cells undergo myogenesis and contribute to muscle development/regeneration, suggesting that these cells, like satellite cells, have myogenic capability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are consistent with previous reports that transplantation of human pericytes into immune-deficient mdx mice generates myofibres expressing human dystrophy13, that pericytes participate in postnatal muscle growth/regeneration in both physiological and pathological conditions12, and that PICs are myogenic in vitro and contribute to muscle regeneration in vivo17,18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The next question then becomes: what are the differences between these cells and satellite cells in term of myogenesis?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A time-course study demonstrated that satellite cells and pericytes have different kinetics in the expression of various myogenic transcription factors13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another study elegantly showed that Pax7 is indispensable for the myogenic specification of PICs, whereas loss of Pax7 does not affect the proliferation and differentiation potential of satellite cells in vitro17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies strongly indicate that pericytes, PICs and satellite cells are three different populations with distinct myogenic kinetics and potentials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, three labs independently report that muscle regeneration fails when Pax7+ satellite cells are genetically ablated2,3,4, suggesting that the myogenesis of pericytes and/or PICs is dependent on the presence of satellite cell population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On loss of laminin, the PDGFR+ cells diminish their myogenic activity and obtain enhanced adipogenic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is consistent with previous findings that both pericytes16,21 and PICs17,20 have adipogenic potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We, for the first time, report that laminin regulates the differentiation and determines the fate of PDGFR+ cells (pericytes and PICs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, collagen IV, another component of the basement membrane, has been shown to control the self-renewal of satellite cells and regulate muscle regeneration40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that the basement membrane, which has direct contact with PDGFR+ cells and satellite cells, is more than just a supporting matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It more likely serves as an important niche to regulate the biological properties of these cells, probably via signalling the cells using its components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies on how individual basement membrane components regulate the biological properties of these cells and how they interact with each other to form a cohesive/coordinate network will significantly enrich our knowledge on basement membrane biology and promote innovative therapies for many diseases, including MD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although laminin significantly improved muscle pathology/function, the PKO mice were still smaller and their muscles were weaker compared with age-matched controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This partial recovery may be due to the local (only hindlimbs) intramuscular injection of laminin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to previous reports that systemic administration of laminin-111 reduced muscle pathology in Lama2-deficient mice26,27, we found intramuscular injection to be more efficient in the PKO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discrepancy may be explained by the compromised vessel integrity in Lama2-deficient mice57, which may allow for the leakage of systemically delivered laminin to target organs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted, however, that intramuscular injection of laminin is impractical for human CMD patients owing to the large muscle size and limited diffusion of laminin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To find an alternative therapeutic option, we performed RNAseq analysis and identified gpihbp1 as a molecular target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies demonstrate that gpihbp1 is expressed in capillary endothelial cells and transports lipoprotein lipase from interstitial space to capillary lumen to regulate lipid metabolism51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains unclear, however, whether PDGFR+ pericytes, which cover endothelial cells in capillaries, are involved in this process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We, for the first time, report that PDGFR+ cells also express gpihbp1, suggesting that these cells may also regulate lipid metabolism and/or lipoprotein lipase transportation, possibly via gpihbp1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we show that gpihbp1 reversibly regulates the myogenesis and adipogenesis of PDGFR+ cells, indicating a critical role of gpihbp1 in PDGFR+ cell differentiation/fate determination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeting gpihbp1 may open new opportunities in developing effective therapies for CMD and other types of MD.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
