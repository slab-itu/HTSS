Splicing misregulation of SCN5A contributes to cardiac-conduction delay and heart arrhythmia in myotonic dystrophy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is caused by the expression of mutant RNAs containing expanded CUG repeats that sequester muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins, leading to alternative splicing changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cardiac alterations, characterized by conduction delays and arrhythmia, are the second most common cause of death in DM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using RNA sequencing, here we identify novel splicing alterations in DM heart samples, including a switch from adult exon 6B towards fetal exon 6A in the cardiac sodium channel, SCN5A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that MBNL1 regulates alternative splicing of SCN5A mRNA and that the splicing variant of SCN5A produced in DM presents a reduced excitability compared with the control adult isoform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, reproducing splicing alteration of Scn5a in mice is sufficient to promote heart arrhythmia and cardiac-conduction delay, two predominant features of myotonic dystrophy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, misregulation of the alternative splicing of SCN5A may contribute to a subset of the cardiac dysfunctions observed in myotonic dystrophy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Myotonic dystrophy (DM), the most common adult-onset muscular dystrophy, includes two genetically distinct forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DM of type 1 (DM1) and its severe congenital form (CDM1) are caused by an expansion of CTG repeats in the 3-untranslated region (UTR) of the DMPK gene1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, DM of type 2 (DM2) is caused by an expansion of CCTG repeats within the first intron of the CNBP (also known as ZNF9) gene4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The pathogenesis of DM involves a RNA gain-of-function mechanism caused by expression of mutant RNAs containing hundred to thousands of CUG or CCUG repeats that interfere with the splicing of other pre-mRNAs through dysfunction of two classes of RNA-binding proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MBNL proteins (MBNL1, MBNL2 and MBNL3) are sequestered within nuclear RNA foci formed by expanded CUG and CCUG repeats5,6, whereas expression and phosphorylation of CUG-binding protein 1 (CUGBP1, encoded by the CELF1 gene) are increased in DM1 heart samples7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MBNL and CUGBP1 proteins regulate alternative splicing, and alterations of their functional levels in myotonic dystrophic tissues results in reversion to fetal splicing patterns for several mRNAs, such as the insulin receptor (INSR) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8), the muscle chloride channel (CLCN1) (refs 9, 10), dystrophin (DMD) (refs 11, 12) and key components of the skeletal muscle excitationcontraction coupling process, including amphiphysin2 (BIN1) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13), ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14), sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase SERCA1 (ATP2A1) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14) and the muscle calcium channel CaV1.1 (CACNA1S) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Misregulation of the alternative splicing of the insulin receptor INSR, CLCN1 and DMD mRNAs are associated with the insulin resistance8, myotonia9,10,16 and dystrophic process12, respectively, while alterations of the alternative splicing of BIN1, RYR1, ATP2A1 and CACNA1S may contribute to the skeletal muscle weakness observed in DM13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In contrast, the molecular mechanisms underlying the cardiac defects, which affect 80% of individuals with DM and represent the second most common cause of death in this disease17,18, are yet to be defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cardiac involvements in DM are characterized by cardiac-conduction delay that may result in fatal atrio-ventricular block, and by atrial or ventricular tachycardia17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electrocardiography (ECG) analyses in DM patients indicate prolonged conduction time from the sinoatrial node to the ventricles (PR interval) and elongated ventricular depolarization (QRS duration).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, cardiac dysfunctions in DM are reminiscent in some aspect to an alteration of the cardiac sodium current.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The -subunit of the cardiac voltage-gated Na+ channel, Nav1.5, is encoded by the SCN5A gene and plays a key role in the excitability of cardiomyocytes and for rapid propagation of the impulse through the cardiac-conduction system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations in SCN5A lead to a variety of arrhythmic disorders, including long QT3, progressive and non-progressive cardiac-conduction disease (also known as Lev-Lenègre disease), atrial fibrillation, sick sinus syndrome, Brugada syndrome and numerous overlapping syndromes19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using transcriptomic approaches, we identified various novel splicing changes in heart samples of DM1 individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the RNA motifs enriched in the vicinity of these misregulated exons indicates that sequestration of the MBNL proteins is probably the main cause of splicing misregulation in heart of individuals with DM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these novel splicing alterations, we focused on misregulation of alternative splicing of the SCN5A pre-mRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This splicing alteration results in expression of a fetal isoform of SCN5A with altered electrophysiological properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of importance, we demonstrate that reproducing the splicing alteration of Scn5a in mouse is sufficient to cause heart arrhythmia and cardiac-conduction delay with elevated PR interval, which are key characteristics of the heart alterations observed in DM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that altered splicing of SCN5A mRNA may participate to the electrical cardiac abnormalities observed in DM.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Identification of splicing changes in DM heart samples', 'To determine novel splicing abnormalities in DM heart samples, we first used whole-genome microarrays (GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST array) on polyadenylated RNA extracted from left ventricle samples of three adult DM1 patients compared with three age-matched control individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bioinformatic analyses predicted significant (Fold Change 2, Sudent t-test, P value 0.01) changes in the splicing of 24 exons between control and DM1 samples (Supplementary Table 1), including a misregulation of the alternative splicing of the SCN5A pre-mRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To extend this analysis, we performed paired-end RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on the same DM1 and control heart samples, yielding 1,611 million of mapped 100 bp reads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DESeq and Cuffdiff were then applied to estimate differential gene expression and over or under-expressed mRNAs were selected by using the Benjamini and Hochberg adjusted P values (false discovery rate (FDR) 0.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 9 and 19 upregulated genes were predicted differentially expressed with DESeq and Cuffdiff, respectively, but none were confirmed by quantitative real-time RT-qPCR analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This low number of differentially expressed mRNAs suggests that cardiac pathology in DM is not associated with drastic modifications of gene expression levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, DEXSeq (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22), which tests differential exon usage between two conditions, predicted 134 significant (Log2 Fold Change 1.2, FDR 0.1) alternative splicing changes between control and DM1 heart samples (Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, MISO (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23) analysis, which computes the fraction of mRNA that includes a given cassette alternative exon, predicted 259 significant (PSI 0.3; Z-score 1.2) alternative splicing changes between control and DM1 heart samples (Fig 1a and Supplementary Data 2), including a robust misregulation of the alternative splicing of SCN5A (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MISO and DEXSeq predictions overlapped, but with some exceptions, such as the skipping of the consecutive exons 18, 19 and 20 of CAMK2B predicted by DEXSeq but not by MISO; or the shift of SCN5A exon 6B towards exon 6A identified by MISO but not by DEXSeq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences are inherent to their computation models, since MISO does not detect alterations of successive exons and DEXSeq does not identify mutually exclusive exons, highlighting that MISO and DEXSeq are complementary bioinformatics approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we tested by PCR with reverse transcription (RTPCR) forty candidate mRNAs having the highest probability of misregulation in DEXSeq and/or MISO analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We validated splicing alterations for 32 of them, including some that have been identified in previous studies (TNNT2, TNNT3, ABLIM1, LDB3, MBNL1, CAMK2B, MAPT and so on)24,25,26, and 20 others that represent, to the best of our knowledge, novel alterations of alternative splicing (ADD3, GOLGA4, CRTC2, ARHGEF10L, ANK3, DCLK2, EPN2, UNC13B, TECR, ARVCF, SOCS7, CELF1 and so on) in DM1 heart samples (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of interest, some of these splicing alterations may be of pathological consequence in DM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, knockout of the Socs7 gene in mouse results in insulin resistance27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether the splicing misregulation of SOCS7 in DM contributes to insulin resistance remains to be tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, RNA sequencing predicts an increased retention of the penultimate intron of FCGRT, which encodes the Fc fragment of the IgG receptor transporter  (FCRN) protein, involved in IGG recycling28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether splicing alteration of FCGRT in DM is responsible to the decreased level of IGG in blood of these patients is an attractive hypothesis that remains to be tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, RNA sequencing predicts misregulation of the alternative splicing of a cardiac-specific exon located in the 5-UTR of CELF1, which encodes CUGBP1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether this alternative splicing may contribute to the increase levels of CUGBP1 protein observed in DM1 hearts remains also to be evaluated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Identification of novel splicing misregulations in

repeats interfere with the functional levels of CUGBP1 and MBNL proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Earlier studies determined that MBNL proteins bind to YGC RNA motifs (where Y is a pyrimidine)29,30,31,32, while CUGBP1 binds to UGU-enriched sequences33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether these RNA motifs are indeed present in the vicinity of exons misregulated in DM, we determined all 4-mer RNA motifs enriched within, upstream or downstream of the exons predicted as misregulated by MISO in DM1 heart samples, compared with 2,000 control exons (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most RNA motifs significantly enriched (binomial test, P value 1.0 107) contained YGC sequences, while none were found to contain UGU sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, YGC sequences were enriched upstream of exons abnormally included in DM1, while YGC motifs were enriched downstream of exons repressed in DM1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results matched the MBNL splicing regulatory map determined by CLIP experiments, where binding of MBNL upstream of an exon tends to inhibit exon inclusion whereas binding of MBNL downstream of an exon generally stimulates exon inclusion35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, we found no enriched motifs for other RNA-binding proteins, including CUGBP1, rbFOX1, hnRNP H or Staufen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results, as well as previous data36,37,38, support a model in which titration of MBNL proteins is the main cause of splicing change in DM1 heart, while misregulation of other RNA-binding proteins may contribute to a subset of splicing alterations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

image', 'Splicing of SCN5A is misregulated in DM heart samples', 'Both microarray and RNA-seq predicted misregulation of alternative splicing of SCN5A pre-mRNA in DM1 heart samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Splicing of SCN5A is developmentally regulated, such that exon 6A is included in fetal heart but rapidly replaced by exon 6B after birth39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, SCN5A exon 6A is named as embryonic or fetal, while exon 6B is known as adult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exons 6A and 6B are mutually exclusive exons encoding part of the voltage sensor, segments 3 and 4 located in the domain I of the sodium channel (Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are key segments for the electrical activity of the sodium channel, and inclusion of either fetal exon 6A or adult exon 6B results in channel isoforms, named, respectively, hNav1.5e and hNav1.5, with different electrophysiological properties39,40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed our microarray and RNA-seq predictions by RTPCR and found that adult SCN5A exon 6B is partly replaced by its fetal exon 6A in heart samples of individuals with DM, including adult DM1 and adult DM2 cases (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that to differentiate exon 6B from exon 6A that have the exact same length of 92 bp, we took advantage of a BstbI restriction site present only in exon 6A, which thus appears as a BstbI-digested doublet band in Fig 3c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with the recent report of a splicing misregulation of SCN5A in one DM1 heart sample42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although splicing of SCN5A is misregulated in DM1, we observed no correlation between the percentage of SCN5A exon 6A inclusion and the increased duration of the PR interval and only a very limited, if any, correlation between misregulation of SCN5A exon 6A splicing and alteration of the QRS duration in individuals with DM1 (R2 of 0.2 with six DM1 samples; Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Misregulation of SCN5A splicing was specific to DM, as we did not observe inclusion of exon 6A in heart samples from individual affected with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, misregulation of splicing in DM1 was specific and not global, as we observed no splicing changes of SCN5A alternative exon 18, of CACNA1C mutually exclusive exons 8A and 8B, of KCNAB1 alternative exons 2 and 11, or of KCNQ1 alternative exons 2 and 5 (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we observed no significant alteration of the expression level of SCN5A mRNA by quantitative real-time RT-qPCR (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these results indicate a specific misregulation of alternative splicing of SCN5A resulting in expression of a fetal form of this channel in adult DM heart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with previous studies where alternative splicing changes in DM resume a MBNL-dependent fetal splicing pattern that persist in adult tissues26,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Splicing of SCN5A exon 6A is altered in DM heart samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic representation of mutually exclusive exons 6A and 6B of SCN5A.

misregulation of SCN5A splicing, we first determined its splicing pattern in cell models of DM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since SCN5A is expressed at low level in culture of immature skeletal muscle cells, we investigated its splicing in primary cultures of differentiated skeletal muscle cells originating from muscle biopsies of control and DM1 individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RTPCR experiments determined a switch of exon 6B towards exon 6A in DM1 muscle cells compared with control, reproducing the splicing alteration observed in cardiac tissue (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of technical interest, the basal level of exon 6A inclusion was higher in muscle cell cultures than in adult heart samples (compare Fig 4a to Fig 3c), which probably reflect the immature aspect of cell cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since mutant RNAs containing expanded CUG or CCUG repeats interfere with alternative splicing through titration of MBNL proteins, we tested whether MBNL1 regulates SCN5A splicing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduction of MBNL1 expression through a siRNA-mediated approach in human control primary muscle cells mimicked the effect of CUG repeats and promoted a switch from adult exon 6B towards fetal exon 6A (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blotting analysis confirmed the successful depletion of MBNL1 expression (Supplementary Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we assessed alternative splicing of Scn5A in heart samples of Mbnl knockout mice43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RTPCR analysis shows that inclusion of the exon 6A of Scn5a is increased in heart samples of mice with no Mbnl1 and reduced level of Mbnl2 (Mbnl1/, Mbnl2+/)(Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increased inclusion of Scn5a exon 6A in Mbnl knockout mice is significant (Student t-test, P value 0.01) but rather mild, probably reflecting difference in regulation of alternative splicing between human and mouse or the compensatory effect of residual Mbnl2 expression43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis is consistent with the mild splicing alteration of Scn5A observed in the sole Mbnl1 knockout mice44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these results suggest that MBNL proteins regulate the alternative splicing of SCN5A exons 6A and 6B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether this regulation is direct or indirect, we constructed a minigene containing exons 6A and 6B of SCN5A bordered by their intronic regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of this construct in mouse C2C12 myoblasts reproduced a fetal pattern with mainly inclusion of exon 6A (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since inclusion of exon 6B was repressed, reduction of Mbnl1 activity through siRNA or expression of expanded CUG repeats had no further repressive effect on exon 6B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, expression of MBNL1 promoted a switch from fetal exon 6A towards adult exon 6B, while expression or siRNA-mediated depletion of CUGBP1 had no effect (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blotting analysis confirmed that siRNA transfection efficiently reduced endogenous Mbnl1 or Cugbp1 expression (Supplementary Fig 3B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, gel-shift assays determined that recombinant purified GST-tagged MBNL1 bound to UGC RNA motifs located upstream of exon 6A (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of interest, this UGC sequence is absent from the mouse genome, which may explain the mild splicing alteration of Scn5A observed in mice knockout for Mbnl proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutation of these UGC motifs abolished MBNL1 binding (Fig 4f), as well as the regulatory effect of MBNL1 on a mutant SCN5A minigene (Fig 4g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these results establish that

channel variants with different electrophysiological properties39,40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the consequences of the switch from SCN5A exon 6B towards exon 6A observed in DM, we first examined in Xenopus oocytes the sodium currents generated by either hNav1.5e, the splice variant of SCN5A containing the fetal exon 6A, or hNav1.5, encoded by SCN5A containing the adult control exon 6B (Fig 5a and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Injection of RNA encoding hNav1.5e, which is the splicing isoform of SCN5A found in DM, indicated a significant reduction of the sodium current amplitude of 45%, compared with hNav1.5, the normal adult SCN5A exon 6B form (Fig 5b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since, the extent of splicing misregulation varies among DM individuals, which typically express a mix of SCN5A splicing forms containing either exon 6A or exon 6B (cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3c), we analysed sodium currents generated by a mix of both SCN5A isoforms (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Injecting Xenopus oocytes with an equimolar mix of RNA encoding each channel, namely 50% of hNav1.5e (SCN5A containing fetal exon 6A) and 50% of hNav1.5 (SCN5A expressing adult exon 6B), resulted in a reduction of 30% of the current amplitude compared with the control hNav1.5 (Fig 5b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, two-electrode voltage clamp recording experiments revealed that the steady-state activation of the fetal hNav1.5e was shifted by 7 mV towards depolarized potential compared with the control adult hNav1.5 form (Fig 5d and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shift is consistent with the shift observed previously in transfected mammalian cells39,40,41, thus validating our approach in Xenopus oocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To better reproduce the situation observed in DM,

and 6 months post injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control animals injected either with saline or empty AAV2/9 presented no splicing alterations of Scn5a and normal cardiac functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, mice injected with AAV-U7-ASScn5a presented a decreased inclusion of adult exon 6B with a concomitant 3040% increase of the inclusion of exon 6A, thus reproducing the situation observed in DM (Fig 6b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative RTPCR demonstrated no changes in the expression of Scn5a mRNA or of its associated subunit Scn1b between control- and AAV-U7-ASScn5a-injected mice (Fig 6c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, AAV-U7-ASScn5a-injected mice reproduce some of the key pathological features of DM, including conduction defects and heart arrhythmias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, ECG performed 4 months post injection revealed a significant prolongation of the PR intervals (Student t-test, P value 0.001) in AAV-U7-ASScn5a-injected mice compared with control injected mice (Fig 6d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, QT interval was not significantly altered, and we identified only a trend towards increased QRS duration (Student t-test, P value of 0.058 with 8 AAV-U7-ASScn5a-injected mice on 25 presenting a QRS higher than 19 ms versus 16.5 ms in control mice) (Fig 6e and Supplementary Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, analysis of heart functions in 6-month-old animals showed that AAV-U7-ASScn5a-injected mice present a consistent increase of the PR interval compared with control injected mice (40.5 ms versus 34.8 ms respectively; Student t-test, P value 0.05), without significant changes of the QRS and QT intervals (Supplementary Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of interest, a similar elongation of the PR interval was observed in Scn5a+/ mice, which are hemizygote for Scn5a expression and represent an established model for cardiac-conduction disease45,46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, ECG analyses also revealed that 44% of AAV-U7-ASScn5a-injected mice develop significant (Student t-test, P0,001) heart arrhythmia at 4 months post injection with an average of five arrhythmic events, defined as variation of the RR interval, per minute whereas control injected animals showed no alterations (Fig 6f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not detect ventricular fibrillations or second and third-degree heart blocks in any injected animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, we observed supraventricular premature contractions and atrial fibrillation in AAV-U7-ASScn5a-injected mice (Fig 6f), and five of these injected mice died suddenly between 4 and 6 months post injections (none of the control mice died).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These electrical alterations were specific and not caused by global cardiac remodelling since we observed neither systolic nor diastolic alterations by doppler echocardiography (Supplementary Table 3) and no change in heart/body weight ratio (4.4±0,1 mg g1 in control, n=9, versus 4,7±0,2 mg g1 in AAV-U7-ASScn5a-injected animals, n=14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As further control, H&E-staining revealed normal heart structures with no evident cardiomyopathy or dilation at 6 months post AAV injections (Supplementary Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, quantitative RTPCR experiments show no alteration in the expression levels of Nppa, Nppb (encoding Anp and Bnp, respectively) and Myh7 mRNAs (Supplementary Fig 4D), suggesting no overt cardiac remodelling in antisense AAV-U7-ASScn5a-injected mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Sirius Red staining confirmed normal heart structures but also revealed some mild fibrosis (Fig 6h), which was confirmed by increased expression of collagen Cola1a and Tgfb1 mRNAs (Fig 6i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, mild fibrosis is also observed in DM cardiac samples17,18, as well as in individuals and mice models with loss-of-function mutations of the SCN5A gene20,21,46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, heart arrhythmias and prolonged PR interval in AAV-U7-ASScn5a-injected animals demonstrate that inclusion of the fetal exon 6A of Scn5a is inappropriate to adult mouse heart physiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, while we found a clear elongation of the PR interval, we did not detect a significant alteration of the QRS duration as only a third of AAV-U7-ASScn5a-injected mice present increased QRS duration (19 ms).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, similar findings have been described in Scn5a+/ mice, which all show elongation of the PR interval, while only a subset of Scn5a+/ animals present a prolongation of the QRS interval45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, elongation of the PR interval is not systematically associated with increased duration of the QRS in mouse model of Scn5a dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, to strengthen our data, we mathematically tested whether human cardiac parameters would be altered by the electrophysiological differences caused by the switch from adult exon 6B towards fetal exon 6A of SCN5A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simulation based on a modified O'Hara-Rudy model48,49 predicted a change of the QRS duration from 72 ms with control adult hNav1.5 to 88 ms with fetal hNav1.5e, hence a 22% increase (Fig 7a and Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we also tested extent of atrio-ventricular change50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mathematical simulation predicted a change of the atrium-His interval from 81 ms with control hNav1.5 to 143 ms with fetal hNav1.5e (Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these results support our mouse results and provide additional evidences that misregulation of SCN5A alternative

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cardiac defects affect 80% of individuals with DM and represent the second most common cause of death in this disease17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for cardiac-conduction delay and ventricular tachycardia in DM are unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using RNA sequencing we identified various novel splicing misregulation events in DM1 heart samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these changes, the splicing switch from adult exon 6B to fetal exon 6A in SCN5A mRNA is of particular interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies39,40,41 as well as ours indicate that hNav1.5e, the splicing variant of SCN5A found in DM and that contains the fetal exon 6A, possesses a reduced excitability compared with the normal adult splicing form of SCN5A containing the exon 6B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the switch from the hNav1.5 to the hNav1.5e channel in DM may cause a slower upstroke velocity of the cardiac action potential, leading to conduction slowing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, this hypothesis is supported by mathematical simulation as well by animal model, since imposing a switch from inclusion of the control adult exon 6B towards using the fetal exon 6A of Scn5A in adult mouse heart led to cardiac-conduction delay and heart arrhythmias, two key features of DM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, clinical evidence also supports an alteration of the sodium current in DM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the electrophysiological features39,40,41 of the fetal isoform of SCN5A expressed in DM are similar to the electrophysiological characteristics observed with loss-of-function mutations of SCN5A causing cardiac-conduction disease51,52,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, there are some similarities of ECG recording, including prolongation of the PR interval and of the QRS duration, between individuals with DM and individuals affected by cardiac-conduction disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in SCN5A42,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the induction of abnormal ECG pattern in DM patients treated with ajmaline55,56, a class Ia antiarrhythmic agent acting on the cardiac sodium channel and the abnormal sodium current observed in a mouse model of DM57, are also evocative of a dysfunction of the sodium channel in DM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, our results suggest that misregulation of the splicing of SCN5A participates in a subset of electrical cardiac alterations observed in DM, namely the cardiac-conduction delay and the heart arrhythmias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is likely that other alternative splicing alterations and/or mechanisms58,59,60,61 are participating to the full pattern of cardiac alterations in DM since knockout of Mbnl1 and Mbnl2 in mice leads to only mild alteration of Scn5A splicing, while these mice show severe conduction disease and cardiac dilatation43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, this work may also have some clinical importance such as considering with caution the treatments of DM patients with pharmaceutical agents that reduce the activity of the cardiac sodium channel, including mexiletine, flecainide and other antiarrhythmic drugs of class I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In that aspect, this study may provide a molecular explanation to the adverse cardiac reaction of some patients with myotonic dystrophic to treatment with drugs reducing activity of SCN5A (refs 62, 63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Involvement of the cardiac sodium channel in DM might also highlight the importance of considering polymorphism in the SCN5A gene, as well as in other genes such as SCN10A, as a possible cause of the clustering of cardiac alterations in some families of DM64, an hypothesis supported by the recent report that DM exacerbates Brugada syndrome caused by a mutation in SCN5A (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inversely, it remains to be tested whether mutations in intronic regions regulating alternative splicing of SCN5A exon 6A/6B might be considered as a cause of cardiac-conduction abnormalities in patients in whom no mutations were identified in the coding sequence of SCN5A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, if dysfunction of the cardiac sodium channel in DM is comparable in some aspects to cardiac-conduction disease caused by mutations in SCN5A, an attractive supposition would be that therapeutic approaches developed for these diseases could be considered for DM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, if cardiac-conduction defects in DM are associated with an alteration of the alternative splicing of SCN5A, one may hope that correction of splicing misregulations through approaches releasing MBNL1 from CUG expanded repeats or through approaches reducing the expression of pathogenic CUG RNA66,67 may alleviate the cardiac symptoms of DM.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
