Charge-transfer crystallites as molecular electrical dopants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Ground-state integer charge transfer is commonly regarded as the basic mechanism of molecular electrical doping in both, conjugated polymers and oligomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that fundamentally different processes can occur in the two types of organic semiconductors instead.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using complementary experimental techniques supported by theory, we contrast a polythiophene, where molecular p-doping leads to integer charge transfer reportedly localized to one quaterthiophene backbone segment, to the quaterthiophene oligomer itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite a comparable relative increase in conductivity, we observe only partial charge transfer for the latter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the parent polymer, pronounced intermolecular frontier-orbital hybridization of oligomer and dopant in 1:1 mixed-stack co-crystallites leads to the emergence of empty electronic states within the energy gap of the surrounding quaterthiophene matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is their FermiDirac occupation that yields mobile charge carriers and, therefore, the co-crystallitesrather than individual acceptor moleculesshould be regarded as the dopants in such systems.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Doping inorganic semiconductors by introducing impurity atoms is the basis of all functionality in modern electronic devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It allows deliberately tuning the band alignment at interfaces and markedly increases the conductivity at ultralow doping ratios, as typically every covalently bound dopant atom donates one mobile charge to the highly crystalline and ultra-pure semiconductor matrix1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, their costly production makes inorganic semiconductors less attractive for large-area applications and, for opto-electronic applications in particular, the tuning of their bandgap still remains a technological challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these fields, organic electronics emerged as a valuable alternative, where organic semiconductors (OSCs), that is, conjugated organic molecules (COMs) and conjugated polymers (CPs), are employed as active materials instead.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the organic light-emitting devices revolutionizing todays display technology, OSCs show great potential also for future applications in organic photovoltaic cells, field-effect transistors and sensors2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, however, a similar variety of applications, as it is feasible with inorganic semiconductors, can only be realized with OSCs if their electrical doping can be similarly well controlled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite intense research since the early days of organic electronics2, doping OSCs by introducing alkali metals or halides proved to be inappropriate for device applications due to their tendency to diffuse6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a valuable alternative, molecular electrical doping has emerged8,9,10,11,12,13,14, which employs strong molecular acceptors for p-type doping and donors for n-type doping instead.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exploiting the full wealth of organic chemistry, molecular dopants are designed such that, for p-type doping, their electron affinity (EA) is in the range of the ionization energy (IE) of the OSC, and vice versa for n-type doping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In todays benchmark devices, this approach is ubiquitously pursued, in particular for conduction layers in organic light-emitting devices and organic photovoltaic cells (pin devices)4,10 as well as in organic field-effect transistors11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given its success in practical applications, it may come as a surprise that the fundamental processes at work in the molecular doping of OSCs are still little understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In one common perception, ground-state integer charge transfer (ICT) is thought to occur, leading to a localized charge on the ionized dopant and a (mobile) hole in the OSC matrix, for example, a positive polaron for p-type doping10,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For CPs, a mounting body of experimental evidence, much of it gathered on the benchmark polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) shown as P3HT in Fig 1a, indeed points towards the validity of this view: (i) a marked increase in conductivity by up to five orders of magnitude (up to 1 S cm1) was reported upon molecularly p-doping P3HT with the strong electron acceptor 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ)16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) In Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, characteristic shifts of F4TCNQ cyano-vibrations were observed that indicate its fully ionized state19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iii) In ultraviolet/visible/near-infrared (UV/Vis/NIR) absorption spectroscopy, optical transitions characteristic for the fully ionized species were observed for the F4TCNQ doping of P3HT16,17,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iv) New electronic states were found via ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) at the Fermi energy (EF) upon doping P3HT with NOPF6 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22), as it was expected for positive polarons according to the model for polaron energetics of Su, Schrieffer and Heeger23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Materials and lateral conductivity of doped 4T films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Chemical structures of the materials employed: P3HT and 4T as OSCs and the increasingly fluorinated TCNQ derivatives FTCNQ, F2TCNQ and F4TCNQ employed as p-dopants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Lateral thin-film conductivity as a function of the dopant ratio (that is, the number of dopant molecules divided by total number of molecules) for vacuum co-deposited films of 4T and F4TCNQ;

the results are depicted in Fig 3b together with reference data of pristine 4T.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to P3HT, no indications of ionized F4TCNQ molecules are observed here whatsoever (expected F4TCNQ anion transitions are marked with stars).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, fundamentally different sub-gap absorptions arise already at the lowest doping ratio of 1.3%, which equals one dopant molecule per 75 4T-oligomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These features, assigned to a single electronic transition with vibronic replica on the basis of our time-dependent DFT results (Supplementary Fig 1), and increase in intensity with dopant loading while retaining their transition energy up to the case of 1:1 blends (50% dopant ratio, that is, one dopant per 4T molecule).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further employing the full range of differently strong dopants yields analogous results, notably also for TCNQ, with no spectroscopic indication for ionized species (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a clear trend for the energy of the new sub-gap transition is apparent, which is lower in energy for dopants of higher EA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation further allows unambiguously excluding these transitions to stem from 4T radical cations39,40, because the related polaronic transition energies are not expected to depend on the EA of the dopant species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that these findings are independent of the preparation method, as fully analogous results are found for solution-processed 4T films employing the same experimental protocol used for P3HT (Supplementary Fig 2 and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the IE of 4T (5.3 eV, vide infra) is still slightly higher than the EA of F4TCNQ (maximum literature value: 5.24 eV)9, we further employed the even stronger, chemically slightly different dopant 2,2-(perfluoro-naphthalene-2,6-diylidene)dimalononitrile (F6TCNNQ)29,41 with an EA as high as 5.6±0.2 eV, which, however, led to qualitatively identical results (Supplementary Figs 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, above spectroscopic findings for the thiophene oligomer are in striking contrast to the ICT phenomenology observed for P3HT and beg for a different explanation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Optical absorption spectra of molecularly doped poly- and quaterthiophene.UV/Vis/NIR spectra of (a) P3HT blended with F4TCNQ at increasing ratio with the inset showing the zoomed region around the ICT features in the film of 3.9% dopant ratio (one F4TCNQ per 25 quaterthiophene segments), (b) 4T blended with F4TCNQ at increasing ratio, (c) P3HT blended with the full range of differently strong dopants (TCNQ to F4TCNQ) at a dopant ratio of 28.6% and (d) of 4T blends with the full range of differently strong dopants (TCNQ to F4TCNQ) in 1:1 ratio (50%);

the positions of the calculated peaks are illustrated by black rings (Fig 5d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the GIXRD data of the 1:1 mixed film of 4T/F4TCNQ (Fig 4a) clearly resembles that pattern, we attribute the features (A, B and C) to essentially isostructural 1:1 mixed crystallites of 4T/F4TCNQ; similar scenarios are found for the entire series of differently strong dopants (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to both pure 4T and all pristine dopants, where neighbouring molecules adopt a herringbone arrangement, this mixed-crystal structure is characterized by a co-planar -stacking of alternating 4T and dopant molecules, as illustrated in Fig 5d for 4T/TCNQ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even more clearly than in the case of P3HT, our GIXRD analysis supports scenario (iii) also for the p-doped oligomer with phase separation between pristine 4T and 1:1 mixed crystallites of the CPX already at a concentration as low as 1.3%, which is well within the initial rising edge of the conductivity (cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Atomic force microscopy', 'As conductivity is (mobile) charge-carrier density times their mobility, the observed increase in  could, in principle, not only be caused by a doping-related increase in carrier density, but also be due to an improved film morphology/structure upon doping, as it was, indeed, suggested for F4TCNQ-doped P3HT60 without, however, the occurrence of exceptional features in topographic atomic force microscopy (AFM) images even at high doping levels48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To contrast these findings against the oligomer system and to complement our X-ray results, we present AFM results on increasingly F4TCNQ-doped 4T films in Fig 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pure 4T reference shows a morphology with monomolecular steps of 1.5±0.1 nm reminiscent of upright standing molecules, which is in line with the GIXRD data evidencing growth in (001) texture with a lattice spacing of 1.523 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon dopant admixture, the 4T island size is significantly reduced which, therefore, increases the density of grain boundaries in the doped film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, this change in morphology must be expected to be detrimental to charge-carrier mobility and, thus, to the conductivity of the film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with the GIXRD data pointing towards the presence of the 1:1 mixed co-crystals of 4T and F4TCNQ already at the lowest dopant ratio of 1.3%, a second, granular morphology emerges (inset shows zoomed part with enhanced contrast), which increases in concentration with the dopant ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, in the 1:1 situation, only a single morphology is observed, which we now can confidently assign to the 1:1 mixed crystallites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An analogous behaviour was observed for all combinations of 4T with the differently strong dopants (Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, both the phase separation and the changes in morphology observed here are expected to reduce charge-carrier mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the increase in conductivity in the F4TCNQ-doped 4T films is due to an over-compensating increase in the density of mobile charges, which must stem from the presence of the 1:1 co-crystallites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Morphology of increasingly doped 4T films.AFM micrographs (10 × 10 m) of co-evaporated 4T/F4TCNQ films with increasing dopant ratios;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In contrast to what is seen in P3HT16,25,26, our results point towards the fact that it is not individual F4TCNQ molecules that should be regarded as the dopants in the oligomer film but, rather, the CPX crystallites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To rationalize the mechanism by which their peculiar electronic structure (cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4a) leads to an increase in the density of mobile charge carriers, a qualitative pictureshown in Fig 7a in its adaption to the present casehas been previously proposed14,29,30,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unoccupied supramolecular hybrid orbitals of the CPXs (LCPX) energetically lie by at least the value of the resonance integral 0.4 eV above the HOMO of the circumjacent 4T film, that is, at least one order of magnitude farther away than typical acceptor levels in p-doped inorganic semiconductors lie above their valence band edge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, only a fraction of the LCPX states are occupied at room temperature, leading to negatively charged 1:1 co-crystallites and mobile holes within the 4T matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon increasing concentration of CPX crystallites, the Fermi level moves down in energy until it is stabilized between the unoccupied hybrid orbitals and the HOMO of the COM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: Evolution of electronic structure with increasing doping level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic energy level diagram of CPXs embedded into a 4T matrix; the lower panels show the proposed microstructure of the respective systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Left: calculated energy of the bulk Fermi level (EF) as a function of

in the 4T matrix as a function of dopant ratio.Full size image', 'Here, to quantify the consequences of this picture, both the HOMO- and LUMO-level distributions in the pure 4T and the energy distributions of the occupied/unoccupied hybrid orbitals of the CPX co-crystals were assumed to be reasonably well represented by Gaussian functions61,62,63, whose respective peak centres and standard deviations (s.d.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  were extracted from the experimental data in Fig 4b (see the Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the molecular volume densities known from the respective single-crystal structures58,59, an accordingly weighted superposition of the densities of states (DOS) of each individual material was then constructed for a series of dopant ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each dopant ratio, the bulk Fermi level (EF) and the individual occupations of all four Gaussian energy-level distributions contributing to the mixed DOS were then obtained by repeatedly solving the GaussFermi integrals numerically until the point of overall charge neutrality was found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The results in Fig 7b show that, at ultralow dopant ratios of 103 %, EF still lies well within the LUMO distribution of the CPXs (LCPX), but soon stabilizes between the LCPX and the 4T HOMO distributions over a wide range of dopant ratios until it eventually drops further to its bulk value in the pure CPX co-crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This evolution entails that, in contrast to typical dopants in inorganic semiconductors, the fraction of charged CPXs is never unity to begin with and rapidly drops with increasing dopant ratio (Fig 7c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the occupation of states other than the HOMO of 4T and LCPX is essentially negligible (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the number of CPXs increases relative to the number of 4T molecules, the volume density of holes in the doped organic film initially rises and shows a pronounced maximum at a dopant ratio of 38%, around where also the maximum in conductivity was observed in Fig 1b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note, however, that the maximum value of ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7 × 1018 cm3 by no means refers to the density of mobile holes only, but that it includes also those that are likely trapped in the (localized) states that make up the low binding energy tail of the 4T HOMO-level distribution64,65,66.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon further increasing the dopant ratio, the hole density then rapidly drops again to reach negligible values for the pure 4T/F4TCNQ co-crystal, rationalizing the lower conductivity in this limiting case independent of the potential impact of morphology (cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We stress that the doping mechanism outlined here for the oligomer is fundamentally different from ICT in the molecularly doped polymer, in that it entails fundamentally different demands for the design of efficient molecular dopants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the oligomer, minimizing the resonance integral  emerges as the key strategy for improving the doping efficiency, because its value limits how closely LCPX can approach the occupied states of the COM in energy (Fig 7a) and, therefore, how many charge carriers are created at room temperature through FermiDirac occupation of all available states (Fig 7bd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To summarize, with the aim of comparing the molecular doping of conjugated oligo- and polymers, we juxtaposed the p-doping of P3HT with F4TCNQ, where ICT was reported to occur localized to one 4T unit of the polymer chain, to that of the 4T oligomer itself, which has been regarded as a model system for the polymer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, we observed a vastly different phenomenology for the two materials classes: comparably to P3HT, doping 4T films increases their lateral conductivity by several orders of magnitude despite a severe doping-induced deterioration of their texture and morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to P3HT, however, surprisingly small shifts of the characteristic cyano-vibrational bands in the F4TCNQ dopants reveal that, instead of ICT, only partial charge transfer (0.25) occurs for the 4T oligomer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the well-defined spectral features observed in FTIR point towards an equally well-defined mutual orientation of the 4T and dopant molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is corroborated by combining GIXRD with morphological investigations, where we observe phase separation between pure 4T and 1:1 co-crystalline regions of 4T/F4TCNQ already at low doping concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In full analogy, the formation of such a mixed-crystalline phase is also deduced from our GIXRD data of p-doped P3HT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In marked contrast to P3HT, however, where the polaron signatures of the individual components dominate, optical absorption spectroscopy evidences strong frontier-orbital hybridization between oligothiophene and dopant in the co-crystallites, which is supported by a theoretical treatment on the DFT level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting supramolecular hybrid energy levels of these ground-state charge-transfer CPXs were directly observed by UPS and IPES.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, instead of the individual dopant molecules being ionized through ICT, as in the case of the polythiophene, it is the co-crystallites of CPXs that are being ionized in the case of the oligomer, thereby effectively acting as dopants by generating holes in the circumjacent COM film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study thus highlights profound differences between the fundamental doping mechanisms at work in small molecular and polymeric OSCs of identical chemical composition and similar microstructure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, -stacking of dopant and quaterthiophene unit entails a substantial resonance integral  with the oligomer (with all the consequences described above), while, for the polymer, this is either not the case or does not prevent ICT there.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further exploring and rationalizing these differences constitutes an important thrust area of future research, which must aim at deriving a unified picture of molecular electrical doping valid for all OSCs, that is, molecular and polymeric ones.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
