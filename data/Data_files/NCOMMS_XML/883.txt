Perfect X-ray focusing via fitting corrective glasses to aberrated optics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Due to their short wavelength, X-rays can in principle be focused down to a few nanometres and below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, it is this short wavelength that puts stringent requirements on X-ray optics and their metrology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both are limited by todays technology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, we present accurate at wavelength measurements of residual aberrations of a refractive X-ray lens using ptychography to manufacture a corrective phase plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with the fitted phase plate the optics shows diffraction-limited performance, generating a nearly Gaussian beam profile with a Strehl ratio above 0.8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This scheme can be applied to any other focusing optics, thus solving the X-ray optical problem at synchrotron radiation sources and X-ray free-electron lasers.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Modern synchrotron radiation sources and X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) provide highly brilliant X-ray beams that allow studying the structure and dynamics of matter from atomic distances and a few femtoseconds to macroscopic dimensions and seconds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Creating small and intense X-ray beams is crucial to confine the beam and concentrate the radiation onto the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ideally, this would require diffraction-limited X-ray optics with high numerical aperture (NA) that are at the same time stable in the intense XFEL pulses1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far, mainly mirror systems2,3 and beryllium compound refractive lenses4,5 (Be CRLs) are in routine operation at XFELs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Due to the short wavelength of X-rays, the fabrication of X-ray optics requires the most advanced technologies, such as lithographic nanofabrication for diffractive6 and refractive optics7, surface figuring with atomic precision for total reflection and multilayer mirrors8,9 and thin-film technologies for multilayer optics10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Today, most X-ray optics are limited by fabrication limitations, and tradeoffs need to be made in terms of aberration-free performance and highest possible NA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To characterize the optics and the resulting nanobeams, metrology has become more and more demanding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the past years, X-ray scanning coherent diffraction microscopy, also known as ptychography11, has evolved to one of the most important methods for X-ray beam and optics characterization12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be used to quantitatively retrieve the complex wavefield of a focused X-ray beam and, hence, reveals wavefront errors with unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the three-dimensional reconstruction of the focal spot volume4, detailed information about aberrations of the optical system can be deduced15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we present a general scheme to assess aberrations of an X-ray optical system under working conditions and correct them by introducing an appropriate X-ray phase plate into the optical path to achieve diffraction-limited focusing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phase plate operates in transmission and is based on refraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, it is largely insensitive to small shape and surface inaccuracies of a few m and can correct residual aberrations originating from surface errors of reflective optics, zone deformations in diffractive optics and accumulated surface errors in larger refractive lens stacks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using ptychography, we measured the complex wavefield of a focused X-ray beam generated by Be CRLs at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detailed knowledge of the complex wavefield was used to fabricate a corrective phase plate that compensates for the aberrations and thus creates a diffraction-limited focus when introduced into the beam following the lens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method can be applied very generally to solve the X-ray focusing problem at synchrotron radiation sources and XFELs and will affect fields as diverse as X-ray microscopy and high-resolution imaging17,18, serial crystallography19,20, creating matter in extreme conditions21, nonlinear X-ray optics22 and single-molecule imaging23.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Initial aberration analysis', 'At the Matter in Extreme Conditions (MEC) endstation24 of the LCLS, focused X-ray pulses are, for example, used for magnified phase-contrast imaging of shock waves in matter18, to locally probe the structure in shocked matter by diffraction or to generate high-energy-density states in matter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, the LCLS beam is focused slightly before or at the sample position, respectively, using refractive X-ray lenses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our experiment, 20 refractive lenses made of beryllium were used to focus the beam (photon energy: E=8.2 keV) with a focal length of 250 mm (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was characterized in detail by ptychography with a test object placed slightly out of focus (Fig 1a) and showed pronounced spherical aberration4 that was also confirmed by the Ronchi test25,26 (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By propagating the wavefield back to the exit plane of the lens and subtracting a spherical wave corresponding to the focal distance, a detailed map of the phase errors, which are responsible for the aberrations in the focus, was determined quantitatively (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured wavefront deviation was used to model the shape error of individual lens surfaces (see optics characterization in the Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was found that shape inaccuracies smaller than 500 nm per lens surface (Fig 2c) reproduce the measured wavefront deviation shown in Fig 2a very accurately as depicted in Fig 2b with the standard deviation of 0.3 rad between the two.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A reduction of phase errors in individual refractive lenses is technically extremely challenging, as the shape errors for individual lens surfaces lie in the range of the current fabrication tolerances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we pursued the following approach: the resulting accumulated phase error of the whole lens stack was corrected for by a single phase plate placed after the stack (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was made out of an amorphous SiO2 substrate by ultrashort-pulse laser ablation27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The material was chosen based on its radiation hardness and well-known fabrication parameters for laser micromachining28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phase plate was locally structured in thickness such as to add an additional phase shift that compensates the measured residual phase error of the whole lens (see phase plate design and fabrication in the Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modelled wavefront deformation (Fig 2b) defines the shape of the phase plate as shown in Fig 2d,e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Experimental setup.X-rays with E=8.2 keV (selected by a Si-111 monochromator) were focused by a compound refractive lens made of beryllium (Be CRL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To correct for the residual aberrations of the lens, a phase plate was installed immediately following the lens stack.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) For ptychography the test objectan array of Siemens starswas placed in the vicinity of the focal plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample was scanned transversely to the beam (xy raster scan) and far-field diffraction patterns were recorded at each position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Ronchigrams were recorded using a grating test sample with a distinct grating period positioned along the optical axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further details can be found in the Methods.Full size image', 'Figure 2: Initial lens characterization and phase plate design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Measured wavefront deformation at the lens exit compared to a spherical wave.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Phase error of a modelled lens stack at the lens exit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars in a,b correspond to 50 m.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In conclusion, we successfully demonstrated the correction of residual spherical aberration in a stack of Be CRLs by a corrective phase plate, thus achieving diffraction-limited focusing with a Strehl ratio of 0.87(5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Minimizing the intensity in the outer lobes is not only critical for high power density experiments, but also for scanning microscopy applications, as side lobes may contribute significantly to the measured signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The approach provides a versatile and general solution to correct aberrations for a variety of X-ray optics ranging from refractive optics as demonstrated here, diffractive optics such as Fresnel zone plates and multilayer Laue lenses, as well as reflective mirror optics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All these optics may be corrected to improve their performance beyond current manufacturing limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effectively solves the problem of aberrations and of technological limitations in the fabrication of optics in the hard X-ray regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, X-ray phase plates could become an essential technology for the next generation of XFEL and storage ring sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diffraction-limited X-ray foci of nm size are not only crucial to improve existing experiments, but they might also enable novel science opportunities such as nonlinear Compton scattering30 or pair creation by photonphoton scattering31.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Experimental setup', 'The experiments were conducted at three different facilities (MEC endstation at the LCLS, beamline P06 at PETRA III and beamline I13-1 at DLS) with similar experimental setups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The broadband X-ray radiation was monochromatized by silicon crystals to a photon energy of E=8.2 keV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flat beam was focused by a set of 20 Be CRLs with a radius of curvature of R=50 m and geometrical aperture of D=300 m. The aperture was defined by a pinhole of D=300 m diameter that matches the geometrical aperture at the entrance of the optics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phase plate was mounted directly behind the CRL, either in a self-centring special mount or in a motorized mount adjustable in x and y to investigate tolerable lateral misalignment and to optimize the centring of the phase plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the ptychographic scans, an array of small Siemens stars with 50 nm smallest features structured in 1 m thick tungsten on a diamond substrate was placed into the vicinity of the focal plane (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The far-field diffraction patterns were recorded using an area detector placed several metres behind the test object (LCLS: in-air CS-PAD 140k at a distance 4.8 m downstream of the sample, DLS: Medipix-3-based Merlin detector at 2.6 m downstream of the sample, PETRA III: Medipix-3-based LAMBDA (Large Area Medipix-Based Detector Array) detector at 2.2 m downstream of the sample).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the Ronchi test (Fig 1b) we used a high-resolution X-ray camera magnifying a scintillator screen and gratings with 270 nm period structured into 1 m thick tungsten on a diamond substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Optics characterization', 'The recorded far-field diffraction patterns were processed with a ptychographic algorithm (ePIE)32 with position refinement4 to reconstruct both the complex object transmission function of the test sample, as well as the complex-valued wavefield  that illuminated the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the illumination and using the FresnelKirchhoff diffraction integral33, the complex wavefield can be calculated at any point along the optical axis, creating a beam caustic as shown in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propagated  back to the lens exit to obtain exit(x, y).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To reveal phase errors, we subtracted the phase of a spherical wave  with radius z=zfzexit that was matched to the distance from lens exit zexit to focal plane zf of the Be CRL34:', '', 'Residual deviations from a plane phase represent the aberrations present in the given optics (Fig 2a) and can be evaluated to accurately model their shape error (Fig 2c) and to design corrective elements like the phase plate characterized in Fig 2d,e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To model the error of a single lens surface, we propagated a plane wave from lens to lens through the stack, treating every lens as thin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under the assumption of an identical deformation for every lens and radial symmetry, the shape was iteratively refined until the total phase deviation shown in Fig 2b matched the measured one in Fig 2a (0.3 rad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition, an independent Ronchi test was carried out as depicted in Fig 1b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, a diffraction grating was placed in the vicinity of the focal plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The grating period was chosen so that the diffracted beam cones overlap each other roughly half way (see Fig 1b and Ronchigrams in Fig 3c,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interfering amplitudes from the cones created a distinct fringe pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Straight interference fringes indicate an aberration-free system (Fig 3f), and bent lines can reveal coma, astigmatism or, in our case, spherical aberration (Fig 3c) on a single-shot basis25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, Ronchi patterns were used to align the lens and the phase plate to one another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Phase plate design and fabrication', 'From the reconstructed wavefront deviation  a phase plate shape zPP(x, y) can be designed, so that the induced phase shift in the material  compensates any present wavefront deviations:', '', 'The phase plate structure was created in an amorphous SiO2 substrate (Vitreosil 077, =2.2 g cm3) with a thickness of 118(2) m.', 'We used an ultrashort-pulsed laser system (Trumpf TruMicro 5050) to enable nonlinear absorption in the focal region for highly localized energy transfer27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The laser emits pulses with durations of 8 ps at a wavelength of 1030, nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pulse energy was set to 0.2 J to facilitate precise ablation of the desired structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a microscope objective with a NA of 0.4 served to focus the pulses onto the substrate, providing a spot size of 1 m.
