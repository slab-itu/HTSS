Sensing the quantum limit in scanning tunnelling spectroscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The tunnelling current in scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS) is typically and often implicitly modelled by a continuous and homogeneous charge flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the charging energy of a single-charge quantum sufficiently exceeds the thermal energy, however, the granularity of the current becomes non-negligible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this quantum limit, the capacitance of the tunnel junction mediates an interaction of the tunnelling electrons with the surrounding electromagnetic environment and becomes a source of noise itself, which cannot be neglected in STS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a scanning tunnelling microscope operating at 15 mK, we show that we operate in this quantum limit, which determines the ultimate energy resolution in STS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The P(E)-theory describes the probability for a tunnelling electron to exchange energy with the environment and can be regarded as the energy resolution function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We experimentally demonstrate this effect with a superconducting aluminium tip and a superconducting aluminium sample, where it is most pronounced.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Scanning tunnelling spectroscopy has evolved into one of the most versatile tools to study the electronic structure in real space with atomic precision1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differential conductance measured through the tunnelling contact directly accesses the local density of states of the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the growing interest in phenomena with extremely sharp spectral features on smaller and smaller energy scales, the demand for higher and higher spectroscopic energy resolution increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examples are the Kondo effect4, YuShibaRusinov states5,6, Majorana fermions7, or the Josephson effect8,9,10,11, just to name a few.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aside from the obvious strategy of lowering the temperature to increase the energy resolution12, superconducting tips have successfully been conducted to circumvent the broadening effects of the Fermi function in the tunnelling process and greatly improve the energy resolution6,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at low temperature T, other energy scales such as the charging energy EC of the tunnel junction may substantially exceed the thermal energy kBT such that the granularity of the tunnelling current becomes non-negligible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The question arises whether the tunnelling process encompasses an intrinsic resolution limit, however small it may be, which cannot be overcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the following, we will show that the consequences of charge quantization ultimately pose a principal limit to the achievable energy resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The principal properties of a tunnel junction can in many cases be satisfactorily described by a tunnelling resistance14 and the charge flow is commonly implicitly assumed to be continuous and homogeneous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at very low temperatures, the granularity of the tunnelling current resulting from charge quantization is not necessarily negligible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, the tunnel junction also becomes a capacitor (see Fig 1a) mediating an interaction of the tunnelling electrons with the surrounding electromagnetic environment15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the quantum limit, where electric charge and magnetic flux (phase) become dual variables (uncertainty principle) so that the charging energy cannot be neglected anymore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, a tunnelling electron may exchange a photon with the surrounding environment, which is accompanied by a loss or gain in energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is schematically shown in Fig 1b for a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM), where the electron tunnels from the tip to the sample and emits a photon to the environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the thermal noise of the junction capacitance becomes appreciable for small capacitance values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These effects may be small, but they are non-negligible at low temperatures, especially in the context of ultimate energy resolution.

indicated with the values found in this work.Full size image', 'The so-called P(E)-theory quantifies the energy exchange with the environment, where the P(E)-function describes the probability of a tunnelling electron to emit or absorb a photon to or from the environment16,17,18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The P(E)-theory has already been successfully applied in many instances, where tunnelling electrons interact with the surrounding environment, which is modelled as an effective frequency-dependent electromagnetic impedance Z().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examples include the Josephson effect in the charge tunnelling regime18,21, as well as the phenomenon of Coulomb blockade15,16,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These examples refer to specific physical situations: tunnelling of Cooper pairs and tunnelling in a high-impedance environment (, where  is the resistance quantum), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the P(E)-theory generally applies to inelastic charge transfer processes through tunnel junctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, Pekola et al.24 have very nicely described a contribution to the superconducting density of states (that is, the Dynes parameter) by environmentally assisted tunnelling through a normalconductor-insulator-superconductor junction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They did not though generalize their findings to the general properties of a tunnel junction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we show that the photon exchange of tunnelling electrons with the surrounding environment in conjunction with the capacitative junction noise represents a principal limit of the energy resolution E in spectroscopic measurements using tunnel junctions (in our case leading to E in the low eV-range).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, the P(E)-function represents the resolution function of a particular tunnel junction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using an STM operating at 15 mK (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25), we independently characterize the P(E)-function of a superconductor-vacuumsuperconductor-tunnel junction through its direct relation with the Josephson effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, we demonstrate the impact of the P(E)-function on the tunnelling process by measuring the superconducting quasiparticle density of states of the same tunnel junction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find excellent quantitative agreement of our spectra from different tunnel junctions with the model calculations including P(E)-theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This leads us to conclude that the P(E)-function plays a ubiquitous role as a resolution function in the tunnelling process, in particular for energy scales at or below 1 meV.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

is commonly defined through the equilibrium phase correlation function J(t) as the Fourier transform of expJ(t) (refs 18, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To account for the different dissipation channels, we define J(t)=J0(t)+JN(t), where J0(t) describes the phase correlation of the environmental impedance and JN(t) captures the low frequency capacitative thermal noise in the junction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allows us to calculate the P0(E)-function for the environmental impedance and the PN(E)-function for the capacitative noise separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They can be combined to the total

sample29,30, which is superconducting at 15 mK (transition temperature TC=1.1 K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aluminium has been shown to exhibit minimal intrinsic broadening due to depairing resulting in sharp coherence peaks31, which is why it is an excellent material for demonstrating the broadening effects in a tunnel junction, as we will show in the following.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used two different tip wires with diameters of 0.25 and 1 mm (tip 1 and tip 2, respectively) expecting different junction capacitances CJ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "To demonstrate the influence of the P(E)-function on density of states measurements, we have to independently determine the P(E)-function from a separate measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since every tip in an STM is slightly different, we have to determine the P(E)-function for every tip separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As both tip and sample are superconducting at 15 mK, the most straightforward way to experimentally determine the P(E)-function is through the Josephson effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have to use the P(E)-theory to describe the Josephson effect rather than the IvanchenkoZil'berman (IZ) model, which has been used in STM measurements before,

Josephson energy, so that the IZ model can still be used3334.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is clearly not the case here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, as has been shown before, the environmental impedance in

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'According to the P(E)-theory, the exchange of energy with the environment during the tunnelling process should be an ubiquitous phenomenon16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the majority of cases, it has been discussed in the context of dynamical Coulomb blockade (DCB)15,16,22,23 as well as the Josephson effect in the sequential charge tunnelling regime17,18,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While in these cases, the role of the P(E)-theory is obvious, its role as a resolution function in every tunnelling spectrum is more subtle, but non-negligible, as we will show in the following.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neglecting the asymmetric shape for a moment and looking at the general broadening effect of the P(E)-function, we find that the FWHM of the P(E)-function is dominated by the capacitative noise and is essentially determined by the junction capacitance CJ as well as the temperature T (see also Supplementary Note 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The FWHM of the P(E)-function for typical low temperatures (0.015 K) and capacitances (150 fF) is shown in Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, the conventional thermal broadening Etherm of differential conductance spectra in the STM due to the Fermi function is also shown as a black line (Etherm=3.5 kBT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the thermal Fermi function broadening depends linearly on temperature, we find an overall empirical relation for the effective energy resolution due to P(E)-broadening, which is a function of temperature and capacitance .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coefficient  has an average value of =2.45±0.1, keeping in mind that the capacitative noise is the dominant contribution to the FWHM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The P0(E)-function changes the coefficient  slightly depending on the actual values of the parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that for low-enough temperature, the P(E)-broadening will eventually be the dominant contribution to the resolution limit, regardless of whether the tip and/or sample are superconducting or not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that this empirical equation holds for capacitive noise from Cooper pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For noise from quasiparticles, we expect the P(E)-broadening to be reduced by about one half.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At or below 1 K, the P(E)-broadening definitely has to be taken into account when optimizing the energy resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optimizing strategy will be to increase the junction capacitance by appropriate ex situ tip shaping on a macroscopic scale (up to mm-scale).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing the junction capacitance will increase the crosstalk between tip and sample, so that a trade-off between energy resolution and STM performance will have to be made.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Energy broadening contributions.Energy broadening due to P(E)-broadening from the environment in comparison to thermal broadening from the Fermi functions as a function of temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The P(E)-broadening is shown for typical junction capacitances that can be found in an STM tunnel junction (see Methods Section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the total energy broadening and hence the resolution limit both contributions have to be combined.Full size image', 'Due to the asymmetry of the P(E)-function, the spectral features in the density of states will not only be broadened, but may also change shape, which can have a strong influence on the interpretation of experimental data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The asymmetry evens out for higher temperatures, but at low temperatures, it has to be considered as can be seen in the fits of the differential conductance spectra in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If a symmetric broadening had been sufficient to fit these spectra, a Dynes fit would likely have sufficed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect the P(E)-broadening to be most significant on intrinsically sharp spectral features, such as coherence peaks of a superconducting gap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, sharp Kondo peaks with a low Kondo temperature on the order of 1 K may show an effectively higher Kondo temperature when the P(E)-broadening is not taken into account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, YuShibaRusinov states, which have an intrinsically -like spectral appearance39, will be strongly influenced by P(E)-broadening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we have shown that the interaction of tunnelling electrons with the environmental impedance as well as the capacitative junction noise limit the effective energy resolution in spectroscopic measurements of the differential conductance with the STM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The P(E)-function that models the energy exchange with the electromagnetic environment combined with the capacitative noise is the energy resolution function of the tunnel junction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of P(E)-broadening becomes dominant at or below 1 K and has to be taken into account when optimizing the energy resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regime, the quantum nature of the tunnelling process becomes evident, there is virtually no elastic tunnelling in experiments, and the surrounding electromagnetic environment has to be taken into account.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
