Altered expression of maize PLASTOCHRON1 enhances biomass and seed yield by extending cell division duration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Maize is the highest yielding cereal crop grown worldwide for grain or silage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that modulating the expression of the maize PLASTOCHRON1 (ZmPLA1) gene, encoding a cytochrome P450 (CYP78A1), results in increased organ growth, seedling vigour, stover biomass and seed yield.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The engineered trait is robust as it improves yield in an inbred as well as in a panel of hybrids, at several locations and over multiple seasons in the field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcriptome studies, hormone measurements and the expression of the auxin responsive DR5rev:mRFPer marker suggest that PLA1 may function through an increase in auxin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed analysis of growth over time demonstrates that PLA1 stimulates the duration of leaf elongation by maintaining dividing cells in a proliferative, undifferentiated state for a longer period of time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prolonged duration of growth also compensates for growth rate reduction caused by abiotic stresses.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Worldwide, more metric tons of maize are produced annually than any other cereal crop and this is largely due to improvements in stover biomass and seed yield.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These improvements were driven by modulation of several molecular mechanisms including transcriptional regulation1, photosynthesis2, hormone signalling3 and carbon metabolism4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We explored if modulating the primary growth control processes of cell division or cell expansion might be an alternative approach to improve crop yield.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of the known growth control mechanisms are regulated in a cell-autonomous manner5,6, including the proteolytic control of cell cycle regulators7, expansins during cell expansion8 and meristemoid cell divisions through PEAPOD (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to cell-autonomous regulators, phytohormones are well documented non-cell autonomous growth control determinants10, and transcriptional activators, such as ANGUSTIFOLIA3, were also shown to control growth over a longer distance11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our previous studies, using kinematic analysis of the maize leaf, which quantified the relative contribution of cell division and cell expansion during steady state growth12, identified several maize growth regulators13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these, gibberellins (GAs) were shown to play an important role, because lines overexpressing the rate-limiting GA biosynthetic enzyme GA20-OXIDASE had larger leaves due to an increase in the leaf elongation rate (LER) and the number of dividing cells13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, a cytochrome P450 CYP78A, named KLUH, was shown to regulate vegetative and reproductive organ growth across plant species by promoting cell proliferation likely through generation of a mobile growth-promoting signal16,17,18,19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In rice, PLASTOCHRON1 (PLA1) that belongs to the same class of CYP78A as KLUH affects the timing of leaf initiation and vegetative growth22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we demonstrate ZmPLA1 is a GA-independent time-keeper of cell division.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Constitutive overexpression of ZmPLA1 severely affected plant architecture by generating very large leaves and preventing reproduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More localized ectopic expression of ZmPLA1 resulted in fertile maize plants that showed an increase in growth, stover biomass accumulation and seed yield.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the maize leaf as a reporter, we demonstrated that localized ectopic expression of ZmPLA1 resulted in an increased duration of the maximal growth rate during steady state growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PLA1-mediated growth promotion also buffered against growth repression caused by two distinct abiotic stress conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcriptome studies, hormone measurements and the DR5rev:mRFP marker line suggest auxin contributes to this compensatory growth mechanism.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Leaf growth is driven by cell division and cell expansion and both processes are regulated in space and time28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the maize leaf, the mechanisms that were shown to affect growth are mainly involved in the spatial organization of the growth zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The size of the division zone and the maximal growth rate is determined by the levels of GA as shown by the changes in division zone size, LER and final leaf length in the GA biosynthetic and signalling mutants and UBIL:GA20ox-1 overexpression lines13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to GA, mutations in BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15) and GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14), and stress growth conditions have been shown to affect maize leaf growth by altering the division zone size (Supplementary Table 4)29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we identified a role for PLA1 in the temporal regulation of maize leaf growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both constitutive and localized overexpression of PLA1 resulted in longer leaves with longer growth periods (and LED) compared with their controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phenotypes of the stacked transgenics containing UBIL:GA20ox-1 and GA2ox:PLA1 were additive compared with the single transgenes, suggesting that in certain situations, LER and LED can be decoupled and that PLA1 is mainly regulating LED.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar conclusion was reached when natural variation for LER and LED was studied in the B73xH99 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population, as both processes were highly correlated with final leaf length but not with each other30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interestingly, at least two hormones play a role in the spatial and temporal regulation of maize leaf growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GA promotes leaf growth by increasing the maximal growth rate (LER)13, whereas auxin is downregulated over time in wild type and increased auxin levels in the GA2ox:PLA1 transgenic lines are associated with a prolonged LED.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with previous study13, we show here that higher levels of auxin accumulate in the basal region of the division zone, which decrease to lower levels at the distal boundary of the division zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern is parallel to the expression profile of PLA1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, overexpression of the auxin-induced AUXIN REGULATED GENE INVOLVED IN ORGAN GROWTH (ARGOS) gene results in enlarged leaves and a delayed flowering time32, similar to GA2ox:PLA1 lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, chorismate synthase that catalyses a reaction resulting in the auxin precursor chorismate33 as well as the auxin transporter ZmPIN1b (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34) are downregulated in GA2ox:PLA1 compared with the non-transgenic siblings after the steady-state growth stage, and are negatively correlated with LED (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data suggest that auxin may play a central role in determining the duration of maize leaf growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also PLA1, a molecular player in the LED process was linked to auxin, as the moderate overexpression of PLA1, that resulted in growth and yield enhancement, had higher auxin levels at the leaf base and increased levels of the auxin response marker DR5rev:mRFPer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The actual substrate and product, catalysed by PLA1 is still unknown, but there are no indications so far that PLA1 catalyses a step in the biosynthesis of auxin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PLA1 could, however, influence auxin concentration by producing a molecule that inhibits IAA oxidase or by modulating auxin transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identification of the nature of the PLA1 enzymatic products might provide insights how PLA1 is able to affect auxin metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We generated two PLA1 overexpression lines (UBIL:PLA1 and GA2ox:PLA1), both of which increased the length and width of the leaves, which was more pronounced in UBIL:PLA1 than in GA2ox:PLA1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Constitutive overexpression of PLA1 results in very small mature cells which might be due to over-proliferation of cells that fail to expand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to members of the CYP78A family, several other growth-regulating proteins also overstimulate cell division and delay differentiation35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When CYCD3;1 is overexpressed in Arabidopsis, the mature leaf epidermis of the transgenic plants consists of a large number of very small cells due to overproliferation36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, overexpression of the cell cycle regulator E2F and their dimerization partner DP severely affects plant stature due to cellular overproliferation37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these cases, growth stimulation is highly dependent on the expression level of growth regulators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, using tissue-specific or inducible promoters to drive gene expression instead of constitutive promoters can overcome such unfavourable effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of specific promoters to drive gene expression has recently been shown to positively influence agronomically important traits4,38, and the specific expression of PLA1 provides another example of the importance of promoter choice in the design of transgenic constructs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Targeted overexpression of PLA1 not only positively affected leaf and plant size and stover yield, but also seed yield.
