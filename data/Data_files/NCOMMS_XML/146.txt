Acute loss of TET function results in aggressive myeloid cancer in mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'TET-family dioxygenases oxidize 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in DNA, and exert tumour suppressor activity in many types of cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even in the absence of TET coding region mutations, TET loss-of-function is strongly associated with cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that acute elimination of TET function induces the rapid development of an aggressive, fully-penetrant and cell-autonomous myeloid leukaemia in mice, pointing to a causative role for TET loss-of-function in this myeloid malignancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phenotypic and transcriptional profiling shows aberrant differentiation of haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, impaired erythroid and lymphoid differentiation and strong skewing to the myeloid lineage, with only a mild relation to changes in DNA modification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observe progressive accumulation of phospho-H2AX and strong impairment of DNA damage repair pathways, suggesting a key role for TET proteins in maintaining genome integrity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Enzymes of the TET (ten-eleven translocation) family are dioxygenases that convert 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and the further oxidation products 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC)1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together these oxidized methylcytosines (oxi-mC) facilitate DNA demethylation and also function as epigenetic marks5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss-of-function mutations in TET2 are associated with diverse myeloid and lymphoid malignancies in humans8,9,10, but diminished TET expression or activity are also prominent features of numerous other cancers including melanoma and glioblastoma; moreover, low TET1 levels in breast and other cancers have been shown to correlate with advanced disease, metastases and poor patient survival (reviewed in refs 11, 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the molecular connections between TET loss-of-function and oncogenic transformation remain to be defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In humans, TET2 is recurrently deleted or mutated in a wide range of myeloid malignancies including myelodysplastic syndromes, myeloproliferative neoplasms, chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia and secondary acute myeloid leukaemia, as well as in T-cell lymphomas including angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and peripheral T-cell lymphoma-not otherwise specified8,9,10,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TET2 mutations observed in these conditions are inactivating loss-of-function mutations that impair 5mC oxidation and are associated with decreased genomic 5hmC levels2; however, the development of full-blown malignancy requires a second hit11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To model this phenomenon, we and others have generated and studied Tet-deficient mice8,15,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tet2 and Tet3 are both highly expressed in murine haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs)2, and their individual deletion in mice results in aberrant haematopoiesis, characterized by expansion of HSPCs with enhanced self-renewal capacity, augmented haematopoietic repopulation and preferential differentiation towards myeloid lineages8,12,15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Certain strains of Tet2-deficient mice develop a chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia-like disease, but with long latency and low penetrance8,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, germline Tet1 deficiency in mice is associated with lymphocytosis and the late development of a poorly penetrant B-cell lymphoma18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together these results indicate that loss of a single TET protein is not sufficient to promote malignancy efficiently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, to explore the relation between TET loss-of-function and cancer, we generated mice homozygous for a germline deletion of Tet2 and a conditional allele of Tet3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our goal was not to model a human disease, since TET3-coding region mutations are relatively rare in humans19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, we wished to examine the relation of TET loss-of-function to oncogenesis, using a mouse model in which a profound loss of TET function could be acutely induced in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show here that Tet2/ mice acutely deleted for Tet3 displayed a rapid, progressive leukocytosis with neutrophilia, monocytosis, thrombocytopenia and severe anaemia, which developed within a few weeks into a highly aggressive myeloid leukaemia in 100% of the mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcriptional profiling revealed aberrant lineage priming20 in HSPC, coupled to impaired erythroid and lymphoid differentiation and marked skewing towards the myeloid lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes in gene transcription were not strongly linked to changes in DNA methylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bone marrow chimera and splenocyte transfer experiments indicated that the myeloid leukaemia was induced in a cell-autonomous manner and was transplantable to secondary recipient mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Myeloid progenitors and mature myeloid-lineage cells acutely deleted for TET function progressively accumulated DNA damage and showed strong impairment of DNA damage responses and DNA break repair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data indicate that TET loss-of-function accelerates myeloid leukaemogenesis, through mechanisms that involve lineage dysregulation, uncontrolled expansion and genomic instability in differentiating cells.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Acute loss of TET function results in myeloid leukaemia', 'To diminish TET function profoundly in adult mice, we first set up an inducible system whereby Tet3 could be acutely deleted in haematopoietic precursor cells in the context of a germline deletion of Tet2 (Tet2/ Tet3fl/fl Mx1-Cre+ mice)12,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mice were injected five times with polyinosinepolycytidine (pIpC) over a 10-day period, a regimen that induces Cre recombinase expressed under control of the interferon--inducible Mx1 promoter21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 2 weeks, we observed a complete loss of Tet3 messenger RNA expression in several haematopoietic cell types, with no compensatory upregulation of Tet1 (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of TET function was monitored at 2 and 4 weeks after pIpC injection by anti-cytosine-5-methylenesulfonate dot blot of bisulfite-treated genomic DNA2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ablation of either Tet2 or Tet3 led to a modest (approximately twofold) decrease in 5hmC levels in the bone marrow and spleen, but deletion of both genes led to an almost complete loss of 5hmC (Fig 1a; Supplementary Fig 1be).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus Tet2 and Tet3 are the main enzymes that catalyse 5hmC production in cells of the haematopoietic system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "Figure 1: Acute deletion of Tet3 in Tet2-deficient mice results in myeloid leukaemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Quantification of 5hmC levels in Tet2/3 DKO bone marrow 4 weeks after pIpC injection by anti-CMS dot blot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) KaplanMeier curve representing percent survival of WT (n=23) and DKO (n=14) mice over time after pIpC injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No lethality was observed for WT, Tet2-deficient (n=4) and Tet3-deficient (n=6) mice during this period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strategy for conditional deletion of Tet3 in adult mice is shown above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For exact genotypes, see Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) MayGrünwaldGiemsa-stained peripheral blood smears, 4 weeks after pIpC administration (n=7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 20 m.

Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examination of peripheral blood showed that DKO mice developed progressive leukocytosis, mainly due to expansion of myeloid-lineage cells including neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils, with concomitant development of profound anaemia and thrombocytopenia (Fig 1c,d; Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flow cytometry confirmed progressive amplification of myeloid-lineage cells in the peripheral blood of DKO mice: Gr-1+ Mac-1+ granulocytes increased within 2 days of the last pIpC injection, with Gr-1 Mac-1+ monocytes expanding at somewhat later times (Fig 1e; Supplementary Fig 3ac), and the percentages of B and T lymphoid cells showing a gradual decrease (Supplementary Fig 3d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In all Tet2/3 DKO mice, myeloid expansion was accompanied by massive, progressive splenomegaly and hepatomegaly (Fig 1f;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this study, we demonstrate for the first time a causal association of TET loss-of-function with the rapid occurrence of a malignant cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Induced deficiency of both Tet2 and Tet3 in mice leads to the almost complete loss of 5hmC in the bone marrow and spleen, and concomitantly to the rapid and cell-autonomous development of an aggressive, fully penetrant and transmissible myeloid leukaemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenotype is not observed with mice lacking only Tet2 or Tet3, indicating that Tet2 and Tet3 function redundantly to suppress oncogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Typically, cancer initiation, progression and metastasis involve multiple steps of progressive cellular dysfunction, including loss of genome integrity and the consequent acquisition of mutations that promote cell transformation47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These processes are rarely the result of a single oncogenic hit, but require multiple mutagenic events that generally accumulate over a long time period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The striking feature of our study is that acute TET loss-of-function accelerates oncogenesis, such that uncontrolled cell proliferation and genome instability develop in a compressed time span of only 45 weeks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Profound loss of function is required, since mice lacking individual TET proteins may show precancerous symptoms but develop full-blown malignancy only sporadically and at a very late age, if at all8,15,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus TET proteins are required to maintain genome stability, and collectively constitute a major class of tumour suppressors in cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While TET2 mutations are thought to be driver mutations in haematopoietic malignancies, whole-exome sequencing of large cancer cohorts has revealed only rare mutations in TET1 or TET3 (refs 19, 48, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, numerous studies have demonstrated substantial decreases in 5hmC levels in diverse human cancers, even in the absence of TET-coding region mutations2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In several cases, decreased 5hmC levels reflect decreased TET messenger RNA or protein expression secondary to upregulation of E3 ligases or microRNAs50,51,52,53, or correlate with increased DNA methylation at TET gene promoters18,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other cases, inhibition of TET function appears to be the underlying cause: for instance in many glioblastomas and myeloid leukaemias, recurrent dominant mutations in IDH1 and IDH2, the cellular enzymes that produce 2-oxoglutarate, result in massively increased levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate55, an oncometabolite that interferes with the activity of TET enzymes and other dioxygenases56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of these findings, we explored the relation of profound TET loss-of-function to cell lineage specification and oncogenic transformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data document a causal relation between TET loss-of-function and cancer, and argue against the possibility that decreased 5hmC in cancer cells merely reflects their rapid proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Notably, we observed no consistent relation between DNA modification and gene expression in DKO versus WT LSK cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected from the fact that TET proteins facilitate DNA demethylation, early progenitor (LSK) cells from Tet2/3 DKO mice showed increased DNA modification relative to WT LSK cells, and the biggest differences were observed at genomic regions where DNA modification levels are intermediate: canyon edges, gene bodies and enhancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, transcriptional profiling revealed clear changes in gene expression in DKO versus WT LSK cells, including decreased expression of stem cell genes, altered lineage priming and strong myeloid skewing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, only a minority of regions with increased DNA methylation displayed decreased transcription of the associated genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Potentially, increased DNA methylation might better correlate with decreased gene transcription in GMP or Mac-1+ cells that are further along the myeloid differentiation pathway than the LSK progenitor cells examined here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If so, it would underscore the view that altered DNA methylation is a late consequence of altered gene transcription rather than its direct cause (reviewed in refs 57, 58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'What mechanisms underlie the lineage skewing induced by deletion of both Tet2 and Tet3, if increased DNA methylation is not the primary cause?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important factor may be the profound loss of TET-generated oxi-mC bases in Tet2/3 DKO cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5hmC is present at high levels at active enhancers and the gene bodies of highly transcribed genes59; moreover, both 5hmC and 5fC are stable modifications that are lost through DNA replication in somatic cells60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, profound loss of 5hmC in Tet2/3 DKO cells would be expected to affect gene transcription only after several replication cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If, as recently reported61, 5fC and 5caC directly affect the processivity of RNA polymerase II, oxi-mC would be most heavily diluted, and gene transcription would be most prominently decreased, at genes expressed in actively proliferating cells that encode key signalling proteins and transcriptional regulators that shape cell lineage commitment and function62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The hypothesis that oxi-mC may be more relevant than 5mC is also supported by recent findings that mice lacking either Dnmt3a or Tet2 in HSC show similar phenotypes in terms of augmented HSC repopulation capacity, myeloid skewing and ultimately myeloid transformation8,15,16,17,63,64,65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNMT3A produces 5mC, the substrate for TET proteins66.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, impaired function of these two enzymes would be expected to have opposite effects on DNA methylation, resulting in overall decreases and increases in 5mC, respectively, but would be similar in terms of decreasing oxi-mC (Dnmt3a-deficient cells have lower levels of the TET substrate 5mC and therefore less oxi-mC, whereas TET2 mutations are loss-of-function mutations and therefore also have low oxi-mC2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus the similar biological phenotypes of Tet2- and Dnmt3a-deficient mice could plausibly reflect loss of oxi-mC in each case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to skewing to the myeloid lineage, Tet2/3 DKO cells display uncontrolled proliferation and rapid progression to oncogenic transformation, a process accompanied by increased levels of the DNA damage marker phospho-H2AX and slower resolution of this mark.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These features were most apparent in cells that had progressed along the differentiation pathway rather than in early precursors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mac-1+ cells sorted from bone marrow and spleen of Tet2/3 DKO mice showed altered expression of many genes encoding proteins in the homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining pathways of DNA repair, but it is not clear whether this is a cause or a consequence of the observed defects in DNA damage responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further mechanistic studies are necessary to determine how TET loss-of-function leads to impaired DNA damage.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

splenocytes were isolated from Tet2+/+ Tet3fl/fl Mx1-Cre and Tet2/ Tet3fl/fl Mx1-Cre+ (for Fig 4dk) or Tet2fl/fl Tet3fl/fl Mx1-Cre and Tet2fl/fl Tet3fl/fl Mx1-Cre+ (for Supplementary Fig 13) mice at about 3.5 or 4.5 weeks following pIpC injection, respectively, depleted of red blood cells and 2 × 106 cells in PBS were injected intravenously via retro-orbital route into sublethally irradiated (600 cGy) C57BL/6 recipient mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For transfer of bone marrow cells in Supplementary Fig 14, bone marrow cells were isolated from Tet2fl/fl Tet3fl/fl ERT2-Cre and Tet2fl/fl Tet3fl/fl ERT2-Cre+ at 3 weeks following tamoxifen injection, depleted of red blood cells and 2 × 106 cells in PBS were injected intravenously via retro-orbital route into sublethally irradiated (600 cGy) C57BL/6 recipient mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For transfer of Mac-1+ cells in Supplementary Fig 15, 2 × 106 Mac-1+ cells sorted from Tet2fl/fl Tet3fl/fl Mx1-Cre and Tet2fl/fl Tet3fl/fl Mx1-Cre+ at about 4.5 weeks following pIpC injection were combined with equal number of WT bone marrow helper cells, followed by injection into lethally irradiated (10 Gy, two split doses with a 3-h interval) C57BL/6 recipient mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, the recipient mice were monitored for survival every day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were killed when they met our monitoring criteria described above and histological or cytological analyses were carried out as described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Colony-forming assay in vitro', 'For colony-forming assay using splenocytes and liver cells (Fig 1g), cells were harvested from spleens and livers of Tet2+/+ Tet3fl/fl Mx1-Cre and Tet2/ Tet3fl/fl Mx1-Cre+ mice about 3 weeks following pIpC injections, depleted of red blood cells and plated at 105 cells per 35-mm dish in duplicate into cytokine-supplemented methylcellulose medium (Methocult M3534, STEMCELL Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colony-forming units were photographed and counted on day 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For colony-forming assay using sorted LSK or GMP cells (Fig 3c), LSK or GMP cells were sorted from the bone marrow of WT (Tet2fl/fl, Tet2fl/fl Tet3fl/fl or Tet3fl/+ Tet3fl/fl), Tet2KO (Tet2/ or Tet2/ Tet3fl/fl), Tet3KO (Tet3fl/fl Mx1-Cre+) or DKO (Tet2/ Tet3fl/fl Mx1-Cre+) mice at 4 weeks after pIpC injection and seeded at a density of 1,000 cells per 35-mm dish in duplicate into cytokine-supplemented methylcellulose media (Methocult M3534, STEMCELL Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For experiments in Supplementary Fig 9cf, LSK cells were sorted from the bone marrow of Tet2+/+
