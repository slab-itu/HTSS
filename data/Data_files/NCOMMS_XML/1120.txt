CTCF orchestrates the germinal centre transcriptional program and prevents premature plasma cell differentiation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In germinal centres (GC) mature B cells undergo intense proliferation and immunoglobulin gene modification before they differentiate into memory B cells or long-lived plasma cells (PC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GC B-cell-to-PC transition involves a major transcriptional switch that promotes a halt in cell proliferation and the production of secreted immunoglobulins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is required for the GC reaction in vivo, whereas in vitro the requirement for CTCF is not universal and instead depends on the pathways used for B-cell activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CTCF maintains the GC transcriptional programme, allows a high proliferation rate, and represses the expression of Blimp-1, the master regulator of PC differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Restoration of Blimp-1 levels partially rescues the proliferation defect of CTCF-deficient B cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our data reveal an essential function of CTCF in maintaining the GC transcriptional programme and preventing premature PC differentiation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Germinal centres (GC) are microstructures that develop in secondary lymphoid organs as a result of B-cell activation by antigen and that allow the generation of high-affinity memory B cells or long-lived antibody secreting plasma cells (PC), the effector cells of the humoral immune response1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After antigen engagement, naive B cells are activated by interaction with CD4+ T cells and initiate a vigorous proliferative response that promotes the clonal expansion of the cells that recognized the antigen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proliferating GC B cells engage in the somatic remodelling of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes by somatic hypermutation, which introduces mutations in the variable region of the immunoglobulin genes and generates clonally related B cells expressing immunoglobulins with slightly altered binding specificities1,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within these closely related clones, only those B cells with a higher affinity for the initiating antigen are selected for survival and further proliferation in the process known as affinity maturation2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the biology of GCs is extremely complex and entails proliferation, B-cell receptor signalling for survival, cell death and cell fate decisions along with a significant reorganization of the genomic architecture that encodes the GC B-cell transcriptome4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The exit of B cells from the GC and their differentiation into PCs involves a major transcriptional switch that promotes on one hand, a halt in cell-cycle progression and immunoglobulin diversification, and on the other, a boost in the transcription of immunoglobulin genes together with a massive production of secreted immunoglobulin5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two important transcriptional regulators orchestrate the transition from naive to GC B cell and from GC B cell to PC: Bcl-6 and Blimp-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transcriptional repressor Bcl-6 is considered the master regulator of the GC reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bcl-6 is upregulated at the GC stage and regulates the expression of genes involved in B-cell activation, survival, DNA-damage response and cell-cycle arrest, among other pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice lacking Bcl-6 cannot form GCs or produce high-affinity antibodies (reviewed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blimp-1 is a transcriptional regulator expressed at the transition from GC to PC differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  B cells that lack Blimp-1 are unable to proceed to the PC fate and cannot secrete immunoglobulins7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blimp-1 acts as a transcriptional repressor that promotes B-cell proliferation arrest, establishes the PC transcriptional programme and triggers immunoglobulin secretion7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, Bcl-6 and Blimp-1 establish mutual negative regulatory loops, such that Bcl-6 prevents Blimp-1 expression and Blimp-1 is considered key to extinguish the GC reaction8,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, the GC and PC differentiation stages can be considered as antagonistic transcriptional programs orchestrated by Bcl-6 and Blimp-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a ubiquitous architectural protein with eleven zinc-finger domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although initially described as a transcriptional regulator of the c-myc proto-oncogene13,14,15 that establishes physical barriers on the DNA acting as a transcriptional insulator14, studies have shown that CTCF is also associated with regions of active transcription16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CTCF mediates long-range chromatin loops to facilitate or prevent promoterenhancer interactions17,18,19, suggesting that CTCF may have a general function in the control of gene transcription (reviewed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of studies have addressed the function of CTCF during B-cell development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Removal of CTCF-binding sites at the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus has revealed an important function of CTCF in the regulation of V(D)J recombination during bone marrow differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, elimination of CTCF in early B-cell precursors, although compatible with immunoglobulin heavy chain recombination, resulted in a block in B-cell differentiation in the bone marrow21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the function of CTCF in mature B cells, and particularly during the GC reaction, is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we use a conditional mouse model to deplete CTCF specifically in GC B cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that CTCF is required for the GC reaction in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the sensitivity to CTCF deficiency in vitro is selectively dependent on the pathways mediating B-cell activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extensive transcriptome and functional analyses reveal that CTCF is required to maintain the GC transcriptional programme and to prevent premature PC differentiation by facilitating cell proliferation and by blocking Blimp-1 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus our data unveil CTCF as an important regulatory factor for late B-cell differentiation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'CTCF is required for the germinal centre reaction in vivo', 'To address the role of CTCF during the GC reaction we specifically depleted CTCF in GC B cells by breeding mice carrying a floxed CTCF allele with transgenic AID-CRE mice (AID-CRETG/+), where the Cre recombinase is inserted together with a cDNA encoding the human CD2 molecule (hCD2) in a BAC construct that contains the complete activation-induced deaminase (AID) locus (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AID is a deaminase expressed in GC B cells that initiates antibody diversification by somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in CTCFfl/fl; AID-CRETG/+ mice the expression of CRE and the deletion of CTCF is triggered by the expression of AIDtherefore specifically expressed in GC B cellsand surface expression of hCD2 can be used to track GC B cells and CTCF depletion (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, analysis of B-cell differentiation in bone marrow and spleen did not show any difference between CTCFfl/fl; AID-CRETG/+ and CTCFfl/+; AID-CRETG/+ mice (Supplementary Fig 1ce and Supplementary Table 1), indicating that B-cell differentiation is not affected before GC formation in CTCFfl/fl; AID-CRETG/+ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To determine the role of CTCF in GCs, we immunized CTCFfl/fl; AID-CRETG/+ (CTCF deficient), and CTCFfl/+; AID-CRETG/+, CTCF+/+; AID-CRETG/+ CTCF+/+; AID-CRE+/+ (control) mice with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and analysed the GC response in spleen 7 days later (Fig 1ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the proportions of GC B cells (Fas+GL7+) and IgG1+-switched cells were markedly reduced in CTCFfl/fl; AID-CRETG/+ mice when compared to all groups of control mice (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the expression of hCD2 is almost undetectable in CTCFfl/fl;AID-CRETG/+ mice (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of GC B cells upon CTCF depletion was also evident by immunofluorescence staining, which showed that immunized CTCFfl/fl mice have normal splenic and follicular architecture but completely lack PNA+, GC B cells (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that we did not detect any significant difference among the three control groups of mice, hereafter all experiments will be performed using CTCFfl/+; AID-CRETG/+ (CTCFfl/+ for brevity) and CTCFfl/fl; AID-CRETG/+ (CTCFfl/fl) littermates as control and CTCF-deficient groups, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently with the novo GC formation, we found a profound GC block in Peyers patches (Supplementary Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results show that CTCF is absolutely required for the GC reaction in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: CTCF is required for the germinal centre reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) FACS analysis of GL7, Fas, IgG1 and hCD2 expression in spleen B cells from CTCF+/+; AID-CRE+/+ (n=5), CTCF+/+;AID-CRETG/+ (n=6), CTCFfl/+;AID-CRETG/+ (n=5) and CTCFfl/fl; AID-CRETG/+ (n=5) mice 7 days after SRBC immunization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plots are gated on B220+ cells (top) or on total live lymphocytes (middle and bottom).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Quantifications of GL7, Fas, IgG1 and hCD2 cells as percentages within B220+ cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ***P less_than 0.001; ****P less_than 0.0001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of immunized spleen cryosections from CTCF+/+;AID-CRE+/+, CTCF+/+;AID-CRETG/+, CTCFfl/+;AID-CRETG/+ and CTCFfl/fl; AID-CRETG/+ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sections were stained with anti-B220 (green), PNA (red) and DAPI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 200 m.

of change in both conditions, that is, were either upregulated both at the GC to PC transition and upon CTCF depletion (26.4%) or downregulated in both cases (34%) (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A major category of genes showing parallel regulation in the PC transition and upon CTCF deletion was cell-cycle genes (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data agrees with the observation that CTCF expression decreases at the transition from GC to PC differentiation (Fig 5d, data from GSE60927 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, one of the genes upregulated upon CTCF depletion was the master regulator of PC differentiation, Blimp-1 (refs 7, 8) (Fig 5e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we found reciprocal downregulation of Bcl-6 upon CTCF depletion (Fig 5e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address the mechanism by which CTCF controls Blimp-1, we first analysed published data34 and found that CTCF binds to Blimp-1 (Prdm1 gene) in B cells (Fig 5f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-quantitative PCR (qPCR) in CD3/CD28 T-cell-stimulated B cells, and confirmed that under these experimental conditions CTCF also binds to Blimp-1 (Fig 5e), suggesting that direct binding of CTCF to Prdm1 gene could mediate a chromatin configuration that hinders Blimp-1 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, numerous PC genes were upregulated, including immunoglobulin genes or the PC marker Syndecan-1 and genes considered direct targets of Blimp-1, such as Myc, CIITA, Bcl11a or Lta were downregulated (Fig 5h,i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we detected an increase in the secretion of IgM in CD3/CD28 T-activated CTCFfl/fl B cells when compared with CTCFfl/+ controls (Fig 5j), suggesting that the generation of antibody secreting cells is more efficient in the absence of CTCF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together these results support the notion that CTCF maintains the GC programme by preventing the premature activation of the PC programme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'CD40

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The establishment of the GC reaction and the shift to PC differentiation involve complex transcriptional programs and the coordinated expression of gene networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the function of master transcriptional regulators in these events, such as Bcl-6 and Blimp-1 is firmly established, the impact of chromatin structure changes at the GC to PC transition is poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CTCF is believed to play general transcriptional regulatory functions by establishing long-range DNA interactions between distal enhancers and promoters (reviewed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have shown here that CTCF is absolutely required for the GC reaction through the transcriptional regulation of genes required for B cell proliferation, and that this effect is at least partially due to the inhibition of Blimp-1, which programs GC B cells for their entry into PC differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We report here that the sensitivity of in vitro activated B cells to CTCF loss is highly dependent on the activation pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is an unexpected finding, given that all three scenarios of B cell activation analysed here (that is, in vivo GC B cells, LPS/IL4 activation or CD3/CD28 T-dependent activation) share a big proportion of transcriptome changes, and that all three involve an intense proliferation rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our data are reminiscent of the finding that a proliferation defect in CTCF-deficient T cells can be bypassed with phorbol ester and ionomycin stimulation, which circumvents TCR signalling38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that LPS/IL4-stimulated B cells seem refractory to the loss of CTCF whereas in vivo and in in vitro T co-cultures, the B-cell activation programme is clearly impaired.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is supported by the higher resemblance between GC and T-co-cultures transcriptomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore our data show that LPS/IL4 activation, one of the most frequently used protocols for B cell activation in vitro, falls short of recapitulating features of the in vivo GC reaction as compared to in vitro T-cell-mediated activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although beyond the scope of this work, further molecular characterization of these activation programs is a fascinating topic for further investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The insensitivity of LPS/IL4-stimulated B cells to CTCF loss was molecularly supported by the finding that only 50 genes showed altered transcriptional levels in CTCF-deficient B cells, as opposed to  greater than 2,000 genes significantly altered in B cells stimulated by T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, the amount of remaining CTCF protein was comparable under both conditions and roughly 15% of normal levels (within CD2+ sorted cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we cannot discriminate whether this reflects a small proportion of cells that retain unrecombined floxed alleles or a small proportion of CTCF protein in many cells due to slow protein turnover, our data clearly show that T-stimulated B cells sense this suboptimal presence of CTCF, whereas LPS/IL4-stimulated cells do not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that the strong signalling triggered by cytokines bypasses the need for CTCF whereas in the context of T-cell-mediated activation in vitro or in vivo, where the activation thresholds may become limiting, CTCF turns into a critical transcriptional regulator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, residual amounts of CTCF in LPS/IL4 cells might be enough to provide minimal architectural requirements for B-cell proliferation and survival in the presence of cytokines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In sharp contrast, the complete absence of GC B cells in immunized CTCF-deficient mice, suggests that in vivo the absence of CTCF promotes either a more profound block in proliferation or additional functional defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is an important issue that deserves further analysis with suitable mouse models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While numerous studies have approached the DNA-binding profile of CTCF in different cell types and tissues, the function of CTCF in global transcriptional regulation has only rarely been addressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, ChIP-seq analyses show that about 84% of all CTCF-binding sites found in LPS/IL4-stimulated B cells are shared with naive B cells (Supplementary Fig 6) our unpublished analysis from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, establishing a functional correlation between a CTCF DNA-binding site and its targets for transcriptional regulation is remarkably complex40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our approach has directly focused on the functional impact of CTCF deficiency by measuring the transcriptional shifts in GC B cells and showed that CTCF is required for the transcriptional regulation of more than 2,000 genes either directly or indirectly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Importantly, the vast majority of CTCF-regulated genes are part of the GC transcriptome, indicating that CTCF plays a pivotal function in the initiation and/or maintenance of the GC transcriptional programme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While it is likely that CTCF is required for GC initiation, the delay of CTCF depletiondependent on AID expressionin our model is not suitable to specifically ascertain that point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, our data strongly support the view that CTCF is required for the maintenance of the GC transcriptional programme and that it does so by repressing the transition to PC differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, CTCF deletion promotes a delay in cell proliferation, one of the hallmarks of B cells exiting the GC programme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we found abnormally high levels of Blimp-1, the master regulator of PC differentiation, in CTCF-deficient cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that we only find a mild decrease in Bcl-6 levels under these conditions, we believe that this effect is secondary to Blimp-1 upregulation, and not vice versa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, numerous other genes of the PC differentiation programme are upregulated upon CTCF deficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourth, we detected increased levels of IgM secretion in CTCF-deficient cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, restoring Blimp-1 levels by anti-CD40 treatment partially rescues the proliferation rate of CTCF-deficient cells, again suggesting that the proliferation defect is secondary to the premature trigger of PC differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our data reveal a key function of CTCF in orchestrating transcriptional changes required for the GC programme and for preventing premature PC differentiation through Blimp-1 inhibition.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
