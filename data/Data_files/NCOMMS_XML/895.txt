CD40-signalling abrogates induction of RORt+ Treg cells by intestinal CD103+ DCs and causes fatal colitis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Immune homeostasis in intestinal tissues depends on the generation of regulatory T (Treg) cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs) acquire microbiota-derived material from the gut lumen for transport to draining lymph nodes and generation of receptor-related orphan t+ (RORt+) Helios-induced Treg (iTreg) cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show CD40-signalling as a microbe-independent signal that can induce migration of CD103+ DCs from the lamina propria (LP) to the mesenteric lymph nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transgenic mice with constitutive CD11c-specific CD40-signalling have reduced numbers of CD103+ DCs in LP and a low frequency of RORt+Helios iTreg cells, exacerbated inflammatory Th1/Th17 responses, high titres of microbiota-specific immunoglobulins, dysbiosis and fatal colitis, but no pathology is detected in other tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data demonstrate a CD40-dependent mechanism capable of abrogating iTreg cell induction by DCs, and suggest that the CD40L/CD40-signalling axis might be able to intervene in the generation of new iTreg cells in order to counter-regulate immune suppression to enhance immunity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The immune system of the gut discriminates between invading pathogens and colonizing commensal bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specialized populations of intestinal cells integrate local signals to regulate and maintain a mutualistic relationship with the microbiota1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Failure to integrate this information into proper regulatory processes can lead to pathologies such as inflammatory bowel diseases, allergy or metabolic dysregulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells are important for such homeostatic balance by controlling immune responses2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treg cells can be generated in the thymus from developing CD4+ thymocytes (nTregs), as well as by differentiation from mature peripheral CD4+ T cells to induced Tregs (iTregs), a process requiring transforming growth factor  (TGF-)3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Germ-free mice have reduced Treg cell numbers4, a deficit that can be rescued by colonization with commensal bacteria5, suggesting that microbes cause colonic iTreg cell differentiation or expansion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  iTreg and nTreg cells occupy distinct cellular niches, indicating a non-redundant role for iTreg cells to control mucosal homeostasis6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A large fraction of colonic Foxp3+ Treg cells is induced by the microbiota to express retinoic acid receptor-related orphan t (RORt)7,8, and the deletion of RORt+ iTreg cells caused increased production of intestinal IL-17A and interferon- (IFN-) in one study8 or elevated type 2 helper T (Th2)-responses in another study7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although both studies demonstrated the importance of RORt+Foxp3+ iTregs to suppress T effector cells in the gut, the precise anti-inflammatory role of RORt+Foxp3+ iTreg cells is unclear9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Dendritic cells (DC) present commensal and dietary antigens to T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD103+ DCs in the lamina propria (LP) of the intestine take up bacterial antigen efficiently from the gut lumen10 or from CX3CR1+ macrophages11 to induce the development of peripheral iTreg cells12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD103+CD11b+ DCs are a major subpopulation of tolerogenic DCs, which can also induce Th17 cells14,15 or Th17 and Th1 cells upon activation with Toll-like receptor (TLR)-ligands16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD103+CD11b DCs express high levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), TGF, integrin 8 and several other proteins necessary for induction of iTreg cells and gut homing17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, most CD103 DCs in the LP express CD11b, have a phenotype similar to macrophages, and can prime IL-17-producing and IFN--producing T cells in steady state without further stimulation17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies revealed precise roles of the distinct DC subsets showing that CD103+CD11b DCs migrating from LP to draining LN, but not sessile CD64+ monocyte-derived cells are essential for the induction of iTreg cells18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The exact mechanisms controlling the functional switch between tolerogenic iTreg-inducing versus immunogenic CD103+ DCs is elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pattern recognition receptors and inflammatory signals certainly have a function in functional DC-modulation; however, many microbial products are shared between commensal and pathogenic microorganisms, making them ambivalent signals for DC to induce tolerance or immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, signals delivered by immune cells could also suppress iTreg-generation when immune responses are needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD40-signals can stop Treg-suppression of DCs19 and modulate CD103-expression by DCs20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To further investigate the role of CD40-signalling, here we study external CD40-triggers and analyse transgenic mice expressing latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1)/CD40-molecules, inducing a constitutive active CD40-signalling in DCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that CD40-signals cause few phenotypic changes in DCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, CD103+ DCs of the intestinal LP upregulate CCR7, migrate from the LP to mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs) and rapidly die by apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Continuous CD40-signalling disables CD103+ DCs to induce RORt+Foxp3+ iTreg cells and causes accumulation of IL-17A+IFN-+ Th17/Th1 T cells, breakdown of tolerance to gut microbiota, dysbiosis and fatal colitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data describe CD40-triggering as a microbe-independent signal sufficient to modulate the tolerogenic properties of LP CD103+ DCs.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'CD40-induced migration of intestinal DCs to mLNs', 'Various signals have been identified that enable DCs to develop tolerogenic iTreg-inducing functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides GM-CSF, RA and TLR2 signalling, also -catenin-dependent signals, uptake of apoptotic DCs and PD-1 ligation may imprint Foxp3+ Treg induction (reviewed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, it is much less clear which signals abrogate Treg induction by DCs, for example in situations where induction of immunity is warranted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides microbial stimuli also CD40-signals can modulate the function of CD103+ DCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, injection of anti-CD40 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can reduce the numbers of splenic CD103+ DC20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, triggering of CD40 is known to induce incomplete maturation and increased survival of DCs22, which only become fully matured, when CD40-signalling is combined with a microbial trigger23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the influence of CD40-signalling on DCs in vivo, we injected anti-CD40 mAbs into C57BL/6 mice and analysed DC subsets in the LP and mLNs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All DC subsets in the LP are strongly reduced at 72 h post treatment, with a more prominent effect on both CD103+CD11b and CD103+CD11b+ DC subsets (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To find out if the decreased DC numbers in LP would be due to apoptosis, we analysed DCs for presence of activated caspase 3, a marker for cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both, CD103+CD11b and CD103+CD11b+ DCs in LP show no increased levels of activated caspase 3 (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, most likely cell death is not the reason for disappearance of CD103+ DCs from LP upon anti-CD40 stimulation (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In parallel, the frequencies and numbers of CD103+ DC subpopulations transiently increase in the mLNs with a peak accumulation at 24 h post injection (Fig 1a,b), suggesting that CD40-ligation induces migration of DCs from the LP to mLNs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interpretation is further strengthened by the finding that CD11c+MHCII+ DCs sorted from the LP after anti-CD40 treatment upregulate expression of mRNA for CCR7 (Fig 1c), which is a requirement for migration of CD103+DCs from LP to mLNs25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, CCR7-surface levels are upregulated strongly by CD103+CD11b and CD103+CD11b+, but to a much lesser extent by CD103 DCs (Fig 1c, centre and right hand panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the increase of CD103+DCs in mLNs is only transient, we investigated the fate of these cells and analysed DCs in mLNs for the presence of activated caspase 3 as a marker for apoptosis (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numbers of activated caspase 3+ CD103+ and CD103 DCs briefly increase at 16 h post treatment, but are then comparable to controls, suggesting a transiently increased number of apoptotic cells (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also monocyte-derived macrophages are involved in immune homeostasis of the intestine26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore analysed different macrophage subpopulations P1  P4 as described previously27 (Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis showed that anti-CD40 injection also modifies the composition of macrophages in the intestine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proinflammatory Ly6C+ subpopulations P1 and P2 transiently increase in population size, while the frequencies of Ly6CMHCII+ subpopulation P3/4 decrease relatively to the other subpopulations, but remain relatively unaltered in total cell numbers (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in contrast to DCs, macrophages of the LP do not migrate to the mLNs, as previously published28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "Figure 1: Injection of anti-CD40 antibody induces migration of DCs from LP to mLNs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Representative FACS plots of DC subsets as differentiated by CD103 and CD11b in LP (gated on live CD45+MHCII+CD11c+CD64 cells, Supplementary Fig 1a) and mLNs (gated on live MHCII+CD11c+ cells, Supplementary Fig 1b) at different time points after CD40 injection are shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numbers in the FACS plot indicate the percentages of cells in the respective subset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Numbers of cells per DC subset from (a) LP (black) and mLNs (red) are shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c, left) CCR7 mRNA expression was analysed in CD11c+MHCII+ cells purified from the LP of control mice and 16 h after anti-CD40 injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (central) CCR7 surface expression of distinct LP DC subsets was analysed in untreated control mice (Ctr) and mice treated with anti-CD40 mAb (iso, isotype control) 24 h after Ab-injection by flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numbers in histograms indicate per cent CCR7+ DCs in the respective gate (mean±s.e.m;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Here, we report that acute and constitutive CD40-triggering of intestinal DCs induces their robust migration from LP to the mLNs leading to strong reduction of CD103+CD11b and CD103+CD11b+ DCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such changes in DC-homeostasis were accompanied by strongly reduced frequencies of HeliosRORT+ iTreg and increased LP IFN-+ Th1 and IL-17A+IFN-+ Th17/Th1 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter can be found in the inflamed intestine of both humans and mice38,39 and are required for the pathogenesis of colitis40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, classical Th17 cells, which have protective roles in tissues and contribute to barrier integrity41, were not altered in the LP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A likely explanation for the increase in Th17/Th1- and Th1-cells and intestinal pathology is the very strong decrease of HeliosRORT+ iTreg-frequencies, suggesting a defective ability of colonic Tregs to regulate inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been previously reported that the gradual numerical decrease of Foxp3+ Tregs by injection of titrated amounts of diphteria toxin into Foxp3DTR-mice did augment Th1 and Th17 cells42 and that regulation of Treg numbers is MHCII+ DC-dependent43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As CD103+ DCs have the unique capacity to induce iTreg cells from naive CD4 T cells12,13,18, their strongly reduced frequencies in DC-LMP1/CD40-mice result in less efficient iTreg induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reduction is a recessive effect, as the presence of wt CD103+ DCs in mixed chimeras could reconstitute iTregs and protect from colitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to mice where HeliosRORT+ iTreg were depleted genetically7,8, inflammatory T-cell responses were increased in the intestine, although overall frequencies of Foxp3+ Treg cells were not altered, suggesting a compensation by increased frequencies of Helios+RORT nTreg cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with our results, RORT+ iTreg cells have been recently shown to more efficiently suppress colitis than their RORT nTreg counterparts in a transfer colitis model44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown that nTreg would fail to fill the niche of iTreg6 because of their largely non-overlapping TCR repertoires45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, despite the relative increase of nTreg, they could not functionally replace iTregs to regulate T-cell-mediated inflammation and colitis in DC-LMP1/CD40-mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'DC-LMP1/CD40-mice develop colitis without further experimentally induced challenges or acute infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In several other homeostatic models, where CD103+CD11b+ DCs were either genetically removed either alone or were depleted together with CD103+CD11b DCs14,15,46,47 homeostatic generation of IL-17A+ Th17 cells was reduced and mice did not develop colitis spontaneously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast Th17 cells were not altered in LP of DC-LMP/CD40 mice, while Th17/Th1 and Th1 cells were strongly increased in the model of the present study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A major difference between DC-LMP/CD40 mice and the DC-ablation models published previously, is the deletion of CD103+ DCs, which are especially equipped to gather microbial and non-microbial products in the LP from the intestinal lumen10,48 or from CX3CR1+ macrophages11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lack of CD103+ DCs might abolish antigen-acquisition and -transport as well as priming of antigen-specific CD4 T cells in the draining mLNs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to Th17 cells, the generation of intestinal iTregs from naive T cells depends on TCR-recognition of antigen/MHCII-complexes, as mice expressing a single TCR, but no cognate antigen49, or mice with MHCII-deficient APC50,51 cannot induce intestinal iTregs, but accumulate nTregs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, in contrast to other models, CD40-triggering does not deplete CD103+ DCs, but rather enforces their migration from the LP to the mLNs and antigen-transport is not abolished.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This view is supported by the fact that OTII cells proliferated in OVA-fed DC-LMP1/CD40 mice in an antigen-specific fashion but failed to generate normal levels of iTregs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other studies identified CD103CD11b+ DCs as producers of IL-12p40 in the steady state52, enabling them to induce Th17 and Th1 cells even in absence of additional stimulation17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, migratory CD103+ DC might bring gut luminal antigens to the mLNs for presentation to CD4 T cells, either directly or upon transfer to other DCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such presentation might result in generation of Th17 cells, but only inefficient iTreg induction, a dysbalance that may lead to inflammatory colitis in DC-LMP1/CD40 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, luminal antigens may reach the mLN by cell-independent pathways as described previously for OVA53 and then the composition of the DC-subsets able to differentially present antigen might determine the degree naive antigen-specific CD4 T cells differentiate into iTreg of CD4 effector cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'IL-23 promotes inflammatory bowel disease54,55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, neither CD103+ nor CD103 DCs produced significantly elevated IL-23 levels in DC-LMP1/CD40-mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The source of IL-23 apparently varies depending on the homeostatic or inflammatory models studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, during acute intestinal inflammation CD103+CD11b+ DCs were the non-redundant source of IL-23 necessary for anti-Citrobacter rodentium responses56 and produced IL-23 upon TLR 5 stimulation with flagellin52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, CD103+CD11b+ DCs have also been reported to be dispensable for C. rodentium protection47 and CX3CR1+ mononuclear phagocytes were the more critical IL-23-source57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also during acute infection and IL10R blockade CD103+CD11b DCs were dispensable for IL-23 driven inflammatory pathology, while MHCII+ monocytes were the highest IL-23-producers58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As numbers of CD64+ monocytes increased during the onset of colitis in DC-LMP1/CD40-mice and CD64+CD11c+MHCII+ monocytes/macrophages, but not CD64CD11c+MHCII+CD103+ DCs were strong producers of IL-12 and IL-23, it is likely that macrophages or blood-recruited monocytes sustain the inflammatory response also in DC-LMP1/CD40-mice, similar to other models of colitis58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Due to the fact that our model is constitutive, but not inducible, it is difficult to precisely determine what actually initiates the inflammatory response, and which factors and cell types do rather sustain it, once it is established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with ABX could completely neutralize intestinal pathology, with normal frequencies of IL-17A- and IFN--producing T cells and normal levels of commensal-specific antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that CD103+ DCs were diminished also in ABX-treated mice argues for an intrinsic, microbiota- and inflammation-independent effect of CD40-signalling in this DC-subset, which is in marked contrast to CD64+ macrophages and CD103 DCs, that were present at normal levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase of these populations in untreated DC-LMP1/CD40-mice can therefore be considered as a secondary CD40-independent effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the reasons for the relative inert behaviour of CD103 DCs to anti-CD40 mAb treatment or LMP1/CD40-signalling are currently not clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact CD103 DCs do express and can upregulate endogenous CD40 and do express the LMP1/CD40-transgene suggest that CD40-signalling might be wired differently in CD103 DCs as compared with CD103+ DCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Taken together, we present a novel intrinsic model of colitis, where the migration of CD103+ DCs is induced, causing their numerical reduction by apoptosis in the draining mLNs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This leads to abnormally low frequencies of iTregs, breakdown of intestinal tolerance manifested by high frequencies of inflammatory IL-17A- and IFN--producing T cells and high titres of commensal-specific IgA accompanied by commensal dysbiosis as results of severe colitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show the importance of homeostatic distribution of intestinal DC-subpopulations for the maintenance of intestinal tolerance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our data fit with an intriguing model where CD40L-CD40 interaction between activated CD4+ T cells and DCs is important to counteract the generation of iTreg or their suppressive activity in order to boost immune responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism has previously been shown to inhibit Treg activity, which caused premature contraction of influenza-specific CD8+ T cells in the late phase of response to infection59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, CD40L-expressing activated T cells, NK cells as well as several other cell types60 would be able to temporarily shut down the tolerogenic properties of intestinal steady-state homeostasis by manipulating/removing iTreg-inducing intestinal CD103+ DCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, this mechanism might also sustain chronic type autoimmune diseases by continuous obstruction of Treg induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further work will be necessary to unravel if such a mechanism can contribute to rapid amplification of intestinal immune responses.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
