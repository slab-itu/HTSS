Fabrication of slender elastic shells by the coating of curved surfaces  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Various manufacturing techniques exist to produce double-curvature shells, including injection, rotational and blow molding, as well as dip coating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these industrial processes are typically geared for mass production and are not directly applicable to laboratory research settings, where adaptable, inexpensive and predictable prototyping tools are desirable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we study the rapid fabrication of hemispherical elastic shells by coating a curved surface with a polymer solution that yields a nearly uniform shell, upon polymerization of the resulting thin film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We experimentally characterize how the curing of the polymer affects its drainage dynamics and eventually selects the shell thickness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coating process is then rationalized through a theoretical analysis that predicts the final thickness, in quantitative agreement with experiments and numerical simulations of the lubrication flow field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This robust fabrication framework should be invaluable for future studies on the mechanics of thin elastic shells and their intrinsic geometric nonlinearities.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Hollow chocolate eggs, rabbits and bonbons have been fabricated since the 1600s by pouring molten chocolate into a mold and draining the excess.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solidification upon cooling ceases the flow and results in a solid shell of nearly constant thickness1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond chocolatiers, the polymer industry abounds with needs to fabricate thin shell structures, and a plethora of manufacturing processes have been developed for this purpose, including: injection2, rotational1 and blow molding3, as well as dip coating4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Common to all of the above techniques are limitations in the thickness of the shells (e.g., 0.5 mm for injection molding) and its uniformity (typically 20% for rotational molding5), as well as a striking lack of predictive theoretical models due to the multi-physics complexity of the processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rotational molding, for example, involves coating the inner surface of a hollow mold with a polymer melt, which is then rotated biaxially while applying a decreasing heating profile until a solid shell is formed1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As another example, injection molding, is geared for mass-production manufacturing and requires costly precision-machined molds that are inflexible to variations in the geometry of the part2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these processes, the optimization of the control parameters is largely tuned empirically, with compromises on versatility, predictability and reproducibility5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, these techniques are not directly applicable to laboratory settings, where adaptable, inexpensive and predictable rapid-prototyping tools are more desirable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is particularly the case for the fabrication of thin, smooth and flexible three dimensional structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For flat and cylindrical surfaces, a variety of thin film coating techniques are well established6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A significant advantage for these geometries is that, when compared to their double-curved counterparts, they are more amenable to theoretical modeling to predict how the final film thickness depends on the control parameters7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these cases, the flow driven by viscous stresses and held by capillary forces is frozen as the media cools, cures or dries, yielding a defect-free and uniform finish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, these robust coating techniques have matured to be ubiquitous in industry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To generate (ultra-) thin sheets, spin-coating is now widespread (e.g., in microfluidics) to attain constant and tunable film thicknesses9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, spin-casting exploits centrifugal forces on a rotating cylindrical surface to evenly distribute a polymer solution and fabricate nearly constant thickness shells in a highly controllable manner11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This technique was instrumental in identifying the role of imperfections on the critical buckling conditions of cylindrical shells in the 1960s (refs 12, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For double-curved surfaces, there is a need for simple and versatile fabrication methods that are analogous to the coating of fibers, plates and cylinders and able to yield uniform, controllable and predictable results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we introduce a simple and robust mechanism to fabricate hemispherical thin elastic shells by the coating, drainage and subsequent curing of polymer solutions on curved molds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our process is analogous to spin-coating (itself not applicable on curved surfaces), albeit with a gravity-driven flow in lieu of centrifugal forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through a systematic series of experiments using elastomers, we show that drainage can lead to coatings that are frozen in time as the polymer cures, thereby leading to a nearly uniform thin elastic shell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A theoretical analysis of the underlying lubrication flow during drainage, which includes the evolution of the rheological properties of the polymer as it cures, is able to accurately predict the final thickness of the shell as a function of the material properties of the polymer and the geometry of the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the final shell thickness is found to be independent of the initial conditions such as the height of pouring and the volume of poured fluid, as well as the initial thickness profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we find that the shell thickness can be tuned over one order of magnitude by changing the waiting time between the preparation of the polymer solution and the moment of pouring onto the mold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis demonstrates that the robustness and flexibility of this mechanism are inherent consequences of the loss of memory in the flow field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach provides a fast, robust and predictable mechanism to fabricate thin shells with flexibility in their material and geometric properties by tuning the control parameters.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our above results establish the basis for the rapid and robust coating process to fabricate spherical elastic shells of nearly uniform thickness, and with radii spanning over two orders of magnitudes (1Rmm375).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the radius of the sphere is decreased below R less_than 10 mm, the agreement between our model and the experiments deteriorates due to the influence of the meniscus that connects the flow on the hemisphere to the puddle that forms as the fluid drains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect is not accounted for in our model, but we expect it to be negligible when , where  is the capillary length with surface tension, , that prescribes the relative magnitude of capillary and gravitational forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since  mm and  mm for VPS and PDMS, respectively, the deviations of the theory from the data for small R are consistent with the onset of these surface tension effects (see Figs 1c and 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our model, e.g., equation (6), uses the physical parameters for the rheology of the polymer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PDMS was found to behave as a Newtonian fluid for small shear rates (but the viscosity varies with time; see Fig 5b) whereas VPS exhibited shear thinning (see Supplementary Figs 3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An estimate of the relevant shear rate is therefore needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the value  s1, assuming a uniform shear rate across

to the equator of the hemispherical shells was found to be, at most, 6.6% (VPS) and 8.7% (PDMS) from the experiments, 8.7% in the theoretical model, and 8.4% in the numerical analysis (using s.d.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For PDMS, the thickness profile follows equation (6) without any adjustable parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This agreement validates our model for the case of time varying viscosities (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For VPS, shear thinning effects lead to an increase of the thickness at the apex (see Fig 3a); where the viscosity is largest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These effects are not captured by our model, yet they do not prevent the shell from being uniform within 6.6% variations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We argue that these same effects are the source of the difference between the numerics and the measured free surface velocity for large times (see Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'When the polymer is poured on the underside of a mold, curvature can suppress the Rayleigh-Taylor instability and thereby prevent the formation of dripping droplets15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the uniformity bounds of the shell that were just stated are ensured, as long as the modified Bond number B=gRhi/ (which characterizes the relative importance of gravity and surface tension, ) remains smaller than the critical value, Bc less_than 8 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, when the outside of a mold is used, fingering instabilities can occur at the advancing front of the flow, but this can be precluded by pouring a sufficiently large volume of liquid over the surface14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A critical volume can be derived14 and we estimated it be of the order of 1 ml for an hemisphere of radius R=20 mm, in agreement with what was observed experimentally for the sensitivity analysis in Fig 4b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions, pouring on the underside or the outside of complementary molds yields identical shells of the same uniform thickness, hf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that during this process an 90% of the volume drains out of the hemisphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even if this technique is an excellent rapid-prototyping method, it may not be suitable for large scale industrial applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar limitations are found for spin-coating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The physical principles that underlay the dynamics of the coating process are rationalized by our analytical model above, to which the separation between the initial drainage and curing timescales is key.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Drainage occurs significantly faster than the polymer curing, such that the memory of the flow vanishes before it is arrested by cross-linking to yield the final elastic shell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, geometry prevails, and the curvature of the mold together with the rheology of the polymer set both the dynamics of the flow and the final thickness of the shell (hfR1/2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The robustness of this mechanism and its insensitivity to the initial conditions are now corroborated by both experiments and simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured the thickness of shells obtained for different values of the height from which the polymer is poured onto the mold (4Hcm10), as well as the volume poured (0.9Vml6.3), and find that hf is constant to within 5.6% across these various conditions (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, simulations that were initiated with four significantly different initial fluid distributionsuniform, sinusoidal, as well as tapered profiles towards the pole and the equatorall converge to the same final shell thickness, which agrees well with the prediction from equation (6), as shown in Fig 4c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Since the final shell thickness is directly connected to the curing time, hf can be continuously tuned by waiting a time  between the preparation of the polymer mixture and the instant when it is poured onto the mold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 5a, hf is plotted versus , for the representative experiments with both VPS-32 and PDMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that hf can be increased by as much as 60% for VPS-32 and elevenfold for PDMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Substituting  for k in equation (6) allows for a direct comparison to the experimental result, with favorable agreement in the case of VPS-32 (solid curve in Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the PDMS, however, an additional adjustment to our framework is required since we found that its rheology differs if the curing occurred in a quiescent state (e.g., when waiting in bulk for  before pouring) versus when sheared (e.g., during coating).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rheometry measurements were performed where the values of  were systematically varied (inset of Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the time axis for each of these tests is shifted by  (the constant factor =2.02±0.02 was determined by fitting), all of the data collapses onto the master curve obtained for =0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have therefore concluded empirically that PDMS cures  times faster when quiescent compared to under shear, but we have not been able to find this specific result in the literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that the shifting factor required for collapse will likely depend on the shear rate and the specifics of the polymer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this additional information at hand, substituting  for k in equation (6) accounts for the effective waiting time, and yields a prediction for hf (dashed line in Fig 5a) that is in agreement with the experimental data for PDMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model is therefore able to accurately capture the elevenfold continuous variation of the shell thickness obtained when pouring partially cured polymer solutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As explained in the Supplementary Note 2, we did not have to consider  for VPS-32 because the entire bulk of this more viscous polymer solution is experiencing sustained shear while it was sequentially poured onto a series of identical molds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that our theoretical description is only applicable if .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we show that coating hemispherical molds with a polymer solution yields thin uniform shells whose thickness can be accurately predicted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the final shell thickness can be tuned by modifying the time between polymer preparation and the moment of pouring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting shells are a realization of the drainage dynamics, driven by gravity, slowed down by viscous stresses and eventually arrested by the curing of the polymer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The robustness and flexibility of this mechanism are inherent consequences of the loss of memory in the flow field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The generality of this framework should open the door for future studies to fabricate slender solid structures in a variety of other geometries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A particularly interesting case outside the scope of the current study is the coating of ellipsoidal molds19, with two distinct principal curvatures, where the difference between the pouring direction and the orientation of the surface could also play a role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our fabrication technique could be important in the ongoing revival of the mechanics of thin elastic shells, in particularly since it enables fully elastic structures that can reversibly explore strong
