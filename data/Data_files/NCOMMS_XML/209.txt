Selective silicate-directed motility in diatoms  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Diatoms are highly abundant unicellular algae that often dominate pelagic as well as benthic primary production in the oceans and inland waters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Being strictly dependent on silica to build their biomineralized cell walls, marine diatoms precipitate 240 × 1012 mol Si per year, which makes them the major sink in the global Si cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dissolved silicic acid (dSi) availability frequently limits diatom productivity and influences species composition of communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that benthic diatoms selectively perceive and behaviourally react to gradients of dSi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell speed increases under dSi-limited conditions in a chemokinetic response and, if gradients of this resource are present, increased directionality of cell movement promotes chemotaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability to exploit local and short-lived dSi hotspots using a specific search behaviour likely contributes to micro-scale patch dynamics in biofilm communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On a global scale this behaviour might affect sedimentwater dSi fluxes and biogeochemical cycling.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Diatoms contribute about 20% to the global primary production and are key players in marine and freshwater benthic and planktonic communities1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A hallmark of diatom physiology is their biomineralized cell wall that is formed by template-catalysed precipitation of silicic acid2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given their vast abundance, diatoms are thereby driving the silicate cycle3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dissolved silicic acid (dSi) availability is often the limiting factor controlling diatom growth and thus also shaping species composition in marine communities5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the pelagic zone is often dSi-limited below 1 M, the benthic zone typically shows strong and steep gradients of this resource with higher dSi concentrations (around 150 M) in the sediment due to the continuous dissolution of deposited minerals6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of their high productivity and biomineralization activity, benthic diatom biofilms can influence sediment properties7 and alter dSi fluxes within the sedimentwater interface, thus regulating dSi concentrations in the oceans8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such processes have implications for the transfer of energy to higher trophic levels, bentho-pelagic coupling and hence population and ecosystem productivity4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most benthic diatoms belong to the pennates, comprising the youngest (90 Myr old) yet most species-rich clade within the diatoms9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many species evolved a strong capacity for vertical migration in sediments under the control of photoperiod and/or tidal cycles11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these processes alone are not fully explaining observed spatiotemporal dynamics of microbial biofilms, and since many years other factors including the direct and indirect influence of herbivory and microbemicrobe interactions are assumed to guide diatom movement11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we identify an additional guiding factor by showing that diatoms detect and actively move towards dSi sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We used the pennate diatom Seminavis robusta to explore cell movement and aggregation in response to dSi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like many other pennate diatoms, this biofilm-forming species moves by gliding through the excretion of extracellular polymeric substances from its raphe, an elongate slit in the cell wall14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allows pennate diatoms to move back and forth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Observed turning movements were suggested to result from the action of extracellular polymeric substance-derived pseudopods or stalks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a pseudopod or stalk is adhering to the substratum resulting torque supports the whole-cell rotation15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this contribution, we describe three sets of experiments where we first look at the general influence of dSi concentration on diatom motility, then we observe and analyse diatom behaviour in a dSi gradient and last, we test the specificity of the response by comparing the reaction towards dSi and dGe gradients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments clearly demonstrate that diatoms have means to selectively perceive and orient towards the essential resource dSi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A search behaviour in form of increased cell motility and cell speed is observed when the nutrient dSi is depleted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unicellular algae are also capable of directional movement towards the sources of dSi gradients, a behaviour that supports foraging in the patchy natural environment of benthic diatoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that structurally closely related dissolved germanium dioxide (Ge(OH)4, dGe) sources are not eliciting attraction suggests a specific receptor-mediated response.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'dSi-dependent diatom motility and speed', 'To determine if dSi availability affects cell behaviour, we counted motile cells in conjunction with dSi depletion in batch cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion of motile cells steeply increased along with decreasing dSi availability as cells entered the stationary growth phase (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of dSi (106 M) to stationary-phase cultures elicited within 1 h a marked drop in the proportion of motile cells, indicating a reversible reaction controlled by dSi (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to motility, cell speed is also dependent on dSi concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When stationary-phase S. robusta cultures were transferred to artificial sea water without added dSi (low-dSi medium) and were further starved for 3 days, cell movement was more than twice as fast than that of cells transferred to dSi-rich control medium (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, cell speed decreased after 1 h of dSi addition while blank addition did not affect the speed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed increased proportion of motile cells and higher speed under limiting conditions is a chemokinetic response, that is, a motile response to chemicals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since dSi is not required for movement, speeding up is an effective mechanism for fast location of this limiting resource during starvation16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Seminavis robusta cell motility is modulated by environmental silicic acid concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) During silicon (Si)-limited batch culture growth, cell motility increases while dSi (100% dSi=106 M) is being depleted and the culture enters stationary phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars show the s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of five replicates (n=300).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) There is a higher percentage of motile cells in low-Si medium than Si-rich medium (one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), n=5, P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After addition of dSi (106 M) to 48-h silicon-starved cultures, cell motility drops within 1 h (one-way ANOVA, n=3, P less_than 0.0001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is not the case after a blank addition of sea water to such silicon-starved cultures (P=1.00).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars show s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of three replicates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) The mean cell speed is significantly higher (LME with Tukeys honest significance difference (HSD) test, n=70200 cells per movie, three movies analysed, P less_than 0.0001) in cultures grown in low-dSi medium compared with dSi-rich medium (dSi=246 M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One hour after the addition of dSi to starved cultures, cell speed significantly dropped (LME with Tukeys HSD, n=70200 cells per movie, three movies analysed, P less_than 0.0001) while blank addition did not induce any change on cell behaviour (LME with Tukeys HSD, n=70200 cells per movie, three movies analysed, P=0.665,).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars show s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of all tracked cells from three 60-s movies.Full size image', 'Directed movement towards dSi sources', 'Since steep vertical and horizontal dSi gradients prevail in benthic environments, an additional strategy to exploit this resource would be a directed movement within dSi gradients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Requirements for such a behaviour are the cells ability to perceive the resource in a quantitative manner, as described above, and a directed movement towards it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Track analysis revealed that S. robusta moves in a back and forth manner that enables cells to reverse direction after each stop (Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This behaviour found in many raphid diatoms and in certain bacteria allows for orientation towards higher concentrations in chemical gradients18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S. robusta thus fulfils both above-mentioned requirements for a directed movement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore verified if it indeed has the capability of chemotaxis that would lead to the accumulation of Si-starved cells at local dSi hotspots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gradients of dSi were generated from micrometer-sized point sources in form of aluminium oxide (alox) beads that were loaded with dSi in different concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To analyse movement along the dSi concentration gradient, the microscopic observation area was divided into three bins (AC) of equidistant concentric rings around each observed bead covering a radius of 336 m (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since a directed orientation would likely be most relevant under low dSi concentrations found at the watersediment interface, we aimed to adjust the local concentration gradient in this range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If 1.4 nmol dSi per microscopic bead were applied, ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5% diffused out within the 600 s assay period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a matter of 460 s a concentration gradient is established with 100 M dSi at the surface of the bead decreasing to 5 M dSi at the edges of the microscopic observation field (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This concentration gradient mimics conditions at the transition of the pelagic and benthic zones6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Si-starved S. robusta responded to such dSi gradients with an accumulation of cells around the beads while control beads were not attractive (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This behavioural response is observed in different S. robusta isolates (Supplementary Movies 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the observation period is extended to 1 h, continuous movement of cells towards the bead is observed until 25 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After that, chemoattraction becomes less obvious, presumably due to diffusion of dSi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control beads are not active through the entire assay period (Supplementary Movies 2 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Response to dSi is not limited to S. robusta, since Navicula sp., another benthic diatom, also accumulated around dSi sources (Supplementary Movie 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The administered dSi concentration is in the optimum range to elicit a response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Attraction became less pronounced if lower concentrations of dSi were administered, higher concentrations still resulted in a substantial accumulation around the beads but data became noisier, indicating a more erratic search (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a concentration-dependent response is typical for receptor-mediated interactions, since higher concentrations of dSi on the beads might cause receptor saturation, whereas lower concentrations fall below the detection limit20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finding capability is thus most efficient in an environmentally relevant concentration range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Chemoattraction of dSi-starved cells to dSi-loaded alox

(LME, P=0.0079) in the dSi treatment reflects the movement of the cells towards the dSi bead.Full size image', 'The fact that starved cells accumulate in the immediate vicinity of the bead suggests that they sense local dSi concentrations and direct their movement up the gradient and ultimately to the source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, the mean swimming speed of cells exposed to a dSi gradient was higher in the close proximity of the beads (Fig 3a and Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This only holds true under the influence of the steep dSi gradient in the immediate proximity of the beads and is already not manifested any more in the more distant bin C (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While cells generally move faster when starved of dSi (Fig 1c), it is apparent that an additional response to a steep gradient of dSi is observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The defined dSi source in an otherwise limited environment causes locally increased speed, which could be the cells mechanism to avoid diffusion limitation during Si uptake around a dSi hotspot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Analysis of track data from dSi and control movies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Cell speed

on tracking individual cell behaviour in response to dSi-loaded and control beads (details in Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S. robusta cells have higher directional persistence when perceiving an ascending dSi gradient, as exemplified by longer correlation length and timescales ( and ) (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells within the dSi gradient also had on average a 57% higher diffusivity (D) and 81% higher encounter kernel () for the dSi beads, showing that they maximize their encounter rate to find dSi beads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the angular orientation by monitoring the angle of the vectorized tracks relative to the bead centre did not reveal any differences between control and Si-loaded beads, thereby excluding a directed orientation during reversing events (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, cells persistently migrate towards the dSi source as indicated by the change in the sum of distances between bead and all cells over time in the treatment compared with the control (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed behaviour can be explained by a preferential forward movement in an ascending gradient of dSi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This directionality during the chemokinetic response thus promotes chemotaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The persistent orientation implies a biased random walk, wherein cells adapt their movement patterns to find a dSi source.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our results clearly indicate the specific modulation of foraging behaviour of benthic diatoms in response to silicate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed analysis of movement indicates a chemokinetic response since cell speed changes in dependence of dSi concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition the observed attraction of cells within a gradient of dSi indicates a chemotactic search capability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly this search behaviour is not regulated by directed turns of the cells towards the dSi source but rather by a longer directional persistence within an ascending dSi gradient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding mechanism thus differs from the chemoattraction mechanism in brown algae where the pheromone-directed movement is mediated by signal molecule-induced turning events of gametes25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such orientation towards dSi or any other dissolved mineral has to our knowledge not been observed before in diatoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specificity of the attraction is demonstrated by a selective movement towards dSi while the structurally closely related dGe does not stimulate an attraction response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations might be explained by a receptor-mediated process20, but until now no candidate receptor mediating a specific recognition of dissolved minerals is known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since different isolates of S. robusta as well as another tested diatom species Navicula sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  exhibit this search behaviour, the response might be general for benthic diatoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed dSi-directed movement might thus help to explain the often patchy species composition and structure of marine biofilms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Tactic behaviour towards nutrient sources such as phosphate and different sources of nitrogen has been demonstrated for other algae and bacteria26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These responses can provide important adaptive advantage for the organisms due to increased acquisition capability for the resources16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of motile diatoms to trace dSi gradients and exploit micro-scale hotspots by changing their foraging behaviour enables them to thrive and dominate phototrophic biofilm communities such as the intertidal microphytobenthos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More general, this capability might be a key factor explaining their explosive radiation in marine and freshwater benthos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Microbial activity is known to greatly affect global biogeochemical processes involved in the cycling of elements28,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several mechanisms have been suggested on how microbial behavioural responses to patchy resources can influence ocean biogeochemistry31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of diatoms to track dSi availability in the environment has thus implications on a global scale by affecting dSi fluxes and on a micro-scale by shaping biofilm communities.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
