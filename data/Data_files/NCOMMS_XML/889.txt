Hidden amorphous phase and reentrant supercooled liquid in Pd-Ni-P metallic glasses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'An anomaly in differential scanning calorimetry has been reported in a number of metallic glass materials in which a broad exothermal peak was observed between the glass and crystallization temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mystery surrounding this calorimetric anomaly is epitomized by four decades long studies of Pd-Ni-P metallic glasses, arguably the best glass-forming alloys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show, using a suite of in situ experimental techniques, that Pd-Ni-P alloys have a hidden amorphous phase in the supercooled liquid region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The anomalous exothermal peak is the consequence of a polyamorphous phase transition between two supercooled liquids, involving a change in the packing of atomic clusters over medium-range length scales as large as 18 Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With further temperature increase, the alloy reenters the supercooled liquid phase, which forms the room-temperature glass phase on quenching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The outcome of this study raises a possibility to manipulate the structure and hence the stability of metallic glasses through heat treatment.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Pd-Ni-P is an excellent glass-forming system, for which centimetre-sized metallic glasses can be made at a cooling rate as slow as 0.17 K s1 (refs 1, 2, 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 1976, Chen4 observed a broad exothermic peak, which is far below the crystallization temperatures in the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves of (Pd0.5Ni0.5)100xPx (x=1719) amorphous alloys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  He proposed that this anomalous exothermal peak, hereafter abbreviated as AEP, corresponds to crystallization catalysed by amorphous phase separation4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in situ small-angle X-ray scattering experiments by Yavari et al.5 could not confirm the development of compositional heterogeneities in the temperature range of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent study using atom probe tomography6 and element-specific transmission electron microscopy (TEM)7 also failed to provide evidence of compositional or microstructure modulations before the onset of crystallization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these findings appear to rule out the possibility of nanoscale phase separation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, changes in short-range ordering were suggested as a possible cause for the observed AEP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, there were hints in early TEM work8, which suggested that phase separation was taking place, but at the atomic scale instead of the nanoscale as thought previously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A similar DSC anomaly has also been reported in a number of other metallic glass alloys, including Zr-Be-X (X=Ti, Nb)9,10,11,12, Zr-Ti-Cu-Ni-Be13,14, Gd-Zr-Al-Ni15, Ni-Zr-Nb-Al-Ta16, Cu-Zr-Al-Y17, Mg-Cu-Ag-Gd18,19, Fe-M-Y-B (M=Mo, W, Nb)20,21,22, (Fe0.9Co0.1)67.5Nb4Gd3.5B25 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23, Fe0.75xDyxB0.2Si0.05)96Nb4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24) and (Fe0.76xDyxB0.24)96Nb4 (x=00.07)25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of these alloys have good glass-forming abilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microscopic studies were carried out to investigate a scenario of amorphous phase separation before crystallization, but the results are mostly inconclusive10,23,26, due to, for example, possible artefacts arising from sample preparation27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In situ studies are therefore essential to determine the structural origin of the DSC anomaly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we employ in situ high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction, and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) with simultaneous DSC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both are bulk techniques; consequently, sample preparation is not an issue and the data interpretation is straightforward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scattering results were further checked and reconciled with TEM analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data for Pd-Ni-P glass alloys showed a change that is in perfect correlation with the DSC data, revealing a hidden amorphous phase, the associated polyamorphous or liquid-to-liquid phase transition (LLPT) and a reentrant behaviour28 in the supercooled liquid region at higher temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although polyamorphous phase transitions have been extensively studied, the experimental evidence has been rare and sometimes controversial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidence for LLPT has been reported in triphenyl phosphite29, confined water30 and in metallic glasses close to the melting temperature31,32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polyamorous transition has been previously observed in metallic glasses as well, but under pressure34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the origin of polyamorphous phase transition is far from clear, and has been a subject of intense debate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our studies of Pd-Ni-P alloys show that at the transition temperature, the underlying atomic structure undergoes significant changes over the medium-range length scale, while the short-range order is little changed.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The energy landscape, a potential energy surface as a function of particle coordinates, offers a convenient way to consider and visualize the structural evolution in the supercooled liquid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examination of Fig 6 suggests a potential energy landscape depicted in Fig 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are three deep minima or megabasins in the potential energy landscape: two supercooled liquid phases (SCL1 and SCL2), and a crystalline phase (X).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystalline phase has the deepest energy minima, but it is difficult to reach during supercooling due to the slow kinetics in metallic glasses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SCL2 has the lower potential energy of the two supercooled liquid phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, quenched samples are always in a frozen, or glass, state of SCL1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only on heating from room temperature is the system able to sample the potential energy landscape and settle into the lower energy phase of SCL2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: Proposed potential energy landscape in Pd41.25Ni41.25P17.5supercooled liquid.There are three energy minima, marked by SCL1, SCL2 and X, which is a crystalline phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shallow, local minima reflect the myriads of atomic configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared to SCL2, SCL1 is in a more disordered state, with many more configurations.Full size image', 'Experimental evidence has shown that when TTC, the sample reenters into the SCL1 phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that at high temperatures, SCL1, although of higher potential energy, is the thermodynamically stable state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand this paradox, it is important to consider the entropy term in the Gibbs free energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The Gibbs energy is given by , where H is the enthalpy or the potential energy and S the entropy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consider the Gibbs energy at a temperature T1 just below the phase transition (say T=570 K) and at TC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since SCL1 is the stable phase at T1, .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, , because there is heat release on transforming to SCL2 as evidenced from the Cp data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It follows that , because T1 is lower.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis shows that SCL1 is more disordered, and that SCL1 is stabilized by the entropy term.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 7, on the potential energy landscape, the more disordered state SCL1 is illustrated with many more local configurations than SCL2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This scenario is analogous to the ordering of a ferromagnet, where the paramagnetic phase at high temperature is stabilized by the entropy of disordered spins36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The presence of megabasins had been previously discussed by Debenedetti and Stillinger37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparing molten SiO2, a prototypical strong glass former, and o-terphenyl, a fragile glass former, they argued that the potential energy landscape of strong glass formers may consist of a single megabasin, whereas the fragile ones display a proliferation of well-separated megabasins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pd-Ni-P samples are known to be form a fragile glass38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, the potential energy landscape depicted in Fig 7 is consistent with the general analysis by Debenedetti and Stillinger37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Structure wise, the phase transitions at TC is accomplished through rearrangement of locally favoured structures, or atomic clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 5 shows that the cluster rearrangement occurs most prominently at medium-range length scales, at the fifth shell (r=11 Å) or longer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zheng et al.39 observed three exothermal responses (peaks) in glassy ribbons of Cu46Zr42Al7Y5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on DSC analysis, they attributed the second peak to the formation of ordered clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work is consistent with an earlier study by Kumar et al.10, who speculated that the anomalous DSC in Zr36Ti24Be40 could be due to development of short-range order towards the final crystallization product.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high-quality synchrotron data obtained in the present experiment allowed us to visualize the dramatic changes in medium-range order, at the fifth shell (R5) centred around r1112 Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As stated earlier, the AEP is not unique to Pd-based BMGs;
