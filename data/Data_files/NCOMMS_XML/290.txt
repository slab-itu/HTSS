Sequence features accurately predict genome-wide MeCP2 binding in vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is critical for proper brain development and expressed at near-histone levels in neurons, but the mechanism of its genomic localization remains poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using high-resolution MeCP2-binding data, we show that DNA sequence features alone can predict binding with 88% accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Integrating MeCP2 binding and DNA methylation in a probabilistic graphical model, we demonstrate that previously reported genome-wide association with methylation is in part due to MeCP2s affinity to GC-rich chromatin, a result replicated using published data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, MeCP2 co-localizes with nucleosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, MeCP2 binding downstream of promoters correlates with increased expression in Mecp2-deficient neurons.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mutations in the gene encoding methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) are responsible for several neurological disorders, including the majority of Rett syndrome cases1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite extensive efforts since the initial identification of MeCP2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3), the molecular mechanisms of its function remain poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In neurons, MeCP2 is approximately as abundant as histone octamers in the nucleus and is believed to be broadly distributed throughout chromatin4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This high abundance has posed a major technical challenge in mapping the genome-wide binding sites of MeCP2 and characterizing the precise DNA sequence features that help recruit MeCP2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there is strong evidence in vitro supporting the ability of MeCP2 to bind methyl-CpG (mCpG), MeCP2 may actually bind diverse sequences in vivo, as reflected in its multifaceted roles5,6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The functional impact of MeCP2 has been previously examined by attempting to identify MeCP2 target genes in neurons8,10,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to a number of genes found to be suppressed by MeCP2, multiple studies have also identified a global reduction of transcription in neurons lacking functional Mecp2 (refs 10, 12, 14, 15), suggesting a novel activating role of MeCP2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resolving whether the resulting repression and activation of genes in Mecp2-null neurons are direct or indirect consequences of MeCP2 binding remains a challenge, largely because the resolution of existing chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data is not sufficient to decipher the precise binding pattern of MeCP2 in vivo and identify the specific DNA recognition sequences4,7,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using new high-resolution MeCP2 ChIP-seq data from olfactory epithelium, our study presents a predictive model of genome-wide MeCP2-binding pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, integrative analysis of sequence features and DNA methylation states revealed that the previously reported methylation preferences may arise in part from MeCP2s strong association with GC-rich chromatin, and this surprising result is replicated in independent published data sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we describe the impact of Mecp2 deficiency on transcriptional regulation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'High-resolution map of MeCP2 genome-wide localization', 'We overcame the difficulty of mapping genome-wide binding sites of MeCP2 by performing ChIP-seq in olfactory epithelial tissue which contains only one neuronal type, the olfactory sensory neurons18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We started with small pilot studies and progressively increased the sequencing depth to reach saturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Possible chromatin-shearing biases were controlled by using an Input library built from the same pool of chromatin used for ChIP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final two biological replicates yielded 220 million raw reads from one of the samples sequenced in one lane and 455 million raw reads from the second sample sequenced in two lanes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eighty-three per cent of the raw reads aligned to the mm9 mouse genome, and 77% of these alignments were unique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR duplicates accounted for 53 and 82% of the reads, indicating that saturation was achieved in the final sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The replicates were then combined in the downstream analysis (Supplementary Fig 1ac), obtaining a high depth of sequencing hitherto unavailable for MeCP2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A rigorous normalization using signal extraction scaling19,20 confirmed the high level of chromatin immunoprecipitation and showed that 29% of the genome was enriched for MeCP2 (Supplementary Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, reanalysis showed that three other MeCP2 ChIP-seq data sets published to date had low ChIP enrichment, as measured by signal extraction scaling and by the high correlation of ChIP and Input channels (Supplementary Fig 1ei).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regions with strong enrichment in our data (that is, statistically significant at 5% false discovery rate) were identified using model-based analysis of ChIP-seq (MACS2)21, yielding 1.0 million peaks covering 11% of the genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous studies4, we found that MeCP2 bound the genome at high frequency (average peak spacing of 2.4 kb).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high sequencing depth allowed us to map MeCP2 binding with unprecedented resolution as illustrated for the Bdnf locus in Fig 1a (Myc locus in Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This map revealed the binding profile to be highly non-uniform on short scales; MeCP2 has sharp peaks with median width 183 bp, and the half width at half maximum of autocorrelation was 113 bp (Supplementary Fig 1j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ChIP-qPCR (quantitative PCR) around the Bdnf gene confirmed that four local peaks and seven local troughs in the ChIP-seq profile indeed had high and low MeCP2 binding, respectively (regions 13 and 1216 in Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that three loci (regions 8, 9 and 11) out of five covering an extended region with low ChIP-seq signal had low ChIP-qPCR signal, while remaining two loci (regions 7 and 10) showed moderate ChIP-qPCR enrichment, which might correspond to transient binding missed in ChIP-seq (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our new data thus show that MeCP2-binding sites are highly localized at fine resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: MeCP2 binding is accurately predicted by GC%.

non-methylated DNA7,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative importance of these domains in vivo is unclear: some studies reported that MeCP2-binding tracks the density of mCpG4, but another study found that the majority of promoters with the highest methylation levels are not bound by MeCP2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate whether DNA methylation regulates MeCP2 binding in olfactory epithelial tissue, we mapped methylated cytosines using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing in two biological replicates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CpG methylation levels, defined at each CpG site to be the fraction of cells having methylation at the site, agreed well between the samples (r=0.89 in 10 kb windows, Supplementary Fig 1k), and the replicates were combined for downstream analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The methylation level also had strong overlap with previous studies in frontal cortex24 and embryonic stem cells (ESC)25 (r=0.79 and r=0.76, respectively, Supplementary Fig 1l,m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genome-wide CpG methylation level was 70%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then calculated the density of methylated CpG dinucleotides (mCpG%) defined as the product of the density of CpG (that is, the percentage of CpG dinucleotides in a 150 bp window, henceforth denoted CpG%) and the local CpG methylation level (that is, CpG methylation level averaged over the same window).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Earlier studies found a genome-wide correlation between MeCP2 binding and mCpG%, albeit the resolution was limited4,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed that the MeCP2 ChIP-seq coverage was correlated with mCpG% genome wide (r=0.39; Supplementary Fig 3a), while the Input coverage showed no correlation (r=0.05; Supplementary Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, the mean mCpG% in MeCP2 peaks was 1.7-fold higher compared with adjacent regions (1.26% versus 0.73%), and this increase closely tracked the outline of the peaks (Supplementary Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, inspection of individual MeCP2 peaks revealed that many binding sites had low mCpG% (Fig 1a; Supplementary Fig 2); genome wide, 37% of peaks had lower mCpG% than the surrounding regions (Supplementary Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, while MeCP2 peaks are generally enriched for high mCpG%, the fact that many individual peaks have depleted methylation indicates that other factors are likely to contribute to the binding profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'DNA sequence features can predict MeCP2-binding sites', 'The abundance of MeCP2-binding sites with depleted methylation prompted us to investigate whether the binding pattern of MeCP2 can be predicted from sequence alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because most CpGs are methylated in neuronal cells, an enrichment of CpG has been observed in MeCP2-bound regions4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these results, our data showed coincidence of MeCP2 binding and high CpG% (for example, Bdnf locus in Fig 1a, Myc locus in Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation generalized genome wide with a Pearson correlation between MeCP2 ChIP fragment coverage and CpG% of r=0.40 (Supplementary Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the ChIP signal, Input showed no correlation with CpG% (r=0.03, Supplementary Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of MeCP2 peaks (68%) had higher CpG% than surrounding regions (Supplementary Fig 3g), and the mean CpG% was significantly higher in the peaks (1.6-fold higher, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P less_than 2.2 × 10308; Supplementary Fig 3h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To rigorously characterize MeCP2 recognition motifs in an unbiased way, we trained a Random Forest regressor to predict MeCP2 ChIP-seq peaks purely based on the sequence in 200 bp running windows (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, mononucleotide frequencies alone had very high predictive power (area under receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), of 94%; Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inclusion of di- and trinucleotides did not increase the predictive power appreciably (AUC of 95% for trinucleotides), but a model using only CpG% had much lower predictive power (AUC of 78%; Supplementary Fig 3l).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equating false positive and negative rates on the ROC curve yielded a classifier with 88% accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In sharp contrast to the previously reported CpG preference4, ranking the mono- and dinucleotides by their predictive importance showed that GC% was by far the most important feature, while CpG% was only ranked the 4th out of 11 (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis thus suggests that GC%, and not CpG%, is an accurate predictor of MeCP2 binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the genome-wide Pearson correlation of the MeCP2 fragment coverage with GC% was higher than that with CpG% (r=0.68 versus r=0.40, Supplementary Fig 3e,f,i,j), and 98% of peaks had significantly higher GC% than surrounding regions (Wilcoxon rank-sum test P less_than 2.2 × 10308; Supplementary Fig 3k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To reconcile the high enrichment of CpG in MeCP2 peaks with the low importance of CpG% as a binding predictor, we controlled for the genome-wide correlation between CpG% and GC% by first classifying 150 bp genomic windows by GC% and CpG% and then calculating how the mean MeCP2 coverage depended on these two variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This representation clearly revealed that the coverage depended strongly on GC% but not on CpG% (Fig 1d; Supplementary Fig 4a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the correlation between CpG% and MeCP2 signal was removed once controlled for GC dependence (partial correlation rMeCP2,CpG·GC=0.12 compared with rMeCP2,CpG=0.40), but the reverse control (that is, controlling for CpG dependence in the correlation between GC% and MeCP2) barely reduced the correlation (rMeCP2,GC·CpG=0.61 compared with rMeCP2,GC=0.68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Partial correlation analysis thus effectively removes secondary correlations arising from confounding factors, and our ensuing analyses extensively utilize and generalize this approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The secondary association between MeCP2 and CpG% was further supported through reanalysis of previous MeCP2 ChIP-seq data from mature murine neurons4 (rMeCP2,GC·CpG=0.34 and rMeCP2,CpG·GC=0.02; Supplementary Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reanalysis of the data from ES cells and ES-derived neuronal progenitor cells revealed a somewhat stronger CpG dependence (neuronal progenitor, rMeCP2,GC·CpG=0.30, rMeCP2,CpG·GC=0.14; Supplementary Fig 4d,e)17, but ES cells lacking the methyltransferases Dnmt1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b had very weak CpG dependence but still an appreciable GC dependence (rMeCP2,GC·CpG=0.20, rMeCP2,CpG·GC=0.02; Supplementary Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The weaker CpG dependence in the more differentiated cells is potentially explained by the large increase in MeCP2 expression throughout neural differentiation26 and a shift from methylation-dependent to methylation-independent binding in the high free-protein concentration limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reanalysis of published data from murine forebrain and hypothalamus revealed enrichment profiles constant in both GC% and CpG% (Supplementary Fig 4g,h)9,27, a different pattern potentially explained by the much lower ChIP versus Input enrichment seen in these data sets (Supplementary Fig 1e) or, for hypothalamus, low coverage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify that the above genome-wide binding trends were visible also at individual loci, we plotted the ChIP signal in short regions with contrasting GC% and CpG%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, regions with no CpG but GC%60% had strong MeCP2 enrichment, supporting that CpG is not necessary for MeCP2 binding (Fig 2ac); conversely, regions with CpG%3% but GC%35% showed decreased MeCP2 enrichment (Fig 2eg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This binding pattern was further corroborated by three independent lower-coverage ChIP-seq replicates from the pilot stage of our study (Supplementary Fig 4in).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, although some previously published data sets also had a moderate enrichment and depletion in high and low GC% regions, respectively, the trends were less pronounced compared with olfactory epithelial tissue (Fig 2d,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To control for the possibility that the signal was caused by potential GC bias in the sequencing adapter ligation or library amplification, we also performed ChIP-qPCR in nine regions with high GC% and no CpG and 13 regions with low GC% but high CpG% and again found that the binding follows GC% and not CpG% (Supplementary Fig 4o; Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modest correlation of MeCP2-binding strength with GC% could be also seen in vitro by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) (Supplementary Fig 5b,c; Supplementary Table 3; Supplementary Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these findings show that the primary sequence predictor of MeCP2 binding is GC% and that the previously reported correlation between CpG density and MeCP2 enrichment is mostly explained by the confounding correlation of GC% with CpG%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: MeCP2 binding follows GC% in regions with

3)28,29, the corresponding in vivo association assessed by MeCP2 ChIP-seq was only moderate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further investigated the extent to which the GC% dependence confounded the association between MeCP2 and mCpG% and found that much of the association was removed after controlling for GC% (rMeCP2,mCpG=0.39, rMeCP2,mCpG·GC=0.19, 150 bp windows; Supplementary Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the MeCP2 enrichment depended strongly on GC% even after controlling for mCpG% (rMeCP2,GC·mCpG=0.62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reanalysis of published MeCP2 ChIP-seq and cell type-matched bisulfite sequencing data revealed a similar dichotomy in the brain (rMeCP2,mCpG·GC=0.13 versus rMeCP2,GC·mCpG =0.34; Supplementary Fig 6b)4,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MeCP2 binding in ES cells had a stronger dependence on mCpG% (rMeCP2,mCpG·GC=0.32, rMeCP2,GC·mCpG=0.29; Supplementary Fig 6c)17,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in the above CpG% analysis, the published data from murine forebrain and hypothalamus were uniform in mCpG% and GC% (Supplementary Fig 6d,e)9,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The predictive power of GC% was particularly clear in CpG islands (CGIs): in CGIs proximal to promoters (within 500 bp of the transcription start sites (TSS)), mCpG% was suppressed relative to surrounding regions, but both GC% and MeCP2 signal were distinctly elevated (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrasting this, distal CGIs were enriched for mCpG%, GC% and MeCP2 binding (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, while MeCP2-binding sites are enriched for both high GC% and mCpG%, the binding profile generally follows GC%, even where GC% and mCpG% diverge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: MeCP2 enrichment depends weakly on mCpG%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) GC% (green), mean MeCP2 enrichment (purple) and mCpG% (red) around proximal (that is,

Gaussian graphical model for MeCP2 binding and explanatory covariates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, a Gaussian graphical model represents the conditional dependence of random variables as an undirected graph, where the nodes are the variables of interest and an edge between two nodes captures the correlation between the connected nodes after controlling for confounding correlations with the remaining nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first built a model relating the MeCP2 ChIP, Input, GC%, CpG%, mCpG% and mCpH% at 150 bp resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the above observations, we found a chain of strong edges from MeCP2 to GC%, CpG% and finally mCpG% (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the direct edges from MeCP2 to CpG% and mCpG% were both relatively weak, implying that MeCP2 binding was mostly independent of these two sequence features once conditioned on the remaining features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, mCpH% was very weakly connected to MeCP2 and slightly more correlated with Input, suggesting that mCpH% was a subdominant predictor of MeCP2 binding in olfactory epithelia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reanalysis of data from neurons and ES cells revealed similar networks, but these data sets showed stronger correlation between MeCP2 ChIP and Input, and the link between MeCP2 and GC% was also somewhat weaker (Fig 3c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hypothalamus data set showed a stronger edge between MeCP2 ChIP and mCpH% than between MeCP2 and GC% (Fig 3e), but that data set had a very strong correlation between MeCP2 and Input, making it difficult to interpret the result.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because one data set had very low counts at 150 bp resolution (Fig 3f), we repeated the analysis at 10 kb resolution and found graphs with similar structures, the main difference being strong correlations between MeCP2 and Input in ESC, hypothalamus and forebrain (Supplementary Fig 6fj).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our integrative analysis thus shows that GC% and, to a lesser extent, mCpG% are the main predictors of MeCP2 binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'MeCP2 preferentially binds nucleosomal DNA', 'Given the role of MeCP2 as an epigenetic regulator, we next investigated the interplay between MeCP2 and chromatin structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous in vitro studies of MeCP2 found that the C-terminal portion of the protein contains a chromatin-binding domain that facilitates complex formation with nucleosomes5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Much like the H1 histone, MeCP2 binds reconstituted nucleosomes near the DNA entry and exit sites and protects proximal linker DNA from digestion5,30, an observation later corroborated with data obtained from HeLa S3 cells29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate this association in vivo, we measured the genomic locations of nucleosomes in wild-type (WT) tissue using MNase-seq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nucleosomes exhibited previously reported patterns: expressed genes (see below) had deep nucleosome-depleted regions around the TSS and distinct +1 nucleosomes (Supplementary Fig 7a)31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, the transcription termination sites were also depleted of nucleosomes (Supplementary Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with a recent study27, overlaying the MNase-seq and MeCP2 ChIP-seq data showed preferential co-localization of MeCP2 peaks with nucleosomes (for example, Myc locus in Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome-wide, MeCP2 peaks closely overlapped with sharply increased nucleosome read density (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the MeCP2 ChIP-seq and MNase-seq fragment densities were highly correlated (r=0.66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the genome-wide cross-correlation between the MeCP2 ChIP-seq and MNase-seq signals was sharply peaked at zero offset (Supplementary Fig 7c;

studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae found that the nucleosome occupancy correlates strongly with GC% (refs 33, 34), and subsequent studies further argued that GC% is the primary predictor of intrinsic nucleosome occupancy35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these results, we found that the nucleosome occupancy correlates strongly with GC% but not with CpG% (Fig 4b, rMNase,GC·CpG= 0.57  greater than

(Supplementary Fig 7e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the relative effects of nucleosome and GC%, we plotted how the mean MeCP2 enrichment jointly depends on these covariates and found that the GC% dependence was much stronger than the nucleosome dependence (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, while MeCP2 binding still conditionally depends on nucleosome occupancy when controlled for GC%, its marginal dependence on GC% seems stronger.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'MeCP2-binding pattern correlates with repressor function', 'The regulatory function of MeCP2 remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While earlier studies found that MeCP2 acts as a repressor in individual methylated promoters36,37, subsequent studies did not find a genome-wide increase in gene expression in Mecp2-deficient neurons38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the contrary, several recent studies found numerous transcriptional changes in Mecp2-deficient tissues, most of which seemed to implicate MeCP2 acting as a global activator10,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A previous study reported that genes with increased mCpG% around the TSS exhibited increased MeCP2 binding17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though we also observed increased MeCP2 binding, GC% and CpG% immediately downstream of the TSS (Supplementary Fig 8ac), we found that mCpG% and the CpG methylation level actually decreased around the TSS (Supplementary Fig 8d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the genes with the highest CpG methylation level had the lowest MeCP2 enrichment (Supplementary Fig 8e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand this anticorrelation, we sorted the promoters into quintiles of GC% and CpG methylation level and found that genes with high GC% (and CpG%) had decreased methylation level and mCpG% (as expected given the hypomethylation of proximal CGIs discussed above) and that the anticorrelation between MeCP2 binding downstream of the TSS and CpG methylation level disappeared after conditioning on GC% (Supplementary Fig 8e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, as was the case in genome-wide analysis, MeCP2 enrichment primarily tracked GC% across the promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To investigate Mecp2 function in the regulation of transcription genome wide, we performed RNA-seq and compared the WT with Mecp2 KO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression values of the biological triplicates clustered correctly into separate WT and KO groups (Supplementary Fig 9a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An earlier study found that the majority of MeCP2-bound promoters are actually transcriptionally active, suggesting that even if MeCP2 acts as a repressor, its binding may not completely silence gene expression8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the relation between MeCP2 binding and gene expression, we sorted genes by their expression levels in WT animals and aligned the MeCP2 ChIP enrichment around the TSSs (Supplementary Fig 9b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While MeCP2 is strongly enriched downstream of the TSS, this enrichment did not correlate with expression status and was almost constant for

expressed genes, particularly in the proximal promoter (Supplementary Fig 9e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To test whether MeCP2 binding is associated with repressed transcription, we first identified transcripts with significant differences in expression between WT and Mecp2 KO, giving 1,690 transcripts in total (Supplementary Fig 9f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The median changes in up- and down-regulated genes were 1.50- and 0.64-fold, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the MeCP2 enrichment downstream of the TSS was 78% higher in upregulated transcripts compared with downregulated transcripts after Mecp2 KO (Wilcoxon rank-sum test P=1.4 × 1050; Fig 5a; Supplementary Fig 9g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted, however, that peak heights might represent either more binding across cell population or more stable binding in a subset of cells; thus, the observed higher MeCP2 enrichment should be interpreted with caution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GC% in the 5 end of Mecp2 KO upregulated genes was also markedly higher than in downregulated genes (65 versus 55%, Wilcoxon rank-sum test P=3.7 × 1050), and the increase largely tracked the MeCP2 enrichment in extent and magnitude (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although mCpG% did not differ appreciably between the 5 ends of up- and down-regulated genes (Fig 5c), MeCP2-binding level did correlate with differential expression (Fig 5d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the differential expression did not depend on GC% or mCpG% after conditioning on MeCP2-binding level (P=0.16 and P=0.28, regression slope t-test on ranked data), suggesting that the dependence of differential expression on MeCP2 was not an indirect effect mediated through GC% or mCpG% (Fig 5d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with earlier observations9,39, long genes were more upregulated than short genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, this length dependence remained after controlling for MeCP2 binding in the promoter, suggesting that it is an effect independent of MeCP2-binding downstream of promoter (Fig 5d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these findings suggest that MeCP2 both directly downregulates genes with strong binding and indirectly downregulates long genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: MeCP2 binding at the 5 end of genes is associated with increased transcription in Mecp2 KO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Top plot shows the alignment of MeCP2 enrichment

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'This study shows that MeCP2 binds distinct but numerous sites throughout the genome in a manner that can be accurately predicted using DNA sequence features alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, the lack of a fine-resolution genome-wide binding map has been a major bottleneck in understanding the mechanism of MeCP2 function40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One challenge has been the fact that MeCP2 has a widespread binding pattern along the entire genome4, thereby diluting the ChIP-seq signal when sequenced at shallow depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another complication arises from the diversity of neuronal types present in the brain tissue4,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to diverse neuronal populations, a large number of glial cells might also reduce the MeCP2 ChIP enrichment level41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have overcome these difficulties by performing high-resolution MeCP2 ChIP-seq in olfactory epithelium, which has only one type of neurons, namely the olfactory sensory neuron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The olfactory epithelial tissue harvested for our experiments consisted of mostly olfactory sensory neurons (77.2%) and only a small fraction of sustentacular cells (14.0%), and underlining stromal cells (8.8%) (data from this study).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, distinct individual MeCP2-binding sites could be identified, and only very low correlation was observed between MeCP2 ChIP-seq and Input data, distinguishing our results from previous published data sets9,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe the preponderance of a unique neuronal population in conjunction with an unconventional deep-sequencing strategy made our high-resolution data possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While our data exhibited the previously reported enrichment of CpG in MeCP2 peaks, we found that the GC% is the predominant predictive feature and that the correlation between MeCP2 binding and CpG% is confounded by the correlation between GC% and CpG%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Integrative analysis further showed that GC% is the dominant feature associated with MeCP2 binding even after including methylation information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation was further supported by reanalysis of published mouse brain MeCP2 ChIP-seq data4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the GC% continued to be an essential feature in mouse ES cells, but the mCpG% also played an important role in this cell type17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, while knocking out the methyltransferases Dnmt1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in ES cells modified the MeCP2-binding pattern, it did not significantly change the overall affinity of MeCP2 for chromatin17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the observed difference in binding pattern between olfactory epithelia and ES cells may be due to the large increase in MeCP2 expression throughout neuronal differentiation and a consequent change in the balance between methylation-dependent and methylation-independent binding modes tuned by MeCP2 concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Because numerous genomic features correlate with GC%, we investigated whether the high level of MeCP2 binding in GC-rich regions reflects direct sequence specificity or is confounded by some secondary GC-associated effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, previous studies have observed moderate technical GC biases in sequencing library preparation42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test for such potential biases, we preformed ChIP-qPCR and found good agreement with ChIP-seq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The degree of MeCP2 ChIP enrichment compared with Input is also much stronger than the level of previously reported GC biases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the disappearance of the correlation between differential gene expression and GC% after conditioning on MeCP2 binding (but not vice versa) suggested that it is the local MeCP2 binding that can predict differential expression after MeCP2 KO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, in vitro binding assays found increased binding affinity for high-GC DNA compared with low-GC DNA, supporting the role of GC% in recruiting MeCP2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the co-localization of MeCP2 peaks with MNase-seq peaks implied the importance of local chromatin structure in recruiting MeCP2 in vivo and suggested that the sequence specificity of MeCP2 might in part arise from its interaction with nucleosomes that themselves prefer GC-rich sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The combined results of our study thus provide support for two binding modes of MeCP2: (1) binding to abundant GC-rich sequences, many of which are found in nucleosomes and (2) binding to mCpG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results clarify the role of DNA sequence in recruiting MeCP2 and provide functional insights into this important epigenetic regulator.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

prediction of MeCP2 enrichment and its observed values varies  less_than 2% as the depth of regression trees varies between 3 and 8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Next, we added the dinucleotide concentrations into the feature set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since we now have multiple features in the set, we are interested in how important the individual features are for the prediction of MeCP2 enrichment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average relative tree-depth of a feature used in trees of the forest is used to quantify the relative importance of the features on the predicted value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our Random Forest regressor showed that dinucleotides have very small importance and hence a negligible impact on the prediction of MeCP2 binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GC% has importance of 88%, while the second most important feature, the GpC dinucleotide has importance of only 2.3%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the importance of CpG falls consistently below the importance of CpC/GpG and GpC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative importance of features is shown in Fig 1c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the negligible importance of dinucleotides, the AUC of the ROC and the Person correlation showed little improvement with inclusion of dinucleotides; AUC only improved by 0.5% and Pearson correlation by 1.2%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, inclusion of both di- and tri- nucleotides showed negligible importance of all di- and tri- nucleic features and little improvement in ROC and Pearson correlation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With both di- and tri- nucleotides included in the feature set, the importance of GC% is 87%, the highest di-nucleotide GpC has importance of 2.3% and the highest trinucleotide CAG has importance of 0.5%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained as depths of regressors ranged between 3 and 8.

Consortiums mouse annotation (gene_association.mgi and go-basic.obo downloaded on 13 March 2015) and restricted the analysis to genes with expression larger than 1 FPKM (geometric mean between WT and KO) and to GO terms with 10 or more such genes52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FPKM values were pooled for genes with multiple refSeq transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the significance of the expression changes, we first quantified the dispersion of the differential expression by binning the genes by , calculated the mean and variance of the fold changes within each bin, and performed quadratic fits for the fold and variance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using these dispersion fits we then calculated the Z-score of the differential expression for each gene and calculated the significance of the aggregated differential expression using the t-test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We finally used the BenjaminiHochberg procedure to control the false discovery rate.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
