Survival trade-offs in plant roots during colonization by closely related beneficial and pathogenic fungi  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The sessile nature of plants forced them to evolve mechanisms to prioritize their responses to simultaneous stresses, including colonization by microbes or nutrient starvation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we compare the genomes of a beneficial root endophyte, Colletotrichum tofieldiae and its pathogenic relative C. incanum, and examine the transcriptomes of both fungi and their plant host Arabidopsis during phosphate starvation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the two species diverged only 8.8 million years ago and have similar gene arsenals, we identify genomic signatures indicative of an evolutionary transition from pathogenic to beneficial lifestyles, including a narrowed repertoire of secreted effector proteins, expanded families of chitin-binding and secondary metabolism-related proteins, and limited activation of pathogenicity-related genes in planta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that beneficial responses are prioritized in C. tofieldiae-colonized roots under phosphate-deficient conditions, whereas defense responses are activated under phosphate-sufficient conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These immune responses are retained in phosphate-starved roots colonized by pathogenic C. incanum, illustrating the ability of plants to maximize survival in response to conflicting stresses.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Fungal endophytes are a ubiquitous and phylogenetically diverse group of organisms that establish stable associations with living plants, but in most cases their ecophysiological significance is poorly understood1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Species of the fungal genus Colletotrichum are best known as destructive pathogens on  greater than 3,000 species of dicot and monocot plants worldwide, causing anthracnose diseases and blights on leaves, stems, flowers and fruits2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However Colletotrichum species can also grow benignly as endophytes on symptomless plants3, and although only few pathogenic members of the genus attack plant roots4, Colletotrichum endophytes are frequently isolated from the roots of healthy plants5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, although the genome sequences and in planta transcriptomes were recently described for four species pathogenic on above-ground plant parts2,7, such information is not available for any root-associated Colletotrichum pathogens or endophytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We found recently that C. tofieldiae (Ct) is an endophyte in natural populations of Arabidopsis thaliana growing in central Spain8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fungus initially penetrates the rhizoderm by means of undifferentiated hyphae, which then ramify through the root cortex both inter- and intracellularly, occasionally spreading systemically into shoots via the root central cylinder without causing visible symptoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under phosphate-deficient conditions (50 M KH2PO4), colonization by Ct promoted plant growth and fertility and mediated the translocation of phosphate into shoots, as shown by 33P radiotracer experiments8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, neither the plant growth promotion nor phosphate translocation activities were detectable under phosphate-sufficient conditions (625 M KH2PO4), indicating that plant fitness benefits conferred by Ct are strictly regulated by phosphate availability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In striking contrast, colonization of A. thaliana roots by the closely related pathogenic species C. incanum (Ci), which attacks members of the Brassicaceae, Fabaceae and Solanaceae, severely inhibited Arabidopsis growth and mediated only low levels of 33P translocation into shoots8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings raise the possibility that in low-phosphate soils, root colonization by the Ct endophyte compensates for the absence of key genetic components required for mycorrhizal symbiosis in the Brassicaceae lineage, which is otherwise conserved in 8090% of terrestrial plants9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the present study, we report the genomes of five isolates of beneficial Ct and one isolate of pathogenic Ci, and analyse the transcriptomes of each species during their colonization of Arabidopsis roots under phosphate-deficient and phosphate-sufficient conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of the two species allows us to identify fungal adaptations to the endophytic lifestyle at the level of both gene repertoire and gene regulation, and provides insights into the evolutionary transition from parasitism to endophytism within a single fungal genus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the host side, transcriptional responses of Arabidopsis roots to colonization by beneficial Ct are modulated by the phosphate status, providing evidence that trade-offs between defense and nutrition control the outcome of the interaction between Arabidopsis and Ct. Our findings also shed light on the ability of plants to maximize survival by prioritizing their responses to simultaneous biotic and abiotic stresses.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Genome sequencing and evolution of Ct and Ci lifestyles', 'We sequenced the genome of the plant growth-promoting fungus Ct isolate 0861, a root endophyte isolated from natural populations of A. thaliana in Spain8,10, and those of four other Ct isolates isolated from diverse dicot and monocot hosts in Europe (Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also sequenced the broad host-range pathogen Ci, isolated from radish (Raphanus sativus) leaves in Japan, that strongly impairs plant growth when inoculated onto Arabidopsis roots8,11 (Supplementary Fig 1, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Illumina short reads were used to build high-quality genome assemblies of similar size for all isolates, ranging from 52.8 to 53.6 Mb (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular phylogeny, whole-genome alignment and divergence date estimates indicate that Ct and Ci are closely related taxa within the Colletotrichum spaethianum species complex and diverged only 8.8 million years ago (Fig 1a, Supplementary Figs 2 and 3, Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Note 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that evolution from pathogenic ancestors towards the beneficial endophytic lifestyle in Ct is a recent adaptation in Colletotrichum fungi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Colletotrichum evolutionary

separated geographical areas and distantly related plant hosts, they diverged only 0.29 million years ago and the aligned fractions ( greater than 93%) of their genomes share  greater than 99% sequence identity (Fig 1a and Supplementary Tables 1,3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall frequency of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between isolates was similar (2.223.04 SNPs per kb) but the SNP distribution within each genome was uneven, with alternating tracts of low (0.220.32 SNPs per kb) and high (4.255.12 SNPs per kb) SNP density (Fig 1b, Supplementary Fig 4 and Supplementary Table 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This peculiar SNP distribution, also visible in the genomes of other plant-interacting fungi12,13, is consistent with chromosome recombination events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the SNP density profiles are remarkably similar between isolates and large haplotype blocks are conserved between all (21%), four (19%), three (18%) or two (17%) of them, with only 22% being isolate specific (Fig 1b,c, Supplementary Fig 4, Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Note 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These conserved SNP signatures in the genomes of geographically distant isolates were likely generated by rare or ancestral sexual/parasexual reproduction and maintained by frequent clonal propagation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Evolutionary dynamics of multigene families in Colletotrichum', "Similar numbers of protein-coding genes were predicted in Ct0861 and Ci (13,000; Supplementary Table 2), with  greater than 11,300 orthologous genes shared between both species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By clustering protein-coding sequences into sets of orthologous genes using OrthoMCL, we identified 7,297 gene families conserved across all six analysed Colletotrichum species and 10,519 shared between Ct0861 and Ci (Fig 2a,b and Supplementary Note 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a maximum-likelihood approach, we also reconstructed ancestral genomes for each Colletotrichum lineage and predicted the number of gene families that were likely gained or lost in each species compared with its corresponding ancestor (Supplementary Fig 5 and Supplementary Note 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found significantly more gene families gained (1,009) than lost (198) on the branch leading to Ct compared with other branches of the tree (Fisher's exact test, P=3.98 × 10136; Supplementary Fig 5 and Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional enrichment analysis among the 1,009 gene families gained (Supplementary Fig 5) and the 1,486 Ct-specific gene families (Fig 2b) revealed a significant enrichment for genes encoding secondary metabolite biosynthesis-related proteins in Ct (Fishers exact test, P=5.89 × 103 and 3.31 × 108, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result contrasts with the very low number of secondary metabolite-related genes detected in the genomes of other root-associated fungal endophytes and mycorrhizal fungi14 and suggests that either fungal secondary metabolites have roles in establishing a beneficial endophytic interaction with host plants or in limiting the colonization of microbial competitors inside roots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evaluation of the selective forces (dN/dS ratio) acting on all the protein families in the Ct genome revealed that genes involved in signal transduction mechanisms, RNA processing and modification and lipid transport and metabolism showed the strongest evidence of adaptive evolution (false discovery rate (FDR) less_than 0.05, Fisher's test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This contrasts with pathogenic Colletotrichum species for which gene families belonging to the categories defense mechanisms, cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis and RNA processing and modification show the highest dN/dS ratios (Supplementary Figs 6 and 7, Supplementary Data

'Ct encodes large repertoires of transporters, secreted proteins, proteases, carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) and secondary metabolism key enzymes, very similar to Ci and four other pathogenic Colletotrichum species (Supplementary Figs 812 and Supplementary Note 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparing the Ct gene repertoires to those of five other plant-associated fungal endophytes from both ascomycete and basidiomycete lineages, we found no obvious common genomic signatures to indicate the convergent evolution of an endophyte toolkit (Supplementary Figs 812).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the convergent loss of decay mechanisms characteristic of ectomycorrhizal fungi15,16 is not a hallmark shared by the non-mycorrhizal root endophytes (Supplementary Fig 12), suggesting that these fungi have followed different evolutionary trajectories to acquire the ability for intimate growth in living root tissues14,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "Despite the overall similar secretome size of all analysed Colletotrichum species (13.315.9% of the total proteome), the proportion of genes encoding candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs), which may promote fungal infection18, varied considerably between species (6.615.8% of the total secretome; Fig 3a and Supplementary Table 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The smaller CSEP repertoire in Ct0861 (133 versus 189 in Ci) is largely explained by the reduction of species-specific CSEPs (34 versus 72 in Ci; Fig 3a, Supplementary Fig 13, Supplementary Table 7 and Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, calculation of dN/dS ratios among 331 CSEP families derived from all the 10 analysed Colletotrichum genomes indicates they are under diversifying selection (median 0.35, interquartile range 0.210.49) relative to non-CSEP families (median 0.20, interquartile range 0.070.33; Fisher's exact test, P less_than 2.2 × 1016; Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genomes from additional Ci isolates are now needed to determine whether there is differential host-selective pressure on the CSEP repertoires of endophytic Ct and pathogenic Ci that reflect their contrasting lifestyles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to other Colletotrichum species2, CSEPs in Ct and Ci are not organized into large multigene families, possibly due to a low frequency of duplication events in their respective genomes (Fig 3c,d and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ", 'Figure

 #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare the transcriptional dynamics of beneficial Ct and pathogenic Ci during colonization of Arabidopsis roots and study the corresponding host responses, we extensively re-analysed the previously created RNA-seq data for the Ct-Arabidopsis interaction (6, 10, 16 and 24 days post inoculation (d.p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), +P: 625 M, P: 50 M; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8) and

expression data were validated using quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RTqPCR) with a subset of Arabidopsis and Ct genes (Supplementary Fig 18, Supplementary Table 9 and Supplementary Note 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Transcriptional shutdown of pathogenicity genes in Ct', 'Among the 3,885 Ct genes significantly regulated (moderated t-test, |log2FC|1, FDR less_than 0.05), only few (61) were impacted by phosphate status (described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8) or the fungal developmental stage in planta (845; Supplementary Data 5 and Supplementary Fig 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, 80% were induced upon host contact and particularly those encoding CAZymes, for which a dynamic expression pattern was observed (Fig 4b and Supplementary Figs 19 and 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A first wave of activation (616 d.p.i.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  involved few plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) acting mostly on hemicellulose, while a second wave (24 d.p.i.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  involved induction of numerous PCWDEs acting on all major wall polymers, including cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, at later infection stages, Ct displays significant saprotrophic capabilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, genes encoding CSEPs, secreted proteases, secondary metabolism key enzymes and transporters showed no clear activation (Supplementary Fig 21), in contrast to the highly stage-specific deployment of such genes by C. higginsianum during infection of Arabidopsis leaves2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, the activation of Ct CSEPs was almost non-existent in planta, with only 18/133 expressed during colonization, 8/133 induced in planta (log2FC1) and 4/133 ranking among the 1,000 most highly expressed genes (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These few expressed CSEP genes showed similar dN/dS ratios compared with CSEPs that were silent in planta (Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contracted repertoire and small number of CSEPs activated in planta suggests Ct requires extremely few effectors for host invasion and maintenance of the beneficial relationship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Gene deployment in planta reflects fungal lifestyles', 'To uncover transcriptional adaptations associated with the evolutionary transition from the ancestral pathogenic lifestyle to beneficial endophytism, we compared the normalized expression levels of 6,804 Ct and Ci orthologous gene pairs that are expressed in planta (10, 24 d.p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ; P) (Supplementary Data 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More than twice as many gene pairs were differentially expressed at 10 d.p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (621 up, 842 down) than at 24 d.p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (306 up, 273 down; moderated t-test, |log2FC|1, FDR less_than 0.05), suggesting that early colonization events are critical for determining the outcome of the interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GO term enrichment analysis showed that processes related to melanin biosynthesis were significantly enriched in Ct, consistent with the formation of melanized microsclerotia in Ct but not Ci8 (Supplementary Table 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found major differences between Ct and Ci in the expression of gene categories typically associated with fungal pathogenicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In planta activation of CSEPs was more pronounced in Ci compared with Ct, with seven times more CSEPs highly expressed (top 1,000 expressed genes) and three times more upregulated in planta at 10 d.p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 3c,d and Supplementary Data 5 and 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise genes encoding CAZymes and secondary metabolism enzymes displayed earlier and stronger transcriptional activation in planta and broader diversity in Ci (Fig 4b,c and Supplementary Fig 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, we observed a reduced number of living cells and a depletion of beta-linked polysaccharides (including cellulose) from host cell walls in Ci-colonized roots at 10 d.p.i., but not in Ct-colonized roots (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggests that pathogenic Ci harvests carbon from plant cell walls more aggressively than Ct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, despite their phylogenetic proximity and similar gene arsenals, gene deployment during infection was strikingly different between Ct and Ci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The in planta transcriptome of Ci resembles that of other pathogenic Colletotrichum species2, whereas the less dynamic transcriptome of Ct might contribute to, or be a consequence of, the beneficial relationship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, our results suggest that the recent transition from pathogenic to beneficial lifestyles might be partly controlled through transcriptional downregulation of pathogenicity-related genes in Ct.', 'Host responses to Ct are phosphate-status dependent', 'To disentangle how Pi-starved and non-starved Arabidopsis roots respond to Ct colonization over time, we compared Ct-colonized and mock-inoculated roots under +P and P conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, 5,661 Arabidopsis genes were differentially expressed in at least one of the 16 pair-wise comparisons (moderated t-test, |log2FC|1, FDR less_than 0.05) and grouped into 20 major gene expression clusters (Fig 5a and Supplementary Data 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GO term enrichment analysis among these clusters indicated that the phosphate level used in our study (50 M) was sufficient to provoke a phosphate starvation response in Arabidopsis roots (clusters 2 and 4; Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our analysis indicates that response to stimulus, indole glucosinolate metabolic process, defense response and ethylene metabolic process are activated in Ct-colonized roots under +P but not P conditions (cluster 9) (Fig 5b and Supplementary Data 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the genes related to root cell differentiation (cluster 8, Fig 5b) and phosphate uptake8 were preferentially activated in Pi-starved Arabidopsis roots during Ct colonization, similar to mycorrhizal symbionthost interactions21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify key regulatory genes (hub genes) that might orchestrate transcriptional reprogramming in the contrasting directions seen in clusters 8 and 9, we checked which of these genes are often co-regulated in other expression data sets using the ATTED-II gene co-expression database (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the hub genes that showed high connectivity within cluster 8 (highlighted with black dots), many encode proteins involved in cell wall remodelling and root hair development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particularly, genes encoding the root hair-specific proteins RHS8, RHS12, RHS13, RHS15 and RHS19 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22) are upregulated (moderated t-test, |log2FC|1, FDR less_than 0.05) in Ct-colonized versus mock-treated roots under P conditions, which was validated by RTqPCR (Fig 5d and Supplementary Fig 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This expression pattern suggests that Ct-dependent remodelling of root architecture might play a key role to enhance phosphate uptake during starvation (Supplementary Note 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, we identified 27 hub genes within cluster 9 (Fig 5c, black dots), encoding well-characterized defense-related proteins such as the transcription factors WRKY33 and WRKY40 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23), the ethylene-responsive factors ERF11 and ERF13 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24), as well as MYB51 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25), a transcription factor regulating Tryptophan (Trp)-derived indole glucosinolate metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four other genes involved in indole glucosinolate metabolism were also highly differentially regulated in cluster 9, including the myrosinase PEN2 and the P450 monooxygenase CYP81F2 required for the biosynthesis of 4-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethylglucosinolate, the substrate of PEN2 myrosinase26,27 (Supplementary Data 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PEN2-dependent metabolism of Trp-derived indole glucosinolates in A. thaliana is activated upon perception of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by receptors of the innate immune system and is needed for broad-spectrum defence to restrict the growth of fungal pathogens26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, in Arabidopsis mutants that cannot activate PEN2-mediated antifungal defense, the promotion of plant growth by Ct is impaired, while the depletion of all Trp-derived secondary metabolites renders Ct a pathogen on Arabidopsis8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings strongly suggest that the phosphate starvation response and Trp-derived indole glucosinolate metabolism are interconnected to control fungal colonization of Arabidopsis roots28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphate status-dependent activation of defense responses was also observed among the 411 expressed Arabidopsis genes annotated as chitin-responsive (Supplementary Fig 23), based on GO term enrichment among all significantly regulated genes (Supplementary Fig 24) and this was validated by RTqPCR (Fig 5d and Supplementary Fig 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data reveal a remarkable capacity of Arabidopsis roots to prioritize different transcriptional outputs in response to Ct, favouring either defense responses under +P conditions or root growth and phosphate metabolism under P conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Transcriptional reprogramming of Pi-starved and non-starved

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Deciphering the genetic basis of the transition from pathogenic to beneficial plant-fungal interactions is crucial for a better understanding of the evolutionary history of fungal lifestyles20,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was recently shown that the ectomycorrhizal lifestyle arose independently multiple times during evolution and that the transition was associated with (1) convergent loss of genes encoding PCWDEs present in their saprotrophic ancestors and (2) the repeated evolution of lineage-specific toolkits of mycorrhiza-induced genes15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However in striking contrast with ectomycorrhizal fungi, this transition in Ct, P. indica and H. oryzae was not accompanied by contraction of their PCWDE repertoires19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, the close phylogenetic relatedness of beneficial Ct and pathogenic Ci, and their ability to infect the same plant host, allowed us to resolve both genomic and transcriptomic signatures associated with this evolutionary transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall high genomic similarity between Ct and Ci suggests that this transition involved only subtle remodelling of the gene repertoire (that is, a reduced set of CSEPs and expansion of chitin-binding and secondary metabolism-related protein families).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The retention of abundant pathogenicity- or saprotrophy-related genes implies that they are still needed by Ct, perhaps for exploitation of other plant hosts or during plant senescence when Arabidopsis leaves are extensively colonized by Ct mycelium8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results also suggest that changes in fungal gene expression patterns during host colonization, rather than extensive remodelling of the gene repertoire, provides an alternative and probably transient adaptation to a beneficial endophytic lifestyle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may reflect the relatively recent transition from pathogenic to non-pathogenic lifestyles in Ct and, consequently, a latent capacity to revert to a pathogenic lifestyle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'During the last decade, the molecular mechanisms by which plants respond to colonization by pathogenic or mutualistic fungi have been extensively studied30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it remains unclear how plants discriminate and respond appropriately to closely related fungal partners with different lifestyles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sedentary nature of plants suggests they have evolved regulatory systems to integrate exposure to conflicting biotic and abiotic stresses and balance their resource allocation strategically to maximize growth and survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent report showed that plant responses to multiple stresses are not cumulative and suggested that prioritization of stress responses does take place31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For plantmycorrhizal associations, an inverse correlation was observed between phosphate levels and the number of arbuscules formed in roots32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the detailed molecular mechanism remains unclear, this suggests that the nutritional status of the plant impacts fungal colonization efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that host transcriptional responses to Ct are dependent on phosphate availability, with defense responses activated or suppressed under high- or low-phosphate conditions, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that immune responses are retained in phosphate-starved roots colonized by Ci makes it unlikely that metabolic competition between phosphate starvation and defense response systems attenuates defense gene activation during interactions with Ct under P-limiting conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, a metabolic link between the phosphate starvation response and glucosinolate biosynthesis was described28 and the functional relevance of this link is supported by our observation that Ct-mediated plant growth promotion is impaired in Arabidopsis mutants lacking regulatory components of indole glucosinolate metabolism or the phosphate starvation response8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we hypothesize that connectivity between nutrient sensing and innate immunity systems in the host, combined with subtle genomic adaptations in Ct, has enabled the transition from pathogenic to beneficial ArabidopsisColletotrichum interactions (Supplementary Fig 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the interaction with beneficial Ct, but not with pathogenic Ci, is tightly controlled in plant roots by trade-offs between nutrition and defense.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether phosphate stress-dependent defense attenuation renders Ct-colonized plants super-susceptible to other microbial pathogens remains to be tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results are consistent with the fact that transfer of Pi from ramifying fungal hyphae to roots, and subsequent allocation to shoots for plant growth, occurs only under phosphate-deficient conditions8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, where Ct naturally associates with Arabidopsis in central Spain, the level of bioavailable phosphate in soil at those locations is very low (5.5 to 17 p.p.m., Supplementary Table 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that both innate immune responses (that is, indole glucosinolate metabolism) and soil phosphate availability are important selective forces driving fungal adaptation and contributing to the evolutionary transition from parasitic to beneficial Arabidopsisfungal associations.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

from Roche 454 FLX+ and Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencers, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the Ct0861 reference genome, a hybrid assembly strategy was used combining 454 and Illumina data.
