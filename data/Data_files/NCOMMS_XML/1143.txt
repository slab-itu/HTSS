Bayesian association scan reveals loci associated with human lifespan and linked biomarkers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The enormous variation in human lifespan is in part due to a myriad of sequence variants, only a few of which have been revealed to date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since many life-shortening events are related to diseases, we developed a Mendelian randomization-based method combining 58 disease-related GWA studies to derive longevity priors for all HapMap SNPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Bayesian association scan, informed by these priors, for parental age of death in the UK Biobank study (n=116,279) revealed 16 independent SNPs with significant Bayes factor at a 5% false discovery rate (FDR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eleven of them replicate (5% FDR) in five independent longevity studies combined; all but three are depleted of the life-shortening alleles in older Biobank participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further analysis revealed that brain expression levels of nearby genes (RBM6, SULT1A1 and CHRNA5) might be causally implicated in longevity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene expression and caloric restriction experiments in model organisms confirm the conserved role for RBM6 and SULT1A1 in modulating lifespan.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Human lifespan is a highly variable and heterogeneous trait1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Until the 19th century average life expectancy was 3040 years2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sharp rise in life expectancy over the past century is due primarily to improved housing, nutrition, hygiene and vaccines3, which greatly enhanced the chances to survive childhood and young adulthood4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While most determinants of life expectancy are still environmental (for example, socio-economic status, smoking and other lifestyle factors and gender1), numerous twin studies5 suggest that in modern societies 2030% of human lifespan variation is due to genetic factors, perhaps up to 40% when looking at survival beyond 85100 years, often termed longevity1,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Longer lifespan is strongly associated with later disease onset and as such is likely influenced by many genetic variants via predisposition to, or protection from certain diseases5, or their risk factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been instrumental in revealing disease susceptibility8 and longevity-associated loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these studies have so far revealed only a handful of robustly replicating genetic variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most studies have focussed on an extreme casecontrol design, where cases were defined as individuals surviving past 90 years of age and controls were those who died at earlier ages, typically before 80.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bottleneck in these studies is the availability of genotyped samples from nonagenarians, however, increasing sample sizes from n=1,836 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9; at which no variants were significant) to n=6,036 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10) and n=7,729 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11), revealed first the TOMM40/APOE/APOC1 (rs4420638) and FOXO3 (rs10457180) loci, although not at genome-wide significance level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A meta-analysis of European longevity cohorts confirmed APOE (rs4420638, P less_than 3.4 × 1036) and revealed a new locus near EBF1 (rs2149954, P=1.74 × 108)11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another approach to identify lifespan-associated loci uses survival analysis, however an early genome-wide study of 25,007 individuals, of whom 8,444 died during the follow-up period failed to identify any significant findings, or overlaps with previous studies12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Two recent studies13,14 analysed parental longevity in the UK Biobank15: both highlighted a disease locus, CHRNA3/5 (P less_than 1016), known to associate with lung cancer linked to smoking16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presumably due to the more powerful method, using information from all parents, alive or dead, in a Cox-regression framework14, both detected the well-known APOE region (P less_than 1019), also associated with Alzheimers disease17, whilst neither study replicated FOXO3 or EBF1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest disease-associated loci may serve as good candidates for lifespan studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, a recent GWAS on extreme longevity18 proposed a weighted hypothesis-testing approach, in which single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are up-weighted if their association P value combined over 14 disease-related traits is lower.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach enabled the discovery of three novel loci implicated in extreme longevity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we improve and extend these approaches using: (i) a Bayesian approach to derive a meaningful prior effect size for each SNP; (ii) estimating and accounting for all effect directions (that is, the SNP-phenotype effect sizes and the trait-lifespan causal effect sizes); (iii) analysing lifespan in a general population cohort of the UK Biobank study14 rather than extreme longevity; (iv) looking up the 16 top associations in four additional longevity studies10,11,12,18; (v) performing extensive bioinformatics follow-up and transcriptomic experiments in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The key aims of our study are to (i) discover new variants impacting mortality and doing this by developing a mechanistic model to estimate morbidity priors for each SNP; (ii) understand through which disease-predisposition they act; (iii) reveal the discrepancy between the life-shortening effect of a SNP and its effect on various life-shortening diseases; (iv) shed light on transcriptome biomarkers that may be causally involved in this process; (v) elucidate whether these processes are shared between mice and human.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Methods overview', 'We used parental lifespan-association summary statistics (Z-statistics of the linear regression) from the UK Biobank study14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For simplicity, in the following, we will use the term lifespan to refer to parental lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For each SNP, we compute a novel test statistic, based on a Bayes factor (BF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With simulations, we draw a large sample of how these statistics would be distributed if the null hypothesis were true for every SNP, that is, no effect of any SNP on lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allows us to compute a P value for each observed test statistic, comparing the observed test statistic to the large sample of null test statistics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this framework, the goal is to compute a novel test statistic which is more powerful than the conventional lifespan Z-statistic of .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given two point hypotheses, the likelihood ratio test is the most powerful test19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use a BF as the likelihood ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each SNP, the two hypotheses of interest are the null hypothesis of no effect on lifespan and an alternative hypothesis, which we refer to as a prior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prior is a prediction of the lifespan effect size, based on the effect sizes of the same SNP for other disease-related traits and an (out-of-sample) estimate of the causal effect of these traits on lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The steps taken, in order, are: (1) Impute Z-statistics for all SNPs of interest in lifespan and in other traits of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2) Estimate the causal effects of traits on lifespan using Mendelian randomization (MR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (3) Build the prior for each SNP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (4) Compute the BFs for each SNP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (5) Sample the null BFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (6) Compute P values by comparing the observed BFs to the null BFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All these steps are explained in details in the Methods section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The first step is performed with a standard summary statistic imputation method20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To tackle step 2, we first collected a large compendium of 58 eligible association studies representing 36 distinct traits potentially impacting lifespan (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These association scores were subjected to multivariate, out-of-sample MR analysis to estimate the causal effect of these traits on parental lifespan (Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In step 3, we then defined the per-trait prior effect of each SNP as the product of its effect on a trait and the causal effect of this trait on lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These per-trait priors were summed up to yield a prior effect estimate for each SNP on lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Steps 2&3 are illustrated in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Analysis steps to obtain longevity prior effects for Bayesian analysis.For each SNP its prior effect on lifespan is calculated as the product of the effect of the SNP i on GWAS traits (risk factors)  and the causal effect of the trait t on lifespan , summed over all available T GWAS traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The causal effects of the traits on lifespan were calculated via a leave-one-chromosome out multivariate Mendelian randomization.Full size image', 'Next, the derived priors were combined with the observed longevity association statistics to calculate the BF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final step was to compare the obtained BFs to the distribution expected under the null hypothesis, allowing us to compute empirical P values control the false discovery rate (FDR) regardless of the correctness of the priors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aside from these permutation-based P values, all P values in this paper are based on a normally distributed test statistic and a null hypothesis of no effect of the SNP (or trait) on lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GWAS data we used for non-lifespan traits includes P values; from these P values and the effect direction we inferred the Z-statistics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Possible causal effects of GWAS traits on parental lifespan', 'The instrument (SNPs) selection, a key component of any MR analysis, depends on the association P value threshold and strength of linkage disequilibrium (LD) pruning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have explored multiple settings (Supplementary Fig 1) and, as a compromise, chose intermediate instrument strength (P less_than 105) and moderate LD pruning (LD less_than 0.2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The multivariate MR identified 11 traits with significant causal effects on lifespan (Table 1 and Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the estimates presented here are multivariate, which is necessary to create priors that avoid double counting the effect of pleiotropic SNPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In univariate MR, many other traits show significant univariate causal effect (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 11 traits were selected based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) after removing any traits with multivariate P value greater than 0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complete model explained 7.7% of the variability of lifespan effect sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most causal effect directions were in line with the literature and mechanistic explanations: having higher education level, higher high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol level and shorter stature improves lifespan; but higher body mass index (BMI), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, triglyceride or glucose levels, susceptibility to coronary artery disease, major depression, type 2 diabetes (T2D) or schizophrenia all shorten lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Smoking intensity (measured as number of cigarettes per day) showed a clear negative impact on lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Less intuitively, the link between tall stature and shorter lifespan has been shown in several studies, some explaining the link by cancer risk21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only one cancer study (neuroblastoma) passed our inclusion criteria, hence due to the weakness of the available instruments the impact of most cancers could not be investigated here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to provide further evidence that these causal estimates yield robust priors, we performed MR using instruments only from chromosomes 1 to 6 and another MR analysis with instruments only from chromosomes 7 to 22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the selected traits did not perfectly agree (Supplementary Table 2), both the causal effect sizes and the resulting priors were highly concordant (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we examined the MR residuals to ensure that there was no instrument with indication to violate the third MR assumption, that is, that the instrument must be independent of disease-lifespan confounders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If such violation occurs, the instrument would have a disease-independent (pleiotropic) impact on lifespan and hence the observed SNP-lifespan effect would deviate substantially from the prior effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed only a slight deviation for one instrument (a SNP near APOE, rs7256200) on the residual qq-plot for all the 22 leave-one-chromosome-out estimation (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the large number of instruments, excluding this single SNP does not change noticeably the results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Multivariate causal effect

many of the obtained causal effect estimates seem plausible and in line with literature evidence, we do not claim that these causal effect estimates are unbiased, neither that no instruments violated MR assumptions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This step was necessary only to obtain sensible priors for the downstream analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If these estimates are wrong, our prior is less informative, yielding fewer discoveries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Computing prior effect estimates', 'In total 77,963 SNPs had association P value  less_than 105 with at least one of the 11 traits identified in the previous step to be causally linked to lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each of these SNPs we calculated the product of its effect on a given trait (set to zero if the association P value  greater than 105) and the estimated causal effect of the trait on lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These products were then summed up for all the 11 traits and used as prior effect estimate of the SNP on lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For illustration we show how the effect sizes of these 78 K SNPs for four important traits compare to their effect on lifespan (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the agreement is far from perfect, but when combined together into a prior it correlates well with the estimated effect on lifespan in the UK Biobank study (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also computed priors for the remainder of the 2.3 million HapMap SNPs for which we imputed lifespan-association Z-statistics and effect estimatestheir prior distribution was set to have zero mean as none of them were significant at 105 for any of the 11 traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Loci surviving 5% false discovery rate', 'Combining the priors with the observed longevity summary statistics we obtained BF for all 2.3 million SNPs and generated 1000 null GWAS associations to derive null BFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The generated 2.3 billion (1,000 permutations × 2,350,352 SNPs) null BFs were used to assign P values to each observed BF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Manhattan plot highlights the 16 associated loci surviving 5% FDR (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each locus we selected the SNP with the largest BF, the

Most of these SNPs (or their LD-proxies) have been previously associated with clinically important traits, most frequently: LDL-, triglyceride-, total cholesterol-, education levels, BMI, height and coronary artery disease (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, an intronic SNP of the BMI-associated FTO gene also features in the list of 16 top hits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, three of them

1% of lifespan variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These calculations showed that apart from the top two hits (APOE and CHRNA3/5) we have only 16% (for the FTO variant) to 73% (for the SNP near BSND) power to replicate our findings with a P value below 0.05/16 in a study very similar to the combined CHARGE data set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason we call our analysis as a lookup, given that strict

meta-analysed P values using the Fishers method22 while accounting for study overlap (Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, 11 of the 16 SNPs can be declared significant based on its combined replication P value at 5% FDR (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Some of these 16 SNPs (near APOE/APOC1, LPA and FTO) seemed to have larger effects on extreme longevity

lifespan, SNPs regulating their expression may influence lifespan through the altered expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we explored whether SNPs that at least mildly regulate

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this work, we present a Bayesian approach to detect novel associations between genetic markers and lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have demonstrated that genome-wide disease GWAS results combined with Mendelian randomization yield very informative prior effect estimates for lifespan association.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When using non-informative priors only two loci could be identified14, but our approach revealed 16 loci associated with lifespan at 5% FDR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, if we were to use the standard association P values, but reduce multiple testing burden to only 4% of the genome that had non-zero prior assigned, still only three of the 16 loci would have been recovered at 5% FDR (Supplementary Table 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One could argue that any SNP linked to a trait causally affecting lifespan will eventually be associated with lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study points far beyond this basic statement: First, we provide effect size estimates of the identified SNPs on various scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, three of our top hits are not associated at genome-wide significant level with any individual disease and only two of them are top hit for some disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, most of the 16 loci exhibit pleiotropic effects (Fig 5): For example, the APOE/APOC1 variant (rs4420638) decreases lifespan primarily through (beyond the well-known effect on Alzheimer predisposition) increasing LDL levels, but surprisingly protects from type 2 diabetes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CHRNA3/5 SNP (rs951266) mainly impacts lifespan through smoking and schizophrenia predisposition; the SNX29 SNP rs729583 seems to have little impact on most of the 11 traits; the FTO SNP rs9939973 essentially exerts its effect on BMI and its downstream traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

significant causal effect of alcohol consumption on lifespan, despite epidemiological observations41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be a false negative result and might be due to the fact that the GWAS on alcohol use did not reveal strong associations, rendering the MR less powerful.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strong link between education level and lifespan has been seen in other studies42, but its interpretation is not straightforward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Educational attainment may have shared genetics with socio-economic status, which is a more plausible underlying cause.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with our finding, a recent study demonstrated that genetic risk score for education level is a strong predictor of longevity42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, some risk factors (lipids, blood pressure, obesity and diabetes) have shown opposite effect on lifespan when focusing on longevity only beyond 85 years43, but  less_than 15% of UK Biobank parental lifespans fell into this category, hence this phenomenon could only mildly worsen our prior, which was based on younger populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some risk factors (for example, BMI) can have non-linear causal relationship with lifespan, which can render our approach less powerful.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The follow-up analyses revealed several novel insights into the genetic underpinnings of lifespan regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we found that while genetic effects on extreme longevity are generally larger than on general lifespan, their global genetics are largely shared (rG=0.73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the squared genetic correlation between lifespan and the (causal effect) weighted combination of 11 traits/diseases examined in this study, calculated by LD-score regression38, is surprisingly low 5.8% (Supplementary Fig 5), but in line with the one 7.7% lifespan variance explained by the 11 traits in the multivariate MR model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we have also seen that 13 of the 16 lifespan-shortening alleles are rarer in older individuals, a clear fingerprint of selection bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The small extent of allele depletion ( less_than 1 months difference between genotype groups) also suggests that selection bias in general population cohorts would not strongly influence GWAS results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, our in-depth eQTL MR analysis revealed three potentially causal genes for lifespan (in brain).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the similarity of the effect of some candidate genes and their expression levels in brain on lifespan and trends in CR in mouse indicate evolutionary conservation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our approach has several weaknesses: (i) Since the UK Biobank study is much larger than any other lifespan study ever conducted, meaningful replication is not possible due to these previous studies being massively underpowered for this purpose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) We cannot identify longevity-associated SNPs whose effects are non-disease mediated or mediated by diseases whose genetic background is largely unknown or confounded by environmental factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iii) When applying MR we did not strictly verify whether all instruments are valid as our aim was only to obtain a sensible causal effect estimate to define the priors, rather than accurately establishing the true causal effect size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iv) Sample size of the available GWASs impacts our ability to detect traits causally affecting lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This limitation precluded us from including most cancer GWASs to build the priors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another example is educational attainment: when we used the recently published study on educational attainment44 (N=293,723) in our MR analysis, it revealed a much stronger causal evidence for lifespan than the earlier study45 (N=101,069).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (v) Combining our results with expression QTL analysis does not provide definite evidence of the causal involvement of certain transcripts in lifespan modulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, tissues with larger sample size have more chance to be picked up than others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in case of the lifespan-associated rs646776 at the 1p13.3 locus (near CELSR2) we could not detect a causally implicated mediator gene in any tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a previous study46 showed that this variant might exert its effect on LDL cholesterol levels through modulating the expression of SORT1 in the liver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conducted MR analysis to confirm this gene as the best candidate for LDL, but not for lifespan: The reason for this is that SORT1 has a much stronger eQTL SNP in liver (rs7528419), which is not associated with lifespan in our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus unless rs7528419 is an invalid instrument, our observation excludes SORT1 as causal gene for lifespan, despite being a strong candidate for LDL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We expect that the growing number of traits subjected to GWASs and their increasing sample size will strengthen our approach to reveal many more longevity-associated SNPs that act through disease modulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, our analysis strategy is not specific to longevity and can provide a new statistical framework to improve the power of future GWA studies of any disease with well-studied risk factors.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
