One-Year stable perovskite solar cells by 2D/3D interface engineering  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Despite the impressive photovoltaic performances with power conversion efficiency beyond 22%, perovskite solar cells are poorly stable under operation, failing by far the market requirements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Various technological approaches have been proposed to overcome the instability problem, which, while delivering appreciable incremental improvements, are still far from a market-proof solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show one-year stable perovskite devices by engineering an ultra-stable 2D/3D (HOOC(CH2)4NH3)2PbI4/CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite junction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2D/3D forms an exceptional gradually-organized multi-dimensional interface that yields up to 12.9% efficiency in a carbon-based architecture, and 14.6% in standard mesoporous solar cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To demonstrate the up-scale potential of our technology, we fabricate 10 × 10 cm2 solar modules by a fully printable industrial-scale process, delivering 11.2% efficiency stable for  greater than 10,000 h with zero loss in performances measured under controlled standard conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This innovative stable and low-cost architecture will enable the timely commercialization of perovskite solar cells.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'With power conversion efficiencies (PCE) beyond 22%, comparable to silicon solar cells at half of the price1,2,3, organo lead-halide perovskite solar cells (PSC) are leading the photovoltaic research scene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, despite the big excitement, the unacceptably low-device stability under operative conditions currently represents an apparently unbearable barrier for their market uptake4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, a marketable product requires a warranty for 2025 years with  less_than 10% drop in performances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This corresponds, on standard accelerated aging tests, to having  less_than 10% drop in PCE for at least 1,000 h. Hybrid perovskite solar cells are still struggling to reach this goal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perovskite are sensitive to water and moisture, ultraviolet light and thermal stress6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When exposed to moisture, the perovskite structure tend to hydrolyse6, undergoing irreversible degradation and decomposing back into the precursors, for example, the highly hygroscopic CH3NH3X and CH(NH2)2X salts and PbX2, with X=halide, a process that can be dramatically accelerated by heat, electric field and ultraviolet exposure7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Material instability can be controlled to a certain extent using cross-linking additives9 or by compositional engineering10, that is, adding a combination of Pb(CH3CO2)2·3H2O and PbCl2 in the precursors11 or using cation cascade, including Cs and Rb cations, as recently demonstrated2,3, to reduce the material photo-instability and/or optimize the film morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, solar cell degradation is not only due by the poor stability of the perovskite layers, but can be also accelerated by the instability of the other layers of the solar cell stack.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the organic hole transporting material (HTM) is unstable when in contact with water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be partially limited by proper device encapsulation12,13,14 using buffer layers between perovskite and HTM15 or moisture-blocking HTM16 such as NiOx (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17) delivering, in this case, up to 1,000 h stability at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this approach increases the device complexity, and the cost of materials and processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also worth to mention that most of the device stability measurements reported in literature are often done under arbitrary conditions far from the required standards18 such as not performed under continuous light illumination17, measured at an undefined temperature, or leaving the device under uncontrolled light and humidity conditions19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This makes a proper comparison among the different strategies used challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, two-dimensional (2D) perovskites have recently attracted a substantial interest due to their superior stability and water resistance, far above their three-dimensional (3D) counterpart14,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this respect, solar cells based on the quasi-2D (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 (BA=n-butylammonium) perovskite have recently shown 12% efficiency21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, their performances drop by 30% after running for 2,250 h in ambient conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we develop an innovative concept by engineering a multi-dimensional junction made of 2D/3D perovskites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This 2D/3D interface brings together the enhanced stability of 2D perovskite with the panchromatic absorption and excellent charge transport of the 3D ones, enabling the fabrication of efficient and ultra-stable solar cells, an important proof of concept for further device optimization and up-scaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we develop HTM-free solar cells and modules substituting the HTM with hydrophobic carbon electrodes22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within this configuration we demonstrate, for the first time, a remarkable long-term stability of  greater than 10,000 h, corresponding to  greater than 400 days with zero loss in efficiency over a large-area, fully printable, low-cost and high-efficient solar module of 100 cm2 (active area of around 50 cm2) measured under controlled standard conditions and in the presence of oxygen and moisture.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Structural and optoelectronic characterization', 'Inspired by the concept of crystal engineering and supramolecular synthons in 2D layered perovskite24,25, we have first realized a low-dimensional perovskite using the protonated salt of aminovaleric acid iodide (HOOC(CH2)4NH3I, AVAI hereafter), as the organic precursor mixed with PbI2 (see Supplementary Information for details), following the procedure of the previous work of few of us23,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deposition results in the formation of a low-dimensional perovskite possibly arranging into a (HOOC(CH2)4NH3)2PbI4 structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A yellowish film containing needle-like crystallites is formed (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1a, the absorption spectra of the film shows a clear band edge at 450 nm and an excitonic peak at 425 nm24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Band edge emission at 453 nm is observed in the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structural properties of the (HOOC(CH2)4NH3)2PbI4 are investigated by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Raman spectra of the 100%AVAI sample is compared with the one collected from the 3D perovskite (0%AVAI) and to the mixed 3% AVAI, as shown in Fig 1b (panels IIII).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the 100%AVAI perovskite sharper peaks in the 50200 cm1 range are observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More in details, the peaks at 87, 112 and 169 cm1 are related to Pb-I stretching and bending modes27,28,29, while the modes at 62 and at 143 cm1 are associated to the rotation and libration of the organic cations, leading to an overall spectra very similar in shape to that of PbI2 intercalated with ammonia molecules27,28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The X-ray diffraction measurement of the 100%AVAI perovskite, Fig 1c (panel I), collected on an extended range down to 3°, exhibits a rich diffraction pattern at low angles with a strong dominant peak at 4.7° along with two lateral peaks at 4.2 and 5.2°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data provide evidence of the formation of a low-dimensional perovskite with a possible much more complex crystal structure as evident by the multiple reflections at low angles (2 less_than 10o)24,25,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the second step, we engineer the 2D/3D composite by mixing the (AVAI:PbI2) and (CH3NH3I:PbI2) precursors at different molar ratios (035102050%, as described in Supplementary Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mixed solution is infiltrated in the mesoporous oxide scaffold by a single-step deposition followed by a slow drying-process, allowing the reorganization of the components in the film before solidification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mixed films obtained by varying the precursors ratio absorb across the whole visible region with an edge at 760 nm and a peak around 430 nm, see Fig 1a and Supplementary Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1a shows the results for the film obtained by 3% AVAI, representing the optimized concentration for the best performing device (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absorption band edge matches with that of 3D CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite, while the peak at 430 nm, which linearly gains intensity upon increasing the AVAI% (see inset in Fig 1a and Supplementary Fig 4), resembles the absorption peak of the 2D perovskite, although partially red-shifted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The addition of 3% AVAI thus induces the formation of a mixed 2D/3D composite, partly retaining the features of its 2D and 3D constituents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1b compares the Raman spectrum of the 100%AVAI sample with those from the 0%AVAI and the optimized 3% AVAI sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional data at different AVAI concentration are reported in Supplementary Figs 5 and 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectrum of the 2D/3D 3%AVAI composite shows well-defined Raman lines spectrally matching the 2D peaks and standing out of a broader band that is characteristic of the modes of the inorganic lattice of the 3D CH3NH3PbI3 (refs 28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the 3% AVAI sample, sharp Raman features with reduced broadening are identified, suggesting an overall more ordered crystal rearrangement of the 2D/3D film compared with the pure 3D phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The X-ray diffraction pattern of the 2D/3D is reported in Fig 1ce and Supplementary Figs 7 and 8 for the different AVAI content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most prominent peak is observed at 14.13°, related to the (110) direction of the CH3NH3PbI3 tetragonal phase30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More in details, as revealed by the zoom in Fig 1d,e, the 2D/3D film shows a remarkable change in intensity of the (00l) and (hk0) peaks compared with the pattern of the 3D CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With 3% AVAI both (002) and (004) decrease in intensity, while the intensity of the (110) and (220) reflections are increased, speaking in favour for a preferred orientation along the  less_than hk0 greater than  direction23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other side, no clear evidence of the peaks related to the 2D phase is observed for 3% AVAI, while they appear if the AVAI percentage exceeds 10% (Supplementary Figs 7 and 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can rationalize these results suggesting that the 2D/3D perovskite film with 3% AVAI is constituted by a thin layer (possibly a monolayer) of 2D perovskite; an oriented interface where the 3D phase has a marked preferential growth direction, and a pure 3D perovskite arranging in the tetragonal phase on top.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further elucidate the properties of the 2D/3D interface, we measure the steady-state PL spectra and time-resolved PL dynamics, see Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Optical and Structural characterization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Absorption spectra of the

light penetration depth is  less_than 100 nm at 600 nm, excitation of the perovskite film from the oxide side (scaffold thickness of around 1 m) interrogates the perovskite nano-crystallites grown within the scaffold, while excitation from the perovskite top layer probes the intrinsic properties of the bulk perovskite growing on top.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) PL dynamics of the bulk perovskite (exciting from the top layer) at 760 nm and from the oxide side at 730 nm of the 3%AVAI deposited on the insulating ZrO2 mesoporous substrate.Full size image', 'In particular, we measure the 2D/3D perovskite infiltrated into an inert ZrO2 scaffold by varying the excitation side to selectively interrogate the perovskite crystals within the oxide or the top bulk perovskite layer, Fig 2a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PL measured when exciting from the oxide side reveals a weak emission around 450 nm, matching with the one of (HOOC(CH2)4NH3)2PbI4 (Supplementary Figs 2 and 10a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests the presence of a 2D phase mostly retained at the interface with the oxide due to the favourable anchoring of the carboxylic acid group of the AVAI ligand to the TiO2 scaffold31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monitoring a more extended spectral window, Fig 2b, excitation of the bulk top layer results in a single PL peak at 760 nm, as one would expect, while excitation from the oxide side leads to a peak at 730 nm along with a shoulder at 760 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emission at 730 nm suggests that a different perovskite phase with a larger band-gap (of 1.69 eV) is formed within the oxide scaffold, but only in the presence of the AVAI precursor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, a similar higher energy emission has been found at low-temperature, for the 3D CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite, but was never observed at room temperature32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we deposit a thicker oxide scaffold, avoiding the formation of the bulk CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite capping layer, only the peak at 730 nm appears (Supplementary Figs 9, 10), confirming that the emission at 760 nm comes from the bulk perovskite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the pristine 3D CH3NH3PbI3 excited from the oxide side does not show such blue-shifted emission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2c compares the PL dynamics probing the temporal decay of the two different peaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 760 nm, the PL shows a long-lived decay (extending out of our temporal window) typically assigned to electron-hole recombination at the band edges32,33, while at 730 nm a fast component with a time constant =2 ns dominates, see Supplementary Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, such faster decay has been observed in the more oriented 3D CH3NH3PbI3 that appears only at low temperature32,33, possibly due to intrinsic reduced electron-hole lifetime34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that we intentionally use the insulating ZrO2 substrate to highlight the intrinsic behaviour of the two phases, however a relative shortening of the lifetime is also observed on TiO2 (Supplementary Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Overall, our analysis demonstrates the unique role of the 2D perovskite, anchored on the oxide network, in templating the growth of a biphasic 3D CH3NH3PbI3: an oriented wider band-gap phase within the oxide scaffold and a standard tetragonal phase on top of it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to remark the fundamental role of the oxide in templating the graded 2D/3D interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, if the 3% AVAI perovskite is deposited on a compact glass substrate the blue-shifted emission peak at 730 nm is not observed, while only the emission at around 760 nm is visible, independently from the excitation side (see Supplementary Figs 12,13 and the discussion in Supplementary Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Simulation of the 2D/3D interface', 'To check the impact of the suggested 2D/3D perovskite interface on the composite electronic properties, we carried out first principles simulations of the 2D/3D interface, Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We built periodic (in the direction orthogonal to the interface) slabs of the 2D and 3D perovskites ensuring a lattice mismatch within  less_than 1%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The methylammonium cations of the 3D perovskite layer contacting the 2D slab were replaced by AVA cations from the 2D slab and, employing the cell parameters of the 3D perovskite, we relaxed the atomic positions of the overall system by means of scalar-relativistic plane-wave/pseudopotential density functional theory calculations employing the PBE functional.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As seen in Fig 3a, there is a 0.14 eV CB upshift at the 2D/3D interface compared to the bulk of the 3D perovskite, which induces a 0.09 eV larger interface gap compared to the 3D bulk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is clearly consistent with the PL blue shift experimentally observed (0.13 eV) when probing the system from the oxide side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, only a small shift (around 0.02 eV) of opposite sign was found at the MAPbI3/TiO2 interface35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: First principles simulations of the 2D/3D interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Local density of state (DOS)

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'These results suggest that the 2D/3D interaction widens the 3D perovskite band-gap in the interface region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the thin 2D layer does not constitute a barrier to electron injection to TiO2, but it rather constitutes a barrier towards electron recombination, since the 2D conduction band is found at lower energy than that of the 3D CB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is confirmed also in the presence of spin-orbit-coupling, see PDOS in Fig 3c and Supplementary Fig 14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results indicate that the 2D/3D perovskite organizes in a gradual multi-dimensional structure retaining the individual 2D and 3D phases, but, importantly also templating the formation of a novel oriented CH3NH3PbI3 phase stabilized at the 2D/3D interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have then fabricated solar cells with the 2D/3D perovskite optimizing the AVAI% using both an architecture with an organic HTM and Au electrode, and a fully printable HTM-free configuration, where the HTM and gold are substituted with a carbon matrix23, and a TiO2 mesoporous layer as electron transporting layer36, as depicted in the cartoon in Fig 4a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  JV characteristic of the 2D/3D perovskite solar cell using an optimal 3%AVAI composition and Spiro-OMeTAD/Au is shown in Fig 4b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solar cell delivers a champion efficiency of 14.6% (see also Table in the inset of Fig 4c, Supplementary Fig 15 and device statistics in the inset and in Supplementary Figs 16,17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, it shows a much better trend in the device stability with respect to pure 3D CH3NH3PbI3 cell (delivering an average efficiency above 13% in the same cell architecture), as shown in Fig 4c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This represents an important proof of concept that paves the way to further stabilize the high efficiency (beyond 21%) mesoporous solar cells based on a mixed halide composition2,37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the 2D/3D perovskite compared to the standard 3D CH3NH3PbI3, the efficiency is maintained up to 60% of the initial value after 300 h continuous illumination under argon atmosphere, more stable than the standard 3D perovskite (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: 2D/3D Mesoporous Solar cell characteristics and stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Device cartoon of the Hole transporting Material (HTM)-free solar cell

developed HTM-free solar cells, being at present the cheapest, fully printable low-cost deposition process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It presents the most attractive photovoltaic solution, being a simple monolithic architecture without the use of the instable and expensive organic HTM and without the additional barrier layers17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have developed small area cells (0.64 cm2) and large area 10 × 10 cm2 solar modules as shown in Fig 5a,b reporting the average JV curve of the cell and the module, as well as the device statistics in the inset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modules were prepared with a total size of 10 × 10 cm2, with a geometric fill factor (GFF), the ratio between the active area and the total area of the module, of 46.7%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This leads to an active area of 47.6 cm2 per module, which is the area considered to calculate the device efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, to avoid any mechanical damage of the cells, the devices were protected with a glass slide via a very simple sealing method under air conditions (see details in Supplementary Information), not under any inert or humidity controlled atmosphere as usually reported in literature, further confirming the higher robustness of our devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The champion cell and module deliver an efficiency of 12.71% and 11.2%, respectively, among the highest reported so far ranging from 7 to 14% (refs 39, 40, 41, 42), as shown in Supplementary Table 2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth mentioning that a fair comparison among the majority of reported module efficiencies is challenging because the GFF and the geometric shape of the devices are most of the times not indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our work, the modules consist of 8 cells of 85 × 7 mm2, which leads to an active area of 5.95 cm2 per cell and 47.60 cm2 per module.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this module design, both the interconnect distance (around 3 mm) and the margins around the module aperture are admittedly large, implying an important loss in the area (which is included in the total area considered for the module).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further optimizations could be done by reducing the interconnect distance between cells, which will probably have two different impacts: less area will be lost, increasing the efficiency per total area in the module and the ohmic losses at the FTO between the interconnect gap will be reduced, improving the efficiency per active area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, producing larger modules will not significantly increase the area for the margins, which would also have a positive impact on the final module performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have tested the modules under different conditions under simulated AM 1.5 G solar illumination at 1000 W m2 and cycling of temperature up to 90 °C under ambient conditions, in agreements with the standards (Supplementary Fig 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results, in Fig 5c, show an extraordinary long-term stability of  greater than 10,000 h and excellent response at elevated temperature (Supplementary Fig 17), reported here for the first time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is fair to notice that an initial increase is detected in Fig 5c in the first 500 h of the stability test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be due to concomitant effects such as light or field induced ion movement with the associated structural rearrangement, light-induced trap formation, or interfacial charge accumulation that can alter the device behaviour (and also cause the device hysteresis), at present under intense scrutiny37,43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementary Fig 18 and Supplementary Table 4 report the comparison of the JV characteristic and parameters, when the device is measured in forward and back scan direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As mentioned above, it is fair noticing that these devices show a not negligible hysteresis that is subject of ongoing investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the long stability here reported is at present the highest record value obtained for perovskite photovoltaics, surpassing with a gigantic step the results obtained so far.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: 2D/3D
