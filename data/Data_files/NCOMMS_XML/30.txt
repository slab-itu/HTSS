Genome-wide association meta-analysis identifies five modifier loci of lung disease severity in cystic fibrosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The identification of small molecules that target specific CFTR variants has ushered in a new era of treatment for cystic fibrosis (CF), yet optimal, individualized treatment of CF will require identification and targeting of disease modifiers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use genome-wide association analysis to identify genetic modifiers of CF lung disease, the primary cause of mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meta-analysis of 6,365 CF patients identifies five loci that display significant association with variation in lung disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regions on chr3q29 (MUC4/MUC20; P=3.3 × 1011), chr5p15.3 (SLC9A3; P=6.8 × 1012), chr6p21.3 (HLA Class II; P=1.2 × 108) and chrXq22-q23 (AGTR2/SLC6A14; P=1.8 × 109) contain genes of high biological relevance to CF pathophysiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fifth locus, on chr11p12-p13 (EHF/APIP; P=1.9 × 1010), was previously shown to be associated with lung disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide new insights into potential targets for modulating lung disease severity in CF.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects 70,000 individuals worldwide and is caused by loss-of-function variants in CFTR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although CF is regarded as a single-gene disorder, patients who have the same variants in CFTR exhibit substantial variation in severity of lung disease, of which  greater than 50% is explained by non-CFTR genetic variation1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identification of small molecules that target specific CFTR variants has ushered in a new era of treatment for cystic fibrosis (CF)2, but optimal individualized treatment will require identification and targeting of disease modifiers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The advent of large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and capability for imputation has made it possible to explore millions of polymorphisms in search of genetic determinants of phenotypic variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our previously reported GWAS in 3,444 CF patients led to identification of genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations with lung disease severity in an intergenic region between EHF and APIP (chr11p13), as well as several additional suggestive loci (chr6p21.3 and chrXq22-q23)3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other published candidate gene studies4, additional loci/genes have been reported to reach significance thresholds for the individual study, but many of these studies were based on relatively small sample sizes and/or limited phenotyping, and most have not been replicated, generating uncertainty as to their pathophysiological relevance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this manuscript, we have extended our study of CF gene modifiers by testing 2,921 additional patients from North America (n=1,699) and France (n=1,222).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use the same lung phenotype as in the previous GWAS (Consortium lung phenotype (KNoRMA))5, which allows for direct comparison of the lung function of CF patients irrespective of age and gender.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A meta-analysis of both imputed and genotyped variants is reported that combines data from the new subjects with the previously reported GWAS, allowing for an unprecedented sample size of 6,365 CF patients and analysis of over 8 million variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To maximize power, linear mixed models are used to allow for inclusion of CF-affected siblings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combined analysis confirms a previous genome-wide association and identifies four new loci that contain genes with high biological relevance for pathophysiology of CF lung disease.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Given the rarity of Mendelian disorders such as CF, it is not possible to accrue the large population of samples achieved for common complex traits11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The uniform genetic aetiology of Mendelian disorders can minimize phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity, and we take advantage of this uniformity to identify five genome-wide significant loci associated with the severity of lung disease in CF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite minimizing genetic heterogeneity, some residual effect of CFTR sequence variation on variation in lung function remained evident, suggesting a contributing but modest role compared to the modifiers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of the calculated beta-coefficients, the potential effect sizes of the SNPs of interest are estimated to be clinically relevant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest absolute beta-coefficient value (0.13) for SLC9A3/rs57221529 is equivalent to a change in forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1) of 190 ml (4.64% predicted) for males and 130 ml (3.98% predicted) for females based on extrapolation from 18-year-old White subjects with lung function and height both at the 50th percentile for individuals with CF13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, the smallest absolute beta-coefficient value (0.08) for AGTR2/SLC6A14/rs5952223 is equivalent to a change in FEV1 of 110 ml (2.68% predicted) for males and 80 ml (2.45% predicted) for females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The five associated loci contain genes with pathophysiological relevance for lung function in CF, and genes in these regions are expressed in lung3,15,16,17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identification of the gene or genes responsible for the modifying effect of each locus will require functional study; however, each locus contains genes of compelling biologic plausibility based on extensive understanding of CF pathophysiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MUC4 and MUC20 located at chr3q29 encode membrane-spanning tethered mucins on ciliated airway mucosal surfaces18,20,21 that contribute to the periciliary brush layer, and prevent mucus penetration into the periciliary space22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, MUC4 and MUC20 are present in airway mucus, reflecting secretion and/or shedding from the airway epithelium18, and likely play a role in mucociliary host defense.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SLC9A3 on chr5 is the cation proton antiporter 3 (NHE3) involved in pH regulation and epithelial ion transport23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockout of SLC9A3 alleviated intestinal obstruction commonly observed in the mouse model of CF25, and a subsequent hypothesis-driven genome-wide association study identified SLC9A3 as a modifier of neonatal intestinal obstruction in humans with CF26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Candidate gene studies in the Canadian pediatric CF population have shown SLC9A3 to be pleiotropic for disease severity in multiple affected organs17,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The broadness of the associated region does not exclude EXOC3 (telomeric, and just downstream of SLC9A3), a component of the exocyst complex that is involved in post Golgi trafficking and specification of membrane surfaces, including those in epithelial cells28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, the two more centromeric genes, CEP72 and TPPP, have been implicated in microtubule function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microtubule disturbance has been reported in CF cells29 and a microtubule-associated gene, DCTN4 has been implicated in a CF-lung related phenotype of onset of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) infection30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HLA Class II region on chr6 has been associated with asthma, variation in lung function in the non-CF populations, and CF lung disease19,31,32, along with susceptibility to allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis33,34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, HLA Class II pathways have been recently associated with CF lung disease and age-of-onset of persistent P. aeruginosa in a large gene expression association study36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chrX locus contains AGTR2 and SLC6A14 and either gene, or possibly both, could modify lung disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AGTR2, the angiotension type II receptor, has been implicated in a variety of pulmonary functions including mediating signalling in lung fibrosis15, regulating nitric oxide synthase expression in pulmonary endothelium37, and has recently been described as a therapeutic target for lung inflammation38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SLC6A14 encodes an amino-acid transporter and variants in its 5-regulatory region have been reported to modify risk for neonatal intestinal obstruction26, lung disease severity, and age at first P. aeruginosa infection in individuals with CF under 18 years of age17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chr11 locus containing EHF and APIP was reported to be associated with CF lung disease in p.Phe508del homozygotes in an earlier GWAS3 and this association persists in this report.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This EHF transcription factor is reported to modify the CF phenotype by influencing p.Phe508del processing16, and to modulate epithelial tight junctions and wound repair39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  APIP is a methionine salvage pathway enzyme known to be associated with both apoptosis and systemic inflammatory responses40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examination of the most significantly associated GWAS SNPs revealed eQTLs for genes at the HLA Class II locus (DRB1 and DRB5) and APIP (chr11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are congruent with lung disease severity being mediated through differential gene expression (eQTLs), but additional studies will be required to clarify this possibility for each locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Collectively, this study suggests new mechanistic insight into ameliorating lung disease progression in individuals with CF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional analysis of associated SNPs and genes at each modifier locus could identify novel targets for treating CF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, BCL11A, a key transcription factor for fetal haemoglobin expression, is a modifier of beta thalassaemia and sickle cell disease42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identification of a common variant associated with fetal haemoglobin level that alters BCL11A expression provides a therapeutic rationale for targeting this modifier of haemoglobinopathies44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evolving paradigm for individualized therapy in CF involves small molecules targeting specific CFTR variants2,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discovery of modifier loci that are strongly associated with severity of CF lung disease provides an opportunity to enhance individualized treatment in CF.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

each subgroup analysis, we included sex and significant principal components (based on the TracyWidom statistic P less_than 0.05) as covariates in the association models for each SNP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SNP was coded additively in the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SNP-specific beta coefficient and s.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  from each subgroup analysis were used as input for the meta-analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome-wide significance was defined (P1.25 × 108)49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Alternate study design', 'Subjects were divided into two pools to evaluate our results using a replication-based study design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The North American subjects (n=5,143) constituted a Discovery sample and the French subjects (n=1,222) served as a Replication sample, a strategy employed in a prior publication3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under this design, four of the five loci (chr3q29, chr5p15, chr6p21, and chr11p12-p13) achieved genome-wide significance (P less_than 5 × 108)49 in the North American sample with independent replication in the French subjects (P=8.7 × 105, 0.003, 0.054 and 0.003, respectively; Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AGTR2/SLC6A14 locus achieved suggestive evidence of association in the North American cohort (P=9.8 × 107) with compelling evidence of replication in the French subjects (1.8 × 104).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that one locus (chr11p12-p13) had previously achieved genome-wide significance in the discovery sample and replication sample in a study of North American subjects3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current study, the EHF/APIP locus retains genome-wide significance in subjects from North America and the association is replicated in the 1,222 French subjects (P=0.003).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'CFTR gene-based testing', 'To assess whether variability in lung disease is associated with CFTR genotype within our sample of individuals with severe (pancreatic insufficient) mutations, we used gene-based association analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From our imputed SNP set, there were 539 SNPs annotated to CFTR (+/ 10 kb).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We constructed a gene-based test statistic in the maximal set of unrelated individuals in each of the 13 subgroups (n=5,762), and restricted to this unrelated set for ease of permutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compute the gene-based test statistic, we obtained residuals by regressing the Consortium lung phenotype (KNoRMA) and each SNP genotype on the principal components and sex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The association test statistic between the residualized phenotype and residualized SNP was computed, squared and then summed across the 539 SNPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used permutation to obtain subgroup-specific permuted statistics, permuting the residualized phenotype 10,000 times to obtain 10,000 gene-based sum statistics under the null hypothesis of no association to obtain P values for each subgroup, which preserves the linkage disequilibrium structure in the region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The P value was calculated as the proportion of sum statistics from the 10,000 permutations that were more extreme than the observed CFTR sum statistic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stouffers Z-score method was used to combine P values from each subgroup and weight them by their respective sample sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Phenotype variation attributable to association', 'To estimate the proportion of variability in Consortium lung phenotype that is explained by our five significant regions, we conducted an association analysis using the maximum set of unrelated individuals in each subgroup, using the five SNPs from Table 2 in the regression model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then we calculated an average r2, weighted by sample size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'eQTL assessment for most significantly associated GWAS SNPs', 'We searched for eQTLs for the top-ranked SNP in each of five loci, and for local SNPs in r2 (LD) greater than 0.6 with the top-ranked GWAS SNPs, using three publicly available databases (Genotype-Tissue Expression, GTEx, lung and whole blood; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill seeQTL, HapMap LCL and Zeller monocyte; University of Chicago SNP and CNV Annotation Database, SCAN, HapMap CEU LCL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes and transcripts within 100 kb of the top-ranked SNPs in five loci were included.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results are presented as

literature search was conducted to identify previously published reports of variants associated with some aspect of pulmonary function with a significance value of P less_than 0.05, from association testing in a regression model, (Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gene suggested as likely responsible for the associations was identified, and the chromosome on which it resides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For SNPs, the rs number was identified, along with other nomenclature (aliases) for the variant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A variety of phenotyping methods had been used in these studies, ranging from X-ray and clinical scores to objective measures of lung function, both cross-sectional and longitudinal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The associating phenotypes are summarized under Phenotypes Tested and the
