Current rates and mechanisms of subsea permafrost degradation in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The rates of subsea permafrost degradation and occurrence of gas-migration pathways are key factors controlling the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) methane (CH4) emissions, yet these factors still require assessment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is thought that after inundation, permafrost-degradation rates would decrease over time and submerged thaw-lake taliks would freeze; therefore, no CH4 release would occur for millennia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present results of the first comprehensive scientific re-drilling to show that subsea permafrost in the near-shore zone of the ESAS has a downward movement of the ice-bonded permafrost table of 14 cm year1 over the past 3132 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data reveal polygonal thermokarst patterns on the seafloor and gas-migration associated with submerged taliks, ice scouring and pockmarks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knowing the rate and mechanisms of subsea permafrost degradation is a prerequisite to meaningful predictions of near-future CH4 release in the Arctic.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Arctic coastal zone permafrost (ground that remains 0 °C for 2 year) developed when the Northern Hemisphere cooled 2.5 Myr ago1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most subsea permafrost formed on the continental shelves when the shelves were exposed during periods of low sea level associated with times of major glacial activity2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the glaciers eventually melted, the sea level rose, which submerged this permafrost3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inundation can markedly change permafrost properties because the permafrost is warmed by as much as 17 °C by the overlying seawater4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following factors were suggested to determine the evolution of subsea permafrost after inundation: duration of submergence compared with the duration of previous exposure above the sea surface; thermal state and thickness of permafrost before inundation; coastal morphology and hydro- and lithodynamics; shoreline configuration and retreat rate; pre-existing thermokarst (that is, the process by which characteristic landforms result from the thawing of ice-rich permafrost or the melting of massive ice) accompanied by formation of thaw lakes; bottom water temperature and salinity; and sediment composition, including ice content5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Warming of the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) began 1213 thousand years (kyr) ago when the entire shelf area was exposed above sea level, forming a major fraction of the coastal plain7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By the time of inundation, numerous thaw lakes underlain by taliks had developed in that area due to thermokarst9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A talik is a layer or body of unfrozen ground in a permafrost area in which the temperature is above 0 °C due to the local thermal regime of the ground10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fate of these thermokarst-induced features in the near-shore zone, only recently inundated, has long been debated8,9,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The widely accepted hypothesis is that the  less_than 0 °C bottom seawater temperature would halt thermokarst formation and cause taliks to freeze by creating a negative temperature profile in the sediments7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no observational evidence to confirm this hypothesis has existed to date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On the contrary, some authors suggested that seawater could be transported into the sediments at sufficient rates to lower the freezing point of the sediment pore water, even in ice-bonded permafrost13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, via convective fingering, seawater transport rates could be orders of magnitude greater than heat conduction from the surface15, perhaps preventing freezing of the submerged thaw-lake taliks and, thus, causing advanced topdown permafrost degradation16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the ESAS near-shore zone is largely affected by riverine runoff, which causes the mean annual bottom seawater temperature to be  greater than 0 °C (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heat flux from large rivers can cause deep talik formation beneath riverbeds; it has been suggested that such taliks might exist below the paleo rivers18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A significant area of the ESAS is affected by paleo-river valleys19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A substantial part of submerged ESAS permafrost consists of ice complexes (ICs), which are Late Pleistocene ice-rich syncryogenic deposits with massive ice wedges20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before inundation, ICs are subjected to two destructive processes: thermo-denudation (upslope permafrost retreat under the influence of insolation and heat flux on the slope) and thermo-abrasion (mechanically and thermally caused retreat of exposed permafrost due to seawater and wind erosion)22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some authors believe that after ICs are submerged, they are subjected to thermo-abrasion and chemical- and current-induced seafloor erosion, to list a few such destructive processes24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Permafrost-degradation rates could be evaluated by assessing changes in the ice-bonded permafrost table (IBPT) position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The position of the IBPT in the ESAS has been investigated using seismic techniques26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there are problems with high attenuation of the reflected seismic signal where sediments contain gas28 and/or reflect variability in permafrost properties29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Methods based on electrical properties of frozen/unfrozen ground were shown to be applicable in shallow coastal waters31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Poor knowledge of the physical and chemical processes occurring within subsea permafrost, combined with a lack of observational data for model calibration, restricts further progress in modelling the current state of subsea permafrost and associated methane (CH4) releases in the ESAS16,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is, therefore, necessary to conduct comprehensive geocryological investigations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This study aimed to document subsea permafrost-degradation rates after submergence by directly studying frozen ground samples recovered from drilled boreholes, and interpreting geophysical data collected during repeated observations in the study area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of results of first comprehensive scientific re-drilling investigation of subsea permafrost in the ESAS, here we present observation-based demonstration of thawing of subsea permafrost resolved over decadal scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interpretation of geophysical data calibrated by drilling allows resolving on inter-annual scale upward migration of shallow gas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that thermokarst occurs after inundation, submerged thaw lakes not always freeze and could serve as gas-migration paths, and ice scouring serves as important mechanism of permafrost disturbance associated with gas releases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knowing the rate and mechanisms of subsea permafrost degradation is a prerequisite to meaningful predictions of near-future CH4 release on the Arctic shelf.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The stability of subsea permafrost underlying the ESAS near-shore zone is a key to whether pre-formed CH4 escapes from seabed reservoirs, or whether CH4 release is fuelled by modern methanogenesis occurring in recently-accumulated Holocene sediments and/or in thawed top permafrost layers48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knowledge about the processes responsible for permafrost degradation after submergence by seawater was until recently mainly based on modelling results5,7,9,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three major assumptions were used to predict the current ESAS subsea permafrost state: (1) it degrades only upwards (bottom-up); (2) submerged near-shore zone thaw-lake taliks freeze after inundation; and (3) permafrost consists of non-saline sediments, thus the phase transition temperature is 0 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These factors combined would make permafrost to remain stable after submergence by seawater and to keep its integrity down to a few hundred metres, which would exclude any mass transfer including gas release8,9,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'When the ESAS was exposed above sea level in cold-climate epochs, permafrost and permafrost-related hydrate deposits formed under very low temperatures50,51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After inundation, the bottom seawater temperature is only slightly  less_than 0 °C that is by up to 17 °C warmer than before inundation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Warming causes destabilization of subsea permafrost and permafrost-associated hydrates release some fraction of CH4 as free gas5,9,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because conversion of hydrates to free gas greatly increases the gas volume (by 200 times), accumulations of over-pressured gas tend to move upwards where sediment permeability allows this to occur, or where gas-migration pathways, such as taliks, are available16,53,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerous gas blowouts followed by long-lasting gas flow have been reported from permafrost areas disturbed by exploratory drilling in Siberia, both on-land and offshore3,22,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such gas blowouts were reported from shallow permafrost-related gas-hydrate accumulations at depths of only a few tens of metres, starting from 20 m depth55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Offshore, a particularly powerful gas discharge erupting from a well drilled through the subsea permafrost was documented in the Pechora Sea shelf; a gaswater fountain originating from 50 m beneath the sediment surface in 64 m-deep water reached 10 m above the ship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Echo sounding carried out at the drilling site 10 days after this event revealed an underwater fountain 10 m in diameter, with a height 40 m above the sea floor56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the 1960s, gas was sampled from another blowout in the Yana River fore-delta at the Laptev Sea edge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemical analysis revealed high CH4 content (38.6%) in the sampled gas accompanied by significant helium and argon amounts, indicative of the deep origin of this gas56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another document describes a blue burning gas flame observed on the water surface after sea ice in the DLS was demolished for navigation purposes57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It was suggested by modelling that the time required for complete destabilization, according to modelling results, is 57 kyr, depending on time since inundation relative to previous freezing duration4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recent studies show that in some areas very recently ( less_than  less_than 1 kyr ago) submerged permafrost is close to or has already reached the thaw point17,58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a series of Pleistocene ocean transgressions and regressions, permafrost in the near-shore ESAS zone was suggested to have experienced an alternation of freezing and thawing, in consequence storing within it a large amount of hypersaline brines (called cryopegs)21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Salt from these accumulations is an effective corrosive factor that not only chemically disintegrates permafrost, but also alters its physical properties by decreasing its thaw point13,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Downward propagation of salt ions from seawater and cryopegs could allow permafrost to remain ice-bearing or ice-free at temperatures  less_than 0 °C (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Salt redistribution and downward movement could occur at speeds of at least 2 cm d1 (refs 14, 59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Salt rejected during freezing is transported into the thawed region by a convective mechanism, which is probably gravity-driven convection by salt fingering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was shown experimentally that salt fingers could move with velocities of several centimetres per hour, and it was suggested that this could be a major mechanism for rapid salt movement in subsea permafrost15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thaw of ice wedges within the submerged ICs could result in thermokarst depressions as deep as the thickness of those ice wedges, creating taliks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, downward development of taliks, along with upward degradation of underlying permafrost caused by geothermal flux, can lead to penetration of the entire permafrost body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, coastal ICs in the near-shore zone of the ESAS could be partially or completely destroyed by heat transfer and salt intrusion, and permafrost remains could represent subsequent layers of non-mineralized and mineralized sediments, thawed/cryotic and frozen16,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One possible mechanism allowing efficient gas-migration path formation in otherwise continuous permafrost is further downward development of pre-existing thaw-lake taliks, which were submerged during sea transgression53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such thaw lakes were abundantly distributed on the Laptev Sea coastal plain; their possible interaction with the ocean has been described4,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the authors assumed that after submergence by the sea, these taliks would freeze and stop developing downwards8,9,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data show that this may not always be true.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Submerged taliks may keep developing downwards; we likely observed this in the DLS (Laptev Sea).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When DLS areas were exposed, ICs reached 50 m in thickness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When natural warming over this area started 15 kyr ago, thermokarst processes began to destroy ICs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because ICs primarily consist of monolithic, wedge-like ice with ground material inclusions, when thermokarst starts it first destroys ice wedges in the IC structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The permafrost thermal state is not the sole critical determinant of permafrost permeability for gas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even ice-bonded permafrost is gas-permeable, especially when gas is over-pressured to enable it to build its own gas-migration pathways (like gas chimneys)60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One such possibility by which submerged thaw-lake taliks could serve as gas-migration paths is via a pingo-like structure, which might form through the taliks61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Summarizing our results, we suggest that subsea permafrost degradation in the near-shore zone of the ESAS is determined by a combination of heat/salt-transfer and erosional processes, including thermokarst and collapse of submerged ICs, which is specific for the near-shore ESAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seafloor erosion could start from initial ground ice melt followed by formation of a polygonal form of seafloor landscape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It could further, or in parallel, be affected by chemical erosion caused by salt penetration into the frozen ground followed by removal of eroded material by bottom currents in the near-shore ESAS zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Development of taliks of different origin could lead to formation of vertical erosion channels, helping gas fronts to propagate upwards towards the seafloor; otherwise, gas fronts tend to dome up towards the seafloor only at morphologic highs and/or at gas collector fronts and sides62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, ice scouring could unroof upper sediment layers, opening gas-migration pathways for underlying gas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting gas release from underlying gas accumulations causes formation of ubiquitously observed pockmarks and other signs of sediment erosion and associated sediment settlement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This area is strongly affected by Laptev Sea Rifts, which consist of several deep, seismically subsided and tectonically active rift basins45,63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Lena River and coastal erosion are considered the main sediment sources to the Laptev Sea; sedimentation flow varies significantly, and sedimentation rates vary by orders of spatial and temporal magnitude through the year34,35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pulsatile flow associated with spring ice breakup and after-breakup flooding causes progressive erosion of floodplain deposits and catchment areas64,65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was shown that slight changes in seafloor erosion and sedimentation patterns that change the thermal and pressure regime below the seafloor could be viable mechanisms for unroofing underlying gas reservoirs, which can release CH4 in large quantities66.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once initiated, erosion could propagate further downward and migrate laterally to adjacent areas, driven by venting gas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Erosion of a few tens of seafloor metres could unroof over-pressured shallow gas reservoirs and buoyant hydrate-laden sediment accumulations beneath the seafloor, triggering rapid gas release66,67.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these processes could explain why the permafrost underneath the seawater is degrading more rapidly than its terrestrial sibling in the late Holocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observational constraints on both mechanisms, and rates of thawing and degradation of subsea permafrost on the ESAS provide a foundation for predictions of the future trajectory of CH4 release from this dynamic Arctic system.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
