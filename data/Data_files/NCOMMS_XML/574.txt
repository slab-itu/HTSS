Bimodal antagonism of PKA signalling by ARHGAP36  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Protein kinase A is a key mediator of cAMP signalling downstream of G-protein-coupled receptors, a signalling pathway conserved in all eukaryotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cAMP binding to the regulatory subunits (PKAR) relieves their inhibition of the catalytic subunits (PKAC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that ARHGAP36 combines two distinct inhibitory mechanisms to antagonise PKA signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, it blocks PKAC activity via a pseudosubstrate motif, akin to the mechanism employed by the protein kinase inhibitor proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, it targets PKAC for rapid ubiquitin-mediated lysosomal degradation, a pathway usually reserved for transmembrane receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ARHGAP36 thus dampens the sensitivity of cells to cAMP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that PKA inhibition by ARHGAP36 promotes derepression of the Hedgehog signalling pathway, thereby providing a simple rationale for the upregulation of ARHGAP36 in medulloblastoma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work reveals a new layer of PKA regulation that may play an important role in development and disease.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Protein kinase A (PKA) is a widely expressed serine/threonine kinase regulating essential cellular processes important in development, metabolism, memory formation and proliferation1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inactive tetrameric holoenzyme comprises a dimer of regulatory subunits (PKAR), each of which binds a catalytic subunit (PKAC) in its active-site cleft, thereby blocking kinase activity and access to substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PKA activation occurs on binding of cyclic AMP (cAMP) to PKAR, causing the release of PKAC and thus allowing phosphorylation of numerous downstream proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Misregulated PKA signalling is linked to various human diseases and recent studies have identified pathway-activating mutations in both PKAR and PKAC as well as in other upstream components in a number of cancers2,3,4,5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since PKA regulates a myriad of cellular responses, precise spatiotemporal control is required to ensure its signalling specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A-kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) bind PKAR and target the holoenzyme to distinct subcellular compartments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AKAPs serve as scaffolds to place PKA in the vicinity of specific substrates together with phosphodiesterases, phosphatases or components of wider signalling networks, thereby providing tailored cAMP signalling units9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, PKA activity can be negatively regulated by a family of small, heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) proteins, each containing a pseudosubstrate motif by which they bind PKAC with high affinity11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, cAMP-dependent proteasomal degradation of PKAR can positively modulate PKA activity by increasing the pool of free PKAC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism facilitates long-term memory formation12 and involves the E3 ubiquitin ligase Praja2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ubiquitin-mediated degradation of PKAC has so far not been described, although regulated proteolysis is a common mechanism for downregulating activated protein kinases14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report the identification of the Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) family member ARHGAP36 as a potent antagonist of PKA signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ARHGAP36 is not only a PKA pseudosubstrate inhibitor but also targets PKAC for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly for a cytosolic protein, PKAC degradation is not mediated by the proteasome but by the endolysosomal system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pathway typically mediates degradation of activated receptor tyrosine kinases16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ARHGAP36 has previously been shown to activate the Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway and is upregulated in a subset of medulloblastoma, suggesting an important role in tumourigenesis18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PKA is a master negative regulator of the Hh pathway19,20, therefore PKA inhibition by ARHGAP36 provides a straightforward mechanism for this observation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study thus defines a new paradigm for negative PKA regulation with implications in health and disease.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'ARHGAP36 interacts with PKAC', 'In a systematic mass spectrometric (MS) analysis of the Rho GTPase regulatory proteins, we identified ARHGAP36 as a new binding partner of PKAC (O.R., manuscript in preparation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ARHGAP36 has five annotated isoforms with molecular masses between 46 and 61 kDa, which vary only in their extreme N-terminal portion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All contain an arginine-rich region followed by a RhoGAP domain (Fig 1a;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We here report the identification of ARHGAP36 as a potent PKA antagonist, employing two different inhibitory mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peptide spot mapping, point mutagenesis, ITC and activity assays revealed that ARHGAP36 directly binds to PKAC via a pseudosubstrate motif by which it blocks PKA activity with potency comparable to the PKI proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, it mediates the ubiquitylation of PKAC and targets it for endolysosomal degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, PKA signalling is suppressed in the presence of ARHGAP36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the first report of ubiquitylation-dependent downregulation of PKAC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many other kinases are known to be subject to regulated proteolysis as an efficient means of signal termination14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our surprise, ARHGAP36 targets PKAC not to the proteasome, the default pathway for the downregulation of cytosolic proteins, but for endolysosomal degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pathway typically processes endocytosed transmembrane receptors, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor14,15,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To our knowledge, only one other cytosolic kinase, GSK3, has been reported to be incorporated into the endolysosomal system in an ESCRT-dependent manner46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In response to sustained Wnt stimulus, GSK3 is sequestered into MVBs away from its cytosolic substrates, in particular ß-catenin, which is otherwise constitutively turned over.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, both the mechanism by which GSK3 is targeted to MVBs and its subsequent fate are unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to PKAC in the present study, GSK3 has not been reported to be ubiquitylated and thus the mechanism by which GSK3 engages with the ESCRT machinery remains unresolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ARHGAP36 appears to be partially incorporated into the lumen of Rab5 Q79L enlarged endosomes together with PKAC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The endosomal E3 ligase and multi-subunit adaptor protein CBL has also been seen to translocate with cargo into the internal vesicles of MVBs47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the bulk of overexpressed ARHGAP36 does not seem to be degraded, as total protein levels do not change, even on cycloheximide treatment (Fig 6f,h; Supplementary Fig 5c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While we have so far failed to identify the E3 ligase mediating PKAC ubiquitylation, we show the strict requirement of a single ubiquitylation site (K285) in the Vps4-dependent incorporation of PKAC into MVBs and its subsequent rapid and efficient degradation in lysosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, GSK3 is also subject to a bimodal negative regulation in that its kinase activity is initially inhibited by binding to the intracellular domain of the LRP6 receptor on Wnt stimulation48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work raises the question whether endolysosomal degradation of cytosolic signalling proteins represents a more general mechanism for effective long-term signal termination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Entry into this pathway may be facilitated by a membrane-associated interaction partner that can mediate access to endocytic sorting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In contrast to PKAC, PKAR has been shown to be degraded by the proteasome, during the establishment of long-term synaptic plasticity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resultant change in PKAR/PKAC ratios causes persistent PKAC signalling that is uncoupled from cAMP levels12,13, the spatial separation of PKAR and PKAC degradation may be important in such a mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that PKAC is less amenable to unfolding by the AAA-ATPases of the proteasomal regulatory particle, which is a prerequisite for entry into the core particle and thus degradation50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, ARHGAP36-mediated endolysosomal degradation of PKAC may provide a mechanism for timely inactivation and selective degradation of a restricted pool of PKAC, thus contributing to the compartmentalization of PKA signalling responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Localized regulation of PKAC may also explain why the phosphorylation status of the nuclear substrate CREB is unchanged on depletion of ARHGAP36 in CLB-GA cells: in these cells ARHGAP36 is predominantly localized to endosomal membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'ARHGAP36 further extends the repertoire of PKA regulators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas modulation of PKA enzymatic activity is generally centred on PKAR, ARHGAP36 directly binds to PKAC and uncouples it from upstream control via PKAR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dual-mode PKAC inhibition by ARHGAP36, pseudosubstrate binding and subsequent degradation, ensures both immediate and sustained negative control of PKA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dependent on the context this could operate in a constitutive manner: ARHGAP36 may serve as a tonic suppressor of PKA to profoundly dampen the sensitivity of certain tissues to cAMP-releasing stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It could also oppose basal PKA activation through cAMP-independent mechanisms in the absence of stimulus, particularly in settings with stoichiometric excess of free PKAC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compensatory mechanisms have been proposed to balance the relative PKAR/PKAC expression levels to preserve proper responsiveness of the PKA holoenzyme to cAMP51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ARHGAP36 may participate in such a regulation by providing additional buffering capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We observed temporally restricted expression of Arhgap36 in skeletal muscles during mouse embryonic development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fittingly, expression profiling identified Arhgap36 (RIKEN cDNA 1100001E04) as a major target gene of the myogenic transcription factor MyoG53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ARHGAP36 may also antagonise PKA in other select tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is tempting to speculate that it is expressed in contexts where additional safeguard mechanisms are needed to ensure tight control of PKA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future gene targeting studies in mice will reveal the details of such tissue-specific PKA desensitization and thus the role of ARHGAP36 in development and homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Since ARHGAP36 is a strong suppressor of PKA signalling, it is conceivable that aberrant ARHGAP36 expression is implicated in disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will be interesting to further explore the role of ARHGAP36 and PKA in neuroblastoma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In human medulloblastoma, upregulated ARHGAP36 has been linked to its ability to activate Hh signalling in a Smoothened-independent manner18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work strongly suggests that this ARHGAP36-dependent oncogenic pathway activation is via inhibition of PKAC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ARHGAP36 is also found to be upregulated in human pheochromocytomas, a neuroendocrine tumour arising from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deregulated PKA signalling due to mutations in the cAMP/PKA axis is associated with numerous other diseases, such as Cushings syndrome, hepatocellular carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, Carney complex and McCuneAlbright syndrome2,3,4,5,6,7,8,55,56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dependent on the signalling context in which PKA functions, aberrant ARHGAP36 expression could have both tumour suppressive and oncogenic roles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, our data indicate that ARHGAP36-mediated PKAC inhibition and downregulation is a potent shutdown mechanism to efficiently suppress PKA-dependent cellular responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism involves the unexpected uptake of cytosolic PKAC into the endolysosomal system for subsequent degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work extends the molecular map of the regulatory circuitry controlling the highly conserved cAMP signalling pathway and provides new insights into its dysregulation in human disease.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
