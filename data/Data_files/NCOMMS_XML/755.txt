Sixfold improved single particle measurement of the magnetic moment of the antiproton  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our current understanding of the Universe comes, among others, from particle physics and cosmology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particle physics an almost perfect symmetry between matter and antimatter exists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On cosmological scales, however, a striking matter/antimatter imbalance is observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This contradiction inspires comparisons of the fundamental properties of particles and antiparticles with high precision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report on a measurement of the g-factor of the antiproton with a fractional precision of 0.8 parts per million at 95% confidence level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our value /2=2.7928465(23) outperforms the previous best measurement by a factor of 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result is consistent with our proton g-factor measurement gp/2=2.792847350(9), and therefore agrees with the fundamental charge, parity, time (CPT) invariance of the Standard Model of particle physics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, our result improves coefficients of the standard model extension which discusses the sensitivity of experiments with respect to CPT violation by up to a factor of 20.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Precise tests of charge, parity, time (CPT) invariance1 are inspired by the intriguing lack of antimatter in our Universe2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite its importance to our understanding of nature, only a few direct precise tests of CPT symmetry are available3,4,5,6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experiments contribute such tests by comparing the fundamental properties of protons and antiprotons with high precision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently we performed the most precise comparison of the antiproton-to-proton charge-to-mass ratio /(q/m)p with a fractional precision of 69 parts per trillion10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report an improved measurement of the magnetic moment of the antiproton .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our comparisons are based on frequency measurements of single particles in cryogenic Penning traps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These traps employ the superposition of a strong magnetic field B0 in the axial direction and an electrostatic quadrupole potential11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under such conditions, a trapped charged particle follows a stable trajectory consisting of three independent harmonic oscillator motionsthe modified cyclotron frequency +, the magnetron frequency , and the axial frequency z. Non-destructive measurements of these frequencies12 enable the determination of the cyclotron frequency  (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with a determination of the spin-precession, or Larmor frequency L, the magnetic moment  can be determined in units of the nuclear magneton N, where  is the g-factor of the particle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The determination of the Larmor frequency relies on the detection of resonantly driven spin transitions by means of the continuous Stern-Gerlach effect14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An axial magnetic field Bz=B2(z22/2) is superimposed on the homogeneous magnetic field B0 of the trap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This magnetic bottle couples the spin magnetic moment to the axial oscillation frequency z of the particle, which is directly accessible by measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a spin-flip takes place, z is shifted by .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This technique has been applied in electron/positron magnetic moment measurements (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3), however, its application to measure the magnetic moments of the proton/antiproton15,16 is much more challenging, since .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, to resolve single antiproton spin transitions an ultra-strong magnetic bottle is needed, we use B2=2.88·105 T m2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this article we report a direct measurement of the g-factor of a single antiproton, with a fractional precision of 0.8 p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our result is based on six individual g-factor measurements and is 6 times more precise than the current best value15.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Experimental set-up', 'The experiment16 is located at the antiproton decelerator (AD)17 facility of CERN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We operate a cryogenic multi-Penning trap system, see Fig 1a, which is mounted in the horizontal bore of a superconducting magnet with field strength B0=1.945 T. Each Penning trap consists of a set of five cylindrical gold-plated electrodes in a carefully chosen geometry18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The individual traps are interconnected by transport electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Application of voltage ramps to these electrodes enables adiabatic shuttling of the particles between the traps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resonant superconducting tuned circuits with high quality factors Q (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19) and effective temperatures of 8 K connected to specific electrodes enable resistive particle-cooling, non-destructive detection12 and measurements of the oscillation frequencies of the trapped antiprotons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Experimental set-up and resonances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic of the Penning trap set-up used in the BASE
