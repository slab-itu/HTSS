Optimal bioenergy power generation for climate change mitigation with or without carbon sequestration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Restricting global warming below 2 °C to avoid catastrophic climate change will require atmospheric carbon dioxide removal (CDR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current integrated assessment models (IAMs) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios assume that CDR within the energy sector would be delivered using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although bioenergy-biochar systems (BEBCS) can also deliver CDR, they are not included in any IPCC scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that despite BECCS offering twice the carbon sequestration and bioenergy per unit biomass, BEBCS may allow earlier deployment of CDR at lower carbon prices when long-term improvements in soil fertility offset biochar production costs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At carbon prices above $1,000 Mg1 C, BECCS is most frequently (P greater than 0.45, calculated as the fraction of Monte Carlo simulations in which BECCS is the most cost effective) the most economic biomass technology for climate-change mitigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At carbon prices below $1,000 Mg1 C, BEBCS is the most cost-effective technology only where biochar significantly improves agricultural yields, with pure bioenergy systems being otherwise preferred.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A target rise in global mean temperature of less than 2 °C has been widely advocated as necessary to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most mitigation scenarios that achieve this include widespread carbon dioxide removal (CDR) in the second half of the century to compensate for residual emissions from sectors where mitigation is costly and to recover from an overshoot of CO2 emissions3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, CDR is critical to achieving climate stabilization within safe limits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hopes for CDR have largely been pinned on the extensive deployment of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), which is the only negative emissions technology included in the mitigation scenarios of the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fifth Assessment Report3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BECCS achieves a net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere by relying on photosynthesis to fix CO2 and interrupting the natural carbon cycle that would otherwise have rapidly returned this carbon to the atmosphere during respiration or combustion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, BECCS sequesters the photosynthetically fixed carbon as post-combustion CO2 stored in a stable reservoir4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, BECCS may be costly and parts of the technology are unproven6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An alternative CDR approach is biochar (BC), in which biomass is pyrolysed and the carbon-rich residue sequestered in soil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BC, like BECCS, relies on photosynthesis to fix CO2, followed by storage of this fixed carbon in a stable reservoir (in this case, soil).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a co-benefit, BC can improve the fertility of degraded or less fertile soils7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also possible to co-produce bioenergy with BC in a bioenergy-biochar system (BEBCS)10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Within any mitigation scenario, BECCS and BEBCS must compete for available biomasswith each other and also with pure bioenergy systems (BES), which can also reduce energy-sector carbon emissions by offsetting more carbon intensive energy resources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of these technologies has advantages and disadvantages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BES generates the greatest bioenergy per unit biomass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BECCS sequesters the largest fraction of biomass carbon, but generates less energy than BES at a higher cost13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BEBCS produces the least energy and sequesters less carbon than BECCS7,10,13,15, but it can enhance soil fertility16,17, return nutrients to soil (although nitrogen may be largely lost or inaccessible to plants after pyrolysis), and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from soils16,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These BEBCS co-benefits potentially offset some of the cost of its CDR, and simultaneously address issues of food security for a growing world population19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BC can also increase or decrease the turnover rate of native soil organic carbon (SOC)20,21,22,23, which would create a negative or positive feedback, respectively, on the amount of carbon sequestered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BEBCS also has additional costs associated with haulage, handling and tillage of BC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Under which, if any, set of biophysical and economic conditions BEBCS becomes more attractive relative to both BES and BECCS has not been previously investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We address this issue here by developing a multi-parameter model to determine which of BES, BECCS, or BEBCS is the more economically efficient use of a given biomass resource for climate-change mitigation under varying conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A multivariate Monte Carlo analysis was conducted using a broad range of parameter related to agro-ecological, economic, technological, global spatial and temporal variability and uncertainty to 2100.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that, despite BECCS offering twice the carbon sequestration and bioenergy per unit biomass, BEBCS may allow earlier deployment of CDR at lower carbon prices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model predicts that, at carbon prices above $1,000 Mg1 C, BECCS is typically the most economic biomass technology for climate-change mitigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At carbon prices below $1,000 Mg1 C, BEBCS is the most cost-effective technology only where BC significantly improves agricultural yields, with pure BES being otherwise preferred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we have shown that BEBCS can be competitive with both BES and BECCS under a range of conditions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Impact of carbon price on optimal technology', 'Biomass supply chains are highly heterogeneous, with costs and emissions varying geospatially and temporally with species, production conditions, and harvest, collection and storage practices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To facilitate comparison of biomass conversion technologies across this diverse landscape of feedstock supply chains, the analysis was based on a functional unit of mass of biomass delivered to the conversion facility gate, assuming that all costs and emissions associated with delivering that biomass are independent of the conversion technology used to process it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each of the conversion technologies (BES, BECCS or BEBCS), we define its relative net present value (RPV) as the difference between its net present value (NPV) and the NPV of the best alternative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By making comparisons on the basis of RPV per unit biomass, all costs, benefits and emissions associated with biomass supply cancel out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a given biomass supply chain, we thus calculate which of the technologies is most economically efficient relative to the alternatives under given conditions, with the caveat that this approach does not determine when biomass price or environmental externalities would make none of the bioenergy conversion processes viable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A full description of the calculation of RPV is provided in Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'At carbon prices below $460 Mg1 C, BES has the highest mean NPV (range where BES mean RPV greater than 0 in Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For carbon prices in the range of $460$900 Mg1 C, BEBCS has the highest mean NPV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Above $900 Mg1 C, BECCS has the highest mean NPV (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Relative present value as a function of carbon price.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Shows the relative present value (RPV) and (b) shows the probability of having the highest RPV, as a function of carbon price, for bioenergy systems (BES; cyan line), bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS; orange line) and bioenergy-biochar systems (BEBCS; purple line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shading indicates one s.d..

BECCS is typically the technology with highest NPV in the higher carbon-price range ( greater than $1,000 Mg1 C), even with carbon prices as high as $3,000 Mg1 C BEBCs remains the most economic

'The highest ranked parameters, in order of their importance as determinants of BEBCS RPV are electricity price, BCs long-term impact on crop yields, carbon price and discount rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electricity price and BCs crop-yield impact are of approximately equal importance because the value of BC to crop production must offset the foregone energy production involved in its manufacture for BEBCS to be preferred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that it is the long-term impact of BC on alleviating soil constraints to crop yields that is critical to its economic value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BC is most likely to have a long-term positive impact on crop production in soils with low cation exchange capacity (CEC) (Methods: crop yield impacts of BC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While BC can also improve crop yields through ephemeral mechanisms such as fertilization (when BC contains plant-available nutrients) or raising the pH of acidic soils, these mechanisms have lower economic value, because their impact diminishes rapidly over time (Methods: value of BCs liming potential to address soil pH constraints, and value of BCs nutrient content).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The next most important determinant of BEBCS RPV was the persistence or stability of BC in soil (Methods: BC decomposition, and Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The ranking order of most important parameters differed slightly for BES and BECCS, in which cases carbon price ranked highest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carbon price is more important for BES and BECCS, because it is the primary factor in determining which of these two is more cost effective, with low (high) carbon prices favouring BES (BECCS), with other factors altering the balance between them in the intermediate price range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BEBCS, on the other hand, is slightly less sensitive to carbon price than BES or BECCS, because it has an additional major value streamits crop yield impactthat is independent of carbon pricing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Discount rate ranks highly because of its differential impact on the various technologies, with BC continuing to accrue benefits gradually over time after it has been produced (due to its impacts on soil fertility and soil GHG emissions), whereas the revenue streams from BES and BECCS (energy production and carbon sequestration) are valued at time of production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Plotting the RPVs and the highest-ranked parameters on a parallel coordinates plot (Fig 3) provides a useful visual indication of the typical conditions in which the RPV of each technology is maximized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each line on the parallel coordinates plot corresponds to a single point in the multi-dimensional parameter space, with lines connecting the values for each parameter on their respective (parallel) axes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each parallel parameter axis is normalized to range from the minimum to the maximum value of that parameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, it can be seen that a high RPV for BECCS (Fig 3, orange lines) correlates with high carbon and electricity prices (evident in the clustering of orange lines at the upper end on these parameter axes), whereas the opposite conditions favour BEBCS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When interpreting such plots, however, care must be taken to consider covariance between parameters, which can give rise to correlations that are not causal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, it can be seen in Fig 3 that large increases in crop price correlate with a high RPV for BECCS, despite the fact that high crop prices would favour BEBCS rather than BECCS if all else remained equal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But, the time factor in the model means that crop prices rise over time (Methods: future food price trends), while other factors that improve the competitiveness of BECCS also increase with time and thus co-vary with crop prices without any causal link.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Parallel coordinates plot of the relative net present values as a function of the

conditions that favour BES relative to BEBCS (the primary competing technology at the carbon prices prevailing in 20202050 even under the more stringent mitigation scenario MS430480).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

By 2050 in MS430480, lower than average carbon prices (0.4 ) (as carbon prices start to move into a range where BECCS is optimal under favourable conditions) and above average carbon intensity of the

of factors are all seen, including a high carbon intensity (+1.6 ), low carbon prices (1.5 ), high cost of carbon capture and storage (+1.6 ), and a low fraction of CO2 being sequestered by BECCS

conditions that require a very low cost for carbon dioxide capture and sequestration (CCS) (1.6 ), low BC yield impact (1.0 ), and high carbon prices (+0.7 ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For BECCS to be competitive in 2050 in the more ambitious mitigation scenario MS430480 requires that a combination of factors improve its performance relative to both BES and BEBCS simultaneously, both of which are also viable technologies under a wide range of conditions at that time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This requires some combination of low BC yield impact (0.6 ), high carbon price (+0.3 ), low CCS cost (0.8 ) and

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our results show that the availability and inclusion of BEBCS within a portfolio of climate-mitigation measures can reduce the costs and ease the implementation of long-term CDR strategies using biomass, because BEBCS can be significantly cheaper than BECCS when agronomic benefits offset costs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduced cost of CDR using BEBCS, relative to an energy supply portfolio in which BECCS is the only negative emissions technology, may allow for earlier CDR deployment at a lower carbon price than in scenarios without BEBCS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'However, long-term improvements in soil productivity from BC applications are required for BEBCS to become competitive with either BES or BECCS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that an integrated portfolio of BECCS plus BEBCS would maximize the economic potential for CDR, with BEBCS being preferred where long-term fertility of agricultural soils can benefit most from BC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is important to note that long-term crop trials with BC remain largely absent from the published literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 781 treatments from 68 published studies used to develop the crop response relationship for our model, 85% were measured in the first year following BC addition, 10% in the second year, 3% in the third year, 2% in the fourth year and no data were available from longer term trials in the peer-reviewed literature (Methods: Crop yield impacts of BC, Supplementary Figs 35, and Supplementary Tables 5 and 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a correlation between higher crop response and low soil CEC was found, suggesting that BC can offer long term improvement to the fertility of low CEC soils (Methods: Crop yield impacts of BC), the evidence to support this hypothesis from direct observation remains inadequate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in some studies, unfavourable changes in soil chemical, physical and biological properties and reductions in crop yields have been reported25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying crop response to BC will support the development of decision-support models that direct BC applications into systems they can most benefit, and that avoid the application of unsuitable grades of BC in cropping systems where they may do harm, while distinguishing between uncertainty and manageable variability26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, we note that there is currently low confidence and high uncertainty in the expected long-term response of specific soil-crop systems to BC amendments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the parameter ranges used in our model reflect this high level of uncertainty, it is clear that further research to provide long term data on crop response in a variety of soils, cropping systems and agroecological zones should be a pre-requisite to the widespread use of BC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further research will also be required to quantify impacts on ecosystem services and functions such as interactions with soil-dwelling and aquatic biota, nutrient cycling through ecosystems and the potential for contamination or bioaccumulation of contaminants27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Where or when BEBCS is not viable, BES (BECCS) is more often than not (that is, P greater than 0.5) the preferred option at carbon prices below (above) $660 Mg1 C. The dependence of BEBCS on beneficial soil-fertility impacts to be economically viable means that its economic potential for climate-change mitigation is likely lower than its sustainable technical potential previously reported7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BEBCS may, however, increase the total technical potential for CDR, not just because it allows for earlier deployment, but also because it may be applicable in situations where BECCS is not: for example, in locations too remote from suitable geologic or other sinks for BECCS to be economic, or in the production of carbon-negative transport biofuelsa sector not readily compatible with CO2 capture and storage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results reported here indicate that BEBCS could be a key component to reduce the costs and otherwise ease the implementation of long-term climate-mitigation strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'At present, integrated assessment models (IAMs) are the primary tool for assessing questions such as these associated with long-term stabilization scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While recognizing that it is premature to embark on a large scale deployment of BEBCS for climate-change mitigation, given the remaining uncertainties outlined above, we recommend that a useful next phase of research would be inclusion of BEBCS as a technology option in IAMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large uncertainties are routinely investigated in IAMs by the use of scenarios as a means to provide what-if analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the current uncertainty over the viability of CCS as a mitigation technology option, has been investigated in IAM simulations through the use of scenarios in which CCS either is or is not included as an option (see, for example, fig.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6.35 in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Including scenarios, both with and without BEBCS, in IAM simulations would allow for a more thorough understanding of how availability of BEBCS as a mitigation option would affect the cost, timing and technology mix of a comprehensive mitigation strategy, if increased crop yields persist in the long term.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This improved understanding will be critical to making informed decisions about how great an investment in further BC research is justified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, we have shown that, with carbon prices expected to rise over time, BEBCS could lead to earlier adoption of CDR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the converse is also possible, that BEBCS might delay adoption of BECCS until carbon prices rise sufficiently high for BECCS to become competitive with BEBCS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall impact of such interactions on overall mitigation outcomes and costs can only be assessed adequately by using IAMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A final issue is the question of the costs and impacts of biomass supply chains to support any of these technologies at a sufficient scale to make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The land area required to provide sufficient BECCS to meet the requirements of MS430480 has been estimated at 400700 Mha (two to four times the global area of abandoned or marginal land)28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These large demands on land would be expected to create competition for productive land with food, fibre, biofuels, habitat and other ecosystem services29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nutrient28,31 and water32 supply may also further constrain biomass supply potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results presented here are independent of the actual costs (economic, social and environmental) and prices of biomass supply, because we calculate only the relative value of each technology (that is, how much better or worse it is than the alternative technologies considered).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In practice, these costs and the price of biomass will be key determinants of the feasibility of any mitigation strategy that places demands on biomass supply.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At present, there is low agreement in the literature as to the scale of the biomass potential once economic, social and environmental impacts are considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Improved estimates using a systems approach that considers all these aspects in a spatially explicit manner must be a high research priority to ensure that policy decisions with possibly irreversible global implications are not based on unrealistic estimates of the biomass supply potential.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

#@NEW_LINE#@#  This second component of discounting is referred to as the pure time discount rate (PTDR) and is a common feature of most markets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Stern review35 challenged the prevailing application of a PTDR, arguing that it is indefensible with regard to inter-generational ethics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Stern et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (page 31 of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

stance has been challenged by others who argue that applying a PTDR is more consistent with observed market behaviour36, and with increasing uncertainty associated with forecasting the distant future37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We do not take a specific stance here on the correct social discount rate to apply, but use a sensitivity range in the Monte Carlo analysis that covers the range of values

risk, not by applying differential discount rates to each technology, but by using a Monte Carlo method to simulate uncertainty in a technology performing worse (or better) than expected.

social discount rate to quantify the uncertainty in the net social costs and benefits for each technology on a common basis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be borne in mind, however, that risk-averse

use efficiency can be approximately 20% lower for organic than mineral fertilizers71,72, therefore, we base nutrient values on 80% of the equivalent prices of phosphorus in Ca(H2PO4)2 (triple super phosphate) and potassium in KCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use the 20052014 price ranges of $220860 Mg1 triple super phosphate and $180650 Mg1 KCl (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'BC haulage and field operations', 'It was estimated that BC haulage would cost between $0.26 to $14.17 per Mg feedstock (note that costs would be approximately four times greater per unit mass of BC), and that associated CO2C emissions would be in the range 0.021.3 kg C per Mg feedstock, calculated as shown in Supplementary Table 11, and equations (15, 16, 17, 18, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calculation of mean rectilinear distance (RD) between BEBCS plant and sites for application of BC followed equations (15, 16, 17) below:', '', '', '', 'Where, CA is the area of cropland amended per year; Pbc is annual BC production; ARbc is the application rate (mass per unit area) of BC on cropland; LA is the geographic area over which BC application is dispersed (including both BC-amended cropland and other intervening land where BC is not applied); and CD is the cropland density (area of cropland per unit area of landscape).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Then, haulage emissions (HE) and haulage cost (HC) per unit biomass feedstock are given by equations (18 and 19):', '', '', 'Where Ybc,py is the yield of BC, and EFT and PT are the haulage emissions and costs, respectively, per unit distance per Mg of BC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Field operations to incorporate BC may in some cases coincide with or substitute for normal tillage and spreading operations (for example, if BC is applied instead of agricultural lime).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we use zero cost as the low end of the sensitivity range for field operations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the high end, field operations were estimated to cost up to $25 ha1 for spreading, and $24 ha1 for cultivation and incorporation (including labour, fuel, lubricant, and tractor and implement overheads) in cases when field operations cannot be combined with normal operations (for example, in no-till systems) and when it is not possible to use idle machinery at off-peak times74,75.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Pyrolysis mass and energy balance', 'Pyrolysis mass and energy balances were calculated according to the method in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10 (equations (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) in Supporting Information of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pyrolysis temperature was in the range 450650 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Process heat was assumed to be provided by combustion of a fraction of the combined gaseous and volatile pyrolysis products, with the remaining pyrolysis gases and volatiles used as fuel for power generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversion efficiency of the power generation stage was assumed to be equal to that in the BES system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parasitic power requirements were assumed to be provided by a fraction of the electricity generated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'BC decomposition', 'Molar O:C ratio was used as a predictor variable of BC mineralization rate76.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data relating O:C ratio to estimated half-life were taken from the metastudy by ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  76 (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The regression of equation (20) thus yielded a value for the mineralization factor (fd) of 4.89 +/ 1.8 (1 s.d.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mineralization rate in the Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis was, therefore, modelled using equation (20) with values of fd populated from a Gaussian distribution with mean=4.89, and s.d.=1.8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  O:C ratio was calculated according to equations (6, 7, 8) in the supporting information of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was assumed that carbon credits would be applicable to BC carbon remaining after 100 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', '', 'N2O emissions from soil', 'Numerous studies have shown reduced N2O emissions from soil with BC application77.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduction in soil N2O emissions is correlated with BC application rate, with the relative reduction varying between 0.17 to 0.91% of initial emissions per Mg ha1 BC applied77.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unamended N2O emissions were calculated assuming the IPPC default N2ON emission factor of 1.25% of applied fertilizer N, and N application rates to cropland were assumed to be in the range 25200 kg N ha1 per year78.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Supplementary Table 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mechanisms and long-term dynamics of BCs N2O impacts are still poorly understood and quantified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some evidence suggests that N2O suppression could be short-lived, decaying over a few years79.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use a sensitivity range of 1100 year for the time over which N2O suppression persists, with a logarithmic distribution to skew probability towards the lower end of this range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'SOC feedback', 'BC can promote mineralization (an interaction sometimes referred to as positive priming) of easily mineralizable non-pyrogenic soil organic carbon (npSOC), and can also promote stabilization of npSOC, potentially leading to increased npSOC stocks in the long term (negative priming)21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considerable uncertainty remains in the underlying mechanisms for both positive and negative priming, and in the sizes and longevity of these impacts under differing edaphic and environmental conditions22,23,80.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the ranges of published measurements of the magnitude of BCs priming effect on npSOC turnover and stabilization can be used to modify rate constants in established SOC turnover models to estimate the possible range of priming impacts on long term npSOC stocks22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Applying this methodology to the RothC soil carbon model, while accounting also for impacts of BC on NPP, indicates that BC could potentially alter npSOC stocks over 100 years by up to 0.03 to +0.3 Mg npSOC per Mg BC C added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We adopt this method from Woolf and Lehmann22, applied over a 100 year time frame, to estimate the potential impact on npSOC within the sensitivity range of 0.03 to +0.3 mg npSOC per mg BC-C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The net magnitude of BEBCS sequestered carbon was then adjusted by adding the (positive or negative) npSOC feedback to the quantity of BC remaining in the soil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note, however, that the value of any possible increase in npSOC may be challenging to internalize into carbon markets unless significant advances in understanding of the underlying mechanisms allow them to be predicted within tighter confidence limits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',
