A time transect of exomes from a Native American population before and after European contact  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A major factor for the population decline of Native Americans after European contact has been attributed to infectious disease susceptibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate whether a pre-existing genetic component contributed to this phenomenon, here we analyse 50 exomes of a continuous population from the Northwest Coast of North America, dating from before and after European contact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We model the population collapse after European contact, inferring a 57% reduction in effective population size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also identify signatures of positive selection on immune-related genes in the ancient but not the modern group, with the strongest signal deriving from the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) gene HLA-DQA1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modern individuals show a marked frequency decrease in the same alleles, likely due to the environmental change associated with European colonization, whereby negative selection may have acted on the same gene after contact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evident shift in selection pressures correlates to the regional European-borne epidemics of the 1800s.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The decline of Native American populations after European contact has been linked to several factors including warfare, alterations in social structure and an overwhelming introduction of European-borne pathogens1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the extent of the population decline remains contentious, European-borne epidemics may have disproportionately contributed to the phenomenon4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The debate has prompted researchers to explore the possibility of genetic susceptibility, where low-genetic variation in HLA genes and immunologically naïve populations are linked to the exacerbated pathogen-associated mortality rates6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assumptions of homogeneity among certain immune genes8, however, are based on surveys of living Native Americans who represent the surviving members of communities affected by European contact and colonization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, they fail to consider immune-related genetic factors that may have existed before contact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The immunological history of the indigenous people of the Americas is undoubtedly complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As people entered the Americas and expanded into different regions, 15,00020,000 years before present (BP)9,10, groups encountered environments with varying ecologies and with relatively little gene flow from other continental populations until European contact11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that indigenous people adapted to local pathogens, resulting in long-lasting changes to immune-related loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ancient immune adaptations are suspected to have occurred throughout human history as populations spread into varying environments across the globe12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the indigenous people of America adapted to local pathogens, those adaptations would have proven useful in ancient times but not necessarily after European colonialists altered the environment with their pathogens, some of which may have been novel13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Existing genetic variation as a result of adaptation before European contact could thus have contributed to the indigenous population decline after European contact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To investigate the possibility of a pre-existing genetic component, we sequenced 50 exomes of ancient and modern individuals from the Northwest Coast of North America, dating from before and after European contact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirm the genetic continuity between the ancient and modern individuals, establishing a single continuous population through time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show a 57% reduction in effective population size after European contact, inferred from our demographic model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also detect signatures of positive selection on immune-related genes in the ancient but not the modern individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strongest selection signal in the ancients derives from the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) gene HLA-DQA1, with alleles that are close to fixation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The important immune function of HLA-DQA1 supports an ancient adaptation to the environments of the Americas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modern individuals show a marked decrease in the frequency of the associated alleles (the most pronounced variant showing a 64% difference).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This decrease is likely due to the environmental change associated with European colonization, which resulted in a shift of selection pressures, whereby negative selection may have acted on the same gene after contact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the selection pressure shift could correlate to the European-borne epidemics of the 1800s, suffered in the Northwest Coast region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is among the first studies to examine a single population through time and exemplifies the power of such studies in uncovering nuanced demographic and adaptive histories.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Samples and sequencing', 'To investigate possible immune-related genes under selection before European contact, we sequenced the exomes of ancient and modern First Nations individuals of the Prince Rupert Harbour (PRH) region of British Columbia, Canada (Supplementary Fig 1, Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then performed genomic scans for positive selection and functional characterization of genes exhibiting the strongest signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exomes of 25 modern individuals from two Coast Tsimshian communities, Metlakatla and Lax Kwalaams (henceforth referred to as Tsimshian), were sequenced to a mean depth of 9.66 × .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 25 ancient individuals from archaeological sites in the PRH region (henceforth referred to as PRH Ancients; Supplementary Fig 1) range in age from 6,260 to 1,036 cal BP (Supplementary Table 1), with most of the individuals falling between 3,000 and 1,036 cal BP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ancient exomes were sequenced to a mean depth of 7.97 × (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contamination estimates (that is, exogenous DNA stemming from modern sources), using the exome-wide data, revealed a mean contamination of 0.94% with a 95% confidence interval of 0.831.10% (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16; Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All 25 ancient individuals exhibited patterns of CT and GA transitions consistent with deamination due to post-mortem DNA damage17,18 (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mitochondrial haplogroups were determined for each ancient individual, all showing haplogroups previously identified in Native Americans19 (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Genetic relationship between ancient and modern individuals', 'Before proceeding with selection scans we investigated the genetic relationship among the ancient and modern individuals to confirm continuity between the two groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these analyses, all C/T and G/A polymorphic sites were removed to guard against biases resulting from DNA damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multidimensional scaling was performed to assess the genetic relationships of our samples to individuals from the 1,000 Genomes Project20, other Native American populations21 and two ancient individuals from America22,23 (Fig 1b, Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis revealed an affinity among the PRH Ancients and the Tsimshian, with the Tsimshian drifting towards Europeans as expected from presumed European admixture24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next used ADMIXTURE25 to separate our samples and other worldwide populations into clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis (at K=5 clusters) suggests that the Tsimshian are a mixture of ancestral components stemming from the PRH Ancients and Europeans (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, the evolutionary relationship among our samples and other worldwide human populations was evaluated via TreeMix26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a single-migration event, the PRH Ancients exhibit minimal drift and appear ancestral to the Tsimshian with European admixture occurring between the two groups (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These analyses, combined with local oral histories and evidence from archaeology and mitogenomes19, allowed for the inference that the ancient and modern individuals represent a single population through time, which includes pre- and post-European contact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Population structure and demographic model of the PRH Ancients and Tsimshian.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) ADMIXTURE analysis depicting ancestry proportions assuming the

American (Surui, Mayan and Karitiana) populations fall with the PRH Ancients and the Anzick-1 ancient sample from Montana.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modern Tsimshian fall along the gradient leading from the Native Americans and the Europeans, reflecting their admixed history with Europeans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) TreeMix graph with a single admixture event.Full size image', 'Demographic model', 'We also inferred the population history of the Tsimshian by taking into account the bottleneck that occurred after European contact1,27,28 (Fig 2, see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Utilizing both ancient and modern exome-wide data, the demographic parameters were inferred utilizing the joint derived site frequency spectrum of potential synonymous sites with respect to human reference genome hg19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The best-fitting model suggests that a bottleneck occurred 175 years BP (bootstrap 95% confidence interval: 125225 years, Table 1) in the ancestors of the modern Tsimshian with an accompanying reduction in effective population size of 57%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The timing of the bottleneck coincides with the documented smallpox epidemics of the 19th Century and historical reports of large-scale population declines29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A majority of the European admixture in the population likely occurred after the epidemics24,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Demographic

most extreme PBS score belonged to the HLA-DQA1 gene, which encodes for the alpha chain of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), class II, DQ1 isoform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HLA-DQA1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with the most pronounced frequency difference between the PRH Ancients (100%) and the Tsimshian (36%) falls in the 5 untranslated region (Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This region may be indicative of selection acting on the regulation of the gene, as the associated alleles exhibit evidence of chromatin alterations and eQTL hits in a variety of cellsincluding monocytes-CD14+ and primary T helper 17 cells33 (Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chromosomal region where the gene is located also shows strong differentiation along the branch leading to

along with DR and DP, and is mainly expressed on antigen presenting cells34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MHC class II molecules are responsible for binding to extracellular pathogen peptides and presenting them to CD4+T helper cells, which activate a targeted adaptive immune response towards the associated microbe35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecules are known to be highly polymorphic, mainly due to sequence differences corresponding to the binding domain of the molecule, which can impact binding affinities36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of this variety in binding domains, differing MHC class II isoforms can have differing disease outcomes due to the restriction imposed on T-cell activation35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The polymorphic nature of these molecules across different populations, however, would not explain the heightened differentiation in the PRH Ancients with respect to their presumed descendants, the Tsimshian.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Haplotype structure and local ancestry of HLA-DQA1', 'The top candidate for selection in the ancient population, HLA-DQA1, showed large-allele frequency changes in the UTR5 region of the modern population (Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there is a slight reference bias in the ancient samples due to mapping and possibly the design of our capture probes (Supplementary Fig 5, Supplementary Note 4), the high frequency cannot be attributed to this feature since the derived alleles putatively under selection are for the alternate allele.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess whether the frequency change was due to European admixture, we examined the haplotype structure among populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To visualize the haplotypes in the HLA-DQA1 region, we phased the ancient and modern samples using Beagle 4.1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We took a randomly chosen haplotype from ancient sample PRH 125, and computed the number of pairwise differences to this haplotype for each haplotype in the modern and ancient samples as well as the Great Britain (GBR) samples from the 1,000 Genomes Phase 3 data38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then ordered the haplotypes based on their number of pairwise differences to this arbitrarily chosen haplotype from sample PRH 125, and grouped them by population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementary Figure 6 shows similar haplotypes between the ancient and modern individuals, while those of the European population are distinct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We next explored the local ancestry of the HLA-DQA1 gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used RFMix39 to infer ancestry along chromosome 6 in the modern Tsimshian population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We utilized the PopPhased program, which corrects the phasing errors, and a window size of 0.2 cM, four generations since the admixture event between the Tsimshian and Europeans, and 100 trees generated per random forest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the reference panel, we used Phase 3 data from the 1,000 Genomes Project38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used 25 individuals each from the GBR (European panel), CHB (East Asian panel) and PEL (Native American Panel, Peruvian in Lima).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PEL chosen showed little to no admixture (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementary Figure 7 indicates that only one haplotype could be attributed to European ancestry, while the remaining 49 are attributed to Native American ancestry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Simulations of the HLA-DQA1 allele trajectories', 'To explore whether the allele frequency differences between the two time periods could be explained by long-term balancing selection, drift or changes in selection pressures, we performed a series of simulations based on our demographic model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we examined whether long-term balancing selection under heterozygote advantage could explain our data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parameters inferred from our demographic model were implemented in the forward-time simulator SLiM40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A de novo mutation was introduced 5 million years in the past (assuming a generation time of 25 years) that evolved under heterozygote advantage (per-generation selection coefficient s=0.1, and dominance parameter h=100) until the present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of the resulting PBS scores can be contrasted with the observed data in Fig 4a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the distribution of the PBS scores under long-term balancing selection is shifted towards small values compared with neutrality (Fig 4a), the data are inconsistent with long-term balancing selection under heterozygote advantage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Selection

 #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the simulations in which the originally positively-selected allele is neutral or still under positive selection after the time of European contact reached the observed allele frequency in the modern population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A model that incorporated negative selection after European contact was a better fit to our data, where 26% of the simulations reached the observed frequency.Full size image', 'To model evolutionary forces acting on the HLA-DQA1 derived alleles after European contact, we chose the frequency of the allele showing the greatest change of 0.67.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We utilized a simulation based approach, described in detail in the Methods section, to evaluate models under positive selection, neutrality and negative selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also used the same approach to obtain estimates of the correlation between the time of environmental change (t) and the selection coefficient (s) (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 4c shows that neither a strict positive selection scheme, nor one involving positive selection followed by a shift to neutrality, could fit our data (none of the simulations reach the observed frequency in the modern population).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the model with a shift from positive to negative selection was compatible, where 26% of the simulations either reach or surpass the observed frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We also investigated if the observed allele frequency in the ancient population could be better explained by drift rather than selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the same general method, we simulated the initial allele frequencies at the time Native Americans split off from East Asian population by randomly sampling allele frequencies from a backward simulation conditioned on the modern CHB frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then simulated allele frequencies from 60 generations agothe time during which the ancient population was sampled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting distribution in Supplementary Fig 9 shows that a neutral scenario is not a good fit for our data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also see that the empirical distribution of all SNP frequency changes between the ancient and modern individuals show the HLA-DQA1 variants as outliers (Fig 4b).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our unique data set has allowed us to examine the demography of a single Native American population through three distinct time frames.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first examined the population from a time span of 5,000 years leading to European contact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selection scans on the ancient individuals from this period revealed a top candidate for positive selection, HLA-DQA1, giving the inference of an immune-related adaptive event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next inferred the severity of the population collapse after European contact, which correlates with historical population declines associated with regional smallpox epidemics30, as well as general estimates of Native American population declines based on mitochondrial DNA diversity27,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the contact period, previous long-standing positive selection on the HLA-DQA1 gene may also have been significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HLA-DQ receptor has been associated with a variety of colonization era infectious disease, including measles42, tuberculosis43,44, and with the adaptive immune response to the vaccinia virus, which is an attenuated form of smallpox45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies are needed to investigate if the ancient alleles putatively under positive selection may pose a differential disease outcome with respect to European-borne pathogens, as well as their effect on downstream target genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'However, when examining the population post-contact and into contemporary times, variants of the HLA-DQA1 gene experience a marked frequency change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This change presents a more complex scenario when taking into account all three time frames.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, scans for positive selection in the modern Tsimshian, with and without correcting for European admixture, revealed no statistically significant selection on immune-related genes (Supplementary Tables 5 and 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gene ontology enrichment analyses also did not suggest a correlation with immune function (Supplementary Table 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, demography alone was unable to explain the large frequency change in the HLA-DQA1 alleles between the ancient and modern groups based on simulations (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  European admixture in the modern individuals also did not account for the frequency changes since the haplotypes in this region can be attributed to Native American ancestry (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, HLA-DQA1 remained a top PBS hit in scans involving both a European admixture correction (Supplementary Table 9) and with an additional scan involving unadmixed Native American individuals from a different modern population (suggesting a regional adaptive event) (Supplementary Table 8; ranked fourth best candidate, with the top three functionally uncharacterized).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We therefore explored alternative explanations for the observed frequency change of the HLA-DQA1 alleles in the time after contact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since HLA genes have been previously postulated to be under balancing selection in humans47,48, we examined the possibility that long-term balancing selection could explain our data by simulating under a model of heterozygote advantage conditional on our inferred demographic model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that this specific type of balancing selection is a poor fit to the data, whereby the HLA-DQA1 gene is still an extreme outlier relative to the simulation results (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we used a forward simulation based approach to trace the HLA-DQA1 allele trajectories under different selection models after the point of European contact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that simulations under our demographic model, which was modified to not include European admixture given our local ancestry results (Supplementary Fig 7), was insufficient to explain the frequency change in the modern populationwith none of the 104 simulations reaching the observed frequency (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, on applying a model of negative selection at the time of contact, we found that simulated allele frequencies were compatible with the observed frequencies in the modern population (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we were unable to precisely identify the selection coefficient necessary to drive the allele frequency change (since the likelihood surface is relatively flat, Supplementary Fig 8), it is likely that relatively strong negative selection occurred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such strength would be expected under a time frame of less than seven generations and correlates with the high mortality rates associated with the regional smallpox epidemics of the 1800s, which reached upwards of 70% (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The results presented here reveal an evolutionary history that spans thousands of years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The immune-related alleles that exhibit strong signals of positive selection in the ancient Native Americans from the Northwest Coast, likely correlate to an adaptation to pathogens that were present in the ancient environments of the region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results also suggest that the indigenous population may have experienced negative selection on the same immune-related genetic component after European contact and the ensuing population collapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shift may represent a form of balancing selection due to fluctuating environments49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This inference was only made possible through our examination of a single population through time, revealing nuanced demographic events and the utility of such studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the evolutionary history detailed here helps to better understand the experiences of Native Americans with disease, in both ancient and colonial periods, by demonstrating a shift in immune-related selection pressures associated with the environmental impact of European contact.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

WrightFisher model based backward simulation of the derived allele frequency in CHB under the neutral model to sample the allele frequency (fT:605) at 605 generations ago, which is the estimated time at which ancestral Native Americans split from CHB according to our demographic model, assuming the current frequency was 0.475 (1,000 Genomes CHB frequency) and a constant population size of 8,250 diploid individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We computed this constant population size to be the effective size with the same amount of elapsed coalescent time as one under exponential growth assumed in for

in which effective population size (Ne) was 13,975 diploids between 605 and 7 generations ago and decreased to 6,006 diploids at 7 generations ago (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since we detected signatures of selection on the derived allele based on the PBS statistic in our ancient samples at 60 generations ago (fT:60=1.0), we sampled a selection coefficient (soriginal) from U(0.0, 0.1) and only accepted trajectories if the frequency at 60 generations ago was  greater than 80%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the trajectory reached 12 generations ago, when European contact occurred in British Columbia,
