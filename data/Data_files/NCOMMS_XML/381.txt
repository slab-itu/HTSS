Marginal zone B cells exacerbate endotoxic shock via interleukin-6 secretion induced by Fc/R-coupled TLR4 signalling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Marginal zone (MZ) B cells produce a first wave of antibodies for protection from blood-borne pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the role of MZ B cells in inflammatory responses has not been elucidated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that MZ B cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), and exacerbate systemic inflammatory responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After intravenous injection of LPS or E. coli, mice deficient in MZ B cells or IL-6 only in MZ B cells have attenuated systemic inflammatory responses and prolonged survival compared with wild-type mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LPS directly stimulates MZ B cells via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and MyD88 pathways for IL-6 production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, TLR4 requires physical and functional association with Fc/R (CD351) for its oligomer formation, NF-B signalling and IL-6 production from MZ B cells; this association is responsible for systemic inflammatory responses and endotoxic shock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results reveal a pro-inflammatory role of MZ B cells in endotoxic shock.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Sepsis is one major cause of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which sometimes leads to host death1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many factors such as bacterial products (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) and those released from damaged cells (damage-associated molecular patterns) are known to trigger SIRS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During SIRS caused by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which initiates the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, has been thought to be pivotal in pathophysiology of sepsis3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Marginal zone (MZ) segregates the circulating blood from the lymphoid tissues in the spleen and contains several types of immune cells including MZ B cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MZ B cells express B-cell antigen receptors poly-reactive to various pathogens with low affinity4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After encountering blood-borne pathogens, MZ B cells collaborate with dendritic cells5 and neutrophils6 to rapidly produce a first wave innate-like antibodies7,8, which plays an important role in eradication of pathogens9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, mice deficient in MZ B cells showed decreased antibody production in the early phase after pathogen invasion into the blood circulation11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the involvement of MZ B cells in inflammatory responses has not been elucidated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Fc receptors (FcRs) play critical roles in immune responses, including inflammation, cytotoxicity and allergic reactions13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fc/R (CD351) is an FcR for IgA and IgM15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Feamr gene is located near the clusters for IgG FcRs on chromosome 1 (refs 15, 17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cytoplasmic region of Fc/R is required for an atypical dimer formation19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fc/R is preferentially expressed on follicular dendritic cells in the lymphoid organs21 and suppresses T-independent antigen retention by follicular dendritic cells, leading to the downregulation of germinal centre formation and humoral immune responses, including antibody production, affinity maturation and memory B-cell generation, against T-independent antigens21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fc/R is also expressed on MZ B cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the functional role of Fc/R on MZ B cells has remained unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we investigate the role of MZ B cells in systemic inflammatory responses during endotoxic shock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report that MZ B cells produce interleukin-6 (IL-6) in response to LPS via the TLR4 and NF-B signalling pathways and exacerbate endotoxic shock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also demonstrate that Fc/R physically and functionally associates with TLR4 and induces the oligomer formation of TLR4 for amplification of IL-6 production.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mice lacking MZ B cells are resistant to endotoxic shock', 'To examine the role of MZ B cells in inflammatory responses, we generated MZ B-cell-deficient bone marrow (BM) chimeric mice (MZ B) by transferring Cd19/ BM cells into lethally irradiated mice (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a control, we also generated BM chimeric mice (MZ B-WT) by transferring wild-type (WT) and Cd19/ BM cells at a ratio of 1:9, respectively, after lethal irradiation (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MZ B mice showed significantly lower number of MZ B cells, compared with MZ B-WT mice (Fig 1b;

in this analysis, IL-6 and CXCL10 were produced primarily by macrophages at 1 h after LPS injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, MZ B cells and macrophages produced comparable amounts of both IL-6 and CXCL10 4 h after LPS injection (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, serum IL-6 and CXCL10 levels were significantly lower in MZ B mice than MZ B-WT mice 4, 8 and 12 h after injection of LPS (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, MZ B cells likely behave similarly as macrophages in inflammatory cascade by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-6 and CXCL10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: MZ B cells secrete cytokines and chemokines during endotoxic shock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) MZ B cells (MZ B) and macrophages (M) (a), or total splenocytes (grey) and splenocytes depleted of MZ B cells (black) or macrophages (white) (b) were purified from C57BL/6 mice after LPS injection at indicated time points after LPS injection and analysed for indicated cytokines and chemokines by quantitative RTPCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Sera obtained from MZ B mice at indicated time points after LPS injection were measured for IL-6 and CXCL10 by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are representative of three independent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analyses were performed with the unpaired Students t-test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars indicate s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NS, not significant.Full size image', 'IL-6 derived from MZ B cells is critical for endotoxic shock', 'Since IL-6 seemed to be a dominant cytokine produced from MZ B cells, we investigated whether MZ B-cell-derived IL-6 is involved in systemic inflammatory responses to LPS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the approach described previously24, we generated mixed BM chimeric mice whose MZ B cells lacked IL-6 expression by transferring both Il6/ and Cd19/ BM cells at a ratio of 1:9, respectively, into lethally irradiated mice (MZ B-IL-6-KO;

WT mice after LPS injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They reported that IL-6 played as an anti-inflammatory cytokine that suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF- in the very early phase after LPS injection, leading to the attenuation of systemic inflammatory responses26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we showed that neutralization of IL-6R signalling by a neutralizing anti-IL-6R antibody at the time points around (1 h before) LPS challenge did not show any effect on the survival of mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results together with previous reports suggest that IL-6, which is mainly derived from macrophages, at the very early phase of inflammatory response to endotoxin may not augment systemic inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we showed that a significant amount of IL-6 was produced by MZ B cells as well as by macrophages at 4 h after LPS challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neutralization of IL-6R signalling around at this time point (24 h after LPS or E. coli injection) significantly prolonged survival of mice after LPS or E. coli injection, indicating that IL-6 produced at delayed time points a few hours after exposure of endotoxin indeed exacerbates systemic inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with this idea, treatment of mice with anti-IL-6R antibody at the late phase (68 h) of CLP prolonged the survival of mice compared with treatment with control antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that timely neutralization of IL-6R-mediated signalling may be useful for the treatment of sepsis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We observed that IL-6 production from MZ B cells in response to LPS required Fc/R even in the absence of its ligands (IgA or IgM) in the serum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since MZ B cells harbour BCR reactive to LPS33, we speculated that membrane IgM or IgM quickly produced in response to LPS from MZ B cells forms a complex with LPS, which also interacts with Fc/R as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since Fc/R associates with TLR4 via its transmembrane region, interaction of Fc/R with IgM-coated LPS may enhance LPS-induced oligomerization of TLR4, leading to the amplification of MZ B-cell activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar mechanism was previously reported with a C-type lectin SIGNR1 (CD209b), a capturing receptor for E. coli34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On binding to E. coli, SIGNR1 enhances TLR4 oligomerization via association with TLR4, and increases cytokine production from macrophages31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further analysis should be required to clarify how Fc/R is involved in the amplification of TLR4 signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The involvement of B cells in inflammatory responses has been demonstrated in several disease models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a peritonitis model induced by CLP, B cells produce CXCL10 in response to type I interferon secreted during peritonitis and amplifies the inflammatory responses, leading to efficient bacterial eradication36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During myocardiac infarction induced by coronary artery ligation, B cells produced CXCL7, which recruits inflammatory monocyte to the heart and impairs myocardium remodelling and function37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies have identified a novel B-cell subset, named innate response activator B cells, differentiated from B1 B cells in the peritoneal cavity during CLP-induced peritonitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Innate response activator B cells secret granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor for protection from bacterial infections38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ping et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  reported IL-35-producing B cells with CD138high plasma cells phonotype, which suppress experimental autoimmune myelitis and host defence against Salmonella enterica infection39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Tedders group had identified regulatory B-cell population producing IL-10, named B10 cells40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  B10 cells expand during experimental arthritis42 and Listeria monocytogenes infection43, leading to the suppression of T cells responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, various B-cell subsets exist and control inflammatory responses via secreting pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Among B-cell population, MZ B cells are primarily recognized as quickly antibody producing cells, critical for the early immune defences against blood-borne pathogens7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was reported that MZ B cells secret an anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 after Listeria monocytogenes infection44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, precursor cells for B10 cells (B10pro) are recently identified within MZ B cells population45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, our current study has unveiled a pro-inflammatory role of MZ B cells: the production of IL-6 that is responsible for LPS-mediated endotoxic shock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, MZ B cells are not only just antibody producer but also regulator for immune responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In humans, IgM+ IgD+ CD27+ B cells were identified as a counterpart of rodent MZ B cells46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are present in the blood as well as in the spleen48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the functional characteristics of human MZ B cells have remained unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies are required for elucidation of the functional role of human MZ B cells in inflammatory responses.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
