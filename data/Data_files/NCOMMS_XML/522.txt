Dimensional crossover in semiconductor nanostructures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Recent advances in semiconductor nanostructure syntheses provide unprecedented control over electronic quantum confinement and have led to extensive investigations of their size- and shape-dependent optical/electrical properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, spectroscopic measurements show that optical bandgaps of one-dimensional CdSe nanowires are substantially (approximately 100 meV) lower than their zero-dimensional counterparts for equivalent diameters spanning 510 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But what, exactly, dictates the dimensional crossover of a semiconductors electronic structure?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we probe the one-dimensional to zero-dimensional transition of CdSe using single nanowire/nanorod absorption spectroscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that carrier electrostatic interactions play a fundamental role in establishing dimensional crossover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the critical length at which this transition occurs is governed by the aspect ratio-dependent interplay between carrier confinement and dielectric contrast/confinement energies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Intuitive expectations, based on a framework of non-interacting particles, suggest that reducing the length of a nanoscale systems confining potential gradually induces the emergence of quantum confinement1,2,3 effects in its spectroscopic response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This crossover is expected to be smooth, without the appearance of a critical length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the presence of interactions fundamentally alters this picture of dimensional crossover in many-particle systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several low-dimensional systems, in fact, show interaction-induced phases of matter absent in higher dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They include fractional quantum Hall states in two dimensions4, TomonagaLuttinger liquids in one-dimension (1D)5 and Kondo effects in zero-dimensional (0D) quantum dots (QDs)6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate that analogous many-particle interactions dictate the 1D-to-0D dimensional crossover in low-dimensional semiconductors (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our spectroscopic measurements and supporting theoretical calculations indicate that this transition occurs at a critical length determined by the delicate balance between carrier confinement and electrostatic interaction energies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: One-dimensional to zero-dimensional crossover of a semiconductor nanowires electronic structure.Top row: structural evolution of a nanowire into a quantum dot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Middle row: corresponding evolution of nanowire and nanorod electron and hole wavefunctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bottom row: a plot depicting the interplay between aspect ratio-dependent carrier confinement, Ek(b) and dielectric contrast/dielectric confinement electrostatic energies, |U|.Full size image', 'While past studies have attempted to investigate 100 meV bandgap (Eg) differences between 1D and 0D CdSe nanostructures by probing nanorods (NRs) of controlled length7,8,9 no consensus exists as to when a 1D object exhibits 0D character7,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although general trends have been gleaned, they are largely the result of ensemble measurements, which suffer from inhomogeneous broadening due to inherent size-and-shape distributions10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, they rely on photoluminescence and tunnelling spectroscopies7,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, dark/bright exciton splitting13, trap-induced Stokes shifts14 and enhanced exciton binding energies15 can significantly alter perceived bandgaps, complicating accurate Eg estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we directly probe this 1D-to-0D transition using single nanowire (NW)/NR absorption spectroscopy to eliminate ambiguities as to the actual evolution of electronic structure across dimensionality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is accomplished using spatial modulation microscopy12,14,16,17, which entails modulating a NW/NRs position in and out of a focused laser beam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent lock-in detection measures the transferred transmitted laser power modulation, which relates to individual nanostructure extinction cross-sections (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig 1)17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As obtained experimental data are found to be in good agreement with an effective mass model that explicitly includes dielectric contrast/confinement effects, and, consequently, provides a critical length at which 1D nanostructures become 0D.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Given that the general evolution of a semiconductors dimensionality is described by (Fig 4), at what point does the 1D-to-0D transition occur?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the only aspect ratio-dependent energies contributing to a nanostructures overall Eg are its longitudinal confinement (Ek(b)) and electrostatic (|U|) energies, the 1D-to-0D evolution is characterized by the interplay between these two terms (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementary Fig 6 plots Ek(b) and |U| as functions of aspect ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From it, we determine where Ek(b) balances |U| and define this to be the critical point where a 1D-to-0D transition occurs (Supplementary Note 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In d6.8 nm CdSe, this length is b8.5 nm, which is just above its bulk exciton Bohr radius (aB=5.6 nm)25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transition point is additionally sensitive to diameter and occurs at b6 nm (b11 nm) for d=4 nm (d=10 nm) NRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings differ from previous studies which suggest transition lengths of b30 nm for d=36 nm CdSe NRs7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discrepancy exists because experimental blueshifts in NR absorption spectra arise from both carrier and dielectric confinement (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At large b, dielectric confinement is the predominant source of blueshifts to NR extinction spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, only at lengths below b2aB (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26) does carrier confinement matter, and where a crossover in nanostructure dimensionality occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we directly probe the 1D-to-0D transition in CdSe using single NW/NR absorption spectroscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These measurements expand the limits of conventional single particle microscopies by providing the first direct absorption spectra of individual CdSe NRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond this, they clearly show how excitonic blueshifts in the linear absorption depend exquisitely on the delicate balance between confinement and dielectric contrast/confinement interactions, the latter being fundamental interactions which govern the dimensional crossover in semiconductors.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
