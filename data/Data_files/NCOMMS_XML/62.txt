Structurally driven one-dimensional electron confinement in sub-5-nm graphene nanowrinkles  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Graphene-based carbon materials such as fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and graphenes have distinct and unique electronic properties that depend on their dimensionality and geometric structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Graphene wrinkles with pseudo one-dimensional structures have been observed in a graphene sheet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, their one-dimensional electronic properties have never been observed because of their large widths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the unique electronic structure of graphene nanowrinkles in a graphene sheet grown on Ni(111), the width of which was small enough to cause one-dimensional electron confinement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Use of spatially resolved, scanning tunnelling spectroscopy revealed bandgap opening and a one-dimensional van Hove singularity in the graphene nanowrinkles, as well as the chemical potential distribution across the graphene nanowrinkles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation allows us to realize a metallic-semiconducting-metallic junction in a single graphene sheet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our demonstration of one-dimensional electron confinement in graphene provides the novel possibility of controlling its electronic properties not by chemical modification but by mechanical structuring.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Graphene wrinkles, which are one-dimensional (1D) folded graphene structures, have generally been observed in graphene produced by chemical vapour deposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These structures have been thought to be the result of the difference in the thermal expansion coefficient between graphene and its substrate1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A graphene wrinkle is chemically bonded with surrounding planar epitaxial graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, its unique geometric structure is distinct from those of carbon nanotubes2 and graphene nanoribbons3,4,5,6, which are indisputably 1D structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we define a graphene wrinkle as a pseudo 1D structure to indicate that it has a 1D shape, but is still a part of a two-dimensional structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the following, we demonstrate the 1D electron confinement in graphene nanowrinkle (GNW) by scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), whose width is  less_than 5 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, spatially resolved electronic structures have been investigated, and the manipulation of graphene geometry by STM tip has been demonstrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results imply that a semiconducting property can be realized by the mechanical deformation of the graphene geometry not by chemical modification, which is analogous to the case of a strain-induced pseudo magnetic field7,8 that was discovered in deformed graphene nanobubbles7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of surface functionalization in our approach can prevent the mobility decline due to chemical defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the covalent bonding at the metallic pEG-semiconducting GNW junction can reduce the contact resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate that the interfacial interaction between graphene and the metal substrate provides a novel way to realize a metallic-semiconducting-metallic junction within a single graphene sheet.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Structural characterization of GNWs', 'Epitaxial graphene with GNWs was synthesized by dissociating acetylene on a clean Ni(111) surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A rapid cooling process is necessary, which is the most critical step to synthesize GNWs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the GNWs were observed in the region where the terrace width of the underlying Ni surface was as small as several tens of nanometres (Fig 1ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These GNWs have been recoloured with orange in Fig 1b, and a line profile along the white arrow in Fig 1b is plotted in Fig 1d, which shows that the GNWs on the terrace have larger widths and lower heights than the GNWs at the step edges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We should note that all GNWs were formed at the step edges (red triangles in Fig 1d) or propagated from kinks at the step edges (blue triangles in Fig 1d) of the Ni surface, the implication being that the geometrical structure of the underlying Ni must play a crucial role in the formation of GNWs (Supplementary Figs 14;

this behaviour is similar to the band-gap opening feature observed in a single-wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT)9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no evidence of such discrete electronic states on the pEG area (blue line in Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Dirac point was not clearly apparent, even on the pEG area, because chemisorption on a Ni substrate strongly perturbs the electronic structure of graphene12,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dI/dV images in Fig 2b revealed the spatial distribution of the LDOS, which were obtained at various Vs, including the voltages at peak positions (Vs=0.6 V (v1) and 0.5 V (c1)) and between v1 and c1 (Vs=0.2, 0.01 and 0.2 V) as well At the peak positions, the measured dI/dV intensities, which are indicative of the LDOS, were higher on the GNW area than on the pEG area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, lower LDOSs were observed on the GNW at Vs values in the energy gap between v1 and c1 (Eg) (Supplementary Fig 5 for dI/dV images at the second set of peaks (Vs=1.6 V (v2) and 1.5 V (c2)), and Vs between the first and second peaks (Vs=1.0 V and 1.0 V)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dI/dV images clearly show the metallic-semiconducting-metallic junction across a GNW, which has never been observed in the dI/dV spectra previously measured on other graphene wrinkles6,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Electronic structures in GNW confirmed by STS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) dI/dV spectra on (grey line) bare Ni(111), (blue line) flat graphene, and (red line) GNW as marked in inset STM image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 2 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The symbols above the peaks indicate (green diamond) v2, (green triangle) v1, (orange triangle) c1 (from conduction band) and (orange diamond) c2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) dI/dV mapping images of GNWs obtained at Vs=(i) 0.5 V, (ii) 0.2 V, (iii) 0.01 V, (iv) 0.2 V and (v) 0.6 V.Full size image', 'We considered two plausible origins of these peaks, a strain-induced magnetic field and a 1D electron confinement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An induced magnetic field due to the high curvature in graphene can result in Landau levels in the graphene, as observed in graphene nanobubbles7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1D electron confinement can also result in discrete states (van Hove singularities (vHS)) in electronic structures, a phenomenon that has been extensively investigated in SWCNTs with various chiralities2,9,10,11,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To check the first possibility, that is, pseudo-magnetic-field based mechanism, the dI/dV spectra in the present work were compared with Landau levels observed in monolayer graphene under magnetic fields18,19, as well as ones observed in graphene nanobubbles7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a monolayer graphene sheet, zeroth Landau level (n=0) should be observed near Fermi level (EF), since electrons behave like a Dirac fermion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the position of the nth Landau level (En) follows the relationship  (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our work, however, discrete energy levels (v1 or c1) are too far from the EF to assign one of them as the zeroth Landau level, even when considering the doping effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the energy gaps between the peaks do not match the relationship, .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we have excluded the pseudo-magnetic-field based mechanism for our results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To examine the plausibility of the second possible mechanism, that is, 1D electron confinement, we investigated the width dependence on Eg, which should show a relationship to w (Eg1/w), if Eg originates from 1D electron confinement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3a shows the dI/dV spectra obtained from the other GNWs within the width range 1.67 nm (a) to 3.65 nm (f; Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is apparent that Eg values decreased with increasing widths of the GNWs, but vHS peaks were not observed in GNWs with widths  greater than 3.5 nm; note that we tested 26 GNWs, the distribution of which is provided in Supplementary Fig 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The width dependence implies that 1D electron confinement is the most plausible explanation for the unique electronic structures of GNWs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To strengthen the 1D electron confinement mechanism, we compared our results with the electronic structures of a SWCNT and a graphene nanoribbon, archetypal 1D carbon materials showing 1D electron confinement phenomena.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a reliable comparison, the actual length for electron confinement (L) is used rather than width of the GNW or the diameter of the SWCNT, because L is more directly related to Eg induced by 1D electron confinement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, Egs measured in GNWs, and calculated Egs for both SWNCTs17 and an armchair graphene nanoribbon (AGNR)20,21 are plotted in Fig 3b as a function of L, that is, arc length of GNW, circumference of SWCNT and width of AGNR, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The arc length of the GNW was estimated on the assumption that the GNW arc shape of its cross section is a part of a circle (Supplementary Figs 810; Supplementary Table 1; Supplementary Note 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values for SWCNTs are extracted from the Kataura Plot17, which are calculated by the tight-binding method, and the band gaps of AGNR are estimated by two methods, the local density approximation (LDA)20 and the GW approximation21, that are used for comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incidentally, LDA usually gives underestimated energy values, while GW values for AGNR are expected to be much closer to reality21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3b shows that the Egs of the GNWs are comparable to the variation of Egs in AGNR and semiconducting SWCNT, which supports the idea that 1D electron confinement in GNWs is more convincing than a pseudo-magnetic-field based mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is noteworthy that circular boundary conditions in the SWCNT impose an even number of nodes on the wave function along the circumference vector, while the number of nodes can be either even or odd in both GNW and GNR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore believe that the comparison of GNW with GNR is appropriate enough to rationalize our work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, further studies would be required not only to fully understand the correlation between Eg and arc length, but also to reveal the other effects on Eg, such as curvature and chirality of the GNW.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Width-dependent STS studies in GNWs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a;

The spatially resolved-STS map revealed that the positions of v1 and c1 were shifted along the Ch direction, the indication being that the chemical potential was different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the centre position of the GNW, the EFs to both the left and right of the centre position were closer to c1, the implication being that the chemical potential was larger in the GNW than in the pEG area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that the asymmetry of the spatially resolved-STS on the left and right sides may be attributed to the asymmetric geometry of the tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on first principles, electron transfer from Ni to epitaxial graphene has been predicted at the epitaxial grapheneNi contact region13,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pEG region interacts strongly with the Ni substrate, the result being electron transfer from the substrate, whereas the GNW is less charged due to the negligible degree of interaction with its substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These different degrees of electron transfer determine the electric field across the GNW and may induce the parabolic distribution of c1 and v1 in the spatially resolved-STS (Supplementary Fig 11b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Spatially resolved-STS studies across GNW.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) dI/dV spectra measured along the line perpendicular to the GNW direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coloured dots in the inset of STM images indicate the positions where the dI/dV spectra were obtained by STS measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Spatially resolved-STS map from a with Vs ranging from 1.3 to 0.7 V.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our results constitute the demonstration of electron confinement in GNWs with dimensions  less_than 5 nm and the demonstration of an open bandgap, which implies that GNWs have semiconducting properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many efforts have been made to manipulate the electronic properties of graphene by chemical modification25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, our study shows a new possibility of controlling the electronic structure of graphene by engineering its geometric structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with chemical approaches, our approach does not involve the breaking of chemical bonds in graphene layers, which causes the carrier mobility to decrease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the metallic pEG and semiconducting GNW are covalently bonded, and their work function should be similar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore suggest that the interface between pEG and GWN will provide Ohmic-like behaviour in electron transport with very low contact resistance (Supplementary Fig 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This concept of controlled mechanical deformation does not result in new chemical species but rather in new forms of graphene-based carbons, which consist of only carbon atoms.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
