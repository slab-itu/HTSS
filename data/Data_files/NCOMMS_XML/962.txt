Constitutive smooth muscle tumour necrosis factor regulates microvascular myogenic responsiveness and systemic blood pressure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a ubiquitously expressed cytokine with functions beyond the immune system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In several diseases, the induction of TNF expression in resistance artery smooth muscle cells enhances microvascular myogenic vasoconstriction and perturbs blood flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pathological role prompted our hypothesis that constitutively expressed TNF regulates myogenic signalling and systemic haemodynamics under non-pathological settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that acutely deleting the TNF gene in smooth muscle cells or pharmacologically scavenging TNF with etanercept (ETN) reduces blood pressure and resistance artery myogenic responsiveness; the latter effect is conserved across five species, including humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in transmural pressure are transduced into intracellular signals by membrane-bound TNF (mTNF) that connect to a canonical myogenic signalling pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data positions mTNF reverse signalling as an integral element of a microvascular mechanosensor; pathologic or therapeutic perturbations of TNF signalling, therefore, necessarily affect microvascular tone and systemic haemodynamics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is primarily characterized as an immunomodulatory cytokine1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its ubiquitous expression2, however, implies important functions beyond the immune system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our previous work in cerebral and mesenteric arteries demonstrates that smooth muscle cell-derived TNF is central to the pathological augmentation of myogenic reactivity3,4,5; it enables systemic diseases with the ability to alter microvascular autoregulation and hence, local tissue perfusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, sequestering TNF with etanercept (ETN) normalizes pathologically enhanced myogenic responsiveness in cerebral arteries3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mesenteric arteries, however, the same intervention abolishes myogenic reactivity5, fuelling the hypothesis that TNF may serve as a constitutive regulator of myogenic signalling in certain microvascular beds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If this observation extends to skeletal muscle resistance arteries, which prominently regulate total peripheral resistance (TPR)6, TNF would emerge as a physiological regulator of mean arterial pressure (MAP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The immediate clinical ramification would be that anti-TNF therapy must be more cautiously applied and monitored, since it could possess an unappreciated capability to modulate TPR and hence, haemodynamic parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, anti-TNF therapeutics have cardiovascular side effects that are incompletely understood7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The biology of TNF is complex8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TNF is expressed on the cell surface as membrane-bound form (26 kDa) that can be cleaved by extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (TNF converting enzyme; TACE) to yield a soluble form (17 kDa) (refs 11, 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The membrane-bound (mTNF) and soluble (sTNF) forms of TNF exist as homotrimers13 that are both biologically active and partially overlap in function10,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sTNF activates well-described signalling pathways via two receptors (TNF receptor 1; TNFR1/TNF receptor 2; TNFR2)15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For mTNF, both forward (via receptors) and reverse (outside-in signalling through the TNF protein) signalling pathways have been described10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the options available, an mTNF signal makes intuitive sense: since myogenic signalling is perpetually active, proteolytic shedding (that cleaves mTNF to release sTNF) would rapidly deplete cellular TNF and is, therefore, unsustainable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this report, we show that acutely deleting the TNF gene in smooth muscle cells or scavenging TNF with the clinical therapeutic ETN reduces resistance artery myogenic responsiveness and hence, systemic blood pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inhibitory effect on myogenic responsiveness is conserved across five distinct species, including humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in transmural pressure are transduced into intracellular signals by membrane-bound TNF (mTNF), thereby positioning mTNF as a mechanosensor; this reverse signal connects to the established intracellular myogenic signalling elements extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data, therefore, suggest that several side effects of clinical ETN therapy result from interfering with TNFs pivotal mechanosensor function and hence, microvascular tone and systemic haemodynamic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, perturbing TNF signalling can potentially elicit deleterious effects in the cardiovascular system.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'This study unveils the concept that mTNF constitutively regulates skeletal muscle resistance artery myogenic vasoconstriction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the molecular level, we identify constitutively expressed smooth muscle cell TNF as a key player in the chain of events that convert a pressure stimulus into biochemical signals and ultimately, vasoconstriction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe this TNF-dependent mechanism in skeletal muscle resistance arteries isolated from mice, hamsters, dogs and pigs; we also complete the first translation of this mechanism, by demonstrating its operation in two distinct human skeletal muscle resistance artery beds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This striking similarity in how different species depend on mTNF to initiate myogenic signalling suggests that this newly discovered mechanism is fundamental and emerged early in phylogenetic ancestry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TNFs new role as a mechanosensor that putatively transduces mechanical stretch into intracellular signals adds a unique element to its portfolio of biological effects and necessitates a prominent shift in how we view TNF signalling in health and disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Microvascular myogenic signalling is continuous39: it is imperative, therefore, that the elements of the signalling chain do not deplete.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Constitutive proteolytic shedding11,12 is not sustainable, effectively excluding the release of soluble TNF and/or soluble TNF receptors as viable myogenic mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although TNF receptors are clearly involved in myogenic signal generation, we exclude a forward signal through the receptors, since soluble TNF does not mimic a pressure stimulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is only one sustainable configuration that does not rapidly degrade as it operates and reconciles our observations: mTNF tethers to and creates a mechanosensitive proteinprotein pair with a TNF receptor that is capable of sensing (for example, via conformational changes) and transducing the pressure stimulus into a myogenic signal through mTNF (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This configuration is the only scenario where exogenously applied soluble TNF could simultaneously (i) disrupt the interaction between mTNF and its tethering receptor partner, without (ii) initiating a pro-constrictive forward signal through TNFRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we clearly demonstrate that mTNF tethers to a TNF receptor, our experimental strategy, which utilized double TNF receptor knockout mice, does not define which TNF receptor subtypes are involved in this mechanotransduction process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Even in the absence of structural information demonstrating a biologically relevant conformational change in response to pressure, our data permit the conclusion that mTNF is an integral component of a mechanosensitive complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This role positions mTNF upstream of canonical myogenic signals: indeed, TNF inhibition abrogates the proximal pressure-stimulated signals of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and intracellular calcium elevation29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sTNFR1-Fc, a ligand for mTNF36,37, elicits ERK1/2 phosphorylation and stimulates vasoconstriction: the commonality with pressure-stimulated signals fuels our speculation that the myogenic signal routes directly through the mTNF molecule itself (that is, a reverse signal)10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The physiological functions of TNF reverse signalling are an emerging field35,36,37,40: this study presents the first evidence for this mechanisms operation in a vital microvascular function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This seminal discovery, therefore, suggests that anti-TNF therapy has an unappreciated capability to modulate vascular resistance and hence, modify haemodynamic parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Remarkably, the mTNF/reverse signalling mechanism observed in skeletal muscle resistance arteries is not common to all vascular beds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cerebral arteries are (i) insensitive to sTNFR1-Fc ligand stimulation and (ii) clearly utilize a canonical soluble TNF/TNF receptor (that is, forward signalling) mechanism to modulate myogenic reactivity3,4,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, the data from these two vascular beds suggest that mTNF reverse signalling and sTNFR/TNFR forward signalling are mutually exclusive mechanisms that do not simultaneously modulate myogenic tone within a specific vascular bed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This functional specialization necessitates a revision in how cardiovascular inflammation is managed, since anti-TNF therapeutics will have differential effects on vascular tone, depending on whether the respective vascular bed utilizes forward or reverse signalling to sustain myogenic reactivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The immediate clinical ramification is that anti-TNF therapy must be more cautiously applied and monitored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Anti-TNF therapy has revolutionized the management of many chronic inflammatory diseases and is, therefore, utilized in an ever-growing number of patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Certain side effects (for example, vertigo and headaches)41 could well result from altered systemic haemodynamic; however, the clinical trials that underpin the use of anti-TNF therapy have never been specifically designed to rigorously assess possible haemodynamic changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the BeSt clinical trial determined that anti-TNF therapy induces a significant and persistent drop in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This drop in blood pressure does not associate with microvascular endothelial function (despite transient improvement in vasodilator responses)42 and was observed in both successful and failed interventions (as measured by disease activity scores)43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results suggest that anti-TNF therapy lowers blood pressure independent of inflammatory status by a non-endothelial mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent report by Yoshida et al.44 identified a diurnal variation in the treatments effect on blood pressure, highlighting the need for additional clinical studies with highly controlled experimental designs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Anti-TNF therapy can clearly worsen HF45,46,47,48 and consequently, it is only indicated for patients with no history of HF or very specific cases of mild, well-compensated HF47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because microvascular effects were never considered in the respective study designs45,46, a potential contraindication tied to peripheral resistance modulation cannot be ascertained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presumably, patients with normal cardiac function (for example, arthritis sufferers) tolerate the reductions in TPR resulting from anti-TNF therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, HF patients have compromised cardiac function and depend on elevated TPR to maintain normal MAP: the unnecessary strain imposed on the heart (that is, a compensatory increase in CO) could explain why the intervention fails to deliver an improved outcome46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Throughout this investigation, we have pharmacologically inhibited TNF with ETN, a decoy receptor construct that exhibits strong species cross-reactivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ETNs efficacy in our mouse models was pivotal for unmasking mTNFs haemodynamic function and the underlying molecular mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are other pharmacological mechanisms that can inhibit TNF (for example, the antibody adalimumab); however, species cross-reactivity is problematic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Food and Drug Administration-mandated pharmacological reviews indicate that adalimumab has at least 1,000-fold less affinity for murine TNF, relative to human TNF49; indeed, the low cross-reactivity limited the use of mouse models in the Food and Drug Administration approval process33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low affinity presumably explains why adalimumab did not exert a microvascular effect in our murine models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our conclusions pertaining to anti-TNF therapy are predicated on ETN and antibody-based therapeutics inducing similar inhibitory effects on mTNF in a human setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, the seminal discoveries presented here indicate that anti-TNF therapy has an unappreciated capability to modulate peripheral resistance and hence, haemodynamic parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The immediate clinical ramification is that anti-TNF therapeutics must be more cautiously applied and monitored, especially in patients with compromised cardiac function45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our investigation unveils the concept that mTNF constitutively regulates skeletal muscle resistance artery myogenic vasoconstriction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By demonstrating that mTNF utilizes a non-canonical reverse signalling mechanism to initiate myogenic signalling, we provide evidence that TNF reverse signalling drives critical cardiovascular functions in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data presented herein uncovers TNFs role as a mechanosensor in smooth muscle cells and demonstrates its pivotal contribution to the transformation of transmural stretch into intracellular biochemical signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This highly conserved function may very well extend beyond the cardiovascular system, as the ability to sense mechanical force is an essential operation found in virtually every cell.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
