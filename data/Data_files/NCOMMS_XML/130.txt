Ultrafast response of monolayer molybdenum disulfide photodetectors  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The strong light emission and absorption exhibited by single atomic layer transitional metal dichalcogenides in the visible to near-infrared wavelength range make them attractive for optoelectronic applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, using two-pulse photovoltage correlation technique, we show that monolayer molybdenum disulfide photodetector can have intrinsic response times as short as 3 ps implying photodetection bandwidths as wide as 300 GHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fast photodetector response is a result of the short electronhole and exciton lifetimes in this material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recombination of photoexcited carriers in most two-dimensional metal dichalcogenides is dominated by nonradiative processes, most notable among which is Auger scattering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fast response time, and the ease of fabrication of these devices, make them interesting for low-cost ultrafast optical communication links.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as interesting materials for low-cost optoelectronic devices, including photodetectors, light-emitting diodes, and, more recently, lasers1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of photodetectors, the response time and the quantum efficiency are two important figures of merit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intrinsic response time of TMD photodetectors and the ultimate limits on the speed of operation are unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reported quantum efficiencies of TMD materials and devices are typically in the 0.00010.01 range5,6,7,8,9,12,13,14,15, indicating that most of the electrically injected or optically generated electrons and holes recombine nonradiatively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding the nonradiative carrier recombination mechanisms, as well as the associated timescales, is therefore important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously, ultrafast optical/THz pumpprobe as well as ultrafast photoluminescence techniques have been used, by the authors and others, to study the ultrafast carrier dynamics in metal dichalcogenides and in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) in particular12,16,17,18,19,20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these measurements, free-carrier recombination dynamics, exciton formation and recombination dynamics, refractive index changes, optical/THz intraband and interband conductivity changes, as well as the dynamics associated with carriers trapped in optically active midgap defects are all expected to play a role to varying degrees and, consequently, the results have been difficult to interpret and reconcile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this letter, we present experimental results on ultrafast two-pulse photovoltage correlation (TPPC) measurements on monolayer MoS2 metal-semiconductor photodetectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In TPPC measurements, a photodetector is excited with two identical optical pulses separated by a time delay and the integrated detector photoresponse (either photovoltage or photocurrent response) is recorded as a function of the time delay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TPPC thus uses the photodetector to perform an optical correlation measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nonlinearity of the photoresponse with respect to the optical pulse energy enables one to determine ultrafast intrinsic temporal response of the detector with sub-picosecond resolution23,24,25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our measurements show that the photovoltage is suppressed when the two optical pulses arrive together indicating a saturation of the photoresponse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the time delay between the two pulses is increased from zero, the photovoltage recovers, and the recovery, as a function of the time delay, exhibits two distinct timescales: (i) a fast timescale of the order of 35 ps and (ii) a slow timescale of 80110 ps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two timescales are found to be largely independent of the temperature, exhibits only a mild dependence on the pump fluence, and varies a little from sample to sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between 50 and 75% of the photovoltage correlation response recovers on the fast timescale implying that ultrafast TMD photodetectors with (8 dB) current modulation bandwidths in the 200300 GHz range are possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fast response speed is a result of the short lifetime of the photoexcited carriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since TPPC measures the photovoltage (or photocurrent), this technique is sensitive only to the total photoexcited carrier population, including both bound (excitons) and free carriers, that contributes to the photoresponse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TPPC therefore also offers important and unique insights into the carrier recombination dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temperature and pump fluence dependence of our TPPC results are consistent with defect-assisted recombination as being the dominant mechanism, in which the the photoexcited electrons and holes, both free and bound (excitons), are captured by defects via Auger scattering28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strong Coulomb interactions in 2D TMDs, including the correlations in the positions of free and bound electrons and holes arising from the attractive interactions, result in large carrier capture rates by defects via Auger scattering28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results underscore the trade-off between speed and quantum efficiency in TMD photodetectors.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

timescales observed in our two-pulse photovoltage correlation experiments match well with the two different timescales observed previously in ultrafast optical/THz pumpprobe studies of carrier

previously by the authors12,28 for explaining the ultrafast carrier dynamics in MoS2 monolayers can be used to obtain photovoltage correlations that are in good agreement with the experimental results reported in this letter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show below that this is indeed the case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Ultrafast photoresponse of the metal-MoS2 junction', 'Understanding the ultrafast photoresponse of the detector, and in particular the short circuit current response I2(t, t), is important for interpreting the experimental results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3a depicts the band diagram of the metal-MoS2 junction (plotted in the plane of the MoS2 layer) after photoexcitation with an optical pulse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the Schottky barrier height of 100300 meV (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8), the width of the MoS2 region near the metal with a non-zero lateral electric field is estimated to be to 100300 nm (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result of light diffraction from the edge of the metal contact, light scattering from the substrate, and plasmonic guidance, a portion of the MoS2 layer of length equal to a few hundred nanometres is photoexcited even underneath the metal (Supplementary Fig 1 and Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The photoresponse of graphene photodetectors has been explained in terms of contributions from photovoltaic and photothermoelectric contributions23,24,25,26,27,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our MoS2 samples, the carrier mobilities and diffusivities are 23 orders of magnitude smaller than in graphene and the time period in which most of the photoexcited carriers recombine and/or are captured by defects is in the few picoseconds range12,20,21,22,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming similar mobilities and diffusivities of electrons and holes in MoS2, the photoexcited carriers, both free and bound (excitons), move, either by drift in the junction lateral electric field or by diffusion, less than 10 nm in 5 ps before they recombine and/or are captured by defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The photoexcited carrier distributions therefore do not change significantly in space during their lifetime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Separation of electrons and holes either by the junction lateral electric field or at the metal-MoS2 interface will contribute to the integral I2(t, t)dt(Vc(t)) (the measured dependence of the photoresponse on the junction electric field and the gate voltage is discussed in the Supplementary Figs 3 and 4 and Supplementary Note 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assume that the integral I2(t, t)dt is approximately proportional to the integral p(t, t) + n(t, t)dt (Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, p(t, t) and n(t, t) are the time-dependent photoexcited electron and hole densities in the junction, including carriers both free and bound (excitons).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assumption, although simple, allows one to relate the measured photoresponse to the carrier dynamics and, as shown below, the results thus obtained are in excellent agreement with the experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect that on much longer timescales, when the photoexcited carriers have recombined or been captured, the photoresponse is entirely thermoelectric in nature, as is the case in metalgraphene photodetectors23,25,26,27,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But in this letter we focus on the dynamics occurring on only short timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our results reveal the fast response time and the wide bandwidth of metal-MoS2 photodetectors and show that these detectors can be used for ultrafast applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results also shed light on the carrier recombination mechanisms and the associated timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we focused mainly on the carrier dynamics in this paper, the device intrinsic resistances and capacitances are not expected to fundamentally limit the device speed because of the rather small capacitances associated with the lateral metal-semiconductor junctions (Supplementary Note 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An obstacle to using TMDs in practical light emission and detection applications is the small values of the reported quantum efficiencies in these materials5,6,7,8,9,12,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In photodetectors, the response speed and the quantum efficiency are often inversely related39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most semiconductor photovoltaic detectors with large carrier mobilities and long recombination times (for example, group IIIV semiconductor photodetectors39), the transit time of the photogenerated carriers through the junction depletion region determines the detector bandwidth39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the relatively small carrier mobilities and diffusivities in MoS2, the fast carrier recombination times determine the speed in our metal-MoS2 detectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The price paid for the the fast response time is the small internal quantum efficiency: most of the photogenerated carriers recombine before they make it out into the circuit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The best reported carrier mobilities in monolayer MoS2 are an order of magnitude larger than in our devices and, therefore, metal-MoS2 photodetectors with internal quantum efficiencies around 0.1 (approximately an order of magnitude larger than of our devices) are possible without sacrificing the wide bandwidth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Density of defects, which contribute to carrier trapping and recombination, is also a parameter that can be potentially controlled in 2D TMD optoelectronic devices to meet the requirements for ultrafast or high quantum efficiency applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, vertical heterostructures of 2D TMD materials can also be used to circumvent the transport bottleneck in high speed applications 40.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
