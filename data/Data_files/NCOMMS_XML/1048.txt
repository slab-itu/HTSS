A simple optogenetic MAPK inhibitor design reveals resonance between transcription-regulating circuitry and temporally-encoded inputs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Engineering light-sensitive protein regulators has been a tremendous multidisciplinary challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optogenetic regulators of MAPKs, central nodes of cellular regulation, have not previously been described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present OptoJNKi, a light-regulated JNK inhibitor based on the AsLOV2 light-sensor domain using the ubiquitous FMN chromophore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OptoJNKi gene-transfer allows optogenetic applications, whereas protein delivery allows optopharmacology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Development of OptoJNKi suggests a design principle for other optically regulated inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this, we generate Optop38i, which inhibits p38MAPK in intact illuminated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurons are known for interpreting temporally-encoded inputs via interplay between ion channels, membrane potential and intracellular calcium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the consequences of temporal variation of JNK-regulating trophic inputs, potentially resulting from synaptic activity and reversible cellular protrusions, on downstream targets are unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using OptoJNKi, we reveal maximal regulation of c-Jun transactivation can occur at unexpectedly slow periodicities of inhibition depending on the inhibitors subcellular location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provides evidence for resonance in metazoan JNK-signalling circuits.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Optogenetics is the application of synthetic genes combining light-sensitive moieties with effector domains that transduce light into changes of protein and cell function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early implementations included light-driven proton pumps to charge mitochondria1 and regulation of G-proteins by exogenous rhodopsin to depolarize individually illuminated neurons2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Light-regulated synthetic channels are widely used in behavioural neuroscience3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second-generation optogenetics4 transduces light into functional regulation of signalling proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This goes beyond regulated firing of neurons, allowing manipulation of specific signalling events with high spatiotemporal precision5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multidisciplinary combinations of crystallography, directed evolution, molecular modelling, interweaving of homologous peptides and systematic iterative functional optimization6,7,8,9,10 have all been applied to develop optogenetic regulators of an increasing range of targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the number of optogenetically regulatable signalling targets remains limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optogenetic inhibitors are generated on a case-by-case basis and no generic guidelines exist for researchers wishing to develop optogenetic regulators of their proteins of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We aimed to develop a reusable approach for optical actuators, using c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) as a proof of concept.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The original caged RacGTPase paradigm used light-induced unfolding of the J-helix of oat phototrophin1 LOV2 domain (AsLOV2)11 to relieve steric hindrance6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, matching hydrophobic patches on second light-oxygen-voltage (LOV2) and GTPase surfaces were required to confer photoregulation6 and steric hindrance alone was not sufficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Engineering photoregulation into the related GTPase cdc42 necessitated crystallization of the LOV2-GTPase fusion protein6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternate strategy, developed to impose light-dependent steric hindrance to short effector peptides8,9, used sequences homologous to the J to be interwoven within the J sequence generating a chimera exhibiting light regulation9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strategy is useful for sequences of sufficient J homology that their introduction prevents neither photoregulation nor peptide-target interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, such interweaving can cause  greater than 10-fold increased photocycle rate9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Less homologous sequences were also embedded within or interwoven into the J-helix so that residues from J could be removed without loss of photoregulation in some cases, but not others8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In successful instances, this obviates the problematic need for engineering hydrophobic interactions into each fusion protein6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, a J homology strategy with multiple rational design/selection cycles led to a panel of 33 J-nuclear export sequence (NES) hybrids, of which two exhibited strong light regulation10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The group responsible also replaced J residues 540546 with a 7-residue nuclear localization sequence (NLS) with less, but apparently sufficient, homology to generate light-regulated nuclear localization12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This overlap strategy has been effective on several occasions, but is challenging and seems unlikely to be feasible for peptides with no homology to J.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Limitations remain unclear, however, as 5 of 30 bipartite NLS sequences tested, mostly fused to J.L546, also showed strong light regulation12, as did the photosensitive degron fused to AtLOV2J residue P616 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14) (equivalent to AsLOV2J.P547).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other optogenetic signalling regulators have been described but typically require two independent components and some even require exogenous chromophores4,5 unlike LOV2, a small (120 residue) photosensor domain based on a PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim domain) core that binds ubiquitous flavin mononucleotide (FMN) as chromophore11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While trying to avoid these limitations with a LOV2J-based tandem bait-prey design, we unexpectedly observe effective photoregulated steric hindrance of the LOV2J domain on a fused competitor of JNK docking, JIP1 (JNK-interacting protein1, also known as MAPK8IP1) residues 157167.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this, we derive a compact optogenetic JNK inhibitor, OptoJNKi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be generated in expression systems and introduced directly into cells, showing that recombinant optical regulators can be optopharmacological tools, complementing the optogenetic approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular dynamics simulation suggests that interaction of JIP inhibitor peptide C-terminal phenylalanine with a non-polar pocket between the LOV2 domain A/B loop and I strand might stabilize the dark state, enhancing light regulation of JIP peptide availability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We derive from this a design strategy we implement for another mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), p38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We fuse short peptides from the MKK3 D-domain sequence demonstrated to act as an unusually selective and potent inhibitor of p38 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15), followed by a C-terminal phenylalanine, to the AsLOV2J domain to generate steric hindrance depending on the J peptide state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find it possible to rapidly generate respectable dynamic range (difference in binding between dark-state and lit-state of two- to threefold at minimum) testing only a few peptides and demonstrate the corresponding Optop38i construct regulates p38MAPK in response to light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maximal inhibition of neuronal JNK pathways by OptoJNKi occurs at unexpectedly slow and context-dependent illumination periodicities, rather than more frequent illumination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests JNK pathways exhibit complex resonant properties which, when matched by corresponding input periodicities, leads to a larger effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose our design framework could help rapidly generate optogenetic as well as optopharmacological inhibitors of new targets of interest, perhaps even beyond MAPKs.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Optimization of lit-state/dark-state JNK-binding ratios', 'The FMN chromophore of AsLOV2 absorbs light, leading to formation of a covalent bond with LOV2 residue C450 followed by unfolding of the J-helix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process has potential to generate light-regulated peptides (Fig 1a), but this has proven challenging to implement (see above).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AsLOV2 C450A mutant prevents formation of the covalent bond and has been considered a dark-state mutant or dsm (Fig 1bi; note this may not completely eliminate light responsiveness16), whereas I539E mutation in the J-helix permanently disrupts helix formation, mimicking the lit-state6,17,18,19 (lsm, Fig 1bii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While evaluating strategies to circumvent limitations of previous optogenetic designs, we unexpectedly found that AsLOV2 (404546) (Fig 1c) conferred lit/dark-state dependence of JNK binding to fused peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared fusion of AsLOV2J mutants to 1013 amino acids, corresponding to MAPK8IP1 sequences around 157167 (refs 20, 21) (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equal amounts, tagged with firefly luciferase to facilitate quantitation22, were compared with JIP1-277, the N-terminal fragment of MAPK8IP1 that contains the JNK-binding domain (JBD)21, a constitutive inhibitor of JNK21,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A washed pulldown assay with recombinant bead-immobilized GST-JNK1 (Fig 1e) demonstrated that all peptides fused to LOV2J.lsm (I539E) bind to JNK1 (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positive control JIP1-277 exhibited the strongest binding followed by LOV2J.lsm-JIP11, which exhibited excellent dynamic range between lit and dark states (Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we used AsLOV2J-JIP11 fusion hereon for JNK inhibition, and refer to it as OptoJNKi after the cell-permeant D-form peptidic JNK inhibitor based on MAPK8IP1, D-JNKi25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Optimization of lit-state/dark-state JNK-binding ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic representation of the LOV2 domain from plant phototrophin 1, which has been used to engineer light-regulated steric hindrance on fused peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Absorption of a photon by the FMN chromophore generates a covalent bond with a cysteine leading to unfolding of the J-helix and, ideally, increased accessibility of the peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) The mutationally stabilized forms of Avena sativa LOV2J are shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (i) The dark-state mutant (dsm) harbours a C450A mutation that prevents covalent attachment of FMN, whereas (ii) in the lit-state mutant (lsm), the I539E mutant prevents J from forming a helix, increasing accessibility of the attached peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) The AsLOV2J(404-546) sequence used is shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residues mutated for some experiments (cysteine 450 for dark-state mutant, isoleucine 539 for lit-state mutant and phenylalanine 509 for distal hydrophobic pocket disruption) are highlighted in red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Sequence alignment of the 1013 amino-acid JNK-inhibitory peptides and their fusion to AsLOV2J (404546) via XbaI linker (encoding a SerArg dipeptide) is shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Schematic representation of pulldown assay using bead-immobilized GST-JNK1 incubated with luciferase-tagged constructs for quantification and normalization of inputs: (i) empty luciferase vector, (ii) the constitutive JBD JIP1-277 or (iiiiv) different JNK peptides fused to dark-state (C450A) or lit-state (I539E) mutants of AsLOV2J.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pulldown efficiency is measured as the per cent of input luciferase signal on GST-JNK1 beads (normalized to input signal).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) GST-JNK1 pulldown assay was performed using the inhibitory peptides as shown in Fig 1d fused to LOV2J dark-state (C/A) or lit-state (I/E) mutants, with JIP1-277 as positive control and unfused (empty) luciferase vector as negative control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All peptides bind detectably to JNK1 but JIP1-277 exhibited the strongest binding followed by the lit-state mutant of LOV2J-JIP11 (n=3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (g) Dynamic range between lit and dark states was calculated for each JIP peptide based on the experiments shown in Fig 1f.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LOV2J-JIP11, hereon referred to as OptoJNKi, shows the biggest change (n=3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  is indicated;

D-domains55,56 with or without C-terminal phenylalanine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When fused with LOV2J, pulldown by immobilized recombinant GST-p38 (Fig 10b) compares favourably with the p38 activator MKK3 (Fig 10c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, pulldown was greater (twofold) in the lit state than in the dark state but only if C-terminal phenylalanine was present (Fig 10c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C-terminal trimming to 10 amino acids resulted in reduced interaction but lost dependence on LOV2J mutational state even with C-terminal phenylalanine (Fig 10d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, even if a peptide retains competence to bind, additional requirements exist for engineering sensitivity to J state and the C-terminal phenylalanine is not sufficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To optimize dynamic range, we further constrained the peptide by removal of amino acids from its N terminus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the peptide may be partly helical, a single residue deletion could greatly influence orientation and in fact 213F loses responsiveness to LOV2J state (Fig 10e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Responsiveness was recovered by removing one more amino acid with 313F, which enhanced dynamic range compared with 113F.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the response to LOV2-J state was inverted by further deletion, generating constructs with high dynamic range, fivefold with 513F, and high binding in dark state (Fig 10e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect the shortest peptides may not reach the distal hydrophobic pocket of the PAS domain (Fig 9a,b) unless J is unfolded, which may provide a rational explanation for the transition from lit-state binding to dark-state binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, it is clear that our protocol in this case produced constructs sensitive to LOV2J state, improved dynamic range and moreover might provide a choice of active-to-inactive or inactive-to-active switching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine our strategy of adding C-terminal phenylalanine, we removed it from all constructs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cases, lit/dark state differences were lost (Fig 10c,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  JIP10 has an alternative hydrophobic residue (leucine, Fig 1d), reminiscent of some previously published peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optop38i, however, is less tolerant as replacement of F with L or V eliminated lit/dark state differences (Fig 10f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 10:

variants were efficiently pulled down by GST-p38, comparable to positive control Luc-MKK3b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only addition of C-terminal phenylalanine resulted in significant change in pulldown between dsm and lsm (n=6 or 3 for 113).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Pulldown of luciferase-fused Optop38i 110F and 113F (dsm and lsm) was compared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Removal of C-terminal residues 1113 eliminated lsm/dsm differences in pulldown (n=3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) N-terminal iterative trimming of inhibitor sequence with or without C-terminal phenylalanine was carried out to optimize lsm/dsm ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optop38i 313F showed a larger lsm/dsm pulldown ratio than earlier variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shorter sequences 413F and 513F showed reversed dsm/lsm selectivity with the greatest

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The advent of optogenetics provided researchers with powerful tools that manipulate living systems with exquisite spatiotemporal precision using non-invasive visible light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plethora of optical reporters to probe changes in cellular structure, second messenger levels, post-translational modifications and even conformation of individual proteins was until recently matched by few optical actuators, mostly chemically caged compounds released by ultraviolet light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synthetic biology has now provided numerous designer channels and proteins that can be activated in different cells and distinct subcellular regions for precisely defined periods or using temporally patterned inputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the design of an optogenetic regulator for a new target is often a strenuous multidisciplinary task guided by combinations of crystallography, directed evolution, library screening, molecular modelling and/or mutational interweaving strategies6,7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It therefore remains challenging for a typical research lab to implement new optogenetic designs for new proteins and pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we develop and evaluate a simple protocol for developing optogenetic regulators of new targets, specifically MAP kinases JNK and p38, for which the currently available tools are limited in spatiotemporal precision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that a LOV2-based regulator of JNK, OptoJNKi, can be applied as an optopharmacological tool without the need for gene transfer, and provide detailed protocols to successfully produce and transfer recombinant OptoJNKi into neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To target MAP kinases, we made use of known D-domain interactions55,56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found AsLOV2J sterically constrained JNK inhibitor peptides, showing considerable dark/lit-state JNK-binding ratios for the optimal peptide (30-fold, Fig 1f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was surprising considering reported difficulties achieving steric hindrance-based light regulation of either proteins or short peptides6,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular dynamic simulation suggested that phenylalanine at or near the C terminus could be caged by a novel non-polar LOV2 domain pocket formed between residues of the I-sheet and the A/B loop (Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This distal pocket might cooperate with the dark-state -helical form of the J sequence to constrain and thereby generate steric hindrance of fused inhibitor peptide that can be released by light, leading to light regulation of JNK that we observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this, a point mutation in this pocket releases the JIP sequence (without disrupting protein stability as judged by soluble expression level) so that dark-state binding to JNK became indistinguishable from lit-state binding (Fig 9d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These structural considerations suggested a simple protocol to implement a novel light-regulated inhibitor peptide without modelling, interweaving or major experimental undertakings like crystallography and directed evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A known short inhibitor peptide is selected and fused to the C terminus of AsLOV2J (404546) and terminated by a phenylalanine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The binding of lit- and dark-state mutants, evaluated by pulldown with immobilized target, is optimized by systematic removal of C- and N-terminal residues from the peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, selected constructs are validated in cell-based assays for known targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This protocol was sufficient to engineer a several-fold difference between lit- and dark-state forms for interaction and inhibition of p38 in few steps without requiring modification of the LOV2J photosensor itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed Optop38i3 allows a substantial light-evoked inhibition of MLK3-evoked p38 activation, though the constructs could perhaps be further optimized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the isoform preference by OptoJNKi could potentially be refined to achieve fully isoform-selective optical regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our optogenetic inhibitor design protocol might also be applicable to additional targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, D-domain selectivity can be reconfigured by minimal mutations57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generation of new inhibitors at least for different MAPK family members may be straightforward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To understand how important continuity of JNK activity is for traditional JNK outputs, we applied OptoJNKi in two JNK/c-Jun activation paradigms in primary cultured neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found constitutive MAP3K-evoked transcriptional responses is inhibited by OptoJNKi upon illumination or by constitutive JNK inhibitor, whether localized to the nucleus or the cytoplasm (with NLS or NES motifs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to expectation, however, inhibition by OptoJNKi did not monotonically decrease as periodicity of brief (1.5 s) illumination pulses lengthened.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NES-OptoJNKi exhibited maximal inhibition at relatively slow periodicities, showing sharply reduced inhibition in the 1560 s periodicity range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The c-Jun activation response to 4 h WTS, a commonly used neurodegeneration paradigm24,30,48,49,50, was particularly dependent on the first hour of WTS, and once again it was most strongly blocked by a slow inhibition periodicity (1.5 s illumination every 10 min).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are not consistent with a traditional kinase cascade model of the JNK pathway and indicate the presence of JNK-dependent regulatory pathways with distinct inhibitory resonances in a context and compartment-specific manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was recently reported that yeast MAPK pathways responding to osmotic stress resonate at a specific frequency of input stimulation, which results in substantial disruption of growth44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A corresponding MAPK resonance has not been reported in metazoans but the data presented here using periodic inhibition cycles may be the first evidence for this.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temporally encoded inputs are particularly relevant for neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, mature neurons integrated into a network have synaptic neurotransmitter inputs known to regulate JNK and p38 pathways58,59,60, Moreover, cells like new-born neurons dynamically growing out and retracting processes most likely receive time-variant target-derived trophic support stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These aspects have been very difficult to study, but tools like OptoJNKi and Optop38i may help achieve a more thorough understanding of how neuronal and other cells decode complex temporal and spatial patterns of MAPK pathway activation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

elements and no negative repeat elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The advantages of this domain are that it is small, 110 amino acids plus 20 residues from the J-helix, it has a ubiquitous chromophore (FMN) and light induces a transient adduct and conformational change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The synthetic sequences were obtained by de novo synthesis (Mr. Gene, Regensburg, Germany).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We

prevents the -helix from forming18) or the dark state (C450A, unable to form a covalent bind from the cysteine 450 to FMN so that absorption of light by FMN has been presumed to have no effect17.
