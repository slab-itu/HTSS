A reciprocal regulatory loop between TAZ/YAP and G-protein Gs regulates Schwann cell proliferation and myelination  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Schwann cell (SC) myelination in the peripheral nervous system is essential for motor function, and uncontrolled SC proliferation occurs in cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that a dual role for Hippo effectors TAZ and YAP in SC proliferation and myelination through modulating G-protein expression and interacting with SOX10, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Developmentally regulated mutagenesis indicates that TAZ/YAP are critical for SC proliferation and differentiation in a stage-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome-wide occupancy mapping and transcriptome profiling reveal that nuclear TAZ/YAP promote SC proliferation by activating cell cycle regulators, while targeting critical differentiation regulators in cooperation with SOX10 for myelination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further identify that TAZ targets and represses Gnas, encoding Gs-protein, which opposes TAZ/YAP activities to decelerate proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gnas deletion expands SC precursor pools and blocks peripheral myelination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the Hippo/TAZ/YAP and Gs-protein feedback circuit functions as a fulcrum balancing SC proliferation and differentiation, providing insights into molecular programming of SC lineage progression and homeostasis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Schwann cells (SCs) produce multilamellar myelin sheaths that are essential for saltatory conduction of action potentials and axonal integrity in the vertebrate peripheral nervous system (PNS)1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutually exclusive aspects of proliferation and differentiation must be tightly regulated to allow both processes to operate properly to generate sufficient SCs for subsequent differentiation and myelination in developing peripheral nerves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Defects in SC generation and differentiation during development and regeneration may cause a failure in myelinogenesis, contributing to acquired or hereditary peripheral neuropathies associated with motor and sensory disabilities4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, SC over-proliferation, caused by mutations in tumour suppressor genes NF1 and NF2, results in peripheral nerve sheath tumours such as neurofibromas5 and Schwannomas6, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'SC development is a molecularly and ultrastructurally well-defined, multi-stage process that occurs over a protracted period of time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After specification from neural crest cells and transitioning to a SC precursor state, SC precursors and immature SCs undergo proliferation and expansion to establish a one-to-one relationship with axons during the radial sorting process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shortly after birth, immature SCs differentiate into pro-myelinating cells and then further differentiate and form myelin sheaths around axons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SC lineage progression requires the coordinated activity of pro-myelinating factors (for example, SOX10, OCT6/POU3F1 and EGR2/KROX20) in promoting cell cycle exit and initiate differentiation, while suppressing negative regulatory factors of differentiation (for example, SOX2, NOTCH/HES and c-JUN)7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At present, the extrinsic and intrinsic signals that modulate and balance positive and negative factors to control SC proliferation and their transition to a differentiating state during peripheral myelination are not fully understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Signalling by the tumour suppressor Hippo is an evolutionary conserved pathway that controls organogenesis by regulating cell proliferation, differentiation and, when dysregulated, tumorigenesis9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yes-associated-protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding-motif (TAZ) are the major effectors of Hippo signalling12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  YAP and TAZ associate with DNA-binding transcription factors, such as TEAD14, to regulate downstream gene expression11,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upstream Hippo kinase cascades phosphorylate and inactivate TAZ/YAP, thereby preventing their nuclear translocation and leading to their ubiquitin-mediated degradation15,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TAZ/YAP activity can be regulated by multiple signalling pathways, including G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR), Transforming growth factor (TGF-), wingless/integrated (WNT), and NOTCH, and by mechanical stimuli19,20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of Gs-protein and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A pathways inhibits YAP activity through preventing its nuclear translocation, whereas elevation of G12/13 or Gi signalling, which antagonizes the Gs-mediated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) stimulation, enhances YAP expression19,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the activity of TAZ/YAP is tightly regulated in response to context-specific signals9,10,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, regulation of G-protein expression by YAP/TAZ remains elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recent studies indicate that TAZ/YAP are required for SC radial sorting and peripheral myelination through regulating laminin receptors22 or KROX20 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26), and in control of myelin internodal length27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ can be modulated by mechanical signals22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  YAP/TAZ interact with TEAD1 to regulate expression of myelination-associated genes including Pmp22 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28), suggesting that YAP/TAZ may directly regulate the transcriptional programme necessary for SC differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the phenotype of Taz/Yap double mutants is much more severe than those observed in mice lacking laminin receptors29, it is conceivable that YAP/TAZ regulate additional targets that are responsible for the severe peripheral dysmyelinating phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, the direct targets regulated by YAP/TAZ during SC lineage progression have not been fully defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether YAP/TAZ have a direct role in the transition from SC proliferation-to-differentiation remains unresolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we show that YAP/TAZ are expressed in SC nuclei in both culture and peripheral nerves through adulthood in mice and demonstrate that YAP/TAZ are crucial for SC proliferation in addition to myelin formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further map TAZ genome occupancy in SCs using chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) and reveal TAZ direct targets responsible for SC proliferation and differentiation processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify a TAZ target, Gnas, encoding Gs-protein, whereby Gs functions as a molecular link in a feedback regulation that attenuates TAZ/YAP activity and modulates the transition from SC proliferation to differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These novel mechanistic insights into how TAZ/YAP-mediated Hippo signalling and Gs-feedback circuits control the opposing aspects of SC proliferation and differentiation provide a rationale for context-specific targeting of TAZ and YAP for treating peripheral neuropathy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The opposing cell proliferation and differentiation processes are tightly regulated to ensure proper timing of SC lineage progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The underlying mechanisms that coordinate these processes are not fully understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our studies with SC lineage-specific and developmentally regulated mutagenesis approaches indicate that Hippo signalling effectors TAZ/YAP are required for SC proliferation, radial sorting and differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SC proliferation is a prerequisite for the subsequent events of differentiation and myelination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of TAZ/YAP is sufficient to induce SC proliferation, consistent with genome occupancy analysis showing that TAZ targets cell proliferation-associated genes including canonical Hippo-downstream effectors and cell cycle regulators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A recent study suggested that dysmyelination in mutants in which Taz/Yap were deleted using the P0-Cre line are mainly due to radial sorting defects22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we found that mice with Taz/Yap deletion in SC precursors using Dhh-Cre exhibit severe deficits in SC number and proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discrepancy could be due to the Cre lines: Dhh-Cre is expressed in earlier SC precursors beginning at E12.5 than is P0-Cre, which is expressed around E13.5 (refs 31, 45), raising the possibility that SC proliferation is regulated during the window between the inception of Dhh and P0 promoter activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the lack of substantial radial sorting defect in TazcKO single mutants at P7 (Supplementary Fig 2) may attribute to Dhh-Cre-mediated recombination, although we cannot exclude the possibility that there will be a sorting defect at later postnatal stages as examined in the previous report22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis demonstrated that the TAZ/YAP effect is dosage-dependent since a heterozygous allele in either Yap or Taz compensates for SC proliferation defects to certain extent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of Yap or Taz resulted in compensatory upregulation of expression of the non-deleted Taz or Yap gene product (Fig 2c), suggesting that YAP and TAZ are functionally redundant and that their expression levels are tightly regulated to maintain homeostatic state of SC development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although myelination-associated laminin receptor genes and Krox20 are reported as YAP/TAZ targets22,26, our genome occupancy and transcriptome profiling analyses revealed a global view of TAZ-targeted gene loci including those encoding essential SC differentiation regulators SOX10 and ZEB2 along with neuregulin receptors ERBB2/3 (refs 46, 47), in addition to the reported targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data further indicate that TAZ co-occupies with SOX10 on TEAD-binding sites in SCs, consistent with a recent finding of association of SOX10 binding sites with TEAD in the PNS, but not the CNS48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TAZ/SOX10 co-targeted elements are also associated with the activating H3K27Ac in the gene loci including Sox10, Zeb2 and Erbb2/3, encoding factors that positively regulate SC differentiation and myelination50,51,52,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly for what has been hitherto known as a co-activator, TAZ occupancy without SOX10 and H3K27Ac marks appears to repress expression of the genes associated with negative regulation of SC differentiation, suggesting that TAZ functions as a repressor in this context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, by using Plp-CreERT-induced Taz/Yap deletion, we showed that Taz/Yap are required for initiation of differentiation from immature SCs and myelin formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, similar to a recent study from Grove et al.26, deletion of Taz/Yap in adult mice by Plp-CreERT resulted in severe tremors and ataxia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mice died within 1 month after tamoxifen treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the Grove et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  study, we did not observe appreciable alteration in myelin thickness or axonal integrity in peripheral nerves after 36 days post tamoxifen treatment (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the exact mechanism underlying the discrepancy remains to be determined, it is possible that the use of different Plp-CreERT lines35,54 or genetic backgrounds may account for different phenotypes in myelin maintenance in sciatic nerves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, TAZ/YAP may regulate physiological properties of SCs and axo-glial interactions, or perhaps, that the essential function of TAZ/YAP in Plp-expressing non-SCs such as spleen, liver, kidney and lung55 may cause animal death besides demyelination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  YAP was reported to play a role in oligodendrocyte morphology and maturation in response to mechanical factors56, however, we did not detect overt myelin abnormalities in the adult corpus callosum or spinal cord of TazYapiKO mice (Supplementary Fig 6), suggesting that TAZ/YAP are not required for CNS myelin maintenance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our observations suggest that TAZ/YAP are critical for SC proliferation and the myelination onset during SC development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A recent study indicates that TAZ and YAP are present predominantly in the cytoplasm of SCs at high cell density, and that mechano-stimulation promotes their translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, in cultured SC and in intact sciatic nerves, we detected expression of TAZ and YAP primarily in the nuclei of SCs at both low and high density, consistent with their function as transcriptional regulators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The underlying discrepancy is likely due to different culture conditions since our finding is consistent with the previous study22 when SCs were plated in glass coverslips, indicating that intracellular localization is context-dependent for TAZ and YAP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recent studies indicate that Hippo effectors acts downstream of GPCR signalling19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of Gs-coupled GPCRs has been shown to inhibit TAZ/YAP nuclear translocation and their activity19,57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with Gs function, Gpr126, which is able to couple to Gs, is required for proper SC development and myelination58,59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, we found that Gs-encoding Gnas itself is a direct transcriptional target of TAZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite TAZ being observed thus far to be a co-activator, activation of TAZ/YAP inhibits expression of Gnas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gs protein levels are low under proliferative conditions and upregulated during SC differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, Gnas deletion leads to excessive SC proliferation while inhibiting SC differentiation, suggesting that Gs protein levels regulate the transition of SC proliferation to differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radial sorting defects in Gnas mutants appear less severe compared to the Taz/Yap double mutant26,58 (Supplementary Figs 2 and 5) or Gpr126 mutant22,26,58, this suggests that these pathways may regulate radial sorting via additional mechanisms other than Gs-dependent mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, our findings identify a crucial role of the reciprocal signalling of TAZ/YAP and Gs in regulating SC proliferation-to-differentiation transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gnas knockdown in SCs lead to a downregulation of cAMP levels (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, Oct6 appears upregulated in Gnas and Taz/Yap mutant sciatic nerves26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since Oct6 is a downstream target of cAMP signalling in SCs, it is possible that Gs functions in cAMP-dependent and -independent mechanisms during SC development in sciatic nerves, or perhaps, other pathways may activate Oct6 expression in the absence of Gs-signalling in Gnas-mutant nerves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given that YAP/TAZ remain active in adult SCs, Gs downregulation at late developmental stages in differentiated SCs may allow the pro-differentiation effects of TAZ/YAP, in collaboration with SOX10, on regulation of the SC myelination programme to prevail (Fig 8m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that changes in G-protein levels may account for a switch in the net effect of YAP/TAZ on proliferation versus differentiation during SC development in a stage-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our ChIP-seq data indicate that TAZ targets an intronic region in the Gnas locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although transcriptional regulators can bind to regions of open chromatin without functional effect60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ChIP-PCR confirms that TAZ binds to the targeted sites on the Gnas locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By overexpression of TAZ or YAP, Gnas transcription is attenuated, while reduction of TAZ/YAP by siRNA knockdown leads to an upregulation of Gnas, suggesting that TAZ may transcriptionally represses Gnas expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth noting that since the expression pattern of Gnas does not strictly correlate with that of Taz and Yap mRNA, it is unlikely that TAZ is the sole repressor of Gnas expression, which could be also regulated by other mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, Gnas deficiency leads to an upregulation of Taz/Yap as well as Gli1-3 expression in Gnas-mutant nerves (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with Gs function as a tumour suppressor that inhibits Sonic hedgehog signalling and Hippo signalling-mediated cell proliferation in medulloblastoma or basal-cell carcinoma44,61,62, suggesting a reciprocal and antagonistic function between Gs signalling and Hippo/hedgehog pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our findings place Gs-mediated signalling in an unanticipated role as a key modulator that antagonizes TAZ/YAP effects during the onset of SC differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that the TAZ/YAP/Gs regulatory loop acts as a feedback circuit that balances SC proliferation and differentiation (Fig 8m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As constitutive activation of either YAP or TAZ enhances proliferation of cultured SCs, this Gs regulatory loop may serve to limit SC proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, Gs activation results in reduced SC proliferation, whereas Gnas deletion leads to a drastic increase in SC proliferation, consistent with a tumour suppressor function of Gnas in other contexts44,61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our findings establish Gs as a critical node in the inhibitory feedback-loop that antagonizes TAZ/YAP activity in regulating the balance between SC proliferation and differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies aimed at modulating or fine-tuning the dynamic balance between YAP/TAZ and Gs may lead to therapeutic strategies to promote myelination in the PNS while inhibiting SC over-proliferation that occurs during formation of peripheral nerve sheath tumours such as neurofibromas and Schwannomas.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
