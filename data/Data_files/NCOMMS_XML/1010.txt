JunB is essential for IL-23-dependent pathogenicity of Th17 cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'CD4+ T-helper cells producing interleukin-17 (IL-17), known as T-helper 17 (TH17) cells, comprise heterogeneous subsets that exhibit distinct pathogenicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although pathogenic and non-pathogenic TH17 subsets share a common RORt-dependent TH17 transcriptional programme, transcriptional regulatory mechanisms specific to each of these subsets are mostly unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that the AP-1 transcription factor JunB is critical for TH17 pathogenicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  JunB, which is induced by IL-6, is essential for expression of RORt and IL-23 receptor by facilitating DNA binding of BATF at the Rorc locus in IL-23-dependent pathogenic TH17 cells, but not in TGF-1-dependent non-pathogenic TH17 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Junb-deficient T cells fail to induce TH17-mediated autoimmune encephalomyelitis and colitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, JunB deficiency does not affect the abundance of gut-resident non-pathogenic TH17 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The selective requirement of JunB for IL-23-dependent TH17 pathogenicity suggests that the JunB-dependent pathway may be a therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing T-helper 17 (TH17) cells, exhibiting heterogeneous pathogenicity, serve diverse biological functions1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pathogenic TH17 cells have a central function in autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases4,5,6, whereas non-pathogenic TH17 cells, which accumulate in the gut at steady state, are probably involved in gut homoeostasis and host defence7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pathogenicity of TH17 cells is associated with cytokine signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A subset of TH17 cells induced in the presence of transforming growth factor 1 (TGF-1) and IL-6 (hereafter referred to as TH17())10,11,12 is non-pathogenic, because transfer of the cells into mice induces weak or no experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, another subset of TH17 cells generated in the presence of IL-6, IL-1 and IL-23 (hereafter referred to as TH17(23)) is highly pathogenic, and transfer of these cells into mice induces severe EAE13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it is broadly accepted that IL-23 is needed for TH17 cell pathogenicity and that it can induce pathogenicity in previously non-pathogenic TH17 cells15,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, mice deficient in IL-23 signalling are resistant to EAE and chronic colitis15,17,19,20, but they have normal numbers of gut-resident TH17 cells at steady state21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The critical function of IL-23 signalling for TH17 pathogenicity is also evidenced by a correlation between IL-23 mutation and human autoimmune diseases22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Pathogenic and non-pathogenic TH17 cells differentially express a number of genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, anti-inflammatory IL-10 is specifically induced in TH17() cells, whereas inflammatory granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is preferentially produced by TH17(23) cells13,14,23,24,25 to contribute to the pathogenicity of TH17 cells26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, pathogenic and non-pathogenic TH17 cells express a subset of molecules (TH17 signature genes) comparably, including Il17a, Il17f and Il23 receptor (Il23r)13,23,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Induction of these TH17 signature genes is regulated by transcription factors including basic leucine zipper ATF-like transcription factor (BATF), interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and RORt in both pathogenic and non-pathogenic TH17 cells28,29,30,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BATF and IRF4 are induced by T-cell receptor signalling and bind to loci of a large number of genes, including TH17 signature genes, where they promote chromatin accessibility29,33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under TH17-polarizing conditions, cytokine signals activate STAT3 and induce RORt, both of which bind to loci of TH17 genes occupied by BATF and IRF4 and activate TH17 gene transcription28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-6 activates STAT3 through JAK-mediated phosphorylation35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is unclear how RORt induction is regulated by different combinations of cytokines under TH17()- and TH17(23)-polarizing conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we show that, in an RNAi screen of transcription factors involved in IL-23 signalling, an AP-1 transcription factor, JunB, is required for IL-23-dependent gene induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional analyses show that JunB is required for induction of RORt in pathogenic TH17(23) cells, but not in non-pathogenic TH17() cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistically, JunB facilitates DNA binding of BATF, IRF4 and STAT3 at multiple gene loci including Rorc (encoding RORt) and Il17a under TH17(23)-polarizing conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we show that JunB is essential for pathogenicity of TH17 cells in EAE and colitis models, but it is not required for generation of non-pathogenic, gut-resident TH17 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that the JunB-dependent pathway is required for IL-23-dependent pathogenicity of TH17 cells.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

single-producing cells (Fig 6e), suggesting that defects in generation of TH17 cells observed in Junb-deficient mice might not be due to increased plasticity of TH17 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, in an inflammatory context, JunB is likely required for generation of TH17 cells that are competent to differentiate to IFN--producing cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To assess whether JunB is also required

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Recent studies have revealed functionally distinct subsets within a TH17 population, distinguishable by their pathogenicity and gene expression profiles1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TGF-1/IL-6-induced TH17() cells are non-pathogenic, but IL-6/IL-1/IL-23-induced TH17(23) cells are pathogenic13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, IL-23 facilitates pathogenicity of TH17() cells14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a number of genes are differentially induced between TH17() and TH17(23) subsets, which probably contribute to their different pathogenicity, differentiation of both TH17() and TH17(23) subsets relies on a common TH17 transcription programme composed of BATF, IRF4, STAT3 and RORt28,29,30,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mechanisms of RORt induction in TGF-1-dependent TH17 cells and IL-23-dependent TH17 cells have not been fully understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we demonstrate that induction of RORt is differentially regulated in TGF-1-dependent TH17 cells and IL-23-dependent TH17 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the RNAi screen of transcription factors responsible for IL-23 signalling, we found that JunB is critical for IL-23-dependent TH17 generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our in vitro results indicate that JunB is essential for RORt induction in IL-23-dependent TH17 cells, but not in TGF-1-dependent TH17 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our in vivo results also show a similar selective requirement of JunB in a subset of TH17 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  JunB is likely dispensable for generation of gut-resident non-pathogenic TH17 cells at steady state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, JunB is required for generation of pathogenic TH17 cells in EAE and colitis models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar phenotype has been observed in mice deficient in IL-23 signalling15,17,19, supporting a model in which JunB facilitates IL-23-dependent pathogenic TH17 production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'JunB is critical for DNA binding of BATF, IRF4 and STAT3 at the Rorc locus under TH17(23)-polarizing conditions, but not under TH17()-polarizing conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, loss of JunB has little effect on DNA binding of these transcription factors at the Ctla4 locus, expression of which is regulated independently of JunB even in TH17(23) conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that JunB is likely required for recruitment or stable DNA binding of BATF, IRF4 and STAT3 in a target site-dependent manner under TH17(23)-polarizing conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A heterodimer of BATF and JunB, in conjunction with IRF4, binds to AP-1-IRF composite elements in many genes, including Rorc and Il17a (refs 33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, other Jun proteins, c-Jun and JunD, also interact with BATF/IRF4 and bind to AP-1-IRF composite elements33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, RNAi ablation of c-Jun impairs TGF-1-dependent TH17 differentiation45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that DNA-binding activity of BATF may be controlled by its AP-1 heterodimer partners, including JunB and c-Jun, in a target site- and context-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'IL-23 is required for maturation and maintenance of TH17 cells, which are likely linked to acquisition of TH17 pathogenic cytokine-producing ability and functional plasticity in the late phase of TH17 development6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data show that a subset of TH17 cells is generated independently of JunB in the early phase of EAE, but full development of inflammatory TH17 cells depends on JunB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that JunB may be important for IL-23-dependent maturation and maintenance of TH17 cells, which are probably generated in a TGF--dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, our in vitro data show that JunB facilitates IL-23-dependent maintenance of IL-17-producing ability of TGF-/IL-6-induced TH17 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in vivo TH17-fate-mapping data indicate that JunB is important for generation of TH17-derived IFN--producing cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seemingly contradicting the in vivo observation, however, JunB deficiency results in abnormal induction of T-bet and IFN- in TH17 cells in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, our ChIP-seq results show that JunB, together with BATF, IRF4 and STAT3, binds to the Tbx21 locus, suggesting direct regulation of T-bet expression by JunB in TH17 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data suggest that JunB may control TH17 plasticity in part by positively or negatively regulating T-bet expression in TH17 cells in a developmental-phase-dependent manner, probably by interacting with distinct transcription factors or epigenetic regulators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'RORt regulates induction of a restricted subset of TH17 genes29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, JunB deficiency impairs expression of a small number of genes, such as Il17a, Il17f and Il23r under TH17(23)-polarizing conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite impaired induction of a limited number of TH17 genes, Junb-deficient T cells lose their ability to induce EAE and colitis, implying a critical function of these JunB-regulated genes in TH17 pathogenicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As Il-23r-deficient T cells are also incapable of inducing TH17-dependent diseases17, JunB-dependent IL-23R induction is likely critical for pathogenicity of TH17 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, given that IL-23 signalling is important for RORt expression in the absence of TGF-1, it is possible that the diminished RORt expression in Junb-deficient TH17(23) cells might be due to impaired IL-23R induction, which is needed for full induction of RORt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It has been suggested that GM-CSF and IFN- are involved in TH17 pathogenicity26,27,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, JunB is not required for induction of GM-CSF and IFN- under TH17(23)-polarizing conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that GM-CSF and IFN- need to be produced by JunB-dependent TH17 cells to exert their pathogenic functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent report demonstrated that Blimp1, which is induced by IL-23 in vivo, is critical for pathogenic TH17 differentiation42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, our ChIP-seq data showed that JunB and BATF/IRF4 bind to the Prdm1 locus in TH17 cells in vitro, suggesting that JunB may have a function in regulation of Blimp1 expression at late stages of TH17 differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that JunB binds to the Cd5l locus in TH17(23) cells, but not in TH17() cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD5L is induced in non-pathogenic TH17 cells and inhibits their pathogenicity43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is intriguing to speculate that JunB-dependent negative regulation of CD5L production may be involved in regulation of pathogenicity of TH17 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although JunB is required for RORt induction specifically in TH17(23) cells, another pathway that is activated by TGF-1 may compensate for the absence of JunB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the main TGF-1 signalling pathway is mediated by SMAD2, SMAD3 and SMAD4 transcription factors, previous data have shown that the SMAD-dependent pathway is unnecessary for TGF-1-dependent RORt induction47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our preliminary analysis showed that TGF-1 receptor kinase inhibitor (SB43152) treatment significantly inhibited Rorc induction in TH17() cells, whereas there was only a partial or no reduction of Rorc expression in TH17() cells treated with TGF-1 signalling regulators, including JNK inhibitor (SP600125), MEK inhibitor (PD98059), p38 inhibitor (SB203580), PI3 kinase inhibitor (LY294002), SMAD3 inhibitor (SIS3) or ROCK inhibitor (Y27632) (Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, TGF- receptor kinase activity may be important for JunB-independent TH17 differentiation, but the downstream signalling pathways remain unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we demonstrate that JunB is selectively required for activation of the TH17 core transcription programme in IL-23-dependent pathogenic TH17 cells, but that the JunB-independent pathway is sufficient to activate the same programme in TGF-1-dependent, non-pathogenic TH17 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  JunB is essential for expression of RORt, by promoting DNA binding of BATF, IRF4 and STAT3 at the Rorc locus in IL-23-dependent pathogenic TH17 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Junb-deficient T cells are incapable of inducing EAE and colitis, but loss of JunB does not seem to affect TH17 generation in the gut at steady state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the JunB-dependent pathway could be an attractive therapeutic target to suppress pathogenicity of TH17 cells, while maintaining beneficial TH17 populations.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

MOG3555 peptides (300 g per mouse) in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) (100 l per mouse) containing dead Mycobacterium tuberculosis (1 mg per mouse).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pertussis toxin (400 ng per mouse) was also intraperitoneally injected into the mice twice on day 0 and on day 2 post immunization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disease severity was evaluated on a scale of 15 as follows: 1, limp tail; 2, partially paralysed hind legs; 3, completely paralysed hind legs; 4, complete hind and partial front leg paralysis; 5, completely paralysed hind and front legs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice with disease score 5 were considered moribund and were killed by CO2 inhalation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ", 'Colitis induction', 'CD4+CD45RBhiCD25 T cells were purified from CD4+ T cells isolated from spleens and LNs of Cd4CreJunbfl/fl and control mice, and intraperitoneally injected into Rag1-deficient mice (4 × 105 cells per mouse).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disease progress was monitored by weighing the mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
