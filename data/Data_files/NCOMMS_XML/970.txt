Quantum-circuit refrigerator  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Quantum technology promises revolutionizing applications in information processing, communications, sensing and modelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, efficient on-demand cooling of the functional quantum degrees of freedom remains challenging in many solid-state implementations, such as superconducting circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate direct cooling of a superconducting resonator mode using voltage-controllable electron tunnelling in a nanoscale refrigerator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is revealed by a decreased electron temperature at a resonator-coupled probe resistor, even for an elevated electron temperature at the refrigerator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our conclusions are verified by control experiments and by a good quantitative agreement between theory and experimental observations at various operation voltages and bath temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the future, we aim to remove spurious dissipation introduced by our refrigerator and to decrease the operational temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such an ideal quantum-circuit refrigerator has potential applications in the initialization of quantum electric devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the superconducting quantum computer, for example, fast and accurate reset of the quantum memory is needed.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Engineered quantum systems show great potential in providing a spectrum of devices superior to the present state of the art in information technological applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since quantum technological devices operate at the level of single energy quanta, they exhibit very low tolerance against external perturbations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, they need to be extremely well isolated from all sources of dissipation during their quantum coherent operation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These properties typically lead to an elevated steady-state temperature and long natural initialization times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, finding a versatile active refrigerator for quantum devices is of great importance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One of the greatest challenges of this century is to build a working large-scale quantum computer1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, a superconducting quantum computer3 has reached the required gate and measurement accuracy thresholds for fault-tolerant quantum error correction4,5 (see also ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This device builds on the decade-long development of circuit quantum electrodynamics7,8,9,10, that is, the study of superconducting quantum bits, qubits, coupled to on-chip microwave resonators11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although several methods have been demonstrated to initialize superconducting qubits14,15,16,17,18,19,20 and resonators21, they are typically suited only for a very specific type of a system and the achieved fidelities fall below the demanding requirements of efficient fault-tolerant quantum computing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, circuit quantum electrodynamics provides an ideal context for the demonstration of a quantum refrigerator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Electronic microcoolers based on normal metalinsulatorsuperconductor (NIS) tunnel junctions22,23 offer opportunities24 to cool electron systems well below the temperature of the phonon bath even at macroscopic sizes25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the ideally exponential tunability of the NIS cooling and input powers using an applied bias voltage, these tunnel junctions are attractive candidates for quantum refrigerators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although single-charge tunnelling has previously been demonstrated to emit and absorb energy quanta26,27,28,29 even in applications such as the quantum cascade laser30, and artificial-atom masers31,32,33, it has not been experimentally utilized to directly cool engineered quantum circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even the recently demonstrated autonomous Maxwells demon has only been used to refrigerate dissipative electron systems34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this work, we utilize photon-assisted electron tunnelling to cool a prototype superconducting quantum circuit, namely a transmission line resonator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tunnelling takes place in NIS junctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since an electron tunnelling event changes the voltage across the resonator, it may simultaneously induce quantum transitions in the resonator modes35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to the energy gap in the superconductor density of states, only the most energetic electrons can escape the normal metal in analogy with evaporative cooling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a tunnelling process where the electron absorbs a photon from the resonator, simultaneously increasing its energy, is favoured against photon emission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the key phenomenon leading to the refrigeration of the resonator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We refer to the NIS tunnel junctions and their coupling circuitry as the quantum-circuit refrigerator (QCR), which is a stand-alone component for cooling the operational quantum degrees of freedom in different types of under-damped quantum electric devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The photon-assisted cooling of the resonator mode is suggested by our qualitative observation that a distant probe resistor electrically coupled to the resonator cools down even if the temperature of the QCR, and of the other heat baths, is elevated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This claim is reinforced by the absence of cooling in a control sample, in which the coupling between the probe and the microwave resonator is suppressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we obtain a good quantitative agreement between our theoretical model and the experimental results over a broad range of QCR operation voltages and bath temperatures, providing firm evidence of our conclusion that we directly refrigerate the resonator mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also verify that the resonator has a well-defined resonance.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

energetically favourable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, elastic tunnelling is dominating here since photon-assisted tunnelling is suppressed by the small environmental parameter =4.7 × 103.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this operation voltage, elastic tunnelling mostly removes electrons below the Fermi energy of the normal metal and adds electrons above it, leading to the heating of the QCR electrons.

the emission of photons from the tunnelling electrons is suppressed by the relatively low-thermal population of the high-energy excitations in the normal metal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the highlighted region of Fig 3a, the refrigeration of the resonator by photon-assisted tunnelling is competing with the power flowing into the resonator from the increasing electron temperature at the QCR.

dominating energy flows into the conduction electrons of the probe resistor are obtained from their coupling to the substrate phonons and to the resonator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coupling to the

In addition, we take into account a weak residual heating of the probe resistor due to the power dissipation at the QCR, a constant thermal conductance to an excess bath and a constant heating of the

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The main result of this work is the demonstrated principle that single-electron tunnelling between a normal metal and a superconductor can be used to refrigerate a microwave resonator on demand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the future, we aim to optimize the set-up for minimal ohmic and other spurious losses (Supplementary Notes 4 and 9) and for low-resonator temperatures by improving the design, nanofabrication, shielding and filtering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An ideally working QCR can potentially refrigerate a multitude of high-quality quantum circuits with many conceivable applications such as precise qubit initialization for large-scale, gate-based quantum computing, quantum-state engineering driven by dissipation38 and active enhancement of ground-state population in quantum annealing39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When inactive, such an ideal refrigerator does not degrade the quantum coherence as desired.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To decrease the base temperature achieved with our device, multiple refrigerators may be cascaded with each other41 or with distant ohmic reservoirs at very low temperatures42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In our experiments, the relatively low-quality factor of the resonator is a result of the chosen measurement scheme: rather strong dissipative coupling between the resonator photons and the probe resistor is needed to achieve conveniently measurable temperature changes at the probe resistor when the resonator is being refrigerated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the future, different probe schemes may be employed where such limitation is absent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include amplification and analysis of the resonator output signal43,44 and measurement of the resonator occupation using a superconducting qubit8,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the ohmic losses due to the QCR may be overcome by minimizing its resistance and by moving it to the end of the resonator where the current profile of the resonator mode ideally vanishes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, this does not reduce the cooling power of the QCR, which utilizes the voltage profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As discussed in more detail in Supplementary Note 4, this type of straightforward improvements of the QCR are expected to allow for resonator quality factors46 in the range of 106 when the QCR is inactive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a level of dissipation is low enough for the undisturbed operation of quantum devices in their known applications.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
