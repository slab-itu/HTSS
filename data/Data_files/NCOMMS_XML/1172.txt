Identification and characterization of a novel botulinum neurotoxin  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Botulinum neurotoxins are known to have seven serotypes (BoNT/AG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report a new BoNT serotype, tentatively named BoNT/X, which has the lowest sequence identity with other BoNTs and is not recognized by antisera against known BoNTs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to BoNT/B/D/F/G, BoNT/X cleaves vesicle-associated membrane proteins (VAMP) 1, 2 and 3, but at a novel site (Arg66-Ala67 in VAMP2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, BoNT/X is the only toxin that also cleaves non-canonical substrates VAMP4, VAMP5 and Ykt6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate its activity, a small amount of full-length BoNT/X was assembled by linking two non-toxic fragments using a transpeptidase (sortase).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assembled BoNT/X cleaves VAMP2 and VAMP4 in cultured neurons and causes flaccid paralysis in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, BoNT/X is a novel BoNT with a unique substrate profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its discovery posts a challenge to develop effective countermeasures, provides a novel tool for studying intracellular membrane trafficking, and presents a new potential therapeutic toxin for modulating secretions in cells.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'BoNTs are a family of bacterial toxins, classified as one of the six most dangerous potential bioterrorism agents (Category A and Tier 1 select agent in the United States)1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are also widely used to treat a growing list of medical conditions2,3, including muscle spasms, chronic pain, overactive bladders, as well as having cosmetic applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are seven well-established serotypes of BoNTs (BoNT/AG), traditionally defined based on a lack of cross-neutralization by different antisera raised against each toxin type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All BoNTs share the same structure and function4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are composed of a light chain (LC, 50 kDa) and a heavy chain (HC, 100 kDa) connected by an inter-chain disulfide bond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HC contains two sub-domains: the C-terminal HC that mediates binding to receptors, and the N-terminal HN that mediates translocation of the LC across endosomal membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LC acts as a protease in neurons to cleave a set of proteins: BoNT/A, C and E cleave at distinct sites on a peripheral membrane protein known as SNAP-25; BoNT/B, D, F and G cleave at different sites on homologous vesicle proteins VAMP1, 2 and 3 (vesicle-associated membrane proteins); and BoNT/C also cleaves the plasma membrane protein syntaxin 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These proteins are prototypes of the SNARE (soluble NSF attachment protein receptor) protein family, whose members mediate various membrane fusion events in eukaryotic cells7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cleavage of any one of the three neuronal SNARE proteins blocks fusion of synaptic vesicles to plasma membranes, thus preventing neurotransmitter release from neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recognizing all distinct serotypes of BoNTs is essential for developing effective countermeasures against this family of toxins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BoNT/A and BoNT/B were first identified in 1919 by Georgina Burke9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The last of the seven serotypes, BoNT/G, was discovered in 1969 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10), and no new BoNT serotype has been found for the past four decades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent progress in genomic sequencing has revealed multiple subtypes (designated with Arabic numbers, for example, BoNT/A1), which can be recognized by the same antiserum but contain substantial sequence variations11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, there are also multiple mosaic toxins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, a type H was reported in 2013 but was later designated as a mosaic toxin, as its LC shares 80% identity with the LC of a BoNT/F subtype, BoNT/F5, and its HC shares 84% identity with the HC of BoNT/A1 (refs 14, 15, 16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, this toxin can be neutralized by antibodies against BoNT/A (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The genes encoding BoNTs can be on a plasmid, a phage, or the chromosome, indicating that these genes are mobile and capable of horizontal gene transfer18,19,20,21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some strains contain two or even three different BoNT genes15,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These strains are usually designated with a capital letter for the toxin type that is expressed at higher levels than the other one, followed with a lower case letter for the second toxin type (for example, BoNT/Af strain).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, it has also been reported that some BoNT/A strains contain a complete BoNT/B gene, but only BoNT/A is expressed26,27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the BoNT/B gene is considered a silent gene and the strains are known as BoNT/A(B) strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent survey of infant botulism cases reported that 8% isolates are BoNT/A(B) strains29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we searched published genomic sequences and identified a novel BoNT gene encoded on the chromosome of Clostridium botulinum strain 111.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strain was originally identified from an infant botulism patient in Japan in 1996 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial characterizations indicated that the toxicity of this strain is due to BoNT/B30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Later studies confirmed that this strain expresses a subtype of BoNT/B (BoNT/B2) encoded on a plasmid31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequence of this novel BoNT gene was deposited into the GenBank database in February 2015, as a part of the genomic sequence of C. botulinum 111.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We characterized the protein encoded by this gene at functional levels and established it as a new BoNT serotype with a unique substrate profile.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Searching genomic databases revealed a novel BoNT gene', 'In an attempt to survey the evolutionary landscape of BoNTs, we performed iterative Hidden Markov model searches of the Uniprot sequence database.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our search identified all known BoNT subtypes and mosaic toxins, as well as the related tetanus neurotoxin (Fig 1a; Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our surprise, the search revealed a potentially new BoNT, tentatively designated BoNT/X (Fig 1a, GenBank no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  : BAQ12790.1), from the recently reported genomic sequence of C. botulinum strain 111.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BoNT/X showed the least protein sequence identity with the other BoNTs in pairwise comparisons (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the low sequence similarity is evenly distributed along the entire BoNT/X sequence (Fig 1c), indicating that it is not a mosaic toxin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this low sequence identity, the overall domain arrangement of BoNTs is conserved in BoNT/X (Fig 1c), including a zinc-dependent protease motif HEXXH (residues 227231, HELVH) in the LC (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33), and a SXWY motif in the HC (residues 1,2741,277, SAWY), which recognizes the lipid receptor gangliosides34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Identification of BoNT/X.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) A phylogenetic split network covering all BoNT serotypes, subtypes, mosaic toxins and related tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) illustrates their potential evolutionary relationships, as well as conflicts arising from e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  chimerisms, based on their protein sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BoNT/X is highlighted in red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An enlarged version of this panel is shown in Supplementary Fig 1, with the sequence access number for each toxin gene noted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) A phylogenic tree of the protein sequence alignment for BoNT/A-G, TeNT and BoNT/X, analysed by the ClustalW method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentages of sequence identity between each toxin and BoNT/X are noted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Upper panel: a schematic drawing of the three domains of BoNT/X, with conserved protease motif in the LC and the ganglioside binding motif in the HC noted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lower panel: analysis using a sliding sequence comparison window demonstrated that the low similarity between BoNT/X and other BoNTs/TeNT is evenly distributed along the entire BoNT/X sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The X axis represents the query sequence position at the center of a 100-amino-acid moving sequence-comparison window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Y axis shows the percentage of identity between that sequence window and each of the aligned background sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two bars at the top of the graph illustrate the best matching sequence (lower bar) and whether the best match is significantly separated from the second-best match (upper bar).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) A schematic drawing of the orf gene cluster that hosts the BoNT/X gene (upper panel), which has two distinct features compared with other known orfX clusters (middle and lower panels): (1) there is an additional orfX2 protein (designated orfX2b) located next to the BoNT/X gene; (2) the reading frame of orfX genes has the same direction as the BoNT/X gene.Full size image', 'Similar to the other BoNTs, the BoNT/X gene is located in a gene cluster23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All seven established BoNTs are co-expressed with another 150 kDa protein known as NTNHA (non-toxic non-hemagglutinin protein), which forms a pH-dependent complex with BoNTs and protects them from proteases in the gastrointestinal tract35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BoNT/X gene is also preceded by a potential NTNHA gene (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides BoNT and NTNHA, a typical BoNT gene cluster contains genes encoding one of the two types of accessory proteins: (1) the HA cluster encoding three conserved proteins HA17, HA33 and HA70, which form a complex with BoNT/NTNHA and facilitate absorption of toxins across the intestinal epithelial barrier36,37,38; or (2) the OrfX cluster encoding conserved OrfX1, OrfX2, OrfX3 and P47 proteins with unknown function23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BoNT/X gene is located in an OrfX gene cluster, as are BoNT/E, F and members of BoNT/A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the BoNT/X cluster has two unique features (Fig 1d): (1) there is an additional OrfX2 gene that does not exist in any other BoNT clusters (we designated it OrfX2b); (2) the reading frame of OrfX genes is usually opposite to BoNT/NTNHA genes, but it has the same direction as the BoNT/X gene in the BoNT/X cluster (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that BoNT/X is a unique branch of the BoNT family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The LC of BoNT/X cleaves VAMP2 at a novel site', 'To characterize BoNT/X, we first focused on its LC (X-LC, residues 1439) and produced it as a His6-tagged protein in Escherichia coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LCs of BoNT/A (A-LC) and BoNT/B (B-LC) were produced and assayed in parallel as controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incubation of X-LC with rat brain detergent extracts (BDE) did not affect syntaxin 1 or SNAP-25, but abolished VAMP2 immunoblot signals (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LCs of BoNTs are zinc-dependent proteases33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, EDTA prevented cleavage of SNARE proteins by X-, A- and B-LCs (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, incubation of X-LC with the purified recombinant cytosolic domain of VAMP2 (residues 193) converted VAMP2 into two lower-molecular-weight bands (Fig 2b), confirming that X-LC cleaves VAMP2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: The LC of BoNT/X cleaves VAMPs at a unique site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) X-LC was incubated with BDE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoblot analysis was carried out to detect syntaxin 1, SNAP-25 and VAMP2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synaptophysin (Syp) served as a loading control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A-LC and B-LC were analysed in parallel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cleavage of VAMP2 by B-LC results in loss of immunoblot signals, while cleavage of SNAP-25 by A-LC generates a smaller fragment (marked with an asterisk).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EDTA blocked the activity of X-, A- and B-LCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) VAMP2 (193) was incubated with X-LC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were analysed by SDSPAGE and Coomassie Blue staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  X-LC converted VAMP2 (193) into two smaller fragments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ce) VAMP2 (193) was incubated with X-LC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were analysed by mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS) to determine the molecular weight of cleaved fragments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eluted peptide peaks from the HPLC column are plotted over running time (RT, X axis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mass spectrometry data for the two cleavage products are colour-coded, with mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) noted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecular weight is deduced by multiplying m with z, followed by subtracting z.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein sequences for the two cleavage products are colour-coded and listed in c.

Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its molecular weight is 3,081.7, which fits only the peptide sequence of A67-L93 of VAMP2 (Fig 2c,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, another fragment from the beginning of the His6-tag to residue R66 of VAMP2 was also detected (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further confirm this finding, we repeated the assay with a different VAMP2 fragment: glutathione S-transferase (GST) tagged VAMP2 (3386) (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incubation with X-LC generated a single dominant peptide peak with a molecular weight of 2,063.1, which fits only A67-R86 of VAMP2 (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results demonstrate that X-LC has a single cleavage site on VAMP2 between R66 and A67.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'R66-A67 is a novel cleavage site on VAMP2, distinct from all established target sites of BoNTs (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also the only BoNT cleavage site located within a region previously known as the SNARE motif (Fig 2f, shaded regions)39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The VAMP protein family includes VAMP1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8, as well as related Sec22b and Ykt6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  R66-A67 is conserved in VAMP1 and 3, which are highly homologous to VAMP2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate the specificity of X-LC, we expressed HA-tagged VAMP1, 3, 7, 8 and Myc-tagged Sec22b and Ykt6 in HEK293 cells via transient transfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell lysates were incubated with X-LC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both VAMP1 and 3 were cleaved by X-LC, whereas VAMP7, VAMP8 and Sec22b were resistant to X-LC (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'BoNT/X cleaves VAMP4, VAMP5 and Ykt6', 'Unexpectedly, Ykt6 was also cleaved by X-LC (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding was confirmed using a purified GST-tagged Ykt6 fragment, which shifted to a lower-molecular-weight band after incubation with X-LC (Fig 2h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cleavage site was determined to be K173-S174 by mass spectrometry analysis of the intact Ykt6 versus Ykt6 cleaved by X-LC (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This site is homologous to the cleavage site of BoNT/X on VAMP2 (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among VAMP family of proteins, VAMP4 contains the same pair of residues (K87-S88) at this site as Ykt6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that X-LC cleaved both purified GST-tagged cytoplasmic domain of VAMP4 (Fig 2i), as well as native VAMP4 in BDE (Fig 2j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a control, Sec22b was not cleaved by X-LC in BDE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the GST-tagged cytoplasmic domain of VAMP5 was also cleaved (Fig 2i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cleavage sites were determined by mass spectrometry analysis to be K87-S88 in VAMP4 and R40-S41 in VAMP5 (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both sites are homologous to the cleavage site of BoNT/X on VAMP2 (Fig 2f), demonstrating that the location of the cleavage site is conserved across different VAMPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of X-LC to cleave VAMP4, VAMP5 and Ykt6 is highly unusual, as their sequences are substantially different from VAMP1/2/3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BoNT/X is the first and the only BoNT known that can cleave VAMPs beyond the canonical targets VAMP1, 2 and 3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Proteolytic activation of BoNT/X', 'We next examined the linker region between the LC and the HC, which must be cleaved by bacterial or host proteases to convert the toxin to an active di-chain form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We produced a recombinant X-LC-HN fragment (residues 1891) in E. coli and subjected it to limited proteolysis by endoproteinase Lys-C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were analysed using Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) labelling and tandem mass spectrometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TMT labels free N-termini (and lysines).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Limited proteolysis by Lys-C produced one new free N terminus mapped to residue N439 in the linker region (Fig 3a;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'BoNT/X is the first serotype of BoNTs identified by genomic sequencing and bioinformatics approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains unknown whether BoNT/X is ever produced in C. botulinum strain 111.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BoNT/X could be a silent gene, or it may not be expressed at detectable toxicity levels under culture conditions in the lab.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this toxin was revealed only by sequencing C. botulinum 111.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This illustrates the importance of genomic sequencing and bioinformatics approaches for understanding microbial virulence factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether BoNT/X could be expressed and exhibit toxicity under certain environmental conditions remains an intriguing question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A remarkable feature of BoNT/X is its unique ability to cleave VAMP4 and Ykt6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VAMP4 is widely expressed and is known to mediate vesicle fusion between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes, as well as homotypic fusion of endosomes47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ykt6 is an atypical SNARE without a transmembrane domain49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is anchored to membranes via lipidation, which allows dynamic regulation of its membrane association.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ykt6 is an essential protein in yeast and implicated in multiple membrane fusion events including ER-Golgi, intra-Golgi, endosome-Golgi-vacuolar, and autophagosome formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its function in mammalian cells remains to be established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BoNT/X is the first and only BoNT to cleave these SNAREs that mediate various intracellular membrane-trafficking events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interestingly, both VAMP4 and Ykt6 are enriched in neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies suggested that VAMP4 contributes to asynchronous synaptic vesicle exocytosis, enlargeosome exocytosis and activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE) in neurons50,51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of Ykt6 in neurons remains to be established, but it has been shown to suppress the toxicity of -synuclein in Parkinsons disease models53,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other substrate of BoNT/X, VAMP5, is mainly expressed in muscle cells and its function remains to be established55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BoNT/X will be a useful tool to investigate the function of VAMP4, Ykt6 and VAMP5, as well as related membrane trafficking events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, because VAMP4 has been implicated in granule release in immune cells56, BoNT/X may have the potential to modulate inflammatory secretion in immune cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The X-LC-HN fragment showed a higher level of activity in neurons than either A-LC-HN or B-LC-HN, suggesting that its membrane translocation and/or protease activity might be more efficient than the corresponding fragments in BoNT/A and BoNT/B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  X-HC is functional for targeting cells, as its presence enhanced cleavage of VAMP2 in neurons over LC-HN alone (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When present without the translocation and LC domains, X-HC is prone to aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This solubility issue is likely due to separation of X-HC from X-LC-HN, as full-length BoNT/XRY remains stable at high concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The X-FL generated by sortase-mediated ligation has a rather low toxicity in vivo in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains unknown whether this low in vivo toxicity was intrinsic to BoNT/X.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also possible that the sortase linking method resulted in an attenuated toxin, as the HC and LC-HN folded separately and there is an additional linker between the HN and HC in ligated toxins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, X-FL produced by sortase-mediated ligation is active on neurons and induced typical flaccid paralysis when injected locally in mice, demonstrating that BoNT/X is a functional toxin (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will be necessary to produce native BoNT/X to characterize its in vivo potency and determine its biosafety risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will be important to generate neutralizing antisera against BoNT/X before producing any native toxin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Introducing a full-length active toxin gene into any expression system/organism is always a significant biosafety concern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sortase-mediated ligation assembles a small quantity of full-length toxin from two complementary and non-toxic fragments expressed and purified individually.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of the precursor fragments in the reaction can be strictly controlled, so the amount of ligated toxin is precisely limited to ensure biosafety.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ligated toxin should possess the same mode of action as native toxins, but may exhibit lower toxicity in vivo, possibly due to the addition of the sortase linker and/or reduced compactness of the molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the ligated toxin could be used for functional studies, but may not be suitable for estimating the lethal dose of native toxin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, this reduced toxicity from the sortase linking method could be an advantage to create attenuated toxins for research use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It might be also possible to deliberately attenuate the toxicity of ligated toxins in vivo by including additional linkers, such as peptide sequences that are sensitive to serum proteases, to further mitigate biosafety concerns.'
