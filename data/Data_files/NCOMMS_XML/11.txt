Solar forcing synchronizes decadal North Atlantic climate variability  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Quasi-decadal variability in solar irradiance has been suggested to exert a substantial effect on Earths regional climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the North Atlantic sector, the 11-year solar signal has been proposed to project onto a pattern resembling the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), with a lag of a few years due to ocean-atmosphere interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solar/NAO relationship is, however, highly misrepresented in climate model simulations with realistic observed forcings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, its detection is particularly complicated since NAO quasi-decadal fluctuations can be intrinsically generated by the coupled ocean-atmosphere system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we compare two multi-decadal ocean-atmosphere chemistry-climate simulations with and without solar forcing variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the experiment including solar variability simulates a 12-year lagged solar/NAO relationship, comparison of both experiments suggests that the 11-year solar cycle synchronizes quasi-decadal NAO variability intrinsic to the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The synchronization is consistent with the downward propagation of the solar signal from the stratosphere to the surface.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'There is increasing evidence that variations in solar irradiance at different time scales are an important source of regional climate variability1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, observational analyses of sea level pressure (SLP) in winter revealed positive anomalies in the Gulf of Alaska for sunspot peak years since the beginning of the twentieth century4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the North Atlantic region, a link between the 11-year solar cycle and the winter phase of patterns resembling the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) or Arctic oscillation (AO) has been found by observational5,6,7,8 and modelling9,10,11,12 studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of these studies particularly showed that the transfer mechanism leading to the North Atlantic solar signal was consistent with the polar route of the so-called topdown mechanism13 related to solar ultraviolet irradiance variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to this mechanism, the solar signal is initially transferred from the upper stratosphere to the lower stratosphere by modulation of the polar night jet and the stratospheric meridional overturning circulation (or Brewer-Dobson circulation14), through Rossby wave-mean flow interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dynamical coupling processes15 between the stratosphere and the troposphere then transmit the solar signal to the Earths surface, projecting onto AO/NAO-like patterns16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recently, analysis of long-term SLP and sea surface temperature observations suggest that the surface climate response to the 11-year solar cycle maximizes with a lag of a few years17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings were supported by a large ensemble of short-term idealized coupled ocean-atmosphere model experiments18, which indicate that the lagged response of the NAO arises from oceanatmosphere coupling mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atmospheric circulation changes associated with the NAO affect the underlying Atlantic Ocean by modulating surface air temperature, atmosphere-ocean heat fluxes, as well as mid-latitude wind stress19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This induces a typical sea surface temperature tripolar pattern anomaly that can persist from one winter to the next20 and amplify the initial atmospheric solar signal over the subsequent years through positive feedbacks onto the atmosphere21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the ocean-atmosphere feedback mechanism has recently been confirmed in an ensemble of transient experiments23 of the Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model version 3 (HadGEM3), it remains highly misrepresented by climate models24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the detection of the 11-year solar cycle influence on the NAO is arduous since interannual to decadal fluctuations of the latter can be internally generated by the ocean-atmosphere system, even in absence of any external forcing25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we present results of two multi-decadal experiments (145 years) of the fully coupled ocean-atmosphere model CESM-WACCM3.5 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26) in its high-top version (up to 140-km altitude) with interactive chemistry, which either include (SOL experiment) or ignore (NO_SOL experiment) solar variability (see the Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparing both experiments, we can analyse the combined role of 11-year solar cycle-induced stratosphere-troposphere couplings and air-sea interactions in setting quasi-decadal fluctuations of the NAO, in a realistic approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis of the SOL experiment in winter first reveals that our model simulates a lagged and amplified quasi-decadal NAO response to 11-year solar cycle at 1-2 years, consistent with reanalysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This lagged response simulated in the CESM-WACCM model agrees with the proposed coupled positive feedback between the ocean and atmosphere represented in the HadGEM model18,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the NO_SOL experiment, however, strong internal quasi-decadal fluctuations of the NAO are also found despite constant solar forcing conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While our results support that quasi-decadal fluctuations of the NAO can be intrinsically generated in a coupled ocean-atmosphere system25, they further suggest that the 11-year solar cycle synchronizes these internal quasi-decadal variations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the proposed synchronization mechanism is consistent with the downward transfer of the solar signal from the stratosphere to the troposphere.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'North Atlantic climate response to the 11-year solar cycle', 'In winter (December to February), SLP composite differences between solar maximum and solar minimum phases at lag 0 years (see the Methods section and Supplementary Fig 1) for the SOL experiment (Fig 1a) show a statistically significant decrease of 2 hPa over the Arctic region, and a statistically significant increase of 1 hPa in mid-latitudes with maxima in the Euro-Atlantic region and Pacific basin, corresponding to the positive phase of the AO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At lag +1 year (Fig 1b), the mid-latitude positive SLP anomaly strengthens in the Euro-Atlantic region up to 1.5 hPa and weakens in the Pacific basin resulting in a positive NAO-like pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The positive NAO signature still persists at lags +2 and +3 years in the Atlantic basin, but the hemispheric equivalent annular mode signal disappears (Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a lag of +3 years, the statistically significant high-pressure anomaly in mid-latitudes is further amplified, consistent with the ocean feedback mechanism that predicts a maximum response at a lag of +3 years18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding sea surface temperature anomalies (Fig 1eh) evolve coherently with the lagged SLP NAO-like response to solar variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with a cold tongue in the southern North Atlantic, a cold anomaly develops in the Labrador Sea (southwest of Greenland) at lag 0 years (Fig 1e) before intensifying and extending eastwards into the Atlantic at lags +1 and +2 years (Fig 1f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simultaneously, a warm anomaly strengthens and extends progressively eastward from the middle West Atlantic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As mentioned before, the sea surface temperature coldwarmcold tripolar pattern19 is a typical North Atlantic response to the positive phase of the NAO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This sea surface temperature anomaly, which persists and strengthens over consecutive years, provides a positive feedback onto the atmosphere leading to the lagged and amplified NAO response (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although slightly weaker, the NAO response to the 11-year solar cycle simulated in our model is consistent with reanalysis (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Solar signal at the surface in the Northern Hemisphere.Consecutive lagged composite solar maximum minus minimum differences for sea level pressure (ad) and sea surface temperature (eh) for DJF season (see the Methods section for details on solar cycle composites definition).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sea level pressure composites are shown for all longitudes and northward of 20° N.

NAO indices of both experiments with regard to the solar radio flux at 10.7 cm (or F10.7 index), which is a measure of solar ultraviolet activity (see the Methods section and Supplementary Fig 4ad for details on NAO indices calculation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NAO indices reveal a strong quasi-decadal mode of variability for each experiment as demonstrated by their respective power spectra (Supplementary Fig 4e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This emphasizes that even in the absence of solar variations, an internal quasi-decadal variability mode of the NAO is generated in our model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparison of NAO indices spectral properties between the model (Supplementary Fig 4) and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis (Supplementary Fig 5) shows peaks, centred at 11 and 9 years, respectively, of similar quasi-decadal power spectral density supporting the realistic nature of the NAO quasi-decadal variability in our model experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quasi-decadal band-pass filtered NAO indices (range 9-13 years; Supplementary Fig 4e,f) show that for the SOL experiment, the NAO index maxima lag the solar maxima in a coherent manner (Fig 2a), while for the NO_SOL experiment, the period of this oscillation is not constant over decades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coherence between the filtered NAO index and the solar variability in the SOL experiment is reinforced by the lagged correlation of both time series, which produces statistically significant correlation coefficients of 0.65 and 0.61 at lag +1 and +2 years, respectively (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectral coherence between the unfiltered SOL NAO and the F10.7 cm time series also indicates a maximum value of 0.72 around a period of 11 years, which is statistically significant at the 95% confidence level (Supplementary Fig 4e), whereas no significant spectral coherence is found at decadal time scales between the unfiltered NO_SOL NAO and the F10.7 indices (Supplementary Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2:

lag 3 years) and 0.55 when spanning all possible lags (from 140 to +140 years).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the strong NAO quasi-decadal oscillation, the correlation between the filtered NAO index and the F10.7 is thus never as high as for the SOL case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a nonparametric random phase method27 (see the Methods section for details), we additionally estimated the probability that the correlation coefficient between the filtered NO_SOL NAO and the F10.7 time series is higher than between the filtered SOL NAO and F10.7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that this chance is  less_than 1% at the lags when maximum positive (+1 and +2) and negative (4) correlation coefficient are recorded between the filtered SOL NAO and the F10.7 time series (coloured stripes in Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This parallel analysis of the filtered NAO index of both experiments regarding the F10.7 suggests thus that the 11-year solar cycle impacts the North Atlantic climate by synchronizing the internal quasi-decadal variability mode of the NAO simulated by CESM-WACCM (see also Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Stratosphere dynamical analyses', 'We investigate the proposed synchronization further by comparing the stratospheric response of both experiments with respect to the quasi-decadal NAO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, instead of using 11-year solar cycle composite differences, the analysis that follows is performed by examining the differences between the maximum positive and negative phases of the NAO at quasi-decadal time scales (Fig 2a; Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the SOL experiment, a statistically significant warming with a maximum of 0.9 K is observed near the tropical stratopause (31 hPa4550 km) at lag 1 year of the NAO-based composites (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This positive temperature anomaly arises from increased solar ultraviolet irradiance during solar cycle maximum phases, which leads to additional heating due to ozone absorption in the upper stratosphere and more ozone production in the mid and upper stratosphere through the photolysis of oxygen28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A secondary warming anomaly of 0.8 K appears in the lower equatorial stratosphere (70 hPa or 2025 km).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although less well understood than the direct upper stratospheric response, this secondary warming could arise from adiabatic warming13 combined with increased ozone heating29 due to a deceleration of the Brewer-Dobson circulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two temperature responses to the 11-year solar cycle are in reasonable agreement with reanalyses30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the 11-year solar cycle/NAO lagged relationship (Figs 1 and 2), the maximum temperature response in the stratosphere due to 11-year solar variability leads the NAO by 1 year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, none of these typical solar signals is observed in the NO_SOL experiment which instead shows a seesaw of positive (negative) temperature anomalies in the middle tropical and subtropical stratosphere (203 hPa) in winter (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Temperature and zonal wind anomalies associated with NAO quasi-decadal variability and

solar cycle induced increase of the poleward temperature gradient results in a strengthening of the subtropical westerly jet through thermal wind balance13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in the zonal background flow alter planetary wave propagation so that the initial westerly wind anomalies amplify and propagate poleward and downward through the winter season13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism leads to a deceleration of the Brewer-Dobson circulation and a strengthening of the stratospheric polar vortex at solar maxima.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the SOL experiment, NAO-based composite differences at lag 1 year show statistically significant westerly wind anomalies in the subtropical upper stratosphere (Fig 3c),  greater than 2 m s1, and in polar latitudes, extending down to the Earths surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This results in a stronger polar night jet throughout the depth of the polar stratosphere (6080° N, 2003 hPa) of  greater than 4 m s1 at its maximum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the signal propagates down to the troposphere, it slightly moves equatorward (5070° N) projecting onto an AO/NAO-positive phase as revealed by easterly (westerly) anomalies centred at 30° N (60° N).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NO_SOL experiment shows a very similaralthough weakerzonal mean zonal wind response in the Northern Hemisphere troposphere (Fig 3d), as shown by the easterly (westerly) wind anomalies at 30° N (55° N), consistent with the AO/NAO-positive phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The statistically significant westerlies extend up to the lower/middle stratosphere (40 hPa) but easterlies are found at higher levels up to the mesosphere (above 1 hPa).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strong westerly wind anomalies are also confined to the subtropical stratopause region (Fig 3d, 30° N, 3 hPa).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in the absence of 11-year solar cycle forcing, the quasi-decadal tropospheric/lower stratospheric zonal wind is certainly linked to the AO/NAO variability, but is not related to the middle and upper stratosphere as it is in the case when solar forcing variability is included.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Planetary wave propagation and wavemean flow interaction anomalies are examined using NAO-based composite differences of the EliassenPalm flux (EPF) vector and its divergence32 (Fig 4a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recall that an anomalous divergence of EPF (or positive anomaly) leads to a reduced wave drag and thus a relative strengthening of westerlies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both experiments, anomalous poleward wave refraction is observed in the vicinity of the subtropical stratopause region, leading to a statistically significant positive EPF divergence (Fig 4a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This statistically significant anomaly expands poleward to 70° N in the SOL experiment (Fig 4a), consistent with westerly wind anomalies in the upper high-latitude stratosphere (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the middle polar stratosphere (6080° N, 10010 hPa), the strengthening of the polar night jet (Fig 3c) is consistent with a reduced upward planetary wave propagation and the associated westerly forcing anomaly (that is, positive EPF divergence; Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that for the SOL experiment, the zonal mean zonal wind and EPF divergence winter signals in the stratosphere associated with solar maximum minus minimum at lag 1 year of the NAO-based composites (Figs 3c and 4a) compare favourably with those obtained by Ineson et al.11 (see Fig 4 in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11; signs are inverted as they examine solar minimum minus maximum).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, no statistically significant signal is observed for the NO_SOL experiment in the polar night jet region (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the upper mid-latitude troposphere, both experiments exhibit a strong EPF divergence positive anomaly (3560° N; 400200 hPa) associated with the positive AO/NAO signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This signal is further amplified and expands poleward and upward when solar forcing variability is

evolution of the December to February NAO-based lagged composite differences of the mean wave forcing anomalies in the three key regions previously identified (see boxes in Fig 4a) shows a clear statistically significant and continuous quasi-decadal oscillation in the SOL experiment (Fig 4c), which maximizes (minimizes) at solar maximum (minimum).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notice that the continuous interannual time evolution of the zonal mean zonal wind and wavemean flow interaction anomalies is also visible on lagged latitude-pressure cross-sections (Supplementary Figs 7 and 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the NO_SOL experiment (Fig 4d), wave forcing anomalies display a statistically significant quasi-decadal oscillation in the mid-latitude upper troposphere only, corresponding to the AO/NAO variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amplitude of the signal is also two times lower than in the SOL experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparison of stratospheric dynamical signals in both experiments shows

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Recent analyses of the Northern Annular Mode/NAO variability conducted in the framework of the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project33 (CMIP5) revealed no significant response to the 11-year solar cycle by examining the average over 37 models participating34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mitchell et al.24 repeated a similar analysis by grouping models according to their lid height and by examining the responses at different lags.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although they found evidence that high-top models (with a lid height of at least 0.1 hPa or 65 km) better simulate the observed solar/NAO relationship than low-top models, the magnitude of the signals remains weak and the agreement between models is relatively low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They further noticed that the most promising solar signals seem to be obtained with models, which have a high spectral resolution and a well-resolved stratosphere including the equatorial Quasi Biennial Oscillation and interactive chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we propose a new and testable synchronization mechanism that combines airsea interaction processes18 and solar-induced stratospheric dynamics modulation11,13 to simulate the observed solar influences on North Atlantic climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the quasi-oscillatory behaviour of the solar cycle and that 4% of the total NAO variance can be explained by the solar variability in our SOL experiment, we believe that this mechanism could potentially improve decadal predictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this contribution is relatively small regarding the NAO total variance, it represents a significant increment to other sources of predictable decadal variability35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A rigorous representation of the impact of ultraviolet forcing on the atmospheric thermal structure is obtained using a radiative transfer module, which adequately resolves spectral solar variability36,37 and by including effects of solar-induced ozone variations38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter can be achieved by (i) prescribing the ozone changes or (ii) interactively calculating the ozone chemistry as in our model configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the first option offers the opportunity of significantly reducing the computational costs, the second option remains the most accurate to simulate ozone feedbacks on atmospheric dynamics and radiation39, which may be important for the representation of the solar signal40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More modelling sensitivity studies should be conducted to assess the relevance of implementing interactive ozone chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, we note that the conservative solar spectral irradiance model used in our experiments (NRLSSI, Naval Research Laboratory Solar Spectral Irradiance) represents the lower limit in the magnitude of SSI solar cycle variation among all models and measurements available41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could explain the slightly weaker upper stratosphere solar temperature signal in our experiments compared with reanalyses31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, it is crucial to assess the best estimate of solar spectral irradiance variability to reduce model uncertainty regarding the natural climate variability.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
