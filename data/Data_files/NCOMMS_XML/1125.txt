De novo active sites for resurrected Precambrian enzymes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Protein engineering studies often suggest the emergence of completely new enzyme functionalities to be highly improbable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, enzymes likely catalysed many different reactions already in the last universal common ancestor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanisms for the emergence of completely new active sites must therefore either plausibly exist or at least have existed at the primordial protein stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we use resurrected Precambrian proteins as scaffolds for protein engineering and demonstrate that a new active site can be generated through a single hydrophobic-to-ionizable amino acid replacement that generates a partially buried group with perturbed physico-chemical properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide experimental and computational evidence that conformational flexibility can assist the emergence and subsequent evolution of new active sites by improving substrate and transition-state binding, through the sampling of many potentially productive conformations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest a mechanism for the emergence of primordial enzymes and highlight the potential of ancestral reconstruction as a tool for protein engineering.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The generation of completely new active sites capable of enzyme catalysis is, arguably, one of the most fundamental unsolved problems in protein science.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rational design approaches to this problem have often used complex computational methods, have targeted simple model reactions and have typically led to low levels of catalysis1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies would seem to suggest, therefore, the unlikelihood of the emergence of completely new active sites in non-catalytic scaffolds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Certainly, most modern enzyme functions likely evolved from previously existing functionalities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, most biochemical processes are extremely slow in the absence of enzymes2 and specialized enzymes are likely to have catalysed many different reactions already in the last universal common ancestor3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It could be inferred from this that efficient mechanisms for the emergence and subsequent evolution of completely new enzyme functionalities must exist or, at least, that they must have existed at the primordial protein stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, little is known about such mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Buried and partially buried ionizable groups with perturbed properties often play essential catalytic roles in modern enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single hydrophobic-to-ionizable residue mutations that generate partially buried groups with perturbed properties may have plausibly provided a feasible route to the generation of completely new active sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This notion has been previously proposed5,6 but never tested in practice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conformational flexibility could have assisted the emergence of the new enzyme functionalities and its subsequent evolution by facilitating substrate and transition-state binding, through sampling a greater number of potentially productive conformations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many years ago, Jensen proposed in a highly influential article7 that primordial enzymes were capable of catalysing a diversity of reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is conceivable that the conformational flexibility that is likely linked to such a broad generalist nature8,9,10 may have facilitated the emergence of new enzyme functionalities in the first place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we explore and test these notions using resurrected Precambrian -lactamases11,12 as scaffolds for the engineering of completely new active sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, only a handful of systems have been studied using ancestral resurrection, and only a few of these resurrection efforts targeted old (3 billion years) phylogenetic nodes (Fig 2 of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these systems, resurrected Precambrian -lactamases have been thoroughly characterized in terms of their structure, function and stability11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These putative ancestral proteins have been shown to be highly stable and able to efficiently degrade several antibiotics11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous9 and current computational analyses, as well as new NMR relaxation studies reported here, support that this substrate promiscuity is linked to enhanced conformational flexibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The broad substrate scope of resurrected Precambrian -lactamases may reflect the wide variety of substances these enzymes had to hydrolyse11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We do not claim, therefore, that they are necessarily at Jensens ancestral generalist stage, although, strictly speaking, this possibility should not be ruled out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In any case, the available resurrected Precambrian -lactamases11 should provide an adequate model with which to address the role of ancestral conformational flexibility in the emergence of new enzyme functionalities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More generally, we have recently reviewed14 several arguments and recent publications that support that promiscuity may be a common outcome of ancestral protein resurrection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Ancestral and modern -lactamases used as scaffolds in this work.Schematic representation of the phylogenetic tree for class A -lactamases11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ancestral nodes studied in this work correspond to the common ancestors (CA) of Firmicutes (FCA), Actinobacteria and Firmicutes (AFCA), Enterobacteria (ENCA), Gammaproteobacteria (GPBCA), various Gram-negative bacteria (GNCA) and various Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (PNCA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proteins encoded by the most probabilistic sequences at these nodes11 were prepared and used as scaffolds for engineering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, seven alternative reconstructions at the GNCA node (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3) were also prepared; these are labelled GNCA1 to GNCA7, with the most probabilistic sequence at the node being labelled GNCAMP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -lactamases from 10 modern organisms are also studied in this work and these organisms are shown at the right.Full size image', 'Figure 2: Reactions and compounds studied in this work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The Kemp elimination of 5-nitrobenzioxazole (5-nitro-benzodisoxazole).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A schematic transition state structure is shown here;

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Selected model systems', 'In the present study, we have used the proteins encoded by the most probabilistic sequences at six Precambrian phylogenetic nodes in the evolution of class A -lactamases (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reconstructed sequences and the procedure used to obtain them have been described in detail in Supporting Information of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These proteins display large sequence differences between themselves (Supplementary Table 1) and they are properly folded, highly stable, active and share the -lactamase fold11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we have also used here proteins encoded by alternative sequences at the GNCA node (common ancestor of Gram-negative bacteria).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As is custormary in the field, these alternative sequences were derived11,13 from a random weighted sampling of the posterior probability distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They differ from the most probabilistic sequence at 820 positions (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, for comparison, we have also used 10 modern -lactamases (Fig 1) that have been considered in the literature to be archetypical examples of -lactamases and are well characterized in terms of their structure and function15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These modern proteins provide a fair representation of the -lactamases from the several bacterial taxa (Fig 1) and they span modern -lactamase sequence space to a substantial extent, as they show limited sequence identity between themselves (Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note also their limited sequence identity with the putative ancestral -lactamases studied here (Supplementary Table 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, we explore in this work a vast region of the sequence space of both ancestral and modern -lactamases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have selected the Kemp elimination reaction (Fig 2) as our primary target for the reaction to be catalysed by the generated new active site, for several reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, it provides a simple activated model for proton abstraction from carbon, which is a fundamental chemical process that underlies many biochemical reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Completely new active sites are expected to display low catalysis levels (high catalysis levels would be the outcome of subsequent evolution) and their emergence is best probed by activated substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, Kemp elimination is a non-natural reaction (unknown in biological organisms).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No natural enzyme has evolved, therefore, to catalyse this reaction16 and studies on engineered Kemp eliminases are unlikely to be compromised by contamination from natural enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following from this, Kemp elimination has been often used as a benchmark for rational enzyme design1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, use of the same system allows for a quantitative comparison of the catalytic efficiencies of the designed constructs presented in this work to those generated in previous enzyme design studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Generation of a new active site for Kemp elimination', 'The possibility that slow conformational changes (on the microseconds to seconds timescale) play roles in enzyme catalytic cycles has been proposed and explored17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, we used NMR relaxation determinations (see Methods section and Supplementary Methods) on the -lactamase encoded by the most probabilistic sequence at the GNCA node (GNCAMP -lactamase) to guide our design of a new active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This putative ancestral protein displays a large number of residues with conformational contribution to the relaxation rates determined by NMR (see the comparison with the modern TEM-1 -lactamase shown in Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A large accumulation of such residues is visually apparent in the region encompassing helix h1 (residues 2641), helix h11 (residues 271290) and the loops 225229 and 252257.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residue 229 within this region appears as a suitable target for the generation of a new active site through a hydrophobic-to-ionizable residue replacement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A substantially buried and highly conserved tryptophan residue is present at position 229 in both modern and reconstructed Precambrian -lactamases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The indole side chain of tryptophan has a shape similar to that of the Kemp substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Precisely because of this shape congruence, replacement of W229 to a new residue with basic properties will not generate a new active site capable of catalysing the Kemp elimination unless, of course, conformational rearrangements occur in the enzyme to be able to avoid steric clashes between the substrate and the new residue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: NMR relaxation studies on modern and ancestral -lactamases.The 3D-structures of (a) TEM-1 -lactamase (PDB 1BTL) and (b) the -lactamase encoded by the most probabilistic sequence at the GNCA node11 (PDB 4B88) are displayed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The residues for which the relaxation rates cannot be explained without including a conformational exchange contribution (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31 and this work) are highlighted in red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The h1 and h11 -helices are labelled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tryptophan residue at position 229 is highlighted in blue.Full size image', 'We found that a simple W229D replacement leads to substantial levels of Kemp elimination activity in the -lactamases at all ancestral nodes studied here (Supplementary Table 6), with the only exception of the evolutionary recent ENCA node (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By substantial activity, we mean that the observed levels of Kemp elimination activity were clearly distinguishable (and much higher in most cases) than the background (enzyme-free) levels (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the W229D variants of all 10 modern -lactamases studied led to levels of Kemp elimination activity that, even at protein concentrations of about 20 M, could be barely distinguished from the background levels (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that the W229D variants of all 10 modern -lactamases studied did show antibiotic degradation activity (linked to the natural active site) at nM concentrations (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, their lack of Kemp elimination activity cannot be attributed to the disruptive W229D mutation preventing their folding, which is anyhow a problem that is less likely to arise with the highly stable ancestral -lactamases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth noting here that enhanced stability is a common outcome of Precambrian protein resurrection11,18,19,20, likely linked to the thermophilic nature of early life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A wide diversity of experimental results confirm (or are consistent with) the main features of the designed approach used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, X-ray crystallography in the presence of 5(6)-nitrobenzotriazole, a known transition-state analogue of the Kemp elimination reaction (Fig 4) and inhibition by this analogue (Supplementary Fig 3) support that Kemp elimination does occur at the site generated by the W229D replacement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The catalytic role of the aspartate at position 229 is further confirmed by mutational studies: the W229G variant shows negligible activity and the nearby aspartate at position 228 does not have a catalytic role, as the replacement of D228 with A does not substantially impair the activity (Supplementary Table 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The catalytic role of the aspartate at position 229 is also confirmed by the pH dependence of the catalysis, which is consistent with the raised pK value expected for an aspartate residue in a hydrophobic environment (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following from this, 3D-structure determination in the presence of the transition-state analogue (Fig 4) confirms the role of conformational flexibility in the generation of a new function, as transition-state binding is shown to rely on conformational rearrangements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the bound transition-state analogue is displaced with respect to the position originally occupied by the tryptophan 229, as required by the presence of an aspartate residue at position 229 in the active variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a displacement is made possible by a shift of the h11 -helix (and the concomitant shift of the substantially solvent-exposed h1 -helix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note also that the catalytic efficiency for the Kemp elimination in the engineered ancestral proteins correlates with the transition-state analogue binding constants derived from inhibition experiments (Supplementary Fig 4), supporting that catalysis is linked to transition-state stabilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, catalysis of Kemp elimination is enhanced by an additional F290W amino replacement in the neighbourhood of position 229, which likely stabilizes the transition state through a face-to-edge interaction with the new tryptophan residue (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: 3D-structures of the de novo Kemp eliminases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) Shown here are the structures of the W229D variant of GNCAMP -lactamase and the W229D/F290W variant of GNCA4 -lactamase, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, the

corresponding GNCAMP and GNCA4 backgrounds (light-blue coloured structures with W229 in darker blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shift of the h1 and h11 -helices is apparent in a, but not in b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reason for this is that the h1 and h11 helices are already displaced in the background GNCA4 variant, as shown by the superposition of the two backgrounds in c (GNCAMP is shown in

to biological organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No enzyme is, therefore, expected to have evolved to catalyse this reaction and, consequently, Kemp elimination activity is not expected among natural proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, Hilvert and coworkers21 found no detectable Kemp eliminase activity in calmodulin, barnase, lysozyme, trypsin, chymotrypsinogen and chymotrypsin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Tawfik and coworkers16 screened the ASKA library (4,300 clones) for natural and non-natural activities and found only two enzymes that could catalyze Kemp elimination, although these appeared to be promiscuous activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, serum albumins can catalyse Kemp elimination22 with a turnover number that is about 102 s1 at neutral pH, but that approaches 10 s1 at pH 10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, serum albumins, even in the absence of bound metals, can catalyse a remarkable diversity of non-natural reactions23, due to hydrophobic pockets, which can bind different substrates and to the presence of lysine residues with catalytic properties within those pockets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The capability of albumins to catalyse the Kemp elimination reaction (among several other non-natural reactions) suggests that the scarcity of natural enzyme catalysts for such a simple reaction is simply due to the lack of a selective pressure to generate Kemp elimination activity during evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, rational design efforts to engineer artificial Kemp eliminases have resulted in limited success1, despite the simplicity of the targeted reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, comparison with these previous Kemp eliminase designs (Fig 6) provides further evidence that the catalytic efficiencies (kcat/KM values) we have generated in the ancestral -lactamases are indeed substantial and consequential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lower end of the variation range spanned by the W229D and W229D/F290W variants of the 12 successful ancestral backgrounds used is actually similar or clearly above the results previously reported using minimalist design24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The upper end of the range is above the results previously reported using more complex design approaches26,27 (iterative design and design based on Rosetta), which also involved large numbers of mutations to reach those efficiencies, and it is less than two orders of magnitude below the catalytic efficiency for the best Kemp eliminase reported for to date28 (which is the outcome of 17 rounds of directed evolution from an iterative design background).

#@NEW_LINE#@#  The values for the previous minimalist designs are taken from Korendovych et al.24 (large orange data point at number of mutations value of unity) and Merski and Shoichet25 (small orange data points).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, the design is based on a single mutation, but, in the latter study25, additional mutations had to be introduced for mainly stabilization purposes (the values shown correspond to the variants displayed in Fig 3 of Merski and Shoichet25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values obtained using a design approach that involved Rosetta are taken from Röthlisberger et al.26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only the values for the eight designs that led to substantial Kemp eliminase activity are shown (59 designs were actually tested by Röthlisberger et al.26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Iterative design values are taken from Privett et al.27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, iterative means that an original design with very low activity was improved on the basis of 3D-structural information and molecular dynamics simulations to achieve substantial levels of catalysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The efficiency of the best Kemp eliminase reported to date28 is also shown here for comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Comparison of the Kemp eliminase turnover numbers (kcat values) obtained in this work with those reported for previous rational designs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The meaning of the symbols is the same as in a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values shown as open symbols for the W229D variants of the ancestral backgrounds are actually lower limit estimates calculated as described in Supplementary Fig 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show here the reaction rates corresponding to the best artificial Kemp eliminase reported to date28 and to the uncatalysed reaction for comparison.Full size image', 'Regarding the turnover numbers, the kcat values obtained for the W229D/F290W variants of the ancestral -lactamase scaffolds are up to approximately seven orders of magnitude above the rate of the uncatalysed reaction (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, the best artificial Kemp eliminase reported to date28 displayed a approximately nine orders of magnitude enhancement, but, as noted above, this was obtained as a result of 17 rounds of directed evolution on a designed background with already substantial activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the upper end of the range spanned by our kcat values is clearly above the reported kcat values for complex designs that required much larger numbers of mutations (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Michaelis plots for the single W229D variants are linear and do not allow kcat values to be calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, lower limit estimates of kcat can indeed be derived from suitable analysis of linear Michaelis plots (see Supplementary Fig 5 for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These estimated lower limit values for the single W229D variants are shown with open circles in Fig 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, they are similar to the actual kcat determined for the double W229D/F290W variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the kcat enhancement of up to seven orders of magnitude over the uncatalysed reaction is actually produced by the single W229D mutation, while F290W mostly favors substrate and transition-state binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, it must be noted that catalysis of Kemp elimination by carboxylic acids is strongly accelerated in aprotic solvents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The acetate ion in acetonitrile is in fact an excellent catalyst of the Kemp elimination with a reported second order rate constant of 2,800 M1 s1, a value that has been used as a metric to judge the catalytic efficiency of artificial Kemp eliminases1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike previous rationally designed Kemp eliminases (Fig 6a), our best eliminase displays a maximum catalytic efficiency (5,500 M1 s1, Fig 5a) that exceeds the acetate in acetonitrile level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Additional activities of the engineered ancestral enzymes', 'We used our best eliminase (the W229D/F290W variant of the alternative GNCA4 reconstruction at the GNCA node), to test whether the introduction of the new active site affects the catalysis at the old natural active site (catalytic residue S70, located at about 23 Å from position 229).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -Lactamases encoded by reconstructed sequences corresponding to the GNCA node have been previously shown11 to be able to degrade a variety of antibiotics, including penicillin and third-generation antibiotics with efficiencies similar to that of a modern average enzyme (by contrast, the modern TEM-1 -lactamase is a specialist enzyme that displays high catalytic efficiency with penicillin and a substantially lower efficiency with third-generation antibiotics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore determined the MichaelisMenten parameters for the degradation of a penicillin antibiotic (benzylpenicillin) and one third-generation antibiotic (cefotaxime) catalysed by GNCA4-W229D/F290W

 Ester hydrolysis data correspond to p-nitrophenyl acetate hydrolysis and were obtained with the GNCA4-W229D/F290W variant (closed data points) and also with this variant modified to block any esterase activity at the natural, antibiotic degradation site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was achieved by mutating the catalytic S70 to alanine (open squares) or by inactivation by clavulanic acid (open triangles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Catalytic parameters for ester hydrolysis discussed in the Main Text are derived from the MichaelisMenten fit to the modified variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The equation used to fit to the data of the unmodified variant includes an additional linear term to account for esterase activity at the antibiotic degradation site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The esterase catalytic efficiency at the natural active site is, however, found to be 20-fold smaller than that at the new active site.Full size image', 'We also used our best eliminase to explore the potential promiscuity at the generated new active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that the GNCA4-W229D/F290W -lactamase does in fact also catalyse the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate (Figs 2 and 7 and Supplementary Fig 6), a substrate commonly used to assess esterase activity16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, lactam hydrolysis and ester hydrolysis are chemically similar and the natural (antibiotic degradation) active site could therefore in principle contribute to the observed esterase activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, our results (Fig 7) indicate a minor natural-site contribution that only becomes apparent when the de novo active site is saturated at the higher substrate concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is specifically shown by the fact that the esterase activity of GNCA4-W229D/F290W is inhibited by 5(6)-nitrobenzotriazole, a transition-state analogue of the Kemp elimination reaction (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, replacing the catalytic serine at the antibiotic degradation active site with alanine does not significantly impair the rate of p-nitrophenyl acetate hydrolysis (Fig 7), except at the higher substrate concentrations at which the de novo active site is saturated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, blocking the antibiotic degradation active site through the irreversible reaction with clavulanic acid does not significantly impair the rate of p-nitrophenyl acetate hydrolysis (Fig 7), except at the higher substrate concentrations at which the de novo active site is saturated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, saturating concentrations of benzylpenicillin do not significantly impair the rate of p-nitrophenyl acetate hydrolysis (Supplementary Fig 7), except at the higher substrate concentrations at which the de novo active site is saturated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The catalytic efficiency for the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate at the new active site, kcat/KM=11.7±1.1 M1 s1, is similar to the best values reported in the literature for rationally designed esterases29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the turnover number at the new active site, kcat=7.6 × 103±2 × 104 s1, indicates a three orders of magnitude enhancement over the rate of the non-enzymatic reaction30 (kuncat=2.5 × 106 s1; Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are remarkable results, in particular since, we are dealing here with a new active site generated on the basis of a minimalist approach that did not target esterase activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Computational modelling of engineered ancestral enzymes', 'To further explore and confirm the role of conformational flexibility in the emergence of new enzyme functions, we have complemented our experimental work with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the wild-type and mutant forms of the modern TEM-1 and Bacillus licheniformis (BL) -lactamases, as well as the ancestral ENCA, GNCAMP, GNCA4 and PNCA -lactamases (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose these particular proteins both due to the availability of X-ray structures (see the Methods section) and because they span the range of Kemp elimination activities obtained in this work upon new active site generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the modern TEM-1 and BL -lactamases, as well as the comparatively recent ENCA -lactamase (Fig 1), display negligible activity upon the W229 mutation, while this mutation confers substantial Kemp elimination activity to the PNCA, GNCAMP and GNCA backgrounds following the order PNCA less_than GNCAMP less_than GNCA4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the double W229/F290W variant of the GNCA4

relaxation data are available (Fig 3) from this and previous31 work, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As explained in the second section of the Results, the region of the ancestral scaffold structure targeted for new active site generation is characterized by a large number of residues with conformational exchange contributions to the relaxation rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, complete agreement between the results of the MD simulations and the conformational exchange contributions to the NMR relaxation rates is not to be expected, mainly because of the different timescales involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, inclusion of exchange terms to explain relaxation rates reveals dynamic processes in the micro to milliseconds range32, while shorter timescales are typically probed by MD simulations33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, we find a clear correspondence between the calculated C RMSF values and the number of residues with conformational exchange contribution to NMR relaxation at the region of the new active site (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore likely that the approximately microsecond conformational transitions at the region of the new active site in the ancestral scaffold are reflected in our 200 ns (=0.2 s) MD simulations, which actually approach the lower end of the conformational exchange timescale range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The capability of our MD simulations to capture flexibility features that are relevant for new active site generation is further supported by the general congruence with the catalytic properties of several modern and ancestral scaffolds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of the wild-type enzymes, a clear increase can be seen in the flexibility of residues 252 through to the h11 helix upon moving from TEM-1 and BL to the GNCAMP to GNCA4 -lactamases, which are the residues that are primarily involved in forming the cavity creating the de novo active site (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flexibility of this region appears indeed to follow the general activity trend described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the largest overall changes in flexibility can be seen in helices h1 and h11, as well as the loops covering the de novo active site, in agreement with both the crystallographic data (Fig 4) as well as with the NMR relaxation data shown in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mobility of different regions of these enzymes has also been highlighted in Fig 9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The function-generating mutation W229D appears to increase the flexibility, which is the likely outcome of the introduction of a charged residue in a hydrophobic environment6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Still, the effect is much more pronounced in the ancestral -lactamases, while the modern -lactamases show only a comparatively small increase in flexibility

new active site region upon the W229D mutation, even though this protein shows negligible Kemp elimination activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, D229 is partially deprotonated at neutral pH and flexibility upon introduction of a charged group in a hydrophobic environment reflects, to some extent, the conformational fluctuations required to allow some water penetration and the consequent stabilization of the partially buried charge6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a specific kind of flexibility might not be relevant to the understanding of transition-state binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, there should not be significant water penetration when the transition state is bound to the new active site, and the negative charge of the catalytic aspartate is actually stabilized by the interaction with the proton being abstracted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the GNCA4 scaffold appears to be more rigid (in the new active site region) than the GNCAMP scaffold, despite the fact that GNCA4 leads to higher levels of Kemp elimination activity upon the W229D mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, 3D-structure determination shows that the GNCA4 is actually more preorganized for transition-state binding than the GNCAMP scaffold (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can again ultimately be viewed as a reflection of flexibility at the GNCA node, as mutations removed from the active site can easily shift the conformational equilibria at this node.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, the specific mutations present in the GNCA4 scaffold have led to the population of a conformation in the W229D variant with a cavity where the substrate can easily form a reactive conformation, and with better architecture for effective transition-state stabilization.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Modern proteins can perform an enormous diversity of molecular tasks, often with high efficiency and specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of these modern functions evolved from previously existing functionalities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, it is inescapable to assume that the emergence of completely new functions has also occurred, at least at some early stages in protein evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, it has been recently estimated from the number of unique enzymes and the number of domain superfamilies34 that at least 87% of all enzyme functions have evolved from another function or from ancestors with generic functionalities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would leave a fraction of 13% of enzyme functions as plausible candidates for having emerged through the generation of new active sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the 13% figure may be an overestimation, as some cases of homology between superfamilies may be missed by sequence comparison35, it does however suggest that the generation of new active sites may not actually be an exceedingly rare event and thus should garner more serious consideration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is supported by reports of alternate-site promiscuous enzymes that display catalysis of a secondary reaction at a site other than the active site of the natural catalytic process36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, most fundamental biochemical processes are extremely slow in the absence of enzymes2 and seemingly specialized enzymes are likely to have catalysed many different reactions already in the last universal common ancestor3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may be reasonably inferred that efficient mechanisms for the emergence and subsequent evolution of new enzyme functionalities must exist or, at least, that they must have existed at the primordial protein stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Little is known, however about these mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent work29 has shown that introducing a catalytic group in the hydrophobic cavity of the C-terminal domain of calmodulin can generate significant levels of catalysis for simple reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simple mechanism for the emergence of new enzyme functions demonstrated here does not require the recruitment of a preexisting hydrophobic cavity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A hydrophobic-to-ionizable amino acid replacement generates a buried (or partially buried) residue with the perturbed properties that are useful in catalysis and conformational flexibility assists the generation of a completely new active site by facilitating substrate and transition-state binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have shown that, when using resurrected Precambrian -lactamases as scaffolds for protein engineering, a minimalist design approach based on this mechanism leads to levels of catalysis for the Kemp elimination reaction of up to approximately seven orders of magnitude above the rate of the uncatalysed reaction, as well as to significant ester hydrolysis activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role played by conformational flexibility in the generation of the new function is clearly apparent in the X-ray crystallographic structures of our designed enzymes and supported by the extensive computational simulations reported, as well as by experimental binding studies (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The process of inferring ancestral sequences inherently generates uncertainly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore customary in the field to test phenotypic robustness by studying not only the protein encoded by the most probabilistic sequence at a given node, but also the proteins encoded by alternative reconstructions derived from random sampling from the posterior probability distribution at the node.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously used this approach to demonstrate phenotypic robustness for the antibiotic degradation activity at the natural active site of the GNCA -lactamase11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, however, the new active site behaves differently and engineered -lactamases encoded by several alternative reconstructions at the GNCA node (common ancestor of Gram-negative bacteria) display Kemp elimination activities that span a 30-fold range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The several GNCA sequences studied differ among themselves at 820 positions, which are, in essentially all cases, distal from the neighbourhood of the Kemp elimination active site (Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the 30-fold range of catalytic efficiency observed suggests long-range communication between residues, a feature that is often linked to conformational dynamics37,38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It emerges that function at new active sites may be more sensitive to long-range effects than function at old highly evolved active sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In any case, the existence of such long-range effects makes it difficult to make a meaningful comparison between the different ancestral scaffolds in terms of their capability to generate a new function and no such detailed comparison is attempted here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a more general viewpoint, however, it is clear that long-range effects could contribute to the immediate evolvability of newly emerged functions as they imply that many mutations are able to modulate the new activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, conformational dynamics/flexibility may contribute to the emergence of new functions as well as to their subsequent evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Certainly, reaching high levels of catalysis for increasingly complex reactions will likely require the concomitant evolution, sophistication and specialization of the catalytic machinery at the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Still, conformational flexibility may have played a key role even at the early specialization stages, as the concomitant long-range mutational effects may have helped avoid stasis between the improvements in the catalytic machinery caused by rare mutations at the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, it is remarkable that the minimalist approach that generates substantial levels of a new function in most of the ancestral -lactamases tested here only leads to catalysis levels barely distinguishable from the background when performed on 10 modern -lactamases (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This different behaviour is plausibly linked to differences in conformational flexibility between the ancestral and the modern proteins, as our attempts to generate a substantial Kemp elimination activity in the modern -lactamases by removing potential steric interferences to transition-state binding were unsuccessful (Supplementary Note).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the distinct ancestral versus modern pattern of new function generation found appears to provide direct evidence in support of recent proposals about the potential of resurrected ancestral proteins as scaffolds for protein engineering11,40.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

remove clashes between the water molecules and the solute.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was comprising of 50 steps of steepest descent and 200 steps of conjugate gradient minimization using 25 kcal mol1 Å2 harmonic positional restraints on all solute atoms, followed by 50 steps of steepest descent and 200 steps of conjugate gradient minimization with weaker 5 kcal mol1 Å2 harmonic positional restraints on all solute atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After this initial minimization, the following four sequential equilibration steps were performed: a 50 ps NVT simulation to increase the thermostat target temperature using the Berendsen thermostat and pressure control algorithms59 with 0.5 ps time constants for both the bath coupling and pressure relaxation; a 50 ps NPT simulation at a constant isotropic pressure of 1 atm to adjust the density of the system to 1 g cm3; five 50 ps NVT simulations in which remaining the 5 kcal mol1 Å2 harmonic positional restraints were progressively decreased in 1 kcal mol1 Å2 increments, allowing us to finally perform a 50 ps NVT simulation without any restraints on the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For each system, we performed three independent equilibrations using different initial random seeds, the starting points for which were obtained by increasing the target thermostat temperature from 100 to 299.9 K, 300.0 and 300.1 K, respectively, to obtain three independent simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was followed by performing 100 ns production simulations for each of the three replicas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All simulations were performed using a 2 fs time step, saving snapshots every 20 ps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SHAKE algorithm60,61 was used during the dynamics to constrain all bonds involving hydrogen atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Short-range non-bonded interactions were calculated subject to an 8 Å cut-off radius.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long-range interactions were described using the particle mesh Ewald method62,63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temperature was kept constant at 300 K using Berendsens weak coupling algorithm59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All production simulations were performed using NVT conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent analyses of the MD trajectories were performed using CPPTRAJ64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first 40 ns of each simulation was discarded from the analysis as equilibration time, and all RMSF and clustering data shown in the paper are obtained as averages over the last 60 ns of three independent equilibration runs for each system (that is, 180 ns total simulation time per system).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The backbone r.m.s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  plots shown in Supplementary Fig 26 demonstrate that all systems remained stable over the remaining simulation time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Supplementary Figs 27 and 28, we compare the average RMSF values per residue with the corresponding averages of the B-factors derived from X-ray crystallography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although B-factors have been often interpreted in dynamical terms65, they are affected by a large number of other factors, including the resolution limit, radiation damage, crystal lattice defects, rigid body motions, occupancy levels and refinement artifacts66,67.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the protein systems studied here, we observe an approximate congruence between the B-factors and RMSF values that appears comparable to the congruence reported for other protein systems in the literature68.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'X-ray crystallographic data for the several 3D-structures determined in this work have been deposited at the PDB
