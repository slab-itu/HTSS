Reader domain specificity and lysine demethylase-4 family function  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The KDM4 histone demethylases are conserved epigenetic regulators linked to development, spermatogenesis and tumorigenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, how the KDM4 family targets specific chromatin regions is largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, an extensive histone peptide microarray analysis uncovers trimethyl-lysine histone-binding preferences among the closely related KDM4 double tudor domains (DTDs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KDM4A/B DTDs bind strongly to H3K23me3, a poorly understood histone modification recently shown to be enriched in meiotic chromatin of ciliates and nematodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2.28 Å co-crystal structure of KDM4A-DTD in complex with H3K23me3 peptide reveals key intermolecular interactions for H3K23me3 recognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, analysis of the 2.56 Å KDM4B-DTD crystal structure pinpoints the underlying residues required for exclusive H3K23me3 specificity, an interaction supported by in vivo co-localization of KDM4B and H3K23me3 at heterochromatin in mammalian meiotic and newly postmeiotic spermatocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro demethylation assays suggest H3K23me3 binding by KDM4B stimulates H3K36 demethylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results provide a possible mechanism whereby H3K23me3-binding by KDM4B directs localized H3K36 demethylation during meiosis and spermatogenesis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Histone lysine methylation regulates gene expression by recruiting or displacing chromatin-binding proteins1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KDM4 (JMJD2) is a conserved iron (II)-dependent jumonji-domain demethylase subfamily that is essential during development5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disrupting the only KDM4 enzyme in Caenorhabditis elegans induced germ cell apoptosis and DNA replication defects9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of individual mammalian KDM4 proteins has been associated with oncogenesis, cancer growth and metastasis in various cancer types and other conditions including cardiac failure and autism10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vertebrates, KDM4A, KDM4B and KDM4C share similar domain organization13 (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amino-terminal catalytic domains of KDM4AC display demethylase activity that can convert di-/trimethylated lysines to lower methylated states at H3K9 and H3K36 with comparable kinetics13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite similar catalytic activities, individual KDM4 members exhibit varied chromatin associations and biological functions14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest an uncharacterized mechanism controls KDM4 protein functions on chromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Distinct binding specificities of human KDM4AC DTDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Domain organization of human KDM4 family members (DTD, double tudor domain; JmjN+JmjC, jumonji catalytic demethylase domain; ZNF, zinc finger).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DTDs were coloured in two blocks (blue and orange) with each representing a tudor domain sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Systematic profiling of histone binding preferences of KDM4AC DTDs on histone peptide microarray.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recombinant HaloTag-tagged DTDs were expressed and purified form E. coli and incubated with in-house histone peptide microarray.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual spots were selected from the representative array images (see Supplementary Fig 1 for the full images).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Red signals correlate with binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Quantitative measurement of H3 (1732) K23me3 binding constant with KDM4AC DTDs by fluorescence polarization (FP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Errors represent s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  from three experimental replicates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Differential histone interactome of KDM4AC DTDs validated by FP assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Matrix represents pairs of KDM4 DTD proteins and trimethyl-lysine peptides (see Supplementary Table 1 for peptide information) for each FP assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative specificity factors (as shown by the shades of red) were normalized to the tightest binding in the matrix (Kd=2.2 M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding affinity for each protein-peptide combination as determined by FP is labelled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Sequence alignment of KDM4AC DTDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondary structure is labelled on top of the sequence (blue: Tudor 1, orange: Tudor 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shades indicate conservation of particular residues (yellow: conserved in all three proteins, cyan: conserved in two proteins).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Red stars highlight the residues that interact with H3K23me3 peptide as determined from Fig 2.

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'H3K23me3-binding specificities among KDM4 DTDs', 'We cloned and expressed human KDM4AC DTDs as recombinant proteins with N-terminal affinity tags from Escherichia coli (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KDM4AC DTDs were probed with our recently developed combinatorial histone peptide microarray covering 746 histone post-translational modification (PTM) states29 (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the peptide microarray assay revealed surprising discrimination for H3K23me3 binding among the three DTDs (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, KDM4B-DTD displayed exclusive binding to H3K23me3 (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KDM4A-DTD, which displayed strong binding to H3K23me3 as well, also bound H3K4me3 and H4K20me3 (Fig 1b), consistent with previous findings23,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, KDM4C-DTD bound specifically to H3K4me3 (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We further quantified the methylated histone binding of KDM4-DTDs by employing a solution-based binding assay (fluorescence polarization; Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the derived binding constants were consistent with the peptide array analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KDM4A-DTD binds H3K23me3 peptide at low micromolar affinity (Kd=2.2 M), slightly stronger than its interaction with H3K4me3 and H4K20me3 (Fig 1d), and KDM4C-DTD displayed highly specific binding to H3K4me3 (Kd=6.8 M; Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In dramatic contrast to KDM4A-DTD and KDM4C-DTD, KDM4B-DTD only displayed striking specificity for H3K23me3 (Kd=10.3 M), with no significant binding to H3K4me3 (Fig 1d and Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, this systematic analysis indicates that KDM4AC DTDs have distinct and surprising histone-binding preferences that could not have been predicted based on the high similarity in their overall amino acid sequences ( greater than 60% identity,  greater than 80% similarity; see Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, how KDM4-DTDs achieve sequence specificity for residues proximal to the trimethyl lysine remained unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To define the mechanism of such sequence selectivity for KDM4-DTD binding, we proceeded to structurally and biochemically detail these interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Structural basis for H3K23me3 recognition', 'To elucidate the molecular basis of recognizing H3K23me3, purified KDM4A-DTD was co-crystallized with an H3 (1928) K23me3 peptide and the peptide-bound structure was determined at 2.3 Å with a space group of P 32 (PDB ID: 5D6Y; Fig 2ac, Table 1 and Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the crystallization screening, we also determined two apo structures of KDM4A-DTD at 1.99 and 2.15 Å (PDB ID: 5D6W, 5D6X; Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all the structures, KDM4A-DTD forms two lobes (HTD-1 and HTD-2; HTD, hybrid tudor domain) with interweaving -strands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The co-crystal structure suggests the H3K23me3 peptide forms extensive interaction with KDM4A-DTD (540 Å2 by PISA31) and such binding is mostly mediated through residues in HTD-2 of KDM4A-DTD (Figs 1e and 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Co-crystal structure of KDM4A-DTD with H3K23me3.

size image', 'Table 1 Data collection and refinement statistics.Full size table', 'The structure of the H3K23me3-bound KDM4A-DTD shows that the trimethyl lysine group of H3K23 is coordinated via cation- and/or hydrophobic interactions by an aromatic cage formed by F932, W967 and Y973 of the reader domain (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the selectivity of methylation state on H3K23, we determined binding constants of KDM4A-DTD for mono-/di-/trimethylated H3K23 peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The binding results suggest the KDM4A-DTD aromatic cage favours trimethyl lysine (Kd=2.20 M) over dimethyl lysine (Kd=9.06 M), or monomethyl lysine (Kd=98.55 M) at H3K23 (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correspondingly, H3K23me3 binding is greatly decreased (Kd=284.90 M) with the aromatic cage substitution Y973A (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conserved role of this aromatic cage in directing PTM selectivity (Supplementary Fig 2b) towards trimethyl lysine suggests specific recognition with H3K23me3 is influenced by neighbouring residues besides the trimethyl lysine moiety on histones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orientation of H3K23me3 peptide in KDM4A is more similar to H3K4me3 than H4K20me3 peptide (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, other H3K4me3 reader domains such as ING2-PHD could not bind H3K23me3 (Supplementary Fig 2c), because ING2-PHD recognizes the free N terminus (H3A1) of H3K4me3 peptide and does not accommodate the longer N terminus of H3K23me3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the more open channel between the two lobes in DTDs can accommodate the longer polypeptide chain N-terminal to H3K23me3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'H3T22, the neighbouring residue of H3K23, plays an important role in the H3K23me3 recognition by KDM4A-DTD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H3T22 side chain forms a hydrogen bond with N940, whereas its main chain forms hydrogen bonds with N940 and S938 side chains (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The importance of H3T22 in H3K23me3-binding is illustrated by the decreased H3K23me3 binding with phosphorylation on H3T22 (Kd=83.69 M) or when N940 is changed into Ala in KDM4A (Kd=57.41 M; Fig 2g), both of which would interfere with the hydrogen bond of H3T22 side chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of H3T22ph on H3K23me3 binding is reminiscent of the relationship between H3T3ph and H3K4me3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, a similar loss of KDM4A binding to H3K4me3 was observed with H3T3ph (Supplementary Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Unique contacts with H3R26 also contribute to H3K23me3 recognition by KDM4A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The H3R26 side chain forms a hydrogen bond with KDM4A N931 (2.9 Å), whereas the main chain of H3R26 forms a hydrogen bond with the KDM4A-DTD G935 main chain (Fig 2h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H3R26 fits nicely into a negatively charged cleft formed by residues spanning from E929 to D933 (Supplementary Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To provide direct biochemical evidence of the H3R26N931 interaction pair in H3K23me3 recognition, we modified H3R26 in the context of H3K23me3 peptide and observed decreased binding (32.3 M) between wild-type KDM4A-DTD and H3K23me3R26A peptide (Fig 2i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, modifying H3R26 with asymmetric dimethylation dropped H3K23me3 binding mildly to 8.7 M (Fig 2i), suggesting KDM4A-DTD might read H3K23me3 and H3R26me2a in a combinatorial manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed a dramatic decrease in H3K23me3 binding (73.9 M) with N931R substitution (Fig 2j), which could form electrostatic repulsion with H3R26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, changing N931 into aspartic acid (N931D) increased H3K23me3 binding by about threefold (Kd=0.85 M; Fig 2j), potentially by providing ionic interaction with H3R26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, N931D also increased H3K14me3 binding (Kd=12.24 M; Supplementary Fig 2f), likely to be due to the enhanced ionic interaction between D931 and H3R17 at the +3 site of H3K14me3, reminiscent of the distance between H3K23me3 and H3R26 at the +3 position (Supplementary Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the H3R26N931 pair mediates H3K23me3 recognition by KDM4A-DTD and this contact is unique to H3K23me3 binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides main-chain hydrogen bonds between H3R26 and G935, other main-chain hydrogen bonds are found between H3A24 and F937, together forming three -sheet-like main-chain hydrogen bonds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intermolecular interactions determined from the KDM4A-H3K23me3 co-crystal structure involve all residues from H3L20 to H3R26 (Fig 2k), consistent with the clear electron density of this region in the structure (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecular arrangement of the H3K23me3-bound structure defines an H3K23me3-specific interaction network and suggests that modifications on H3T22 and H3R26 could play regulatory roles in modulating DTD binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'H3K23me3 recognition by specific side-chain interactions', 'Previously, H3K4me3 and H4K20me3 were characterized as histone PTMs recognized by KDM4A-DTD23,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D945 of KDM4A was identified as the residue important for H3K4me3 binding by forming a salt bridge with H3R2, whereas D939 was reported critical for H4K20me3 binding due to its interaction with H4R19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We noted that neither D945 nor D939 contacts the H3K23me3 peptide in the KDM4AH3K23me3 structure (Fig 2k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this observation, we generated a series of D945 substitutions (D945A/L/S) and found that they did not affect H3K23me3 binding, although such changes did decrease H3K4me3 binding (Supplementary Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, D939A only weakens H4K20me3 binding but not H3K23me3 binding or H3K4me3 binding (Supplementary Fig 3ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that individual KDM4-DTD substitutions at different residues could exclusively disrupt H3K23me3, H3K4me3 and H4K20me3 binding, respectively, without affecting the other two interactions, demonstrates that H3K23me3 recognition is distinct from either H3K4me3 or H4K20me3 interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To further confirm the specific H3K23me3 recognition is mediated by unique side chain interactions, we combined amino acid substitutions that reduce H3K4me3 (D945R) and H4K20me3 (D939R) affinity, while increasing H3K23me3 affinity (N931D) as a triple mutant (DRR) in KDM4A-DTD (Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DRR mutant retained a low micromolar Kd value for H3K23me3 binding, while discriminating against other PTM states, leading to overall enhanced H3K23me3 specificity (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The engineered DRR reader domain specifically recognized H3K23me3 full-length recombinant histone (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The successful engineering to selectively recognize H3K23me3-containing histones highlights the

interacts with H3K23me3 with high discrimination (Fig 1d), we investigated whether KDM4B-DTD engages H3K23me3 using intermolecular interactions similar to KDM4A-DTD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, KDM4B-DTD binds H3K23me3 with sensitivity to PTM states on H3K23 and neighbouring residues in a similar fashion to that observed for KDM4A-DTD (Fig 4a,b), suggesting that the interaction network with H3K23me3 is shared between KDM4A-DTD and KDM4B-DTD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our initial analysis showed a unique specificity of KDM4B-DTD: unlike KDM4A-DTD and KDM4C-DTD, KDM4B-DTD displayed dramatically poor interaction with H3K4me3 (Fig 1b,d and Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such poor interaction with H3K4me3 was also confirmed with more physiologically relevant chromatin substrates, native nucleosomes purified from human cell line MCF-7, and KDM4B-DTD showed no enrichment of H3K4me3-containing chromatin (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, KDM4B-DTD displayed H3K23me3-specific binding

interactions in the modelled KDM4B-H3K4me3 structure (Fig 4fi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first noticed that N960 in KDM4B-DTD showed a significant steric clash with H3A1 and H3R2 in the model (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether N960 hinders the interaction between H3K4me3 and KDM4B-DTD, we made the Asn-to-Ala substitution, which should alleviate the steric clash.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, with the N960A variant, H3K4me3 binding was rescued to Kd=303 M, whereas the corresponding substitutions in KDM4A (N940A) dramatically decreased H3K4me3 binding (Fig 4g), most probably due to disrupting the hydrogen bond with H3T3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S965 in KDM4B might also contribute to the poor affinity for H3K4me3, probably due to the lack of strong ionic interaction between H3R2 and S965; such ionic interaction is fulfilled between KDM4A-D945 and H3R2 (Fig 4h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, KDM4B-S965 forms a weaker hydrogen bond (3.9 Å) with H3R2 in the modelled structure than KDM4A-D945 (3.0 Å; Fig 4h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this hypothesis, H3K4me3 binding in KDM4B-S965D (Kd200 M) is tighter than that in wild-type KDM4B (Kd not measurable; Fig 4i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this study, we described the molecular basis and functional relevance of H3K23me3 recognition by the KDM4A and KDM4B DTDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biochemical analysis revealed the intricate molecular interactions that govern PTM specificity and sequence specificity of KDM4-DTDs for H3K23me3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we demonstrated the significance of side-chain interactions with residues surrounding the trimethyl lysine in mediating KDM4B-DTDs binding preference of H3K23me3 over H3K4me3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study suggests a role for KDM4B in heterochromatin maintenance during meiosis, mediated by H3K23me3-dependent binding and demethylation of H3K36me3 (Fig 6e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, our results support a conserved role of H3K23me3 during germ cell development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'KDM4 demethylases are conserved epigenetic regulators of histone methylation that are required for normal development5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C-terminal DTDs in the multiple KDM4 homologues are only present in vertebrates (Supplementary Fig 8), suggesting functional diversification as a result of genome duplication during evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sophisticated intermolecular interactions present in KDM4-DTDs revealed by this study underlies the histone interactomes of human KDM4AC DTDs and sheds light on distinct functions of KDM4 members14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mild phenotype of individual KDM4 knockout mice40,41 implicates some compensating functions among KDM4 members, which is consistent with overlapping histone PTM interactomes among KDM4AC DTDs (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the H3K23me3-specific reader KDM4B-DTD displays poor H3K4me3 binding, whereas KDM4A-DTD and KDM4C-DTD have low-micromolar binding affinity with H3K4me3 (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is in line with previous findings that KDM4C but not KDM4B overlaps with H3K4me3 genomic distribution and the fact that targeting of KDM4C is dependent on its DTD16,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, the data suggest a model in which chromatin association of KDM4 members is mediated by both their divergent and common reader binding targets, to ensure correct epigenetic programming during development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Germ cell chromatin is subject to epigenetic regulation42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we propose that H3K23me3 and H3K36me3 might be involved in mammalian germ cell development, especially during the mitosis-to-meiosis transition, through cross-talk between the KDM4 reader and catalytic domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We revealed H3K23me3 enrichment in mouse and rat testes, specifically in primary spermatocytes undergoing meiosis (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provides further evidence about H3K23me3 being a conserved histone modification associated with meiotic chromatin, as previously identified in Tetrahymena and C. elegans32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enrichment of H3K23me3 is also consistent with reduced immunostaining of H3K23ac during preleptotene to pachytene stage in mouse testes tissues44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The function and mechanism of this unique association with meiotic chromatin still needs further investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains to be experimentally tested whether H3K23me3 plays similar roles in meiotic DNA damage in both mammalian systems and Tetrahymena32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previously, the KDM4 family and H3K36me3 were independently implicated in germ cell development5,41,45;
