DNA damage induces a meiotic arrest in mouse oocytes mediated by the spindle assembly checkpoint  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Extensive damage to maternal DNA during meiosis causes infertility, birth defects and abortions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is unknown if fully grown oocytes have a mechanism to prevent the creation of DNA-damaged embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that DNA damage activates a pathway involving the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) in response to chemically induced double strand breaks, UVB and ionizing radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA damage can occur either before or after nuclear envelope breakdown, and provides an effective block to anaphase-promoting complex activity, and consequently the formation of mature eggs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This contrasts with somatic cells, where DNA damage fails to affect mitotic progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it uncovers a second function for the meiotic SAC, which in the context of detecting microtubulekinetochore errors has hitherto been labelled as weak or ineffectual in mammalian oocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that its essential role in the detection of DNA damage sheds new light on its biological purpose in mammalian female meiosis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Maternal DNA damage is universally detrimental to reproductive success: causing infertility, birth defects and abortions1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, strategies within gametes are known to exist that mitigate the impact of these events4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example in the early phases of follicular growth, oocyte atresia is stimulated following DNA damage5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, oocytes contained in primordial follicles undergo apoptosis in response to DNA damage, so protecting the propagation of harmful mutations from the female germline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this can lead to sterility in women undergoing chemo- or radiotherapy due to a marked reduction in ovarian follicle reserve, and at a cellular level is mediated in oocytes by activation of the p53 family member Trp63 (refs 5, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Trp63 expression is limited to oocytes from primordial and primary follicles, and as such is absent from fully grown oocytes that are found in more advanced stage follicles5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, given the high protection placed on oocytes in primordial follicles, one would anticipate a p53-independent mechanism in fully grown oocytes that prevents formation of DNA-damaged embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this supposition appears incorrect in the face of observations that show a weak G2/M transition DNA damage response (DDR) checkpoint and catenation checkpoint in fully grown oocytes7,8, both of which are prominent in somatic cells9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The SAC is a universally employed cell checkpoint, present in mouse oocytes11,12,13,14,15,16,17, that acts to prevent aneuploidy by inhibiting the activity of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) before chromosomes are ready to divide faithfully18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In somatic cells, the SAC prevents chromatid mis-segregation at anaphase, and consequently aneuploidy in daughter cells, by inhibiting APC activity until a time at which kinetochores from sister chromatid pairs are all attached to microtubules18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SAC, which is composed principally of members of the Bub and Mad families, does this by using unoccupied kinetochores as a platform to build and amplify a cytosolic and potent APC inhibitory complex20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the attachment generates tension across sister chromatids, when the kinetochores of the pair attach to microtubules emanating from opposite poles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This state, known as biorientation, promotes faithful segregation of chromatids at anaphase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Development of tension across the sister chromatid pair aids biorientation by stabilizing microtubule interaction with the kinetochores, so turning weak often side-on interaction into strong end-on k-fibres that can pull on chromosomes19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We speculated here whether the meiotic SAC could be involved in sensing DNA damage in oocytes, so providing a protective checkpoint against the formation of embryos with damaged DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, neocarzinostatin and laser-beam dissection that cuts DNA, have both been reported to delay or arrest oocytes in meiosis I (MI)21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, there is growing evidence to show cross-talk between two major cell cycle checkpoints: the DDR and the SAC23,24,25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, proteins associated with one checkpoint have been identified as having moonlighting roles in the other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, RNAi silencing of nearly all members of the Fanconi Anaemia pathway, involved in DNA crosslink repair, abrogates the SAC in both HeLa cells and primary cells cultured from Fanconi Anaemia patients26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, in DT40 cells, loss of the DDR kinase Chk1 leads to a failure of the SAC component BubR1 to be targeted to kinetochores, possibly due to lowered activity and phosphorylation of Aurora kinase B, and this is associated with an inability of the cells to arrest with taxol27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase and MDC1 have been shown to be important in recruiting the SAC component Mad2 and the APC activator Cdc20 to kinetochores of U2OS cells24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In budding yeast, the reciprocal association has also been reported, with Mad2 involved in a DDR response during the G2/M transition23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, in HeLa cells Bub1 contributes to an optimal DDR following ionizing radiation, and has been shown to be a substrate of ataxia telangiectasia mutated28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite the possibilities of overlapping functions for some DDR proteins in the SAC, it seems clear from somatic cells that the DDR is actually suppressed during mitosis29,30,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So for example, when human somatic cell lines have their DNA damaged in mitosis they do not activate the SAC32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed a diminution in the efficacy of the DDR during mitosis is thought to be essential to protect against telomere fusions that could otherwise be generated during repair33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the present study set out to establish whether there was meiotic association of DNA damage with the SAC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that both physical- and chemical-induced DNA damage given to mouse oocytes has the capacity to induce an MI arrest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This arrest is associated with a block to APC activity and raised levels of Mad2 on kinetochores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it is dependent on the presence of Mad2 and can be alleviated by reducing Mps1 activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such it is proposed that DNA damage has the capacity to help prevent the creation of deleterious eggs by activating a pathway involving SAC proteins.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Fig 5a); (ii) displacement from the metaphase plate, which reduces as balanced microtubule forces position bivalents at the spindle midpoint (Fig 5b); and, (iii) bivalent orientation, the angle () that subtends the axes formed between the bivalent and the spindle equator - and tends to 90° as bivalents align with the pole-to-pole axis (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A three-axis plot of tension, displacement and , and colouring each bivalent by the number of s.d.s from the mean at 8 h, demonstrates the process of congression and biorientation in the hours leading up to anaphase in untreated oocytes (2 h, Fig 5d;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The present study shows that DNA-damaging agents have the ability to activate the SAC in mouse oocytes during MI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These conclusions are based on the findings that (i) the arrest is associated with securin stabilization, a process consistent with APC inhibition, (ii) Mps1 inhibition recovers the ability to initiate securin degradation and complete MI, and, (iii) the arrest is Mad2 dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the fact that both Mps1 and Mad2 are fundamental components of the SAC18,19,20, whose downstream target is the APC, we implicate this checkpoint in the DNA-damage-induced meiotic arrest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The timing of DNA damage here was performed primarily prior to NEB, although we observed it can be induced after NEB with the same effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present findings used four agents capable of inducing DSBs (chemical damage with bleomycin and etoposide; and physical damage with ultraviolet B and ionizing radiation), but the phenomenon may be independent of the initiating agent, given that neocarzinostatin and laser-beam dissection, which cuts DNA, have previously been reported to delay oocytes in MI or arrest them21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The failure to complete MI appeared to be associated with a long-lasting arrest for three of the four DNA-damaging agents (etoposide; ionizing radiation; ultraviolet B), rather than a small delay, given most undamaged oocytes have undergone MI completion by 9 h, but DNA damage caused substantial numbers to remain arrested until 25 h. During this window, oocytes would have been ovulated (1011 h) and fertilized (1518 h)49,50, with oocytes more than 10 h after ovulation showing greatly reduced ability to become fertilized and produce viable embryos50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It seems likely that a kinetochore-based SAC activation pathway is activated by DNA damage, because Mad2 kinetochore levels were raised.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, however, it remains possible that DNA fragments, generated by the four agents used, also contribute to APC inhibition by providing a platform on which the SAC signal is initiated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, components of the SAC have been shown to assemble independently of the kinetochore51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We only observed fragments in 50% of the oocytes examined, so if they do contribute to the SAC-mediated arrest, their size must be below the limits of detection, or they become entangled with other bivalents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'How Mad2 could accumulate on the kinetochores of DNA-damaged oocytes is presently unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bivalents and the their sister kinetochore pairs were tracked by 4D-CLSM during MI following DNA damage to measure accurately the timing of tension development as they became stretched.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such measurements of biorientation were found to be largely unaffected by damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it seems unlikely that DNA damage is affecting tension development across the bivalent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, previous studies have highlighted that high levels of bivalent misalignment and lack of tension can be tolerated in oocytes11,12,13,14,15,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such it seems highly unlikely that it is a failure of tension development across DNA-damaged bivalents that would raise Mad2 levels on kinetochores sufficient to stall MI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We currently do not fully understand the factors that contribute to the strength of the SAC signal in oocytes53,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So, for example, the SAC signal stays partially on during much of MI, reducing APC activity by 50%, but the mechanism behind this rise is not known44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the level of centromeric cohesin can affect the strength of the SAC signal in mouse oocytes, such that loss of cohesin negatively impacts on the strength of the SAC, although mechanistically how this is achieved remains unknown55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This latter finding illustrates an important precedent that factors independent of the immediate location of the kinetochore can influence the strength of the SAC signal during MI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that DNA damage is similarly a factor able to act at a distance to the kinetochore, and amplify by a process not yet resolved the residual SAC signal that stays partially on in MI44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In somatic cells, the DDR is suppressed during mitosis29,30,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a diminution in the efficacy of the DDR protects against telomere fusions that could otherwise be generated during repair33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, and in contrast to the present findings in meiosis, when examined directly in human somatic cells lines, mitotic DNA damage has no capacity to activate the SAC32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The meiotic arrest observed in the present study was initiated by both chemical- and physical-damaging stimuli, and is distinct from the M-phase decatenation arrest, which is both SAC- and DNA-damage independent56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, oocytes lack both a G2/M transition DDR checkpoint and a catenation checkpoint7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, here we have demonstrated what we believe to be a distinct and novel meiotic checkpoint.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of such a DNA checkpoint uncovers a hitherto unappreciated function of the SAC in female mammalian meiosis, which would very much help prevent oocytes with damaged DNA progressing to become fertilizable mature eggs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work needs to establish the precise mechanism at play between DNA damage and the SAC, but as a working hypothesis it may involve another member of the p53 family (that is, not Trp63), possibly p73, which is known to be involved in DDR57,58, but which also seems essential for the establishment of the SAC in mouse oocytes59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The present findings point to the SAC being an important control mechanism in oocytes-preventing formation of DNA-damaged embryos; and allude to a SAC function that extends beyond its recognized actions in monitoring bivalent alignment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The meiotic SAC appears inherently weaker than its mitotic counterpart to the canonical signals of microtubule attachment and tension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With respect to attachment, this may be due to the changes in the architecture of microtubulekinetochore interaction, which is uniquely set up so as to mono-orientate the sister kinetochore pair in MI, rather than biorientate it as it does in mitosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With respect to tension, this may be because tension uniquely in MI has to propagate along the length of the chromosome, and therefore would become influenced by the elastic buffering capacity of chromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the protracted length of meiosis (several hours in mouse) compared with mitosis, may allow a DNA-damage signal to propagate for long enough to influence the SAC.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
