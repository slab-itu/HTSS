Joint-specific DNA methylation and transcriptome signatures in rheumatoid arthritis identify distinct pathogenic processes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Stratifying patients on the basis of molecular signatures could facilitate development of therapeutics that target pathways specific to a particular disease or tissue location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies suggest that pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is similar in all affected joints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that distinct DNA methylation and transcriptome signatures not only discriminate RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) from osteoarthritis FLS, but also distinguish RA FLS isolated from knees and hips.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using genome-wide methods, we show differences between RA knee and hip FLS in the methylation of genes encoding biological pathways, such as IL-6 signalling via JAK-STAT pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, differentially expressed genes are identified between knee and hip FLS using RNA-sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Double-evidenced genes that are both differentially methylated and expressed include multiple HOX genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Joint-specific DNA signatures suggest that RA disease mechanisms might vary from joint to joint, thus potentially explaining some of the diversity of drug responses in RA patients.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) therapy remains an unmet medical need, despite improvement1, in part due to the diversity of pathogenic pathways in RA2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the methods used to assess therapeutic response in clinical trials focus on total disease burden rather than synovitis in individual joints3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of RA is generally symmetrical and often evolves from the small joints of the hands and wrists to more diffuse involvement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there is no information as to why some joints are commonly inflamed (metacarpal phalangeal joints), some are uncommon (distal interphalangeal joints) and some are mainly affected in severe late disease (hips).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that epigenetic patterns in the unique cells that line joints, namely fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), contribute to differences in synovial inflammation and clinical response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Growing evidence suggests that epigenetics has an important role in the pathogenesis of RA, which is an immune-mediated disease affecting diarthrodial joints7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously identified a DNA methylation signature that distinguishes RA FLS from osteoarthritis (OA) FLS9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells display a unique aggressive phenotype in RA and contribute to synovitis and matrix destruction through the production of small-molecule mediators, cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By integrating our DNA methylation data with gene expression and genome-wide association study data, several potential drug targets were identified12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we showed differences of epigenomic signatures in early RA and long-standing RA suggesting plasticity in DNA methylation over time13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Characteristic changes of synovitis, including synovial lining hyperplasia and sublining infiltration with mononuclear cells, are present in many joint types during RA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, previous studies did not reveal significant differences in histology or cytokine expression between various RA joints14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, those studies focused primarily on candidate gene approaches and used relatively insensitive techniques, such as immunohistochemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternative methods to assess spatially defined pathogenic mechanisms include quantification of epigenomic marks and transcriptomes using unbiased techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, DNA methylation has been profiled in various human tissues, and location-specific epigenomic patterns control tissue development and differentiation15,16,17,18,19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As joint-specific pathogenic differences could influence response to therapy, here we evaluate DNA methylation and gene expression signatures in hips and knees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first expand our RA and OA sample sets and confirm the RA epigenomic signature in FLS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then compare DNA methylation and the transcriptome from FLS isolated from these two sites and identify joint-specific signatures and pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that distinct mechanisms of disease in different joints could contribute to the pathogenesis of RA and variable responses to therapy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Confirmation and expansion of DNA methylation signature', 'We collected an independent set of 19 RA and 5 OA FLS from total joint replacement surgeries to complement our previous data set of 11 RA

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our studies demonstrate joint location-specific epigenetic marks that could contribute to local pathogenic and developmental mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focused on FLS for a variety of reasons, most notably because they display a unique aggressive phenotype in RA and contribute to cytokine production and joint damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also have not been targeted by new therapeutics and are a treatment opportunity that would not affect adaptive immunity22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, FLS are a homogeneous population compared with the mixture of cells that populate the inflamed synovium and create complexity when trying to deconvolute data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using FLS and the expanded data set, we first confirmed the DNA methylation signature of RA defined in our previous study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then showed that RA FLS have distinct DNA methylation and gene expression patterns based on the joint of origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that joints might differentially respond to highly targeted therapeutic agents and that this possibility should be considered in clinical trial design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our analysis has potential limitations, in part, because of the nature of arthroplasty surgery today.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hip and knee surgeries are the most common in RA and OA, which limits our ability to sample enough synovia from other joints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also could not compare within-patient samples (that is, hip and knee from the same patient) because patients rarely have simultaneous arthroplasties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of cultured FLS introduces potential for the influence of culture conditions; current technology precluded the use of primary FLS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the FLS methylation profile is stable despite prolonged culture and the aggressive FLS phenotype is maintained for months after isolating from synovial tissue9,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, hip and knee FLS were purified and grown the same way but still had very different methylomes and transcriptomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, our population is enriched for longstanding disease, which would be an advantage because it decreases the potential for epigenetic differences that might be based on duration of disease13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these limitations, RA- and joint-specific genes and pathways were identified suggesting distinct pathogenic mechanisms can be identified even when potential disease-independent differences were taken into account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The notion that all joints exhibit similar pathology in RA has been evaluated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, no significant differences in histology and cytokine expression in various joints were observed using immunohistochemistry14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differences between our results and previous studies are likely due to the sensitivity of techniques and the use of unbiased rather than candidate gene approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One interesting corollary relates to the observation that FLS can potentially migrate from joint to joint24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, location-specific signatures suggest that local conditions could shape the epigenome after cells arrive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We also compared the magnitude of RA hip/knee differences with RA/OA differences using computational methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, within-disease changes (for example, RA hip to RA knee) were less than the differences between RA and OA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pathways and genes that are most likely related to hip and knee development because they were shared across diseases were estimated and subtracted from the RA hip and knee data to estimate RA-specific changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RA hip- or knee-specific pathways are related to inflammation and immune responses and support the notion that RA joints could have distinct pathogenic mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Among the differences between hips and knees, we were struck by the preponderance of developmental genes that emerged in both transcriptomics and methylomics studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highly conserved HOX genes encode transcription factors of embryonic development that regulate limb morphogenesis and skeletal formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During vertebrate embryo development, the HOX genes specify regional differences along the anteriorposterior axis25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The location-specific expression of HOX genes might contribute to defining joint-specific biology and function, and the impact on pathogenesis of disease is not fully understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differential expression of HOX genes in RA has been previously identified and supports the notion that the genes and pathways are not random26,27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The clinical relevance of joint-specific pathways could be important when considering how drugs are tested in RA clinical trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current metrics do not distinguish which joints respond; instead, only the total number of swollen and tender joints is counted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, investigators could potentially overlook site-specific responses or patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hips are rarely evaluated in most clinical trial tools, such as the DAS28 (refs 29, 30), so a differential response in the hip would be missed entirely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, clinical trialists had no method to determine whether individual joints differentially respond to targeted agents; to date, there was no particular reason to do so to consider this issue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because our study found location-specific methylation and transcriptome signatures, it raises the possibility that asynchronous responses might occur with RA therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although speculative, this could be an important consideration that in the context of clinical trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we have shown joint-specific differences in epigenetic imprinting and gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of these differences could be due to the role of FLS in joint development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, RA-specific differential gene expression and methylation pathways are also evident.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The methylome and transcriptome differences between knees and hips in RA could potentially contribute to differential responses to highly targeted agents.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
