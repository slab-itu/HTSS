Therapeutic microparticles functionalized with biomimetic cardiac stem cell membranes and secretome  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Stem cell therapy represents a promising strategy in regenerative medicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, cells need to be carefully preserved and processed before usage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, cell transplantation carries immunogenicity and/or tumourigenicity risks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mounting lines of evidence indicate that stem cells exert their beneficial effects mainly through secretion (of regenerative factors) and membrane-based cellcell interaction with the injured cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we fabricate a synthetic cell-mimicking microparticle (CMMP) that recapitulates stem cell functions in tissue repair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CMMPs carry similar secreted proteins and membranes as genuine cardiac stem cells do.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a mouse model of myocardial infarction, injection of CMMPs leads to the preservation of viable myocardium and augmentation of cardiac functions similar to cardiac stem cell therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CMMPs (derived from human cells) do not stimulate T-cell infiltration in immuno-competent mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, CMMPs act as synthetic stem cells which mimic the paracrine and biointerfacing activities of natural stem cells in therapeutic cardiac regeneration.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Multiple types of adult stem cells, such as mesenchymal stem cells, cardiac stem cells (CSCs), and endothelial progenitor cells have entered clinical investigations worldwide1,2,3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differentiation of injected cells into the host tissues has been reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these sporadic events could not explain the therapeutic benefits seen in animal models and human trials7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Later on, the field realized that one important mode of therapeutic action is the secretion of paracrine factors by injected stem cells that act like mini-drug pumps to promote endogenous repair9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, stem cell membranes are not null in the repair process: contact with the injected stem cells triggers intracellular protective/regenerative pathways in the host cells11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of these two aspects, we proposed a core-shell design of a therapeutic microparticle (MP) which mimicked stem cell biointerfacing during regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This particle, named cell-mimicking MP (CMMP), contained control-released stem cell factors in its polymeric core and was cloaked with stem cell membrane fragments on the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our hypothesis is that CMMP can exert similar regenerative outcomes as real CSCs but are superior to the later since they are more stable during storage and do not stimulate T-cell immune reaction since they are not real cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the present study, we report for the first time a poylmer MP which emulates CSC functions during tissue repair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a mouse model of myocardial infarction, injection of CMMPs led to preservation of viable myocardium and augmentation of cardiac functions similar to CSC therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CMMPs (derived from human cells) did not stimulate T-cell infiltration in immuno-competent mice, suggesting their excellent safety profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our first application targeted the heart, the CMMP strategy represents a platform technology that can be applied to multiple stem cell types and the repair of various organ systems.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The last one and a half decades witnessed the booming of stem cell therapies for multiple diseases16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deviating from the initial perspective that stem cells exert their therapeutic effects through direct cell differentiation and tissue replacement, the paradigm has shifted as emerging evidence suggests that most adult stem cell types exert their beneficial effects through paracrine mechanisms (soluble factors)19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, studies further suggest that cellcell contact between the injected cells and the host cells plays an important role in tissue regeneration11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PLGA, as a biocompatible and biodegradable polymer, has provided a safe and non-toxic building block for various control-release systems22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have demonstrated the success of coating PLGA nanoparticles with cell membranes from red blood cells23, platelets24 and cancer cells25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inspired by these findings, we designed CMMPs and demonstrated the therapeutic effects of CMMPs in an experimental myocardial infarction model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparison between CMMP and CSCs is outlined in Supplementary Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CMMP represents a synthetic MP functionalized with both stem cell membranes and secretome, harnessing the power of these two major components of stem cell-induced regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, CMMP overcomes several major limitations of live stem cells as therapy products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, stem cells need to be carefully cryo-preserved and thawed before they can be sent to the clinic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As living organisms, how the cells are prepared and processed can greatly affect the therapeutic outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, stem cell transplantation carries certain risks (for example, tumourogenecity and immunogenicity if allogeneic or xenogeneic cells were used).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CMMPs will most likely be delivered intramyocardially via direct muscle injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such injection normally requires open-chest surgery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, percutaneous options are becoming available with the implementation of the NOGA mapping systems27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, our future studies will explore the potential of vascular delivery of CMMPs (for example, intracoronary, intravenous) with the focus on targeting CMMPs to the injury and promoting extravasation through the mechanism of angiopellosis28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One caveat of our study is that with the existing assay it is difficult to conclude whether cardiomyocytes (or their progenitors) really are proliferating and leading to remuscularization after CMMP injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this proof-of-concept study targets the heart, CMMP represents a platform technology that is generalizable to other stem cell types and the repair of various other organ systems.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
