A peripheral epigenetic signature of immune system genes is linked to neocortical thickness and memory  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Increasing age is tightly linked to decreased thickness of the human neocortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biological mechanisms that mediate this effect are hitherto unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DNA methylome, as part of the epigenome, contributes significantly to age-related phenotypic changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we identify an epigenetic signature that is associated with cortical thickness (P=3.86 × 108) and memory performance in 533 healthy young adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The epigenetic effect on cortical thickness was replicated in a sample comprising 596 participants with major depressive disorder and healthy controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The epigenetic signature mediates partially the effect of age on cortical thickness (P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A multilocus genetic score reflecting genetic variability of this signature is associated with memory performance (P=0.0003) in 3,346 young and elderly healthy adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genomic location of the contributing methylation sites points to the involvement of specific immune system genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decomposition of blood methylome-wide patterns bears considerable potential for the study of brain-related traits.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Human cortical thickness, a brain morphometric measure that is linked to cognitive functioning, reflects the amount of neurons and neuropil in the horizontal layers of the cortical columns that are responsible for the organization of cortical connectivity1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent data suggest a monotonic decrease in cortical thickness (cortical thinning) from preschool age throughout the lifespan4, but previous studies have also described patterns of regional increase in cortical thickness during childhood5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Studies in twins and in unrelated individuals provide consistently high heritability estimates for cortical thickness (80%), demonstrating the importance of naturally occurring genetic variation for this physiological trait8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the well-known and substantial impact of age on cortical thinning, the biological mechanisms that mediate this effect are hitherto unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is reasonable to assume that age-related, dynamic processes, such as epigenetic changes, represent good candidates for such mediators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'DNA methylation, the most extensively studied epigenetic modification to date, regulates important processes such as imprinting, chromosomal inactivation and gene expression10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Age represents one of the most potent factors known to correlate with physiological variation of global DNA methylation11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-throughput quantification of DNA methylation at several hundreds of thousands of C-phosphate-G (CpG) sites has detected numerous CpG loci across various tissues undergoing differential methylation with age13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, such loci have been identified within regulatory regions of genes that are known to undergo differential expression in such age-related conditions as Alzheimers disease13 and cancer17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, DNA methylation markers predicting chronological age were shown to correlate with all-cause mortality18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA methylation levels can also be influenced by genetic variations19,20 and age-related DNA methylation signatures represent heritable traits18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Thus, the existing data suggest that peripherally measured DNA methylation patterns might contribute to the identification of molecular underpinnings of age-related complex traits relevant to health and disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we investigated the relation between peripherally measured DNA methylation and cortical thickness in healthy young adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a first step, we performed Independent Component Analysis (ICA)-based decomposition of whole-blood methylomic profiles to identify independent signatures of physiological variation of global DNA methylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ICA is a decomposition method, which provides a representation of complex relationships arising from high-dimensional data, such as genome-wide expression21,22 and brain imaging data23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After ICA-based decomposition, the identified methylation patterns were first tested for association with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Age-associated methylation patterns were subsequently tested for correlation with global cortical thickness and, in case of such correlation, mediation analysis followed to assess whether these methylation patterns mediated significantly the effect of age on cortical thickness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant findings were subjected to further analyses, including functional annotation of CpGs contributing to the observed methylation patterns, testing for pattern association with region-specific cortical thickness and cognitive performance, and a genome-wide investigation of common genetic variations (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) that contribute to the variability of the methylomic patterns.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'ICA-based identification of methylomic patterns', 'We performed methylomic profiling (Illumina 450K Human Methylation array) of blood samples collected from N=533 healthy young individuals (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After quality control, DNA methylation levels (DNAm) were quantified at 397,947 autosomal CpG sites and subsequently corrected for sex and sources of variation inferred from Surrogate Variable Analysis (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Next, we performed ICA to achieve a low-dimensional representation of genome-wide methylation profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the ICA paradigm introduced first for gene expression data analysis21, an individuals methylomic profile is treated as a mixture of latent variables (that is, methylomic signatures), each reflecting a combination of biological processes and exerting independent effects on DNAm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, ICA provides a representation of these signatures by decomposing the original DNAm signals into components, whose statistical inter-dependence is minimized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This property is typically achieved by favouring heavy-tailed non-gaussian distribution of the components loadings; thus each component is characterized by a restricted set of CpGs exhibiting loadings at the extreme of the distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simultaneously, each component is characterized by its representation across the study sample, giving rise to individual methylation patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of these patterns is a low-dimensional representation of a global mode of DNAm variations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, these patterns can be tested for association with traits of the study sample (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: ICA-based identification of DNAm patterns.

singular modes of variation24, subsequent analyses were restricted to the remaining 15 components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These components represent global modes of DNAm variation across the individuals of

negatively correlated with age (r=0.27, P=3.12 × 1010).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Two out of 15 ICA methylomic patterns (termed ICA1 and ICA2) were significantly correlated with age, after Bonferroni

1b and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant correlation was observed between ICA1 and ICA2 (r=0.048; nominal P=0.27), suggesting that the corresponding independent components capture distinct methylomic processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To test whether the significant correlations between ICA2 and cortical thickness were merely attributable to the correlation between age and both types of measurements, age effects were partialled out from ICA2 and cortical thickness (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After this adjustment, a significant correlation was exclusively detected between ICA2 and cortical thickness (r=0.18; P=6.55 × 105, Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correlation remained significant (r=0.17; P=8.74 × 105) also after correcting for individual white blood cell count (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also examined which other available variables (that is, body mass index, smoking, alcohol consumption, frequency of cannabis use) were significantly associated with ICA2 in addition to age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Smoking frequency was also significantly associated with ICA2 (r=0.17, P=0.0001) but not with cortical thickness (r=0.072, P=0.11).

F-test analysis to compare the fit of a model predicting cortical thickness from a fifth degree polynomial of age (age+age^2++age^5) to the fit of the same model augmented by ICA2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a highly significant increase in adjusted R2 with the addition of ICA2 to the model (F(1,507)=15.6, P=8.8 × 105).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the association between ICA2 and cortical thickness is not driven by non-linear age effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We also used in silico annotation of blood cell types as described by Jaffe and Irizarry26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After this adjustment, ICA2 associations with both chronological age and cortical thickness remained highly significant (P=2 × 1011 and P=8.3 × 107, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also examined the association between ICA1 and ICA2 and chronological age in two publicly available data sets of purified blood cells (N=1,202 monocyte samples, age range: 4483, mean age: 60; N=214 CD4+ T-cell samples, age range: 4579, mean age: 59)15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each data set, ICA1 and ICA2 were estimated as the linear combinations between ICA1 and ICA2 loadings, respectively (as inferred from the Swiss DNAm sample), and blood samples DNAm values, adjusted for main confounders (see Supplementary Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cell-specific data sets, we observed a significant positive correlation between ICA patterns and chronological age (monocyte samples, N=1,202: ICA1: r=0.67, P less_than 2.2 × 1016; ICA2 r=0.32, P less_than 2.2 × 1016; CD4+ T-cell samples, N=214: ICA1: r=0.70, P less_than 2.2 × 1016; ICA2: r=0.49; P=8.6 × 1015), suggesting that the ICAage correlations identified in whole-blood are also detectable in individual cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether these results substantiate the lack of influence of blood cell counts on the reported associations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correlation between cortical thickness and ICA1, that showed the strongest correlation with age, was not significant after adjusting for chronological age (r=0.01, P=0.83, Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to chronological age, we also calculated epigenetic cross-tissue- and whole-blood-based predictors in our sample as described by Horvath27 and Hannum et al.14, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both estimators yielded DNA methylation age values (that is, predictors for chronological age based on CpG methylation) that significantly correlated with actual participants age (Horvaths predictor: r=0.70, P less_than 1060; Hannums predictor: r=0.71, P less_than 1060).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither predictor was associated with cortical thickness after adjustment for chronological age (Horvaths: r=0.04, P=0.32; Hannums: r=0.01, P=0.77), suggesting that these predictors (like ICA1 but,

linear combination between ICA2 loadings (as inferred from the Swiss DNAm sample) and individual DNAm values of the Munich sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this independent sample, we observed a significant positive correlation between ICA2 and chronological age (N=596, r=0.48, P less_than 1010) and a negative correlation with global cortical thickness (N=596, r=0.31, P less_than 1010).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

possible links between this methylomic pattern and regional variations in cortical thickness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inter-individual variations in delineated brain regions often coincide with latent structural covariance patterns29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) allows depicting such distinct patterns of volumetric covariance among brain regions that can be subsequently tested for association with additional phenotypes of the population under study30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore performed EFA, considering 68 regional brain measures of thickness (34 per hemisphere) obtained from automated parcellation of the cerebral cortex (Desikan-Killiany atlas)31,32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before analysis, effects of intra-cranial volume, sex, processing batches and age, which possibly drive global correlations among brain regions, were regressed out from individual measures (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using parallel analysis34, we determined eight extractable factors, altogether accounting for 48.9% of variance across regional measures (Supplementary Data 1, see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Factor extraction was followed by varimax orthogonal rotation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subjects factor scores were subsequently tested for association with the age-adjusted ICA2 pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After correction for multiple testing, we identified one factor score, F6, that showed significant correlation with ICA2 (r=0.13, P=0.00314, Bonferroni-adjusted P=0.025 for eight tests conducted)(Fig 3a and Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This factor, accounting for 4% of variance in cortical thickness measures, was characterized by a spatial pattern comprising mainly temporal areas (loadings greater than 0.3), with the highest loadings observed for left and right temporal poles and entorhinal cortices (mean loadings across the four temporal regions: 0.58) (Fig 4 and Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also run EFA under most conservative adjustment of the 68 regional brain measures of thickness for mean global thickness, to study whether the significant regional effects observed herein are fully explained by mean global cortical thickness.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In the present study we applied ICA decomposition of whole-blood genome-wide methylomic profiles in healthy young adults (22.9±3.3 years, mean±s.d.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and detected a specific pattern of DNAm (ICA2) that was associated with cortical thinning and decreased EM performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed that a significant part of the well-known negative correlation between age and cortical thickness was partially mediated by ICA2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CpG sites that contributed to this methylation pattern mapped to genes involved in immune system regulation and inflammatory response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Notwithstanding the robust and replicated findings presented herein, we would like to stress some limitations, which are inherent to the study design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the mediation analysis suggests that ICA2 significantly, albeit partially, mediates the effect of age on cortical thickness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the associative nature of the data, we cannot exclude the possibility that the correlation observed between ICA2 and cortical thickness might also be partially driven by additional non-modelled variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, decomposition of genome-wide methylomic profiles comes at the cost of specificity of the inferred solution towards the genomic localization of CpG markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detection of CpGs contributing to the methylomic signature relies on a fixed threshold on the distribution of the components loadings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our case, this approach allowed relating ICA2 broadly to genes involved in immune system function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the specific relationships between the identified marker sets and the phenotypes of interest can be studied only in downstream experiments focusing on single CpG sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, the ICA model relies on the assumption that methylomic signals arise from a fixed set of independent sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of a priori knowledge about the source signal, the number of inferred components must be determined empirically, which might impact negatively on generalizability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Integration of multiple-layers of molecular traits, such as genotypic data used in this study, is therefore important to address whether the identified patterns represent relevant features of the data set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The cellular mechanisms underlying changes in cortical thickness are not entirely clear; however, they are most likely life phase-dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During development, cortical thinning might be related to events mirroring cortical maturation, such as synaptic pruning47, whereas shrinkage of neurons, reductions of synaptic spines and lower numbers of synapses probably account for adult age-related cortical thinning48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, myelination of lower cortical layers might cause the cortical mantle to appear thinner on MR scans49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenomenon might account for a substantial part of the observed cortical thinning during development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correlation between cortical thickness and cognitive function also seems to be age-dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In adulthood and old age, cortical thinning is associated with a decline in cognitive function3, whereas during development this relationship is dynamic with predominantly negative correlation between cognitive function and cortical thickness in early childhood to a positive correlation in late childhood and beyond6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, a substantial proportion of the strength of the relation between cortical thinning and cognitive decline in adults is attributable to the influence of age in each type of measure3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The association of ICA2 with cortical thickness and EM performance reported herein supports observations relating the peripheral immune system to brain morphology and cognition50,51 and is coherent with the notion that the brain and its functions is directly linked to peripheral tissues relevant to the function of the immune system52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data presented herein might suggest high concordance of the cortical thickness-related blood DNAm patterns with DNAm of B lymphocytes and of the common myeloid progenitor lineage, and relatively less concordance with DNAm of natural killer cells and T lymphocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, it is important to stress that we cannot draw any mechanistic conclusions about the relationship between peripheral methylation on the one side and cortical thickness and EM performance on the other, and that no further inference can be drawn towards the contribution of a specific immune cell type to the reported associations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the mechanisms through which the peripheral immune system exerts an influence on the central nervous system remain elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct cytokine-induced central responses or indirect cytokine-mediated changes within the central nervous system via activation of vagal-nerve afferents are being discussed among possible scenarios53,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, methylation sites related to IL6R (encoding interleukin 6 receptor), ZC3H12D (encoding zinc finger CCCH-type containing 12D) and CD4 (encoding CD4 molecule) are listed among the top ten ICA2 contributing CpGs (Supplementary Data 2) in our data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The products of these genes are centrally implicated in cytokine signalling, mRNA stability of cytokine genes and immunological response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will be interesting to investigate whether direct measurement of the immune factors implicated herein along with traditional blood markers of the immune system will provide additional information with regard to the relation between these immune factors and cortical thickness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that this might not be the case, given the substantial volatility of such direct measurements, which mostly reflect acute state of the immune system, whereas methylation profiles reflect, at least partially, a record of past immune regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, further experimental work is warranted to test this hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Inter-individual variability in blood cell composition is known to influence whole-blood DNAm measurements55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our population of healthy young adults, no significant association between blood cell sub-types and cortical thickness or EM performance was observed (Supplementary Table 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the associations between ICA2, cortical thickness and EM were significant also after correction for blood cell composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we observed a significant positive correlation between ICA patterns (ICA1 and ICA2) and chronological age in the examined blood cell-specific data sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is unlikely that the detected associations are driven by inter-individual variability in composition of blood cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to studying methylation patterns, we also performed a genome-wide SNP-based analysis of ICA2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reasons for this analysis were two-fold: (1) Given the fact that genetic variation is related to DNA methylation, we tested whether ICA2-related genetic variation can be used as a proxy for DNA methylation in larger samples, where such epigenetic measures were unavailable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2) We hypothesized that the biological processes revealed through gene set enrichment would be similar regardless of the nature of the data input (that is, genetic versus epigenetic variation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the SNP-based analysis of ICA2 revealed a robust association between variants of genes involved in the regulation of the immune system and EM in independent cohorts of young and elderly healthy adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the association between ICA2, which reflects epigenetic variation, and EM performance is, at least partially, genetically driven.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we adopted an ICA approach to achieve a tractable and biologically meaningful representation of genome-wide methylation profiles that are amenable to association testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end we searched for methylomic profiles that arise from putatively independent biological processes, each reflected by a restricted number of CpG sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By decomposing genome-wide DNAm profiles we identified an epigenetic mark of immune system genes linked to cortical thickness and to human memory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The well-known effect of age on cortical thinning is partially mediated by this epigenetic mark, and its genetic underpinnings also point to genes involved in immune system regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the decomposition of blood methylome-wide patterns bears considerable potential for the study of brain-related physiological traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, peripheral markers of systemic inflammation are associated with reduced grey matter volume, both in midlife adults50 and in the elderly56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, such grey matter reduction seems to mediate the negative effects of peripheral inflammation on age-related cognitive decline50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will be interesting to investigate whether the peripheral DNAm profiles identified herein might be used to differentiate between physiological and pathological age-related cognitive decline and cortical thinning.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

reference populations (see Methylomic profiling).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subjects were also checked for inconsistency between reported and genetically inferred sex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual call rate averaged to 98.3%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the purpose of scoring analyses, subjects from the Basel imaging, Basel cognitive, Zurich and AgeCode samples were additionally excluded based on the following criteria: genome-wide call rate less_than 95%; IBD sharing defined by PI_HAT greater than 0.2 (one-sample of each detected pair was excluded); Bayesian Clustering65 outlier detection on genome-wide call rate and heterozygosity rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This yielded a total of N=1,445 individuals entering the genetic scoring analysis for Basel cognitive sample, N=534 for Basel imaging sample, N=624 for Zurich sample and N=743 for AgeCode sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Validation of the link between methylation and genotype data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A per-subject crosscheck between phenotypic data, methylation data and genetic data was performed using the reported sex and sex-predictions based on the array data, as well as matching of all SNPs represented on the Illumina 450 K array to the corresponding Affymetrix SNP 6.0 genotype calls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This crosscheck allowed an unambiguous assignment of each methylation data set to the corresponding genetic and phenotypic data set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Gene set enrichment analysis of ICA2 pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GSEA was performed using the MAGENTA44 software which derives gene-centric association statistics from single-SNP association P values, while controlling for potential confounders (gene size, number of SNPs, number of independent SNPs, number of recombination hotspots, linkage disequilibrium and genetic distance).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome-wide single-SNP association analysis was conducted on ICA2 pattern adjusted for chronological age (at blood sampling), using an additive model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 773,330 autosomal SNPs that passed individual SNP quality control in the methylomic profiling sample (exclusion criteria MAF less_than 0.01; HWE P value0.0001; call-rate less_than 0.90) entered the analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In order to capture signals from potentially regulatory variants, MAGENTA-derived gene scores were based on SNPs lying within 20 kb upstream and downstream of the extreme transcript boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GSEA algorithm includes a built-in procedure controlling for physical proximity of SNPs within a given gene set (automatic exclusion of the gene exhibiting a lower association signal in case of one SNP mapped to multiple genes within a gene set).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene set enrichment statistic was based on the 75th percentile cut-off of the observed genome-wide gene-score distribution, which has been proposed to show optimal power for weak genetic effects as expected for complex polygenetic traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Empirical P values were adjusted for multiple testing using FDR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene sets were extracted from the MSigDB v3.1 database (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb), including gene sets from different online databases (KEGG, Gene Ontology GO, BioCarta and Reactome).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a gene set size ranging between 20 and 200 genes to avoid both overly narrow and broad gene set categories, resulting in 1,411 gene sets to be analysed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes from the extended major histocompatibility complex region were excluded from the analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Genetic scoring association analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scores comprised SNPs associated with ICA2 pattern (P less_than 0.05) mapping to an equal number of genes (that is, one most significant SNP per gene).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic scores were computed using the PLINK70 score profile procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scores were weighted by the direction of effect of association (+1 or 1) of each minor allele with ICA2 pattern inferred from the methylomic profiling sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic score calculations were restricted to SNPs meeting the inclusion criteria: MAF0.01; HWE P greater than 0.0001; call-rate90% within a sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resulting genetic profiles were adjusted by regressing out the effect of the number of missing SNPs per-subject included in the scoring procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Associations between the inferred scores and behavioural or imaging phenotypes were assessed using Pearsons correlation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the negative correlation observed between ICA2 methylomic pattern and EM performance in the methylomic sample, genetic score correlation tests with EM performance were one-sided (lower tail).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Description of additional analyses of ICA methylomic patterns can be found in Supplementary Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding authors on
