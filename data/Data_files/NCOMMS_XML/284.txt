Observation of magnon-mediated current drag in Pt/yttrium iron garnet/Pt(Ta) trilayers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Pure spin current, a flow of spin angular momentum without flow of any accompanying net charge, is generated in two common ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One makes use of the spin Hall effect in normal metals (NM) with strong spinorbit coupling, such as Pt or Ta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other utilizes the collective motion of magnetic moments or spin waves with the quasi-particle excitations called magnons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A popular material for the latter is yttrium iron garnet, a magnetic insulator (MI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate in NM/MI/NM trilayers that these two types of spin currents are interconvertible across the interfaces, predicated as the magnon-mediated current drag phenomenon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transmitted signal scales linearly with the driving current without a threshold and follows the power-law Tn with n ranging from 1.5 to 2.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that the NM/MI/NM trilayer structure can serve as a scalable pure spin current valve device which is an essential ingredient in spintronics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'There has been intense research interest in pure spin current transport in both conducting and insulating materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether by spin pumping1,2,3,4, spin Seebeck effect (SSE)5,6,7,8 or spin Hall and inverse spin Hall effects9,10,11,12,13,14,15, pure spin current generation and detection are typically accomplished in bilayers consisting of a magnetic and a non-magnetic layer2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Either generation or detection, rarely both, is done by electrical means.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kajiwara et al.16 first demonstrated a lateral all-electrical device in which an electrical signal can transmit through yttrium iron garnet (YIG) over a macroscopic distance (1 mm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The response (1 nV) is highly nonlinear with a threshold in driving current, which was interpreted as the critical value for the spin transfer torque17,18 induced coherent precession of YIG magnetization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect also suggests that spin currents of two different types, that is, electronic9,10,11,12,13,14,15 and magnonic19,20,21,22, are inter-convertible at the interfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the phenomenon has not been reproduced in a similar planar geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Zhang et al.23,24 predicted a phenomenon with a different origin in sandwich structures, analogous to the conventional spin-valve device for spin-polarized charge currents25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather than exciting a coherent precession of magnetization, at one interface, electrons in the NM create/annihilate magnons in the MI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The individual magnon creation/annihilation does not need to overcome any threshold; therefore, the interconversion takes place at any current.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the long magnon decay length in MI27, this effect couples two remote electrical currents, which is called the magnon-mediated current drag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the on and off states are controlled by the relative orientation between the polarization of the spin current and MI magnetization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In small lateral devices similar to that of Kajiwara, Cornelissen et al.28 reported both - and 2 nonlocal current responses in the a.c. measurements ( is the frequency of a.c. current).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The -response indicates a linear nonlocal current relation, which apparently does not share the same origin as that of the effect reported by Kajiwara.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonlocal magnetoresistance was also reported in similar device geometry29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is unclear whether the reported effect indeed arises from the microscopic mechanism predicted by Zhang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An objective of this work is to experimentally establish the current drag effect in the sandwich geometry proposed by Zhang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this work, we first successfully fabricate Pt/YIG/Pt(Ta) trilayer structures using pulsed laser deposition in combination with sputtering and post-growth annealing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below 220 K, the trilayers are sufficiently insulating and we observe nonlocal responses when an in-plane magnetic field is swept or rotated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the polarity of the nonlocal signal is opposite to each other between Pt/YIG/Pt and Pt/YIG/Ta, indicating the spin current origin of the effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By investigating the effect at low temperatures, we show that the power-law dependence of the nonlocal signal is consistent with the prediction for the magnon-mediated current drag effect.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Nonlocal device structure', 'Our NM/MI/NM trilayer device structure is schematically shown in Fig 1a,b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MI is a thin YIG film sandwiched by either two identical NM films or dissimilar NM films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Via the spin Hall effect, a charge current (Jinjected) generates a pure spin current flowing in the z-direction with the spin polarization () parallel to the y-direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conduction electrons in the bottom NM interact with the localized moments of the MI via the s-d exchange interaction at the interface, resulting in the creation or annihilation of magnons in the MI accompanied by spin-flips of conduction electrons in the bottom NM layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the nature of the s-d exchange interaction24,30, that is, , where Jsd is exchange coupling strength, when the magnetization of the MI (M) is collinear with , magnons are created or annihilated depending on whether M is parallel or anti-parallel to .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, the interaction creates a non-equilibrium magnon population and spin accumulation in the MI which drives magnon diffusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The excess/deficient magnons are then converted to a spin current in the top NM layer by the reverse process, which is converted to a charge current (Jinduced) again in the top NM layer via the inverse spin Hall effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When  M, there is no non-equilibrium magnon population or spin accumulation and the spin current is absorbed by the MI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, there is no induced spin or charge current in the top NM layer (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, one can switch on and off the magnon creation/annihilation process by controlling the relative orientation between M and .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conceptually, this structure functions as a valve for pure spin current.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Schematic illustration of spin current valve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The transmission of spin current is switched on.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Magnetization (M) of magnetic insulator (MI) oriented collinearly with the spin polarization  (//y) of the pure spin current in the bottom normal metal (NM) layer generated by the spin Hall effect with an electric current Jinjected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spin-flip scattering of conduction electrons at the bottom NM/MI interface can create (M || ) or annihilate (M || ) magnons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A non-equilibrium magnon population extends to the top MI/NM interface, and the spin angular momentum carried by magnons is transferred to conduction electrons in the top NM layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pure spin current flowing perpendicular to the NM layer is then converted to a charge current (Jinduced) via the inverse spin Hall effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) The transmission of spin current is switched off.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M is perpendicular to the spin polarization  of the spin current.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this geometry, the sd exchange interaction between conduction electrons and local magnetic moments does not excite magnons in the MI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, there is no spin accumulation at the top MI/NM interface or induced charge current in the top NM layer.Full size image', 'Field-dependent nonlocal response in trilayer devices', 'Since both Pt and Ta have strong spinorbit coupling with opposite signs in their spin Hall angle15,31,32, we have fabricated three Pt (5 nm)/YIG (80 nm)/Pt (5 nm) devices and two Pt (5 nm)/YIG (80 nm)/Ta (5 nm) reference samples, which were deposited on (110)-oriented Gd3Ga5O12 (GGG) substrates (see Methods section for fabrication details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inset of Fig 2c shows an optic image for a GGG/Pt/YIG/Pt device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As illustrated in Fig 2b, the bottom Pt layer is used to inject current Ib, while the top layer, either Pt or Ta, functions as a detector to measure the induced current or the nonlocal voltage Vnl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An in-plane H is either swept in a fixed direction or rotated with a continuously varying angle of  measured from the y-direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the high-quality YIG/Pt interface is essential to the observation of the spin current transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2a, the morphology of a YIG film tracks the atomically flat terraces of the GGG (110) surface33 in spite of a layer of Pt in between.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The excellent interface quality is verified by both the SSE5 (see Supplementary Note 5 and Supplementary Fig 6) and the spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR)34,35 (see Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Fig 3) in the same devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 80-nm-thick YIG films are nearly insulating but have small leakage at high temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the resistance between the top and bottom NM layers increases exponentially as the temperature (T) decreases (see Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Fig 2), and exceeds 20 G at and below 220 K. Therefore, all the nonlocal measurements were performed below 220 K to avoid any parasitic signal from the small leakage current.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Vnl, we remove a non-zero background signal that exists even at Ib=0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Msesaurement geometry and field-dependent nonlocal signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Atomic force microscopy image of 80 nm YIG film grown on 5 nm Pt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Schematic illustration of the experimental set-up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ib is the current applied to the bottom Pt layer, and Vnl is the nonlocal voltage measured at the top layer along the Ib direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The applied in-plane magnetic field H makes an angle  with the y-axis which is in plane and perpendicular to the current direction (x).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) The field dependence of the nonlocal signal for H along Ib, that is, =90°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inset shows the optical image of GGG/Pt/YIG/Pt device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) The field-dependent nonlocal signal with H perpendicular to Ib, that is, =0°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both c and d, solid (empty) blue squares and empty red circles represent Vnl for +1.5 mA (1.5 mA) and 0.0 mA bottom current, respectively.Full size image', 'Figure 2c,d plot the field dependence of Vnl at 220 K. When H is swept along Ib, that is, =90° (Fig 2c), Vnl is a constant at Ib=0 (red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at Ib=+1.5 mA, Vnl shows a clear hysteresis with two positive peaks tracking the coercive fields of the YIG film, indicating that Vnl is closely related to the magnetization state of YIG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the Ib is reversed, Vnl also reverses the sign.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In principle, a sign reversal can occur if there is a finite leakage current flowing in the top layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through the magnetoresistance, this current can produce a hysteretic voltage signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Estimating from the leakage current, we find that the relative change in Vnl due to this effect is at least three orders of magnitude smaller than the observed nonlocal voltage signal (see Supplementary Note 4 and Supplementary Figs 4 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we exclude the leakage current as the source of the nonlocal signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that Vnl (±1.5 mA) is the same as Vnl (0 mA) at the saturation state (H greater than 200 Oe) when  M, suggesting that magnon creation/annihilation is totally suppressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the field sweeps with =0° (Fig 2d),  is collinear with M at high fields, interface magnon creation/annihilation results in a full current drag signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, Vnl (+1.5 mA) is different from Vnl (0 mA) at the saturation fields and reverses the sign when Ib reverses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is interesting to note that Vnl (±1.5 mA) differ from Vnl (0 mA) at the coercive fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One would expect them to be the same since the average magnetization should point to the x-direction at the coercive fields, which would correspond to the saturation states for =90° in Fig 2c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discrepancy can be explained by the multi-domain state of YIG in which the actual M is distributed over a range of angles around =90°, and the collinear component of M turns on the magnon channel and yields a nonzero Vnl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the phenomenon in the single-domain state, we perform the following experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Angle-dependent nonlocal response of single-domain YIG', 'Figure 3a presents Vnl in GGG/Pt/YIG/Pt as a function of  between M and  at 220 K, as illustrated in Fig 2b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 80 nm (110)-oriented YIG grown on Pt has a well-defined uniaxial anisotropy with an anisotropy field  less_than 200 Oe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The applied magnetic field (1,000 Oe) is sufficiently strong not only to set YIG into a single-domain state, but also to rotate M with it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all positive Ib (solid symbols), Vnl exhibits maxima at =0° and 180° (M collinear with ), but minima at =90° and 270° (M ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vnl changes the sign as Ib is reversed (empty symbols).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At =90° and 270°, the nonlocal signal for ±Ib coincides with Vnl (0 mA), further validating that the spin current is in the off state when M .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar angular dependent measurements are also taken on a GGG/Pt/YIG/Ta device and the results are depicted in Fig 3d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the same measurement geometry and the same polarity of Ib, we find that Vnl of GGG/Pt/YIG/Ta has the opposite sign to that of GGG/Pt/YIG/Pt, which is just expected from the opposite signs in their spin Hall angle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Vnl sign difference here is another piece of critical evidence for the magnon-mediated mechanism, as opposed to other extrinsic ones such as leakage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Angular and

independent of the current polarity but increases with the increasing magnitude of Ib.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We attribute this phenomenon to the SSE contribution since the joule heating in the bottom Pt layer unavoidably generates a small vertical temperature gradient, which in turn launches an upward spin current in YIG entering the top Pt (or Ta) layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As M reverses, so does the spin polarization, which consequently produces two different SSE signal levels between =0° and 180°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining these two effects, we can fit the angular dependence data using:', '', 'where V0 is an offset voltage insensitive to the magnetization orientation, VSSE is the SSE voltage amplitude and VDrag represents the amplitude of the current drag signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solid

Two conclusions can be evidently drawn from these results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the magnitude of the current drag signal (red circles) scales linearly with the driving current, that is, VDragIb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in stark contrast with the highly nonlinear behaviour16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the weak current dependence of the SSE contribution follows  (as shown in Fig 3c,f), which is characteristic of thermoelectric effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with usual bilayers, trilayer structures may have an enhanced SSE contribution due to the presence of the second heavy metal layer that draws an extra heat-driven spin current.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carefully designed experiments are needed to separate this effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Temperature dependence of nonlocal responses', 'According to Zhang, et al.24, the temperature dependence of the injection interface spin convertance Gem is , where Tc is the Curie temperature of the MI; for the detection interface, the spin convertance Gme is proportional to , where TF is the Fermi temperature of the NM layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the most simplified picture which is strictly applicable only for very thick films, the current drag signal should be proportional to the product of the two spin current convertances, that is, VDragGem·GmeT5/2 The representative angular dependence measurements below 220 K are shown in

drag signal decreases progressively with decreasing temperature for both the devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By fitting Vnl using equation (1), we extract the magnitude of VDrag and VSSE shown in Fig 4b,d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apart from the expected sign difference, the magnitude of VDrag in both the devices monotonically decreases with decreasing temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, both data sets can be well fitted by a power-law  (red solid curves in Fig 4b,d), where  is a pre-factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extracted exponent n is 2.21 for GGG/Pt/YIG/Pt and 1.88 for GGG/Pt/YIG/Ta, falling in the range between 1.5 and 2.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be pointed out that the full picture described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24 actually contains other quantities that have weak temperature dependence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deviation of the exponent from 2.5 is fully expected if these factors are considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the VSSE is found to be relatively insensitive to
