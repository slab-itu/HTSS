The fungal-specific -glucan-binding lectin FGB1 alters cell-wall composition and suppresses glucan-triggered immunity in plants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'-glucans are well-known modulators of the immune system in mammals but little is known about -glucan triggered immunity in planta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show by isothermal titration calorimetry, circular dichroism spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy that the FGB1 gene from the root endophyte Piriformospora indica encodes for a secreted fungal-specific -glucan-binding lectin with dual function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This lectin has the potential to both alter fungal cell wall composition and properties, and to efficiently suppress -glucan-triggered immunity in different plant hosts, such as Arabidopsis, barley and Nicotiana benthamiana.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results hint at the existence of fungal effectors that deregulate innate sensing of -glucan in plants.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The ability to distinguish self from non-self is a fundamental aspect of any immune system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plants rely on the innate ability of each cell to recognize invaders and are capable of perceiving and responding to pathogenic or beneficial microbes via a multilayered, highly specific and effective immune system comprising surveillance of non-self, damaged-self and altered-self as danger signals1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To protect and defend against microbial invaders, but also to start the symbiotic program, plants need to detect the presence of microbes by means of pattern recognition receptors that respond to specific microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs)2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MAMPs are usually slowly evolving components of microbes with crucial biological functions that are not present in the host4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During plant colonization, the first microbial-derived structure that makes physical contact with the host cell is the cell wall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In pathogenic as well as in beneficial fungi an important structural building block of the cell wall is chitin, a well-known elicitor of immune responses in plants5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the past 10 years, several plant receptors for chitin have been identified and characterized as have different microbial strategies to evade chitin recognition, including modification of the cell wall carbohydrate composition and secretion of effectors6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In spite of its strong elicitor activity, chitin represents only a small percentage of the fungal cell wall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By far the most abundant cell wall polysaccharide in the majority of fungi is -glucan, a well characterized elicitor in fungus-animal systems9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most -glucans originating from the fungal cell wall are made of glucosyl units joined by -1,3-linkages often branched via -1,6-linked glucose residues10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas -1,3-glucan is found also in the cell wall of plants, -1,6-glucan is a cell wall constituent specific to fungi and to members of the Stramenopiles, thereby representing a potential MAMP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite its abundance, studies focusing on the possible role of -glucan as a MAMP are rare and the mechanisms of -glucan perception and signalling in plants are largely unknown10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most plant hosts secrete a large plethora of different hydrolytic enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include chitinases and glucanases that target fungal cell wall constituents to impact cell wall integrity and to release MAMPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct mechanisms to evade -glucan recognition by plant-associated fungi have not yet been reported but considering the widespread presence of -glucan at the fungal cell wall, it is conceivable that plant-associated fungi have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to protect their glucan fibrils from hydrolysis and detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The root endophyte Piriformospora indica (Basidiomycota, Sebacinales) is a fungal symbiont that colonizes inter- and intracellularly the root epidermal and cortex cells of a broad range of unrelated plants, including the monocotyledonous cereal crop Hordeum vulgare (barley) and the dicotyledonous plant Arabidopsis thaliana, with a biphasic lifestyle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial biotrophic phase is followed by a stage where the fungus is more often found in dead or dying host cells secreting a large variety of hydrolytic enzymes that degrade plant cell walls and proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is especially evident in barley where the symbiont rapidly undergoes a nutritional switch to saprotrophy that correlates with nitrogen limitation and is associated with the production of thinner hyphae in dead root cells11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report on the identification and functional characterization of FGB1 (Fungal Glucan-Binding 1, PIIN_03211), a small fungal-specific protein from the root endophyte P. indica induced during colonization of barley and Arabidopsis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By cytological and biochemical approaches, we show that FGB1 is a secreted lectin that binds -glucan, alters fungal cell wall composition and suppresses glucan triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in different plants, effecting fungal colonization.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'FGB1 is a fungal-specific lectin', 'In order to identify possible compatibility factors in the interaction of P. indica with different hosts, we recently performed global characterization of fungal transcriptional responses to barley and Arabidopsis at different developmental stages11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of induced genes encoding small secreted proteins (SSPs;  less_than 300 amino acids), which are possibly enriched in effectors13, were either barley or Arabidopsis responsive, suggesting that colonization of different hosts might require exploitation of host dependently induced effectors that interact with elements characteristic to each host11,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A small set of P. indica genes encoding SSPs, however, was expressed in both hosts at comparable symbiotic stages and hence may be enriched for general determinants of compatibility that target conserved recognition and signalling pathways in different hosts11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One of these putative P. indica core effectors is FGB1, a 104-amino-acid residue long protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amino acid sequence of FGB1 is similar to that of other uncharacterized proteins predicted from the genome sequences of fungi (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No homologous sequences have been found outside the fungal kingdom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple alignment among these proteins shows that several cysteine residues are invariant, suggesting that these proteins may be capable of forming intramolecular disulfide bonds (Fig 1a, Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we found a homologue (E-value 2e-07) of P. indica FGB1 in the genome of the root pathogen Fusarium oxysporum (Ascomycota, Hypocreales).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gene named Pep2 was listed as an effector candidate because it is present in cotton wilt pathogenic strains of F. oxysporum f.sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  vasinfectum and absent in the non-pathogenic cotton field soil isolates, but was never functionally characterized15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Real-time PCR analyses of P. indica colonized roots of barley and A. thaliana on ½ MS confirmed that FGB1 is transcriptionally induced during colonization of both hosts compared with controls (½ MS without host plants) (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FGB1 is not exclusively expressed in planta, but it represents the most abundant secreted protein in culture filtrate of P. indica grown in liquid complete medium (CM), whereas its production is suppressed in liquid yeast nitrogen base (YNB) medium (Supplementary Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high abundance of FGB1 in CM culture filtrate allowed us to establish a purification strategy for the native FGB1 (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Liquid chromatographymass spectrometry (MS)/MS analysis of the P. indica secreted cationic protein fraction at pH 7 (Supplementary Fig 2a) and molecular weight determination (Supplementary Fig 2b) showed that the native FGB1 is a non-glycosylated SSP of 6,219 Da stabilized by four disulfide bridges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Localization studies using P. indica strains expressing a FGB1:green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter fusion construct under the control of the native promoter showed that FGB1 is present at the cell wall and septa of P. indica in colonized Arabidopsis (accessions Columbia, Col-0 and Wassilewskija, Ws-0) and barley (cultivar Golden Promise) roots and during axenic growth in liquid CM but not in YNB medium (Fig 1c, Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus examined the affinity of this SSP to fungal and plant cell wall polymers using pull-down assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The native FGB1 showed specific binding to fungal cell walls but not to barley cell wall components as it co-precipitated only with insoluble protein-free cell wall preparations of P. indica and F. oxysporum (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: The small secreted P. indica protein FGB1 binds to fungal cell walls and harbours a fungal-specific lectin domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Protein sequence logo of FGB1 (PIIN_03211) obtained after alignment of the mature protein sequence with homologous sequences from different fungi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) P. indica FGB1 transcript levels in barley (Hordeum vulgare) and Arabidopsis Col-0 roots grown on ½ MS medium inoculated with spores and harvested 3, 7 and 14 dpi and on control ½ MS medium (7 dpi) relative to transcription elongation factor (TEF, PIIN_03008).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars are s.d.s calculated from three biological replicate samples (eight technical replicates each).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) FGB1:GFP localizes to the fungal septa (arrowheads) and cell wall in colonized A. thaliana Col-0 (7 dpi) and Ws-0 roots (6 dpi), as well as barley roots (7 dpi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The asterisks show the entry point of the hyphae into the root cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chitin dye Alexa Fluor 594 labelled wheat germ agglutinin is shown in red (see Supplementary Figs 1 and 3 for further details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars, 10 m.

buffer (pH 5.0) containing 500 mM NaCl.Full size image', 'FGB1 specifically binds -1,6-linked glucose residues', 'To examine the specificity of FGB1 to different ligands, isothermal titration calorimetric (ITC) experiments were performed using soluble oligosaccharides and polymers present in fungal cell walls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results showed that FGB1 binds with high affinity to laminarin (Sigma), a -1,3-linked glucose polymer containing -1,6-glycosidic side branches derived from brown algae (Stramenopiles) (Fig 2a, Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, FGB1 was able to bind the chemically synthesized gentiobiose, a disaccharide composed of two units of D-glucose joined with a -1,6 linkage but not -1,3-laminarihexaose (Megazyme), -glucan (chemically synthesized) and chitin oligosaccharides (Megazyme) (Fig 2a, Supplementary Fig 4a,b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ITC measurements showed that FGB1 strongly interacts with laminarin in a dual-binding event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A first binding transition appeared at a protein:ligand ratio of 1:1 with a corresponding binding constant of 80 nM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second transition occurred at a molecular ratio of 1:7 yielding a Kd value of about 800 nM (Fig 2a, Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Circular dichroism measurements revealed that binding to laminarin induces a conformational change in FGB1 that increases the proportion of -helical structure (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding to gentiobiose also induced a structural alteration, but this was less pronounced, suggesting that -1,3-linkages may also contribute to the efficient binding of FGB1 to laminarin (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, circular dichroism measurements of recombinant (His)6FGB119104 produced in E. coli revealed that correct disulfide bridge formation is crucial for the proper function of this protein (Supplementary Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we concluded that FGB1 is a novel type of disulfide-bridge-containing lectin that specifically binds -glucan via -1,6-linked glucose moieties in a context of a -1,3 glucan backbone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The questions arose whether and to what extent binding of FGB1 to -glucan at the fungal cell wall may alter wall stress responses and/or composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to answer these questions, we attempted to express FGB1:GFP under the control of the constitutive PiGPD promoter in P. indica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No strains constitutively expressing significant amounts of FGB1:GFP were retrieved (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the functionality of this construct we expressed it in the smut pathogenic fungus Ustilago maydis (Basidiomycota, Ustilaginales) that lacks a FGB1 homologue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of the PromPiGPDFGB1:GFP fusion in U. maydis led to the accumulation of specific GFP signals at the cell wall indicating that the construct was functional (Supplementary Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations support findings from other fungal systems showing that overexpression of endogenous genes driven by strong constitutive promoters may lead to silencing of both, the extra gene copy and the endogenous gene16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: FGB1 specifically binds to -glucan and to the disaccharide gentiobiose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) ITC profiles showing titrations of laminarihexaose

equivalent and independent sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming a molecular mass of laminarin of 5 kDa the following parameters were obtained: N1=6.8±1.09, K1=2.14 × 106±1.97 × 107 M1, H1=508±128 cal mol1,

corrected with the spectra obtained for the individual ligands (see Supplementary Fig 4 for further details).Full size image', 'FGB1 alters fungal cell wall proprieties and composition', 'To test for altered cell wall susceptibility, U. maydis strains expressing FGB1:GFP and control strains expressing GFP were cultured in the presence of Calcofluor white (CFW), Congo red (CR) or H2O2, three chemicals that are commonly used to identify cell wall mutants in fungi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CFW and CR are reported to interact in vitro with various -linked glucans and in vivo with nascent chitin chains thereby inhibiting cell wall assembly17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas CFW preferentially interacts with chitin17, CR is speculated to additionally interfere with -glucan synthesis18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of FGB1 in U. maydis did not alter the speed of growth in CM or the morphology of fungal colonies but increased resistance to H2O2 and in particular to CR but not to CFW (Fig 3a, Supplementary Fig 6b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test if the FGB1 overexpression phenotype in U. maydis could be reproduced in P. indica, we assessed the growth of the PromPiFGB1FGB1:GFP P. indica strains on CM plates or CM plates containing CR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On CM plates the PromPiFGB1FGB1:GFP P. indica strains and the control strains carrying a gene for resistance to geneticin displayed a slower growth compared with the WT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is maybe due to the fact that the FGB1:GFP and the control strains obtained from protoplast-mediated transformation were homokaryotic whereas the WT strain is dikaryotic (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our hands, the protoplast-mediated transformation led to regeneration of P. indica homokaryotic strains in 40 to 85% of all cases (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of the correct homokaryotic strain as control instead of the WT is, therefore, crucial for phenotypic analyses of P. indica transformants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of CR, the homokaryotic PromPiFGB1FGB1:GFP strains had a considerably faster growth than the WT and the homokaryotic control strain (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that expression of FGB1 leads to altered cell wall properties in P. indica and U. maydis with an increased resistance to CR and further substantiate the involvement of this lectin in -glucan

control GFP U. maydis strain (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second copy of FGB1 under the control of its own promoter in P. indica grown in CM where FGB1 production is induced, also led to an altered glucose to N-acetylglucosamine ratio compared with the homokaryotic P. indica control strain (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that expression of FGB1 leads to changes in levels of -glucans and/or chitin in the fungal cell wall (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with an altered cell wall composition, PromPiGPDFGB1:GFP U. maydis strains were significantly more sensitive to protoplastation by chitinases than the GFP controls (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, FGB1 affect cell wall composition and susceptibility to cell wall stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This, however, does not explain why a large proportion of FGB1 is secreted into the culture filtrate (Supplementary Figs 1c and 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'FGB1 suppresses -glucan triggered ROS production in plants', 'Two distinct chitin-binding lectins from Cladosporium fulvum (Ascomycota, Capnodiales), a pathogen of tomato, were shown to be involved in fungal cell wall protection against hydrolysis by plant chitinases in the case of Avr4, or to prevent chitin-triggered immunity in planta in the case of the abundantly secreted LysM-effector Ecp6 (refs 5, 7, 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plants secrete glucanases into the apoplast upon fungal attack, causing the release of glucan oligosaccharides that like chitin may act as MAMPs, such as the -1,6-1,3-heptaglucan derived from the plant pathogen Phytophthora sojae (Stramenopiles, Oomycetes, Peronosporales)19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we analysed the plant proteins present in the apoplastic fluid (APF) of barley roots obtained at 5, 10 and 14 days post inoculation (dpi) with P. indica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No barley endo-1,3--glucosidases were detected at 5 dpi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the most prevalent plant proteins present at 10 and 14 dpi we could detect two and four barley endo-1,3--glucosidases, respectively (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This correlates with the expression pattern of FGB1 during root colonization (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, it was shown that -glucan is required for cell wall rigidity in appressoria and fast-growing necrotrophic hyphae of Colletotrichum graminicola in maize but its synthesis is rigorously downregulated during biotrophic development possibly representing a strategy for evading -glucantriggered immunity21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether FGB1 is able to protect -glucan from glucanase activity in vitro, we incubated an endo- and an exo--1,3-D-glucanase, from barley (Sigma) and Trichoderma virens (Sigma) respectively, with laminarin in the presence and absence of native FGB1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant protection of the glucan polymer from glucanase activities was observed upon addition of FGB1 (Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus speculated that the large secreted portion of free FGB1 might be involved in mediating symbiosis through perturbation of glucan-triggered host immunity in different hosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of plants to respond to -glucan elicitors is not universal and different plants recognize different glucan polymers10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To clarify whether -glucan acts as an elicitor in barley and Arabidopsis, we used a luminol assay to measure the production of ROS upon incubation of plant tissues with laminarin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Barley root and leaf tissues and Arabidopsis leaves of the accession Ws-0, the latter previously identified as being insensitive to the bacterial MAMP flg22 because of a premature stop codon in the FLS2 kinase domain22, responded to laminarin with production of ROS (Fig 4, Supplementary Fig 10a,b,c,d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The laminarin-triggered ROS production is slightly delayed compared with that observed after chitin elicitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is most evident in barley (Supplementary Fig 10e) and could be caused by the inability of the polymer laminarin to diffuse quickly in plant tissues or the need of hydrolysis by glucanases in the adequate elicitor before detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: FGB1 supresses -glucan-induced oxidative burst in barley and A. thaliana Ws-0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Barley leaf disks react with a strong ROS burst after

dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the host-translocated effector-protein Avr3a from Phytophthora infestans23, which like FGB1 is a SSP but does not act in the apoplast, and the recombinant (His)6FGB119104, which displays a different conformational change upon binding to laminarin (Supplementary Fig 4d) did not affect the laminarin-induced ROS production (Supplementary Fig 10a,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of P. indica in the roots of barley leads to suppression of the laminarin-triggered ROS production at 3, 5 and 9 dpi demonstrating the general ability of P. indica to suppress immunity (Supplementary Fig 10f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm the capacity of FGB1 to suppress -glucan-mediated oxidative burst in different hosts, luminol-based ROS assays in Nicotiana benthamiana using flg22 or laminarin in presence and the absence of FGB1 were performed in an independent laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FGB1 specifically suppressed the laminarin induced ROS production also in this plant system, but did not affect the response to flg22 (Supplementary Fig 10h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high efficiency of the laminarin-mediated oxidative burst suppression by FGB1, however, suggests that the perturbation by this novel glucan-binding lectin is possibly not established through glucan sequestration but conceivably through interference with component of the host immunity (Fig 5), as proposed for the chitin-binding LysM-effector Ecp6 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identification of the -glucan receptor will aid in elucidating the molecular mechanisms behind the proposed function of FGB1 as suppressor of glucan-mediated immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Model displaying the potential dual function of

able to suppress -glucan induced ROS production at substoichiometric concentrations, we hypothize that FGB1/-glucan complexes have higher affinities to the plant -glucan receptors than free -glucan

'To date, only few historical studies have focused on the role of fungal-derived glycan MAMPs other than chitin, highlighting the gap that exists and needs to be filled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data shows that the plant responsive lectin FGB1 from the root endophyte P. indica is abundantly secreted and possesses a so far uncharacterized protein domain conserved among fungi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated that FGB1 is able to specifically interact with -1,6-linked glucan, has the potential to alter cell wall composition and to confer resistance to the glucan-associated cell wall stressor CR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we showed that FGB1 is able to efficiently suppress laminarin-triggered ROS production in different hosts, thus representing a possible strategy to avoid -glucan triggered immunity in planta and indicating a dual functionality of this protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The striking functional similarities between chitin-binding LysM effectors and the glucan-binding FGB1 lectin indicate convergent mechanisms that safeguard different fungal cell wall-derived polymers from the plant immune system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether these data provide fundamental evidence that -glucan is an important fungal MAMP and that pathogenic, as well as mutualistic fungi need to protect -glucan polymers from recognition in planta.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Here the integrals of the anomeric protons (6.414.45 p.p.m.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  to the remaining signals (3.73.0 p.p.m.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  were 1:6.3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the spectra of glucose, N-acetylglucosamine and Chitin from 022 h we concluded that the observed signals were stable and appropriate to determine the ratio of chitin and beta-glucan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'APF collection from roots colonized by P. indica', 'Barley seeds (H. vulgare L. cv Golden Promise) were surface sterilized for 1 min under light shaking in 70% ethanol followed by 1 h in 12% sodium hypochlorite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, seeds were washed repeatedly for 1 h with sterile distilled water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After germination for 3 days at 22 °C in complete darkness on wet filter paper, germinated seeds were transferred into jars with 1/10 PNM under sterile conditions and inoculated with 3 ml of chlamydospores (concentration 500,000 spores ml1) of P. indica GoGFP strain24 and cultivated in a growth chamber with a day: night cycle of 16 h: 8 h (light intensity, 108 mol m2 s1) and temperature of 22 °C 18 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For APF extraction three time points reflecting different interaction stages have been chosen: Early and late biotrophic phase (5 and 10 dpi), as well as cell death associated phase (14 dpi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After respective growth time, roots were thoroughly washed and cut into pieces of 2 cm length (second to fourth centimetre of the root).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were vacuum infiltrated (Vacuumbrand, CVC 3000, VWR) with deionized water 5 × 15 min at 250 mbar with 1 min atmospheric pressure break.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bundled infiltrated roots were centrifuged in 5 ml syringe barrels at 2,000 r.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  for 15 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pooled APF was stored at 20 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to exclude, cytoplasmic contamination APF was tested in immunoblots with GFP antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For higher peptide mass accuracy APF was deglycosylated with Protein Deglycosylation Mix (P6039S, New England BioLabs, Ipswich, USA) under denaturing conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For peptide mass, identification samples were digested with trypsin and subjected to liquid chromatographyMS/MS mass spectrometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins matched to peptides were analysed for the presence of signal peptides and exclusiveness in the three specific time points of APF extraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'Data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article and its Supplementary Information files and from the corresponding author on reasonable request.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
