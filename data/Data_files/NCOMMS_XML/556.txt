Localized force application reveals mechanically sensitive domains of Piezo1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Piezos are mechanically activated ion channels that function as sensors of touch and pressure in various cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the precise mechanism and structures mediating mechanical activation and subsequent inactivation have not yet been identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use magnetic nanoparticles as localized transducers of mechanical force in combination with pressure-clamp electrophysiology to identify mechanically sensitive domains important for activation and inactivation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Piezos are large (2,500 aa.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  proteins with 1438 transmembrane domains that form mechanically activated ion channels1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They have been implicated in several biological processes involving mechanical sensing such as the sense of touch, proprioception and cardiovascular development5,6,7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recent studies have demonstrated that lateral membrane tension is the physical stimulus that activates Piezo1, suggesting hydrophobic mismatch between the membrane bilayer and transmembrane domains as a possible mechanism of mechanical sensing11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Piezos are unrelated to other known ion channel families, and therefore, the precise mechanism that transduces mechanical force into pore opening (activation) and subsequently leads to pore closing (inactivation) is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The macroscopic organization of Piezo1 has been revealed by cryo-electron microscopy, and a smaller (230 aa.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  extracellular domain of the C. elegans Piezo orthologue was resolved at the atomic level4,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C-terminal region contains the pore domain and is also highlighted by several disease-related single-point mutations that cause a slowing of inactivation kinetics2,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, further detailed links between structural domains and distinct modalities of channel function such as activation and inactivation have remained unresolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Existing thermodynamic models of mechanical gating simplify channel structure to be homogenous and elastic and are thus limited in revealing structural features17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we aimed to advance our understanding of this concept, hypothesizing that specific structures within Piezos are highly sensitive to localized application of force, whereas others are less sensitive in comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further reasoned that mechanical perturbation of such domains may induce changes in channel function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we introduce a method by which localized force is applied through magnetic nanoparticles to distinct domains of Piezo1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify two domains that are mechanically sensitive and affect pressure-dependent channel activation and inactivation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Localized force application by magnetic nanoparticles', 'To probe mechanical sensitivity of Piezo1 ion channels with sub-molecular resolution, we generated a highly localized pulling force to specific domains of Piezo1 by attaching superparamagnetic nanoparticles and exposing the complex to a magnetic field while measuring channel activity electrophysiologically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we engineered constructs of Piezo1-IRES-EGFP that each contained a 13 amino-acid (aa.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  bungarotoxin binding sequence (BBS) within a predicted extracellular domain, further referred to as Piezo1-BBS18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first treated HEK293T cells expressing Piezo1-BBS constructs with biotinylated bungarotoxin, which binds to the BBS with high affinity (Kd15 nM)19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we applied 75 nm diameter streptavidin-coated nanoparticles to the cells, which in turn bind the biotinylated bungarotoxin (Kd0.01 pM), linking the targeted domain to the nanoparticle (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reasoned that due to the comparatively large size, each Piezo1 channel can accommodate at most one single nanoparticle (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Localized force application by nanoparticle labelling and magnetic field generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Piezo1 transmembrane topology with aa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  locations of BBS insertions (red, labelled and functional;

Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, to probe the efficiency of nanoparticle labelling, we labelled unoccupied binding sites of all Piezo1-BBS constructs with a fluorescently conjugated bungarotoxin either directly or after the binding of nanoparticles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed for all constructs that prior nanoparticle labelling reduced fluorescence by 6080% (Fig 1c;

P less_than 0.01, paired t-test) in current amplitude for BBS-2422, no significant changes (Supplementary Fig 6a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether the magnetic field could lead to direct channel activation, we analysed the channel open probability (NPo) during the +5 mm Hg prepulse period in the presence and absence of the magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found NPo less_than 1 % for all constructs for both conditions, indicating that the channel was predominantly closed regardless of the presence of a magnetic field (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Altogether, four extracellular sites within two domains emerged from our screen as significantly mechanically sensitive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BBS-86 and BBS-300 are both tagged proximal to the N terminus, and BBS-2422 and BBS-2425 are tagged precisely on top of a large structurally unique extracellular domain located between the two predicted pore helices that likely forms part of the ion permeation pathway (Fig 2c)4,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the robust effect we observed on localized force application at BBS-2422 and the presence of human single-point mutations found within and surrounding this extracellular domain that cause loss of inactivation, we decided to further focus on construct BBS-2422 to better understand how localized force acts on Piezo1 function mechanistically21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Magnetic force acts directly on channel domains', 'Measuring the magnitude of the applied pulling force might allow for inferences about its effects on protein stability and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To calibrate our setup, we labelled the 75 nm magnetic nanoparticles with Alexa Fluor 594 and measured their velocity through glycerol in the magnetic field of our setup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using Stokes law, we calculated the drag force on 75 nm nanoparticles to be 9.9±0.7 pN, setting the upper limit of the total force applied to a single Piezo1 channel (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By performing this measurement on nanoparticles of 50, 100, and 200 nm diameter, we found that force increases with particle size, which is expected given that the magnetic susceptibility is the same for all bead sizes (Ocean NanoTech).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we measured the applied force for varying current amplitudes through the electromagnetic coil (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplying a current of 1 A reduced the force to 2.6±0.2 pN, which is comparable to the force of ambient thermal energy alone (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this force we were unable to elicit a slowing of inactivation on BBS-2422, supporting the notion that the functional effect we observe is due to a force magnitude that exceeds physiological conditions (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Mechanism of magnetic force on construct BBS-2422.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Measured force on fluorescently labelled magnetic nanoparticles (red, 75 nm diameter;

Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further address the possibility of steric hindrance, we engineered a Piezo1-IRES-EGFP construct with a myc-tag binding sequence at residue 2422 (Piezo1-myc-2422) that we could specifically conjugate with a 10 nm-sized anti-myc antibody (Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pressure sensitivity and inactivation (P50=18.5±2.4 mm Hg, 84.9±2.7%, n=8 cells) of this construct were not affected by labelling it with the anti-myc antibody (P50=19.6±1.7 mm Hg, 90.6±2.5%, n=8 cells; P greater than 0.01, unpaired t-test; Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these results support that it is specifically the magnetic force application that affects Piezo function and not steric hindrance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We next hypothesized that Piezo function may be affected indirectly through pulling force transduced through the membrane bilayer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this we tagged the inwardly rectifying potassium Kir2.1 channel with a BBS (Kir2.1-BBS) on the first extracellular pore loop (S1-pore helix) and co-expressed it with wild-type Piezo1-pIRES-EGFP in HEK293T cells (Fig 3f; Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that wild-type Piezo1 function (P50=24.6±2.7 mm Hg, average maximal current=148±44 pA, inactivation=87.4±2.3%, n=10 cells) was not affected by the force on Kir2.1 channels (P50=19.7±2.0 mm Hg, average maximal current=154±38 pA, inactivation=81.8%±3.3; P greater than 0.01, paired t-test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result, together with the observation that the functional effects we detected were specific to each Piezo1-BBS construct, suggests that the pulling force is acting primarily on the tagged domain and not indirectly though the membrane bilayer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interestingly, the loss of inactivation is irreversible on a minute timescale (Fig 3g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is comparable to previous reports that a permanent loss of inactivation of wild-type Piezo1 can be mechanically induced22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such an effect suggests that magnetic pulling force on BBS-2422 may be accelerating an existing, but mechanistically unclear, tendency towards channel inactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Structural studies showed that the BBS-2422 site is located near or along the ion permeation pathway4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the single-channel conductance g of BBS-2422 (g=32.5±0.7 pS; n=10 cells) remained unchanged by magnetic pulling force (g=31.3±0.3 pS; n=10 cells; P greater than 0.01, paired t-test), therefore suggesting that mechanical perturbation of the extracellular domain containing residue 2,422 is directly affecting the mechanism of inactivation independently of ion permeation (Fig 3h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Magnetic force specifically perturbs mechanical gating', 'We next aimed to test whether the observed functional effects from a magnetic pulling force were specific to a mechanism of mechanical activation or rather a nonspecific conformational change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this, we inserted a BBS into the extracellular loops of the voltage-activated ion channel Kv1.2 (Kv1.2-BBS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this channel is not known to be mechanically activated, a previous study has shown that mechanosensitivity can be conferred by fusing it with the mechanosensitive ankyrin repeat domain of NOMPC, and another study has shown that activation can be modulated when stimulated with pressure, suggesting that this channel may be a strong candidate for modulation by a magnetic pulling force23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, a BBS was inserted into the extracellular loops S1-S2 (Kv1.2-BBS-S1-S2) and S3-S4 (Kv1.2-BBS-S3-S4) of the voltage-sensing domain, which undergoes a well-characterized conformational change on depolarization leading to channel activation, as well as the S5-pore-helix (Kv1.2-BBS-S5-PH) of the pore domain (Fig 4a)25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nanoparticle labelling was specific to constructs Kv1.2-BBS-S1-S2 and Kv1.2-BBS-S3-S4 constructs, but failed to label Kv1.2-BBS-S5-PH (co-transfected with EGFP) (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recorded voltage-activated currents from nanoparticle-labelled Kv1.2-BBS transfected HEK293 cells in a cell-attached configuration, while additionally applying a transient 60 mm Hg pressure stimulus, analogous to our studies on Piezo1, at each voltage-step (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with Piezo1, these recordings were performed first without and then with a magnetic force F=9.9±0.7 pN applied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Specificity of magnetic force on mechanical activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Kv1.2 transmembrane topology with aa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  locations of BBS insertions (red, labelled and functional;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We set out to identify domains with high mechanical sensitivity in Piezo1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current experimental methods do not allow force application on defined sub-molecular structures simultaneous to functional characterization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we apply a force of 10 pN to specific extracellular domains, while measuring channel function electrophysiologically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atomic force microscopy experiments have shown that destructive forces that extract an entire transmembrane domain from the lipid bilayer (100150 pN) or that cause domain unfolding (50200 pN) are much larger, which is consistent with our finding that none of the tested constructs loses its ability to be mechanically activated under magnetic force application26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, the force in our experiments is comparable to the Coulomb force acting on a single voltage sensor domain of a voltage-gated potassium channel under physiological conditions (10 pN; see Methods) or the force acting on a 1 nm long gating spring to open a mechanically activated ion channel (10 pN; see Methods)17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Lower forces were indistinguishable from ambient thermal energy and thus did not affect channel behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher forces could have allowed us to investigate the upper limits of local force application on Piezo1, but the electromagnetic coil in these experiments was already operated near the fusing current.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given this limitation, our measurements of magnetic pulling force on different sized nanoparticles show that the 75 nm diameter size nanoparticles meet a balance by minimizing size while still providing a physically relevant magnitude of force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One related potential caveat in our study arises from the possibility that multiple channels or subunits may be bound to a single nanoparticle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, the force transduced by one nanoparticle would be distributed among these channels, likely rendering the force negligible and therefore resulting in wild-type Piezo1-like behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the fact that each channel is maximally labelled to a single nanoparticle is at the same time advantageous, because each labelled channel is then modulated identically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our unbiased screen reveals four mechanically sensitive sites in two distinct domains of Piezo1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sites 86 and 300, located at the proximal N terminus, mark an intriguing location because it resonates with the theoretical mechanism of a gating spring that provides maximal force sensitivity at the outermost end of a lever structure17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, an effect in this region also supports structural data suggesting that the numerous transmembrane domains are in fact organized as a blade structure possibly involved in mechanosensing4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sites 2,422 and 2,425 are part of the outer pore domain, which raises the possibility that mechanisms of inactivation found in other ion channels, such as pore blocking (N-type inactivation) or collapse of the selectivity filter (C-type inactivation), are also at work in Piezos28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that single-channel conductance stays unchanged in BBS-2422, which likely interacts directly with the pore region, suggests that it is less likely that the pore helices are being pulled apart by the magnetic force as part of an irreversible structural change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, the lack of an effect on single-channel conductance suggests that we are facilitating a natural movement of the channel by specifically targeting mechanosensitive sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible, however, that the domains we have identified are critical for channel function but not necessarily its native mechanosensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore we can currently only conclude that these domains are themselves mechanically sensitive, but not necessarily the mechanosensors of Piezo1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite the N terminus and the outer pore clearly being structurally distinct, it is interesting that these two regions both affect the process of inactivation, though it is still unclear whether this occurs through a common mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A clue for a potential allosteric interaction between these regions may be found in the intracellular beam structures revealed in the cryo-EM model that span the length of each subunit and through which membrane tension acting on the blade structures could be transmitted to the pore4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, we see that pulling either the N- or C-terminal domain away from the membrane induces a stabilization of the open state on activation by pressure, which manifests itself as a loss of channel inactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possible mechanism by which this occurs could involve a lever and hinge mechanism by which the blade domain functions as a stiff lever with its movements allosterically connected to the central pore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, our manipulation with a magnetic pulling force may imitate a native tension-induced movement of Piezo1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Magnetic pulling only affected function of the mechanically activated Piezo1 channel, and not that of the voltage-activated Kv1.2, even under the added mechanical stress of increased membrane tension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along with our observation that the effects of magnetic pulling on Piezo1 are confined to only certain domains, this finding suggests that the sites our screen identified in Piezo1 might specifically contribute to sensing mechanical stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Still, it is likely that targeting other specific sites within Kv1.2 or in entirely different channels could reveal structures not unique to Piezo that can be mechanically perturbed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experiments on Kv1.2 are thus merely a first test for specificity, and future broad application of magnetic pulling could be used to investigate the fundamental principles of mechanical sensitivity in other ion channel proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In light of our findings in Piezo1, it is quite remarkable that we did not observe acute channel activation with the onset of magnetic pulling force, but rather a slowing of activation in BBS-2422.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken with the idea that a slowing of inactivation indicates a stabilization of the channels open conformation, this may indicate that perturbing the domains identified in our screen may affect channel activation and inactivation through mechanistically distinct pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Ultimately, we identify two mechanically sensitive domains, and it is possible that more domains remain to be uncovered with more controlled labelling stoichiometry, probing of intracellular sites, or higher forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding sets a direction for future studies in understanding the mechanism of mechanical activation in Piezo ion channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Working towards a magnetically activated ion channel will be worthwhile beyond understanding Piezo function, as it could provide the means for magnetogeneticsthe remote control of neuronal excitability with a magnetic field.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
