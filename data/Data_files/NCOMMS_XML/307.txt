Groundwatersurface water mixing shifts ecological assembly processes and stimulates organic carbon turnover  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Environmental transitions often result in resource mixtures that overcome limitations to microbial metabolism, resulting in biogeochemical hotspots and moments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Riverine systems, where groundwater mixes with surface water (the hyporheic zone), are spatially complex and temporally dynamic, making development of predictive models challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spatial and temporal variations in hyporheic zone microbial communities are a key, but understudied, component of riverine biogeochemical function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, to investigate the coupling among groundwatersurface water mixing, microbial communities and biogeochemistry, we apply ecological theory, aqueous biogeochemistry, DNA sequencing and ultra-high-resolution organic carbon profiling to field samples collected across times and locations representing a broad range of mixing conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that groundwatersurface water mixing in the hyporheic zone stimulates heterotrophic respiration, alters organic carbon composition, causes ecological processes to shift from stochastic to deterministic and is associated with elevated abundances of microbial taxa that may degrade a broad suite of organic compounds.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Understanding the processes that underlie places and times of elevated biogeochemical activity is needed to construct predictive models of elemental cycling and contaminant fate and transport under future environmental scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without the knowledge of governing processes, predictions are unlikely to be accurate, owing to emergent properties that arise through the behaviour of complex systems1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Environmental transition zones often exhibit elevated rates of biogeochemical activity due to the mixing of complementary electron donors and terminal electron acceptors2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hyporheic zone is a classic transition zone5,6,7 important to the functioning of lotic systems8,9,10,11,12,13,14, where biogeochemical activity can be locally elevated during times of groundwatersurface water mixing15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Shifts in the hyporheic zone microbial communities are a key, but understudied, component of hydrologic mixing-induced increases in biogeochemical reaction rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hyporheic zone microbial ecology has primarily been studied indirectly by characterizing spatiotemporal patterns in electron donors, terminal electron acceptors and microbial biomass or activity4,18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although connections have been made between the community composition and metabolic function of hyporheic zone microbial communities21, there are few studies that directly investigate hyporheic zone microbial composition8,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This represents a significant knowledge gap, especially considering that up to 96% of lotic ecosystem respiration occurs within the hyporheic zone12 and up to 95% of hyporheic zone respiration is microbial23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although few in number, studies that directly evaluate hyporheic zone microbial communities have made important progress, revealing significant influences of sediment porosity21, temporal variation in physicochemical conditions24,25,26, heavy metal contamination27,28,29, groundwatersurface water exchange30 and dissolved organic carbon composition31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Temporal fluctuations in river stage cause variation in the degree of groundwatersurface water mixing32,33, which in turn changes the resource environment experienced by hyporheic zone microbial communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  River stage fluctuations are therefore likely to have an indirect impact on hyporheic zone microbial community composition, mediated through changes in electron donor and/or terminal electron acceptor profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although outside the spatial domain traditionally considered the hyporheic zone, Lin et al.34 provide evidence consistent with this hypothesis, revealing significant changes in community composition associated with the intrusion of surface water into a subsurface aquifer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stegen et al.35 further showed that these changes in composition were due to intrusion-driven shifts in ecological selection pressures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies did not sample surface water or evaluate changes in the resource environment, making it difficult to understand linkages among groundwatersurface water mixing, biogeochemical conditions and community composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Iribar et al.36 also sampled across groundwatersurface water mixing conditions in the hyporheic zone, but did not relate changes in mixing to changes in microbial community composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sliva and Williams37 used a field manipulation to study the connection between groundwatersurface water exchange and microbial composition, but found equivocal patterns due to methodological limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we evaluate the hypothesis that changes in groundwatersurface water mixing drive a coupled response in hyporheic zone biogeochemistry and microbial community composition due to shifting ecological selection pressures tied to the resource environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do so, we take advantage of short-term fluctuations in river stage that cause broad changes in the degree of groundwatersurface water mixingand thus resource environmentwithin the Columbia River hyporheic zone and link the resulting hyporheic zone dynamics to system end members (surface water and groundwater).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although longer-term stage fluctuations are clearly important, we focus on short-term fluctuations to isolate the impacts of shifts in groundwatersurface water mixing; longer-term (for example, seasonal) sampling may confound changes in mixing with changes in other environmental variables (for example, temperature).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analyses also leverage and combine next-generation DNA sequencing, ultra-high-resolution organic carbon profiling and ecological theory to track microbial community dynamics and reveal underlying drivers of change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that groundwatersurface water mixing shifts the coupled microbiome-biogeochemical system from a mixing-driven system characterized by stochastic ecological processes to a system with elevated biogeochemical rates and deterministic ecological processes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Hydrologic mixing and stimulated respiration', 'A sampling scheme was employed adjacent to and within the Columbia River (Fig 1), to capture a range of river-stage conditions across 1 week.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although large, long-term fluctuations in river stage (Fig 2a) are principally driven by snowpack melt and runoff across the Columbia River watershed, short-term fluctuations (Fig 2b) are caused by up-river flow regulation at the Priest Rapids dam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sampling across different river-stage conditions and across different spatial locations (vertically and horizontally distributed; Fig 1) translated into a range of groundwatersurface water mixing conditions in the hyporheic zone as shown by substantial variation in Cl concentration within hyporheic zone samples (Fig 3); Cl concentration was used as a conservative tracer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three non-conservative (that is, reactive) analytes showed remarkable differences between groundwater and surface water, which allowed for evaluations of mixing-model deviations (Fig 3); reactive analytes included non-purgable organic carbon (NPOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and nitrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific conductancean alternative tracer of groundwatersurface water mixing conditions38was logged in river water and groundwater wells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relatively high and stable specific conductance values in groundwater wellscombined with low and stable values in the riverduring the sampling period (Supplementary Fig 1) provide evidence that water sampled from groundwater wells and from the river represented distinct end members.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Sampling locations and infrastructure.Map showing sampling locations in the Hanford 300 Area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also displayed is the top 30 cm of the multi-level sampling device used to sample riverbed piezometers;

NPOC (Fig 3a) and DIC (Fig 3b) concentrations commonly fell outside this space, whereas nitrate (Fig 3c) concentrations did not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positive DIC deviations were, however, only found below a Cl concentration of 7 mg l1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NPOC concentrations appeared to be a single continuous function of Cl concentrations (Fig 3a), which suggests relatively consistent quality of labile carbon entering the hyporheic zone across the week of sampling; a significant decline in quality would have shifted NPOC concentrations to values more consistent with the mixing model expectation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Taken alone, the loss of NPOCrelative to the mixing expectationcould be interpreted as a signal of either enhanced microbial metabolism of organic carbon or sorption onto hyporheic zone sediments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enhanced microbial heterotrophic respiration could increase DIC by increasing the rate of CO2 production, whereby positive deviations would be expected from the DIC mixing model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, assuming that the magnitude of the NPOC deviation indicates the degree to which respiration is enhanced, increasingly negative NPOC deviations would be associated with increasingly positive DIC deviations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is indeed the pattern observed (Fig 3d) and, in turn, our analyses are consistent with the hypothesis that the intrusion of surface water transports labile organic carbon into the hyporheic zone that, in turn, stimulates microbial respiration20,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is important to note that there is a larger DIC increase than expected from the magnitude of NPOC loss (that is, the stoichiometry is not 1:1) (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two factors that may contribute to the excess DIC are calcite dissolution and organic carbon priming; a recent simulation study40 of our field system revealed that intrusion of river water into the hyporheic zone can lead to calcite dissolution and, in turn, elevated DIC; priming41 could occur if dissolved organic carbon transported to the hyporheic zone stimulated decomposition of sediment-bound organic carbon, thereby elevating DIC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work that leverages isotopic signatures of abiotic and biotic sources of DIC should enable evaluation of these hypotheses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results indicate that the transported labile carbon is dissolvedas opposed to particulategiven that particulate organic carbon (POC) was highest in the river and did not vary significantly between the hyporheic zone and groundwater (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These patterns are consistent with previous work showing that POC is retained in surface sediments via filtration, thereby limiting its transport into the hyporheic zone42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did observe greater variation in hyporheic zone POC concentrationrelative to groundwater (Supplementary Fig 2)and the cell density of planktonic organisms was found to increase with hyporheic zone POC (Supplementary Fig 3); however, inclusion of POC from all water sources resulted in this relationship becoming nonsignificant (P greater than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the POC-cell density relationship in the hyporheic zone was relatively weak (R2=0.32), it suggests that there may be times and/or places within the hyporheic zone where microbial growth due to elevated POC penetration resulted in higher biomass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Residence time of carbon-rich water in the hyporheic zone influences metabolic pathways used by hyporheic zone microbial communities44,45; longer residence times can be associated with elevated nitrate reduction45 due to localized depletion of O2 (that is, anaerobic microsites)46,47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we do not have estimates of surface water residence time, it was probably short due to the rapid rise and fall in river elevation across the sampling timeframe (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is supported by previous investigations in the study system showing thatduring river-stage dynamics similar to those sampled herethe direction (and magnitude) of water flux changes on a 12-h time scale due to the 12-h cycle of high/low river stage38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining estimated flux rates from Fritz and Arntzen38maximum influx of river water was 0.4 l m2 min1with porosity of the hyporheic zone alluvium (0.18; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  49) provides an estimated maximum water velocity of 1.5 m per 12 h, with the vast majority of velocities across a 12-h period much slower than this38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The regular reversal of the hydrologic gradientand low river elevation minima during the sampling period (Fig 2)suggests that the residence time of river water in the hyporheic zone was on the order of 1 day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The consistency between hyporheic zone  concentrations and mixing model expectations are therefore not surprising.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that denitrification was not stimulated by surface water intrusion, because modest residence times, high O2 concentrations in intruding surface water and low NPOC concentrations collectively resulted in severe reaction-rate limitation50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, significant O2 can be maintained in the hyporheic zoneand therefore inhibit denitrification2under organic carbon concentrations similar to those observed here, even when residence times are two orders of magnitude longer than estimated here51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further note that these conditions (high O2 and low NPOC) may be more conductive to nitrification than denitrification2,52, which could lead to a positive deviation from the  mixing model, but such a pattern was not apparent (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The significant loss of NPOC during times of surface water intrusion suggests that changes in the organic carbon profile may drive shifts in microbial community composition31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If there is such an effect, it could be mediated by the quantity and/or composition of organic carbon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To distinguish between these possibilities, we complemented the NPOC quantification with ultra-high-resolution carbon profiling, using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Shifts in organic carbon and microbial community composition', 'Considering all water sources together, the composition of organic carbonas characterized by FT-ICR MSvaried significantly (P=0.001) with changes in NPOC concentration (Fig 4a) and this relationship was stronger (r=0.66) than one based on changes in Cl concentration (r=0.55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the median mass-to-charge ratio within a given sample varied significantly across water sources (P less_than 0.05), with larger values in groundwater (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low-molecular-weight organic carbon in the hyporheic zone, relative to groundwater, is consistent with increased microbial activity53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This further supports our inference that labile organic carbontransported by intruding river waterstimulates microbial respiration in the hyporheic zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Variation in FTICR MS-based dissolved organic carbon composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Change in carbon compositionmeasured as Sorensen dissimilarity, bounded between 0 and 1as a function of change in NPOC concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solid line indicates the regression model and associated Mantel test statistics are provided.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Box plots summarizing distributions of mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) across different water sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different letters indicate statistically significant differences (P less_than 0.05) by a KruskalWallis test and values in parantheses are the number of samples in each group.Full size image', 'Although organic carbon composition varied significantly with changes in NPOC concentration and water source (Fig 4), it was not strongly related to microbial community composition (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we consider this evaluation preliminary, because our use of the FT-ICR MS data was limited to the presence/absence of unique m/z peaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach does not capture important shifts in the relative abundance of labile carbon species, which may obscure the relationship between carbon composition and microbial community composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consider this probable given that previous work has shown a strong influence of carbon composition over hyporheic zone community composition31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Preliminary data exploration indicated that changes in community composition were most strongly related to shifts in Cl and NPOC concentrations, with weaker relationships observed for changes in FT-ICR MS-based carbon composition and changes in temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the number of unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs) increased significantly with Cl concentration and declined significantly with NPOC concentration (Supplementary Fig 4); these relationships were effectively equivalent in terms of variation explained (R20.45 and P less_than  less_than 0.0001 for both).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In turn, we focus on microbial composition as related to Cl and NPOC concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Relating three metrics of community turnoverBrayCurtis, -mean nearest taxon distance (MNTD) and -nearest taxon index (NTI)to shifts in Cl and NPOC concentrations revealed important influences of both groundwatersurface water mixing and changes in the resource environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BrayCurtis and MNTD metrics respectively quantify turnover in the relative abundances of OTUs and in community phylogenetic structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are raw metrics and do not, by themselves, carry information about the ecological processes that govern community turnover54,55,56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, variation in the magnitudes of these two metrics can be driven by stochastic ecological processes such as organismal dispersal and more deterministic ecological processes associated with environmental or habitat selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'BrayCurtis was nonlinearly related to changes in Cl concentration (Fig 5a), but a weak relationship was observed with respect to changes in NPOC concentration (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MNTD was significantly (P=0.001 for both) related to changes in both Cl and NPOC concentrations (Fig 5c,d); the relationship with Cl (r=0.70) was stronger than with NPOC (r=0.52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a change in NPOC concentration probably reflects alteration of the resource environment, a change in Cl concentration arises due to the transport of surface water into (or out of) the subsurface domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BrayCurtis and MNTD patterns therefore suggest that the transport of surface water may directly influence OTU relative abundances and community phylogenetic structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One parsimonious interpretation is that the transport of surface water into the subsurface enhances organismal dispersal across system compartments (that is, from surface water to the hyporheic zone to the broader aquifer).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, this indicates that organismal dispersal can influence community composition, but it does not rule out a strong influence of the resource environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternative interpretation is that uranium contaminationwhich closely tracks groundwatersurface water mixing conditions in the study system38may influence community composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Konopka et al.57 showed, however, that microbial activity in the study system is not altered by prevailing uranium concentrations due to formation of carbonate uranyl complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Turnover in microbial community composition.Microbial community turnover in terms of composition (a,b), phylogeny (c,d) and phylogenetic null model deviation (e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Turnover metrics are related to either changes in Cl (a,c,e) or changes in NPOC (b,d,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solid red lines indicate a nonlinear spline fit (a,b) or linear models (cf);

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Biogeochemical activity is often enhanced at environmental transitions due to reciprocal provisioning of resources that limit activity in one environment but are abundant in the other3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hyporheic zone is a classic example of this dynamic15 and here we aimed to evaluate coupled dynamics between the biogeochemical environment and microbial composition, in response to changes in groundwatersurface water mixing within the hyporheic zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest thatacross the spatial and temporal scales studied heremicrobial communities within groundwater or surface water are governed by stochastic ecological processes, but that surface water intrusion into the hyporheic zone delivers labile organic carbon that stimulates microbial respiration and causes (ecologically) deterministic shifts in microbial community composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have revealed a collection of field-scale patterns that are consistent with a strong impact of surface water intrusion on hyporheic zone microbiomes and biogeochemical function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are numerous mechanisms underlying these coupled dynamics that will require additional investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To guide future efforts and connect our study to a broader range of systems, we collate the patterns observed here into a conceptual model (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that the conceptual model developed below is speculative and represents a collection of hypotheses that emerge from our results; it is intended to be a point of departure for future work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conceptual model is most relevant to systems that transition between saturated and unsaturated conditions, such as sections of rivers that are influenced by dam operations and/or tides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We frame the conceptual model around a key question: what is the source (or sources) of labile organic carbon that is transported by surface water and why is it not consumed before entering the hyporheic zone?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 8: Conceptual depiction of hypothesized dynamics in the hyporheic zone driven by changes in river stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) At high stage, the hyporheic zone is inundated with river water (dark blue arrow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unattached microbial communities in the river and hyporheic zone are governed by stochastic ecological processes whereby a broad range of microbial taxa are present (visualized as different cell shapes); purple and brown cells represent river-derived and groundwater-derived microbial taxa, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Well-connected pore channels and active microbial communities limit the accumulation of labile organic carbon (visualized as saccharide molecules) in pore channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) At low river stage, the hyporheic zone is dominated by groundwater discharge (green arrow) and unattached microbial communities are governed by stochastic ecological processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large interconnected pores drainbut smaller pores do notfollowing the decline in river stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extracellular enzymes (black and red) continue to degrade POC into labile organic carbon;

repeated high/low moisture cycles select for stable aggregates70 and aggregate dissolution should result in a progressively diminished biogeochemical response71, yet hyporheic zone NPOC concentration can be described as one continuous function of groundwatersurface water mixing conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that a more probable scenario is a combination of (i) physical isolation of sediment-associated microorganismsthe primary drivers of organic carbon cycling, but not directly studied herefrom organic matter following the transition from advective to diffusion-based transport; a decline in river stage results in unsaturated conditions and, in turn, diffusion-based transport; and (ii) the rapid transport of dissolved organic carbon through the hyporheic zone as river stage rises (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We specifically hypothesize that extracellular enzymes continue to degrade large organic moleculessupplied as POCin locations that microorganisms cannot access (temporarily) due to diffusion-based transport during low river stage (that is, during times of desaturation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Labile organic carbon would, in this case, accumulate in isolated microsites during low river stage andfollowing an increase in river stagesubsequently be dispersed and carried into the hyporheic zone at a rate that exceeds the ability of recently re-saturated communities to metabolize it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism is consistent with models that indicate accumulation of labile carbon during dry periods72,73 and observations that enzyme activities are less impacted by soil moisture than is microbial biomass74, suggesting continued enzymatic activity in times of reduced microbial activity75.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The patterns observed here suggest that transported labile carbon may be progressively consumed along hyporheic zone flow paths20,39thereby stimulating microbial activityand may also select for particular microbial taxa that can efficiently use the transported substrates (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Extending these concepts leads to an additional hypothesis: longer times between surface water inundations lead to greater accumulation of labile carbon within microsites, which is consistent with observations in soil systems71.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If this is true, then less frequent (and large) increases in river stage may disperse and transport larger quantities of labile organic carbon into the hyporheic zone and, in turn, may cause greater enhancement of microbial activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher rates of microbial respiration can generate anaerobic microsites47 and promote removal and/or immobilization of nitrate and other redox-sensitive contaminants44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests an important link between climate-change-driven shifts in watershed hydrology and the rates of elemental cycling and contaminant dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If large pulses of water associated with Spring-time snowpack melt (for example, Fig 2a) are diminished by warmer winter temperatures, microbial respiration rates may be too low to deplete O2, therefore having a significant impact on contaminant dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To rigorously evaluate the potential for such outcomes (for example, through predictive hydro-biogeochemical models), the hypotheses that constitute our proposed conceptual model (see Fig 8) will need to be directly tested and refined.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
