Alternative splicing of MALT1 controls signalling and activation of CD4+ T cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'MALT1 channels proximal T-cell receptor (TCR) signalling to downstream signalling pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With MALT1A and MALT1B two conserved splice variants exist and we demonstrate here that MALT1 alternative splicing supports optimal T-cell activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inclusion of exon7 in MALT1A facilitates the recruitment of TRAF6, which augments MALT1 scaffolding function, but not protease activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Naive CD4+ T cells express almost exclusively MALT1B and MALT1A expression is induced by TCR stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify hnRNP U as a suppressor of exon7 inclusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas selective depletion of MALT1A impairs T-cell signalling and activation, downregulation of hnRNP U enhances MALT1A expression and T-cell activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, TCR-induced alternative splicing augments MALT1 scaffolding to enhance downstream signalling and to promote optimal T-cell activation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Antigenic stimulation of the T-cell receptor (TCR) together with a CD28 co-stimulatory receptor induces productive activation of naive CD4+ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MALT1 (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue protein 1) bridges TCR/CD28 co-engagement to cellular downstream signalling pathways to promote T-cell activation and effector functions1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As part of the CARMA1BCL10MALT1 (CBM) signalling complex, MALT1 channels upstream TCR signalling to the canonical IB kinase (IKK)/nuclear factor-B (NF-B) signalling pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three TRAF6-binding sites have been mapped on MALT1 (refs 3, 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MALT1 recruits TRAF6 to the CBM complex to promote MALT1 ubiquitination and to facilitate activation of the IKK complex5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides its scaffolding function, MALT1 contains a paracaspase domain, and MALT1 proteolytic activity is induced on antigen stimulation in T cells6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MALT1 proteolytic activity is not directly involved in controlling canonical NF-B signalling7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, MALT1 cleavage of the deubiquitinases A20 and CYLD, the E3 ligase HOIL, the non-canonical NF-B family member RelB or the RNA regulators Regnase-1 and Roquin have been associated with various functions for T-cell biology6,7,9,10,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Alternative splicing is a crucial and ubiquitous mechanism that controls gene expression at the co- and post-transcriptional level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mammals, most pre-mRNAs are prone to alternative splicing, which results in the generation of multiple transcripts and proteins with diverse functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extensive changes in splicing patterns have been shown to occur in the immune response and especially in antigen-dependent T-cell activation14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternative splicing can act on multiple layers ranging from cell surface receptors, cytokines, signalling proteins to transcription factors, and thereby constitutes an essential regulatory mechanism for T-cell function15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A well-studied example is the TCR-induced exon exclusion of the transmembrane phosphatase CD45, which creates a negative-feedback regulation that counteracts T-cell activation17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in T cells, little is known how alternative splicing modulates expression and activity of intracellular signalling mediators and how this can influence T-cell signalling and activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Two conserved alternative splice isoforms of MALT1 have been assigned that differ only by inclusion (MALT1A) or exclusion (MALT1B) of exon7 that codes for 11 amino acids (aa 309319 of human MALT1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, neither expression nor functions of the two MALT1 alternative splice variants have been investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we identify heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNP U; SAF-A/SP120) as a factor that controls alternative MALT1 splicing and demonstrate that TCR-induced splicing of MALT1 increases relative MALT1A expression, which augments MALT1 scaffolding function and fosters activation of CD4+T cells.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'MALT1 exon7 supports optimal T-cell signalling and activation', 'A comparison of mammalian transcriptome databases revealed that MALT1 is expressed in two alternative splice isoforms (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mRNA of the splice variants MALT1A (824 aa) and MALT1B (813 aa) only differs in the inclusion or exclusion of the 33-bp long exon7, which codes for amino acids 309319 positioned between the Ig2- and caspase-like domains of human MALT1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The region was shown to contain a putative TRAF6-binding motif4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of both splice variants, exon/intron boundaries, amino-acid sequences and TRAF6-binding site in MALT1 exon7 are highly conserved in mammals (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This evolutionary and structural conservation points to a functional relevance of preserving the expression of the two MALT1 variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Conserved MALT1 exon7 enhances TRAF6 recruitment and NF-B activation but not MALT1 activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Domain structure of MALT1 isoforms with different TRAF6-binding motifs (T6BMs) highlighted in orange and blue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence conservation of T6BM1 in exon7 in different species is shown below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein domains are denoted by black boxes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DD, death domain, Ig, Immunoglobulin-like domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Schematics of the T6BMs in MALT1A and MALT1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different TRAF6-binding mutants were generated by glutamate (E) to alanine point mutations (A) as indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ch) MALT1-deficient Jurkat T-cell clone was reconstituted with StrepTagII (mock) or MALT1-StrepTagII variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) MALT1 expression was checked by western blot (WB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Reconstituted cells were stimulated with P/I for the indicated time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NF-B signalling was analysed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and WB, and NF-B signal was quantified relative to OCT1 control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e,f) Cells transduced with MALT1A wild-type or MALT1A mutants were stimulated with P/I for the indicated time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NF-B and MAPK signalling were analysed by WB and EMSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (g) CBM complex formation as well as TRAF6 recruitment were investigated by StrepT-PD after 30 min P/I stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding of MALT1 to NEMO was monitored after NEMO IP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modified MALT1 indicative of ubiquitination is marked by asterisk (*).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (h) Proteins were precipitated by StrepT-PD after 20 min P/I stimulation and active MALT1 was detected using fluorescent MALT1-ABP probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are representative of at least three independent experiments.Full size image', 'Two functional TRAF6-binding motifs (T6BM2 and T6BM3) have been identified in the C terminus of MALT1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3; Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TRAF6 binding to T6BM1 within exon7 was demonstrated, but the role for T-cell signalling has not been investigated4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To analyse the putative isoform-specific effects on T-cell signalling, we generated MALT1-deficient Jurkat T cells using CRISPR/Cas9 for viral reconstitution (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of MALT1 protein was verified by western blotting (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, NF-B activation in response to PMA/Ionomycin (P/I), but not tumour necrosis factor- (TNF-) stimulation, was lost in Jurkat T-cell clone #2 that lacks MALT1 (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To analyse the differential effects of MALT1 isoforms, MALT1-deficient Jurkat T cells were lentivirally reconstituted with MALT1A or MALT1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the isoforms were expressed at equivalent levels and in the range of endogenous MALT1 from Jurkat T cells (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reconstitution with either MALT1A or MALT1B rescued NF-B signalling, but the activation of IB degradation and NF-B in MALT1A-expressing cells was more rapid and slightly stronger when compared with MALT1B cells (Fig 1d), indicating that inclusion of exon7 can facilitate TRAF6 recruitment to promote optimal NF-B activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We wanted to validate that the putative binding motif in MALT1 exon7 is crucial for signalling in Jurkat T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, we reconstituted MALT1-deficient Jurkat T cells with MALT1A or MALT1B constructs mutated in one or more TRAF6-binding sites (Fig 1b; Supplementary Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas mutation of the TRAF6-binding motif 2 (T6BM2) next to the Ig3 in MALT1B does not affect signalling, activation of NF-B, JNK and p38 completely relies on the presence of the most C-terminal T6BM3 (Supplementary Fig 1e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, only the combined mutation of T6BM1 in exon7 and the C-terminal T6BM3 (T6BM1/3 EA) in MALT1A abrogates the activation of downstream signalling pathways (Fig 1e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prove that the mutations in individual or multiple T6BMs affect TRAF6 recruitment, we performed StrepT-PD of transduced Jurkat T cells (Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Constitutive BCL10 association and inducible CARMA1 recruitment were not affected by MALT1 exon7 inclusion or mutations of TRAF6 sites, but TRAF6 recruitment was diminished in MALT1B compared with MALT1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with the effects on signalling, mutation of the binding site T6BM3 in MALT1B alone and the combined mutation of T6BM1/3 in MALT1A abolished TRAF6 recruitment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, MALT1 ubiquitin modification was severely reduced only in the absences of any functional TRAF6-binding site, which prevented recruitment of ubiquitinated MALT1 to the IKK regulatory subunit NEMO (Fig 1g)5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the mutagenesis of individual or multiple TRAF6-binding sites confirms that exon7 is significantly contributing to the activation of downstream signalling pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To test whether splicing affects MALT1 proteolytic activity in response to T-cell stimulation, we measured MALT1 protease activation in reconstituted Jurkat T cells using fluorescently labelled MALT1 activity-based probe (MALT1-ABP;

Supplementary Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of both the MALT1 isoforms rescued NF-B signalling on anti-CD3/CD28 or P/I stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Congruent with our observations in MALT1-deficient Jurkat T cells, IB degradation was more rapid and NF-B activation was stronger in cells expressing MALT1A when compared with MALT1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, JNK phosphorylation was rescued on MALT1 expression and MALT1A was more potent in mediating JNK activation than MALT1B after anti-CD3/CD28 or P/I stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MALT1 was also able to rescue the partial defect in p38 activation that has been observed earlier in MALT1-deficient T cells1, but p38 activation did not rely on the MALT1 isoforms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, despite a reduction in ERK amounts in MALT1A- or MALT1B-expressing cells, no differences in the extent of inducible ERK phosphorylation were detected using the two splice variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: MALT1A promotes stronger NF-B and JNK activation on T-cell stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ac) CD4+ T cells from MALT1-deficient mice (C57BL/6J) were reconstituted with mock, MALT1A or MALT1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) MALT1 expression levels of T cells from wt mice or reconstituted Malt1/ mice were determined by western blot (WB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NF-B (b) and MAPK signalling (c) were analysed by WB after stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 as indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NF-B DNA binding was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NF-B signal was quantified relative to OCT1 control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d,e) MALT1-deficient mice (C57BL/6J) were reconstituted with MALT1A, MALT1B or different TRAF6-binding mutants as indicated (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IB phosphorylation and degradation were analysed by WB after P/I stimulation and DNA binding of NF-B was monitored by EMSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NF-B signal was quantified relative to OCT1 control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are representative of at least three independent experiments.Full size image', 'To investigate whether the TRAF6-binding motifs in the C terminus and exon7 contribute to differential effects on MALT1 downstream signalling in primary T cells, we performed reconstitutions using a series of MALT1 point mutations to destroy T6BMs individually or in combination (Fig 1b) and determined the effects on NF-B signalling in primary T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutation of the C-terminal TRAF6 motifs (T6BM2/3 EA) in MALT1A led to a similar reduction in P/I-triggered NF-B signalling activation as exclusion of exon7 in MALT1B (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, NF-B signalling was decreased on destruction of the T6BM1 in exon7 MALT1A (T6BM1 EA; Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only the combined destruction of T6BMs in either MALT1A (T6BM1/2/3 EA) or MALT1B (T6BM2/3 EA) completely abolished the NF-B response (Fig 2d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in primary T cells, intact TRAF6-binding sites in the C terminus of MALT1B are sufficient to induce moderate downstream signalling, but cooperation between C-terminal and exon7-encoded TRAF6-binding motifs promote optimal NF-B signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In Jurkat T cells, we observed the effects of exon7 on downstream signalling, but not on paracaspase activity, suggesting that inclusion of exon7 is primarily modulating MALT1 scaffolding function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interleukin (IL)-2 expression critically depends on MALT1 scaffolding and partially on MALT1 cleavage activity5,8,21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, IL-2 production after anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation was rescued in T cells retrovirally reconstituted with MALT1A or MALT1B, but the number of IL-2-producing cells was increased in MALT1A transduced cells (Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the stronger potency of MALT1A to promote downstream signalling correlates with a more robust IL-2 production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TH17 differentiation was completely abolished in MALT1 protease defective mice and is thus apparently independent of MALT1 scaffolding function22,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate whether inclusion of exon7 influences TH17 differentiation, we adenovirally transduced naive CD4+ T cells expressing a signalling-deficient coxsackie adenovirus receptor (CAR1) from Malt1/R26/CAG-CAR1stop-flCd4-Cre mice12,25 using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as infection marker (Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We optimized ex vivo differentiation under TH1- or TH17-inducing conditions and found that TH17 differentiation was absent in Malt1/ T cells in the presence of anti-CD3 and irradiated antigen-presenting cells (APCs; Supplementary Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, also TH1 differentiation was diminished in the absence of MALT1, indicating that depending on the conditions MALT1 does not only control TH17 differentiation24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using these conditions, we monitored the number of IFN-producing TH1 cells and IL-17A-expressing TH17 cells in MALT1-deficient cells after viral rescue (Fig 3c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the MALT1 splice variants induced TH17 and TH1 differentiation to a similar extend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the catalytically inactive MALT1A C464A mutant was unable to promote TH1 and TH17 differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the biochemical and functional data provide evidence that alternative MALT1 splicing modulates MALT1 scaffolding and downstream signalling, but does not affect MALT1 protease activity and cell fate decisions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: MALT1A expression enhances IL-2 production but not TH17 differentiation in CD4+ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) Malt1/ CD4+ T cells were retrovirally reconstituted with either mock, MALT1A or MALT1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Reconstituted T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 for 4 h and intracellular IL-2 production was analysed by FACS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Quantification of IL-2 production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentage of IL-2-positive cells from MALT1B-expressing cells was set to 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depicted is the mean±s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (n=3) (c,d) CD4+ T cells from Malt1/R26/CAG-CAR1stop-flCd4-Cre mice were adenovirally reconstituted with GFP control, MALT1A, MALT1B or MALT1A C464A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were cultured for 3 days under TH1- or TH17-polarizing conditions and restimulated with P/I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GFP+ cells were analysed for intracellular IFN- and IL-17A levels by FACS and numbers in quadrants represent percentage of IFN-- or IL-17A-positive cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Data show mean±s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (n=4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  *P less_than 0.05;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'MALT1 paracaspase controls adaptive and innate immune signalling pathways and is a key regulator of T-cell activation27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the fact that two conserved MALT1 splice variants exist in mammals neither expression nor the functional relevance of these MALT1 isoforms has been explored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that MALT1 is prone to alternative splicing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While murine CD4+ T cells express almost exclusively the shorter isoform MALT1B, the longer exon7 containing variant MALT1A is induced on TCR stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lower MALT1A expression and induction of MALT1A after T-cell stimulation was also observed in human CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find differences in the levels of MALT1A/B in human and murine cells, but the different sources, purification protocols and stimulatory conditions preclude a quantitative comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified the RNA-binding protein hnRNP U as a negative regulator of exon7 inclusion in human Jurkat and murine primary T cells and we show that MALT1A upregulation enhances T-cell signalling and activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the induction of MALT1A, MALT1B remained the more abundant isoform, suggesting that not the absolute amounts, but the shifted balance in MALT1A versus MALT1B expression is defining downstream effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relevance of MALT1 alternative splicing is also underscored by the observation that MALT1A transcripts are elevated in vivo in T cells with a more activated phenotype such as effector memory T cells and TFH cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Alternative splicing is an important mechanism regulating cell function during the immune response14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Global analysis of splicing events using exon array demonstrated extensive alternative exon usage in many immune regulators during T-cell activation28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternative exon7 usage of MALT1 in T cells was never reported using exon arrays, most likely because the short exon7 cannot be detected in global analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TCR-induced inclusion of exon7 generates the hyperactive MALT1A isoform that provides an additional and functional TRAF6-binding motif that boosts NF-B activation and slightly enhances JNK signalling in primary T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, in Jurkat T cells MALT1A was slightly more effective in triggering downstream signalling, but interestingly deletion of exon7 in MALT1B exerted a more severe effect than point mutation of T6BM1, suggesting that the role of exon7 may not be restricted to TRAF6 recruitment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, whereas in Jurkat T cells one of two T6BMs was largely sufficient to trigger full-NF-B signalling, decreased signalling was seen after mutation of individual sites in CD4+ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, modulation of signalling strength by alternative MALT1 splicing seems to be more important in primary T cells, presumably to enhance weaker TCR signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Constitutively expressed MALT1B seems to function as a molecular rheostat that limits the signalling strength in naive CD4+ T cells and MALT1A induction in activated T cells is required to overcome a threshold and to achieve a full response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we propose that TCR-induced MALT1 splicing is part of a positive feed-forward mechanism that is tuning T-cell signalling to allow productive T-cell activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'MALT1 acts as a molecular scaffold protein to recruit the IKK complex to the CBM complex5, but it is also a protease which is activated on T-cell stimulation6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since exon7 contains a functional TRAF6-binding site and TRAF6-dependent MALT1 ubiquitination drives NF-B signalling5, the data suggest that exon7 inclusion augments MALT1 scaffolding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The E3 ligase TRAF6 can catalyse MALT1 poly-ubiquitination and trigger IKK activation3,5, but its role in T-cell activation has been questioned as TRAF6 ablation does not significantly affect TCR signalling to NF-B and MAPK29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, our mutagenesis underscores an essential requirement of the TRAF6-binding motifs for MALT1 scaffolding function, suggesting that another E3 ligase may compensate for the loss of TRAF6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, inclusion of exon7 in MALT1A does not enhance protease function, which is in line with the results obtained by comparing Malt1/ and MALT1 paracaspase mutant (Malt1PM) mice21,22,23,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD4+ T cells from both Malt1/ and Malt1PM mice are unable to differentiate into TH17 cells22,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Congruently, we show in reconstitution experiments in vitro that catalytically inactive MALT1 does not promote TH17 development, but both MALT1 splice variants support TH17 differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, our data indicate that even though TH1 differentiation is not completely relying on MALT1, the catalytic activity augments TH1 development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, differentiation processes are apparently primarily driven by MALT1 protease function, which is required to remove the critical post-transcriptional regulators Roquin and Regnase-1 that counteract upregulation of TH17 differentiation factors such as IB or IBNS12,31,32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, proteolytic activity of MALT1 is largely dispensable for direct downstream signalling to NF-B and JNK21,22,30, providing further evidence that the differential effects of MALT1 splice variants are caused by the scaffolding function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  JNK activation has been connected to MALT1-catalysed CYLD cleavage10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, MALT1 activity and CYLD cleavage were not affected by blocking MALT1A induction and JNK activation was also not impaired in T cells from Malt1PM mice21,22,30, revealing that JNK signalling in naive CD4+ T cells is not relying on MALT1 protease activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, biochemical and functional evidence demonstrates that alternative splicing modulates MALT1 scaffolding function, but not protease activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We identified several RNA-binding factors that influence splicing of MALT1 by either promoting inclusion (for example, hnRNP R, hnRNP LL and SRSF3) or skipping (for example, hnRNP H1, hnRNP A1, U2AF1 and hnRNP U) of exon7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with a minigene approach, the results indicate that MALT1 exon7 splicing is controlled by a complex machinery of positive and negative trans-acting factors as well as cis-acting RNA elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the screen, we identified hnRNP U as the most potent negative regulator of exon7 inclusion in Jurkat T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  hnRNP U knockdown enhanced TCR-induced upregulation of MALT1A and T-cell activation, supporting the conclusion that alternative splicing of MALT1 modulates T-cell responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  hnRNP U is able to bind DNA and RNA, and it has been implicated in a variety of biological processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent genome-wide studies revealed that hnRNP U is an important regulator of alternative splicing34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  hnRNP U can promote exon skipping or inclusion in a highly context-dependent manner and it can act in conjunction with other splicing regulators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the initial search already indicated that multiple RNA-binding proteins impact on alternative MALT1 splicing, it seems reasonable to assume that MALT1A and MALT1B levels will be regulated by a network of splice factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TCR stimulation induces the expression of hnRNP U, but at the same time putative MALT1A promoting splice factors such as hnRNP R, SRSF3 and SRSF9 are increased, suggesting that expression and competition of a complex network of positive and negative splice factors may control MALT1 splicing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, a more detailed understanding about these factors and their cis-acting elements is required to elucidate the mechanism how TCR signalling impacts on MALT1 splicing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  hnRNP U was suggested to regulate splice site selection either by modulating the core splicing machinery or by directly targeting the pre-mRNA35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The processes are not mutually exclusive and future studies must determine the exact mechanism how hnRNP U regulates exon7 splicing of MALT1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Little is known how cellular signalling pathways influence splicing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AKT signalling was shown to control hnRNP U- and hnRNP L-dependent Caspase-9 splicing36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, JNK signalling was shown to induce alternative splicing of multiple targets including the MAP kinase kinase 7 (MKK7) upon T-cell activation37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will be interesting to unravel if similar molecular mechanisms link TCR stimulation to MALT1 splicing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We show that alternative MALT1 splicing impacts on signalling strength and induction of the hyperactive splice variant MALT1A pushes more robust T-cell activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such positive feed-forward regulation may facilitate to surpass thresholds for cellular decisions and they even can take place on the single-cell level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the relative MALT1A and MALT1B expression may trigger different programs in individual cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, intrinsic characteristics of T-cell signalling determine the fate of naive CD4+ T cells38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strong TCR signalling favours TFH over TH1 development, but the underlying molecular mechanisms that translates the magnitude of TCR signalling into a response remains elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that induced MALT1 splicing augments TCR signalling to NF-B and JNK, and that MALT1A expression in vivo is indeed high in TFH cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that MALT1 alternative splicing constitutes an early bifurcation point to translate TCR signalling into different T-cell activation states that may favour
