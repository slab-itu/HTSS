Structural and functional insights into IZUMO1 recognition by JUNO in mammalian fertilization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Spermegg fusion is the critical step in mammalian fertilization, and requires the interaction between IZUMO1 on the sperm surface and JUNO (also known as folate receptor (FR) 4 or IZUMO1R) on the egg surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas other FRs bind and uptake folates, JUNO binds IZUMO1 and establishes the cellcell adhesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mechanism of IZUMO1 recognition by JUNO has remained elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the crystal structure of mouse JUNO, at 2.3 Å resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A structural comparison of JUNO with the FRs revealed that JUNO and the FRs have similar overall structures, but JUNO lacks the folate-binding pocket, thereby explaining the inability of JUNO to bind folate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further complementation of Juno knockout eggs with mutant Juno messenger RNAs revealed that the conserved, surface-exposed tryptophan residue of JUNO is required for sperm binding and fertilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our structure-based in vivo functional analyses provide a framework towards a mechanistic understanding of mammalian gamete recognition.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Among many factors involved in spermegg fusion1, IZUMO1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2) on the spermatozoon and the IZUMO1 counter-receptor JUNO3 on the egg are the only factors proven to form an intercellular bridge, and the deletion of either gene leads to the failure of gamete membrane fusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the ability of a hamster egg to fuse with human sperm4, hamster JUNO can bind human IZUMO1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5), highlighting the importance of the IZUMO1JUNO interaction in cross-species gamete recognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IZUMO1 is a type-I transmembrane protein, comprising an ectodomain and a single membrane-spanning region2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IZUMO1 ectodomain is composed of an immunoglobulin-like domain and an Izumo domain, which can be further divided into an N-terminal unstructured region and an -helical core region important for spermegg binding6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  JUNO is a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cysteine-rich glycoprotein, and was originally identified as folate receptor (FR) 4, which shares 52% sequence identity with FR1 and FR2 in mice3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, JUNO binds IZUMO1 and is involved in the spermegg adhesion3, whereas the FRs bind folate and participate in folate uptake7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystal structures of FR1 and FR2 revealed that the FRs adopt a globular architecture stabilized by multiple disulfide bonds and recognize folate in a folate-binding pocket11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the distinct specificities between JUNO and the FRs, the amino-acid residues forming the folate-binding pocket are strictly conserved in the FRs, but not in JUNO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, the crystal structure of mouse JUNO was reported13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure revealed conformational differences in three loop regions between JUNO and the FRs, despite they have similar overall structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, an avidity-based extracellular interaction screen suggested that the flexible loop regions of JUNO are involved in IZUMO1 binding13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the molecular mechanism by which JUNO specifically recognizes IZUMO1 and participates in the spermegg adhesion step remains to be fully understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To gain mechanistic insights into the IZUMO1 recognition by JUNO, we solved the crystal structure of the N73D mutant of mouse JUNO and performed the structure-based mutational analyses.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Crystal structure of the N73D mutant JUNO ectodomain', 'We prepared the wild-type (WT) ectodomain of mouse JUNO (residues 20221), using the baculovirus-Sf9 expression system (Fig 1a and Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed crystallization screens, but failed to obtain crystals of the WT JUNO ectodomain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse JUNO has two putative N-glycosylated sites (Asn73 and Asn185; Fig 1a), and the glycosylation may hinder the crystallization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This notion is consistent with the fact that the WT ectodomain of mouse JUNO (residues 20221), which was expressed in human embryonic kidney 293S (HEK293S) GnT1 cells and enzymatically deglycosylated, was successfully crystallized13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The N185D mutant JUNO ectodomain was not expressed as a soluble protein in insect cells, suggesting that the Asn185-linked glycan contributes to the protein stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the N73D mutant JUNO ectodomain was expressed at a similar level to that of the WT JUNO ectodomain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus crystallized the N73D mutant ectodomain of mouse JUNO (residues 20221), and determined its crystal structure by molecular replacement at 2.3 Å resolution (Fig 1b, Table 1 and Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure revealed that JUNO adopts a globular architecture comprising two long  helices (3 and 4) surrounded by five short  helices (1, 2 and 57), a two-stranded anti-parallel -sheet (2 and 3), a two-stranded parallel -sheet (4 and 7) and a mixed three-stranded -sheet (1, 5 and 6) (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall structure is stabilized by eight conserved disulfide bonds (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Asn185-linked glycan interacts with the side chains of Asn146 and Leu148 (Fig 1c), consistent with the reduced stability of the N185D mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Crystal structure of JUNO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Multiple sequence alignment of JUNOs from different species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In

'Recently, the crystal structure of the WT ectodomain of mouse JUNO (PDB code 5EJN) was determined at 2.7 Å resolution13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystal of WT JUNO belongs to the space group P21, with two protomers in the asymmetric unit (Mol A and Mol B) (Fig 1d), whereas our crystal of N73D mutant JUNO belongs to the space group P21212, with one protomer in the asymmetric unit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our structure of N73D mutant JUNO is essentially identical to that of WT JUNO (PDB code 5EJN)13, with root mean square deviations of 0.74 and 0.70 Å for Mol A (157 C atoms) and Mol B (166 C atoms), respectively (Fig 1e), suggesting that the N73D mutation did not substantially affect the overall structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparison between the three structures revealed that JUNO comprises a rigid core and three surface-exposed, flexible regions (flexible regions 13) (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our N73D mutant JUNO structure, flexible regions 1 and 3 adopt loop conformations (flexible region 3 is partly disordered), while flexible region 2 forms a -hairpin (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, flexible regions 13 are largely disordered in Mol A, whereas flexible regions 1 and 3 are disordered and flexible region 2 forms a -hairpin in Mol B of the WT JUNO structure (Fig 1d)13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the WT JUNO, Asn73 on flexible region 2 is disordered and does not interact with the protein (Fig 1d), consistent with our data showing that the N73D mutation does not affect the protein expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Structural comparison of JUNO with the FRs', 'Mouse JUNO shares sequence and structural similarities with human FR1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11) (PDB code 3LRH, 54% sequence identity, root mean square deviation of 1.0 Å for 176 C atoms) and human FR2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12) (PDB code 4KMZ, 54% sequence identity, root mean square deviation of 1.2 Å for 179 C atoms) (Fig 2ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The eight disulfide bonds are also conserved in JUNO and the FRs (Fig 2ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In FR1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11) and FR2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12), the folate is bound to the folate-binding pocket formed by the core helices and loop regions, and is extensively recognized by the protein (Fig 2d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In FR1, Tyr85/Trp171 and Tyr60/Trp102 form stacking interactions with the pterin and aminobenzoate rings of folate, respectively11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Asp81, Arg103, Arg106, His135 and Ser174 hydrogen bond with the pterin ring of folate11 (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Tyr60, Asp81, Tyr85, Trp102, Arg103, Arg106, His135 and Trp171 residues of FR1, respectively correspond to the Phe72, Ala93, His97, Gly114, Gln115, Arg119, Leu148 and Trp184 residues of JUNO, which form a central pocket equivalent to the folate-binding pocket of FR1 (Fig 2f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A structural comparison of JUNO with FR1 revealed that folate cannot be accommodated in the central pocket of JUNO (Fig 2h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, JUNO Trp184 adopts a different configuration from that of the equivalent FR1 Trp171, and would sterically clash with the folate (Fig 2h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Asp81 and Arg103 in FR1 are replaced with Ala93 and Glu117 in JUNO, respectively (Fig 2h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These structural differences explain the inability of JUNO to bind folate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Comparison of

system (Supplementary Fig 2), and examined whether the sperm-fusing ability of unfertilized eggs derived from Juno KO mice can be complemented by the injection of mRNA encoding the WT or mutants of mouse JUNO (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the Juno KO eggs failed to fuse with the sperm, whereas the injection of mRNA encoding WT JUNO restored their sperm-fusing ability (Fig 3b, Supplementary Fig 3 and Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  N73D mutant JUNO rescued the sperm-fusing ability of the Juno KO eggs (Fig 3b and Table 2), indicating that the Asn73-glycan is dispensable for the spermegg interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  His97 and Trp184 in the central pocket are conserved among the JUNOs from different mammalian species (Figs 1a and 2g), implying the functional importance of the central pocket.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, both the H97A and W184A mutants restored the sperm-fusing abilities of the Juno KO eggs (Fig 3b and Table 2), indicating that the central pocket is not involved in IZUMO1 binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A close inspection of the conservation of surface residues revealed that the loop regions around the central pocket are less conserved, whereas the molecular surface opposite from the central pocket is relatively conserved among the JUNOs from different mammalian species (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the hydrophobic Trp62 and Leu66 residues are exposed to the solvent (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, these residues are highly conserved among the JUNOs (Fig 1a), but not in the FRs (Fig 2a), suggesting their functional importance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the W62A mutant, but not the L66A mutant, failed to rescue the sperm-fusing ability of Juno KO eggs (0/21 and 15/18 eggs fertilized in W62A and L66A, respectively) (Fig 3b and Table 2), suggesting that Trp62 is involved in the IZUMO1JUNO interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the -helical core region (residues 57113) of IZUMO1 is important for the interaction with JUNO6, these results suggested that Trp62 of JUNO interacts with hydrophobic residues on the -helical core region of IZUMO1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: IZUMO1-binding site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a)

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The crystal structure of N73D mutant JUNO described here, along with the recently reported WT JUNO structures13, revealed that JUNO has a core fold and three surface-exposed, flexible regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A previous functional analysis suggested that flexible regions 1 and 3 around the central pocket are involved in IZUMO1 binding13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these results, Han et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  proposed that the -helical region of IZUMO1 interacts with the surface groove surrounded by the two flexible loop regions of JUNO13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our in vivo analyses revealed that Trp62, rather than the central pocket, is critical for sperm binding and fertilization, thereby highlighting the importance of Trp62 for IZUMO1 binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the proximity of Trp62 to flexible regions 1 and 3, we suggest that JUNO interacts with IZUMO1 through the surface encompassing Trp62 and flexible regions 1 and 3 (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, Trp62 is strictly conserved among the JUNOs, whereas the flexible regions are relatively divergent (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that Trp62 plays conserved roles in IZUMO1 binding, whereas the flexible regions contribute to IZUMO1 binding in species-specific manners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This notion is consistent with our data indicating that human JUNO can interact with mouse IZUMO, with reduced efficiency (Figs 3b and 4c and Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Putative IZUMO1-binding surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) A putative IZUMO1-binding site encompassing Trp62 and flexible regions 1 and 3 is indicated by a circle on the ribbon (a) and surface (b) representations of N73D mutant JUNO.Full size image', 'Previous studies showed that the cultured cells expressing mouse IZUMO1 can bind to eggs, but do not fuse with them6,14,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we showed that the cultured cells expressing mouse JUNO can bind to spermatozoa, but do not fuse with them (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a recent study revealed that JUNO is enriched in the spermegg interface before the beginning of membrane fusion but disappears a few minutes after fusion has started while part of IZUMO1 still present16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that IZUMO1 has another receptor that could be involved in membrane fusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complementation assays presented in this study utilizing Juno KO oocyte and cultured cells would be usable even in the identification of the novel IZUMO1 receptor and/or in detailed studies of gamete recognition such as a species specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, our structural and functional approach provide a framework towards a mechanistic understanding of spermegg fusion in mammalian fertilization.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
