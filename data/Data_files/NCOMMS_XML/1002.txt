Protein-altering and regulatory genetic variants near GATA4 implicated in bicuspid aortic valve  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a heritable congenital heart defect and an important risk factor for valvulopathy and aortopathy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report a genome-wide association scan of 466 BAV cases and 4,660 age, sex and ethnicity-matched controls with replication in up to 1,326 cases and 8,103 controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify association with a noncoding variant 151 kb from the gene encoding the cardiac-specific transcription factor, GATA4, and near-significance for p.Ser377Gly in GATA4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GATA4 was interrupted by CRISPR-Cas9 in induced pluripotent stem cells from healthy donors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The disruption of GATA4 significantly impaired the transition from endothelial cells into mesenchymal cells, a critical step in heart valve development.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a congenital aortic valve defect characterized by fusion of two of the normal three leaflets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a prevalence of 1% in the population and a feature of some rare connective-tissue syndromes, BAV is the most common cardiovascular malformation in humans1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BAV is associated with serious consequences: 3070% of those with BAV will develop dilated thoracic aorta3; 1571% of BAV patients develop aortic valve stenosis depending on age group and individuals with BAV have a 50-fold higher risk of severe aortic valve stenosis4; and up to 47% of BAV patients develop aortic valve incompetence5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of a BAV confers an eightfold increased risk of aortic dissection, which carries very high mortality6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, 27% of BAV patients will require surgical intervention to either replace their aortic valve or aorta for aortic aneurysm and dissection7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BAV accounts for 40% of the  greater than 50,000 aortic valve replacements performed in the United States each year8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'BAV is moderately heritable, with estimates ranging from 20 to 89% (refs 9, 10, 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the prevalence, importance and heritability of BAV, its genetic origins remain elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous genetic studies of BAV have focused primarily on linkage analysis in families9,12 or sequencing candidate genes in cases13 under a hypothesis of Mendelian inheritance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only one previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) for BAV has been published in a limited number of cases (n=68; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14), which did not identify any genome-wide significant results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only gene in which variants have been identified to cause BAV in multiple families is NOTCH1, but  less_than 6% of BAV cases are accounted for by NOTCH1 variation13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is clear that BAV is not a simple Mendelian trait9,15, but is indeed heritable, and, therefore, we applied genetic association methods typically used for complex traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'With a goal of identifying genetic variants associated with BAV, leading to biological insight of the underlying causes, here we perform an unbiased genome scan in a large study of BAV cases (n=466) and controls (n=4,660), with replication in additional samples of up to 1,326 cases and 8,103 controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify two genetic variants that reached or were near genome-wide significance levels (P less_than 5 × 108).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One is a low-frequency intergenic variant rs6601627 (odds ratio (OR)=2.38, Pafter-replication=3 × 1015) with a substantially higher frequency in BAV cases (8.3%) than in controls (4.2%), and the other one is an independent association signal at a common protein-altering variant p.Ser377Gly (rs3729856) in GATA4, which encodes a cardiac-specific transcription factor that is 151 kilobases(kb) away from the first variant (Pafter-replication=8.8 × 108).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with GATA4 disrupted by CRISPR-Cas9 demonstrate impaired transition of endothelial into mesenchymal cells (EndoMT), a critical step in valve formation16.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'GWAS of BAV', 'To discover the underlying genetic basis of BAV, we successfully genotyped 498,075 genetic variants with enrichment of protein-altering variants (43.8% of variants examined) for 466 BAV cases and 4,660 controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imputation from the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) panel17 enabled examination of a total of 12,320,487 variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinical characteristics for BAV cases are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following a genome-wide association scan (Supplementary Figs 1 and 2), we examined three variants in replication cohorts with a combined total of up to 1,326 additional cases and 8,103 controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Variants near GATA4', 'The strongest result from the genome-wide discovery for BAV was observed for a genotyped low-frequency variant, rs6601627, in an intergenic region of chromosome 8 (rs6601627, minor allele frequency (MAF)=4.1%, OR=1.9, Pcombined=3.0 × 1015; Table 1, Fig 1 and Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ninety-seven imputed variants in this region also reached genome-wide significance (P less_than 5 × 108).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two nearest genes are not obvious functional candidates (CTSB and DEFB135); however, this variant is 151 kb from the 3 end of the GATA4 gene (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Genetic variants associated with BAV.Full size table', 'Figure 1: Regional association plot of the chr8 association region near GATA4n the discovery cohort.Genome-wide single variant association tests were performed on 466 BAV cases and 4,660 controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The upper panel shows all variants that were directly genotyped in the chip array in this region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A missense variant (rs3729856, p.S377G) within GATA4 was observed to be associated with BAV with P=3.2 × 104, that reached P=8.8 × 108 following replication in 1,326 BAV cases and 8,103 controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bottom panel shows results after genotypes imputed from the HRC reference17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coding variants are represented by triangles and noncoding variants are represented by squares.Full size image', 'We also observed a common missense variant p.Ser377Gly in GATA4 (rs3729856) that was also associated with BAV (Pdiscovery=3.2 × 104, MAF=14.5%; Table 1 and Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We selected GATA4 p.Ser377Gly for in silico replication because it is a protein-altering variant and because it was located in the local genomic region of the most significant variant (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The p.Ser377Gly variant reached near genome-wide significance after including in silico replication data (OR=1.31, P=8.8 × 108; Supplementary Fig 4), and exceeded the typical significance level used for exome-wide studies of coding variation (typically P less_than 2 × 107; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that GATA4 may be the functional gene at this GWAS locus; however, further experiments will be needed to demonstrate which gene(s) causes BAV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two variants at 8p23.1 (rs6601627 and rs3729856) appear to be independent of each other, since they were not in linkage disequilibrium (LD r2=0.013) and reciprocal conditional association analysis maintained nominal significance for both (Pcond rs6601627=8.92 × 109, Pcond rs3729856=0.012).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After including in silico replication data, the reciprocal conditional association analysis still maintained nominal significance (Pmeta rs6601627=1.52 × 109, Pmeta rs3729856=8.17 × 103; Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The non-additive association tests showed that both variants appear to have dominant effects on risk of BAV (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The ExAC database characterizes protein-altering variants in 60,706 multiethnic individuals with whole-exome sequences19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ExAC lists 96 missense variants in GATA4 (95 of them have MAF less_than 1%), a deficit compared to the 140 variants predicted based on gene size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, 9.4 loss-of-function (LoF) variants are predicted and only 1 was observed (p.Lys365Ter) out of 60,706 individuals with deep exome sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probability that the gene is intolerant to LoF, a measure of the relative importance of gene function, is high (loss intolerance probability (pLI) score=0.8 where  greater than 0.9 is considered extremely intolerant).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the missense GATA4 variant rs3729856 is predicted as benign or tolerated by PolyPhen2 (20) and SIFT21, and it has a combined annotation dependent depletion (CADD) score 9.418 (in top 11% of deleterious variants in the human genome)22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest the importance of the GATA4 genes function, although the missense variant rs3729856 itself may not be significantly deleterious.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We hypothesized that the functional BAV gene at this CTSB/GATA4 locus would demonstrate high expression in heart or vascular tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the GTEx portal23, we examined mRNA expression levels of all genes within the 200 kb surrounding the noncoding associated variant rs6601627 and found that GATA4 showed strong expression in the heart (atrial appendage and left ventricle) and coronary artery, and also in the ovary, testis, pancreas and liver (Supplementary Fig 6)23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other genes in the region (NEIL2, FDFT1 and CTSB) showed ubiquitous expression levels across all tissues (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examination of all GTEx association results did not identify any significant expression quantitative trait locus with the noncoding rs6,601,627 (P less_than 105; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that this noncoding variant, or a variant tagged by it, influences GATA4 expression in a manner not detectable by GTEeither exerting an influence on gene expression levels only in the developing fetal heart or with a relatively modest effect that was not detectable in the current GTEx sample size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'After detecting the association with both coding and noncoding variants at the GATA4 locus, we sought to examine the role of GATA4 in the development of the aortic valve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the primitive heart tube, heart valves develop from endocardial cushions, which are formed by mesenchymal cells derived from endothelial cells (ECs) through a process called EndoMT16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the critical role in heart valve development, the mechanism of EndoMT is not well understood24,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GATA4 was previously shown to be essential for heart formation and for endocardial cushion development in mice27,28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we evaluated the impact of disruption of GATA4 on human iPSC differentiation into mesenchymal cells through EndoMT to examine the role of GATA4 in the development of aortic valves in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The GATA4 knockout mouse is embryonically lethal between embryonic day (E) 7.0 and E9.5, and lacks a primitive heart tube28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletions of GATA4 in humans have been associated with congenital heart defects (CHDs)30,31, and a missense variant p.Gly296Ser was identified in a family with atrial and ventricular septal defects32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A mouse model of the p.Gly296Ser missense change is also embryonically lethal by E11.5, but a subset of these mice demonstrate semilunar valve stenosis and small defects of the atrial septum, thought to be resultant from defects in cardiomyocyte proliferation during embryogenesis33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies observed missense variants in GATA4 in patients with septal defects34, CHDs35 and Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF)35, but have not been tested in casecontrol models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequency of GATA4 variants in healthy controls is not clear from these studies and their pathogenicity is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The co-appearance of congenital heart disease and testicular anomalies was found in a family with a GATA4 p.Gly221Arg mutation, thought to disrupt interaction with FOG2 and/or NR5A1, important factors for gonadal development36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GATA5 has 46% homology with GATA4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GATA5 sequence variants have been identified in humans with BAV37,38, and GATA5 knockout mice and zebrafish demonstrate high rates of cardiac abnormalities39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Chromatin conformation at the GATA4 locus', 'We attempted to evaluate the hypothesis that noncoding variants in LD with rs6601627 have an impact on expression of GATA4 during a critical stage of development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is supported by prior evidence that GATA4 dosage has an impact on cardiac formation40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first identified potentially functional variants using RegulomeDB and HaploReg in the region near rs6601627 or variants in high LD (r2 greater than 0.6; ranging from rs112197605 to rs117851931; hg19:chr8:1177495211838697)41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After examining local chromatin states, DNase-hypersensitive regions and transcription factor-binding sites, we identified rs118065347 as a variant likely to be functional because it co-localizes with binding regions for multiple transcription factors (including KAP1, CCNT2, CJUN, C-MYC, GATA2, HDAC2, HMGN3, JUND, MAX, SP1, TAL1, YY1 and ZBTB7A) and is in a known enhancer active in fetal heart, left and right ventricle, right atrium, as well as other tissues42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This variant disrupts the binding motif for a variety of transcription factors including PAX6 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are other candidate functional variants in high LD with the index variant, and molecular experiments will be required to definitively identify the functional variant(s) and the mechanism of action on aortic valve development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We next asked which genes in the locus may interact with this candidate enhancer region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified chromatin interaction loops in K562 and GM12878 cells using chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) and high-throughput sequencing (Hi-C) data (Fig 2)45,46. rs118065347 falls near the edge of a topologically associated domain spanning from hg19:chr8:11250000 to 11825000 defined by Hi-C in both cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variant falls inside a ChIA-PET loop connecting to a region also annotated as an enhancer 3 of GATA4 and C8orf49 and 5 of NEIL2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that this distal region is brought in close proximity to GATA4 and disruption of this region may have direct impact on GATA4 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further molecular experiments will be needed to clarify the gene(s) that has an impact on BAV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Chromatin interactions between associated variants and GATA4.The topological domain region containing associated variants (orange vertical lines), genes (green bars), chromatin interactions by Hi-C (blue loops) and ChIA-PET (purple loops), and chromatin state (outer ring and standard colours from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  68 but of significance here: yellow as enhancers, red as promoters, green as transcribed, blue as CTCF and grey as inactive).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All data are from K562 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  rs3729856 is indicated as falling within a coding exon of GATA4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  rs6601627 was identified as the associated variant to BAV and rs118065347 is the putative functional variant in linkage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  rs11865347 overlaps an annotated enhancer as well as a ChIA-PET loop connecting to a region 3 of GATA4.Full size image', 'Phenotypic characteristics of BAV cases in discovery sample', 'Among our 466 non-syndromic BAV cases, 93 (20%) reported one or more family members also having BAV (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests a high recurrence risk and supports the hypothesis of large-effect variants, but not necessarily Mendelian inheritance47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Majority of BAV cases were recruited from a cardiac surgery clinic at the University of Michigan Frankel Cardiovascular Center (FCVC), where patients are referred to cardiac surgery for aneurysm repair or valve replacement; thus, we found a high proportion of patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA; 83%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at these two loci, we saw no evidence for heterogeneity between BAV cases with or without TAA (Supplementary Table 3) and between BAV cases with or without a positive family history of BAV and/or TAA (Supplementary Table 4), suggesting that BAV probably has an impact on the risk of TAA because of altered haemodynamic blood flow and aortopathy from different mechanisms instead of sharing molecular mechanisms with TAA that has an impact on both aorta and valve tissue47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we did not find evidence for heterogeneity in the association results at GATA4 and BAV subtypes (Supplementary Table 5) and among male and female subjects (Supplementary Table 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Implication of rs6601627 and rs3729856 in other CHDs', 'To investigate whether the two variants at GATA4 that we report are involved in development of other and more severe CHDs, we tested for association with 806 cases of ToF along with 5,029 matched controls and performed association tests for the two variants as described previously48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an additive genetic model, we did not find evidence for association between the noncoding rs6601627 and ToF (MAF=0.03, OR=0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.671.20, P=0.46);

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this study we find variants associated with BAV that reach genome-wide significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified association with a low-frequency noncoding variant 151 kb from GATA4, as well as a common missense variant in GATA4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we cannot yet confirm the mechanism of action of the noncoding variant(s) on chromosome 8 on aortic valve development, chromatin conformation experiments suggest that the region near the associated variants appears to loop and physically interact with regions intronic to GATA4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis could be tested in future functional experiments to investigate whether the noncoding BAV-associated variants identified here affect expression of GATA4 at a critical time in heart development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could possibly disrupt EndoMT, a process important for normal trileaflet aortic valve formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'GATA4, a zinc-finger transcription factor, is one of three major transcription factors, together with Nkx2.5 and TBX5, that are critical for heart differentiation52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although not previously associated with BAV, the GATA4 gene is a plausible biological candidate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The missense GATA4 mutation G296S disrupts the transcriptional cooperativity between GATA4 and TBX5, resulting in abnormal cellular functions related to morphogenetic defects53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many mutations in GATA4 have been previously reported to be found in different kinds of CHDs atrial septal defect32,33,34,54,55,56,57,58, ventricular septal defect32,34,57,59,60 and ToF34,57,61, although mostly tested in family studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the GATA4 mutations have been identified in CHD patients with various ancestries: European32,33,34,58, Asian32,54,55,57,59,60,61 and Native and Hispanic American34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, GATA4 knockout mice are embryonically lethal with heart defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice that are missing GATA5 also develop BAV39, and rare GATA5 mutations have been identified in humans with BAV37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have provided evidence for the complexity of the BAV phenotype, with multiple genetic variants of incomplete penetrance contributing to susceptibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess whether the two variants that we report are specific for BAV or whether they are also implicated in other CHDs, we studied cases of ToF, characterized by several cardiac malformations including an over-riding aorta, pulmonic stenosis, ventricular septal defect and right ventricular hypertrophy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the common coding variant in GATA4 (p.Ser377Gly) was associated with an increased risk of ToF, whereas the low-frequency noncoding variant (rs6601627) was not associated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that the low-frequency noncoding variant disrupts a regulatory element that plays a critical role in regulating GATA4 expression in a precise time of cardiac embryogenesis that may have an impact on the valve more specifically, whereas the common GATA4 missense variant might disrupt GATA4 function more generally and increase the risk of several cardiac malformations, including ToF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequencies of the associated variants at the GATA4 locus (variants with r2 greater than 0.6 in EUR samples of 1000 G) vary among different populations62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, among the noncoding variant rs6601627 and its 115 correlated variants, 108 variants have MAF less_than 0.01 and 73 are monomorphic in East Asians62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Association studies in other populations will be critical for determining whether the association exists in other populations and may be helpful at narrowing the associated interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To investigate the possible role of GATA4 in aortic valve development, we used sgRNA-guided Cas9 to disrupt GATA4 in iPSCs from a healthy human donor with normal tricuspid aortic valves (TAVs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The iPSCs were differentiated into ECs and then induced to mesenchymal cells through EndoMT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated that deficiency of GATA4 impaired the EndoMTs, a critical step in valve formation16 (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that GATA4 is required for aortic valve formation and that disruption of the GATA4 gene, either by noncoding or protein-altering variants, may affect aortic valve formation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
