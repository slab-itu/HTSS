Multiply periodic states and isolated skyrmions in an anisotropic frustrated magnet  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Multiply periodic states appear in a wide variety of physical contexts, such as the RayleighBénard convection, Faraday waves, liquid crystals and skyrmion crystals recently observed in chiral magnets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we study the phase diagram of an anisotropic frustrated magnet which contains five different multiply periodic states including the skyrmion crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We clarify the mechanism for stabilization of these states and discuss how they can be observed in magnetic resonance and electric polarization measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also find stable isolated skyrmions with topological charge 1 and 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their spin structure, interactions and dynamics are more complex than those in chiral magnets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, magnetic resonance in the skyrmion crystal should be accompanied by oscillations of the electric polarization with a frequency depending on the amplitude of the a.c. magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show that skyrmion materials with rich physical properties can be found among frustrated magnets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We formulate rules to help the search.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The magnetic skyrmion is a topological defect with a complex non-coplanar spin structure1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Predicted over 20 years ago2, skyrmions have been recently observed in conducting and insulating helimagnets under an applied magnetic field3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Magnetic skyrmion provides a physical realization of the idea that quantization of physical observables, such as electric and baryon charge, is rooted in topology5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The skyrmion spin texture induces one flux quantum of an effective magnetic field acting on spin-polarized electrons and magnons, which gives rise to topological Hall effects in charge and heat transport, and at the same time sets skyrmions into motion7,8,9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low critical currents needed to manipulate skyrmions opened a new active field of researchskyrmionics, which has a goal of developing skyrmion-based magnetic memory and data processing devices13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'So far, skyrmions have only been found in a handful of materials, all with the non-centrosymmetric cubic B20 structure, in which the relativistic DzyaloshinskiiMoriya interaction turns a collinear spin state into a helical spiral.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under an applied magnetic field, the spiral transforms into the skyrmion crystal (SkX) with a triangular magnetic superlattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further increase of the magnetic field results in a transition to the saturated ferromagnetic (FM) state, in which isolated skyrmions exist as stable topological defects17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Skyrmions are close relatives of magnetic bubbles (cylindrical domains) and the transformation of the helical spiral into SkX is analogous to the field-induced transition between the stripe domain state and the bubble array taking place in thin FM films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the framework of Landau theory, the bubble array is described by three coexisting spin modulations with the wave vectors, q1, q2 and q3, which add to zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This 3q-state is stabilized by an anharmonic interaction between these modulations and the uniform magnetization induced by an applied magnetic field19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In bulk chiral magnets, SkX competes with the conical spiral (CS) state, and an additional order-from-disorder mechanismstabilization by thermal spin fluctuationswas invoked to explain why skyrmions are only observed at elevated temperatures3,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Practical applications of skyrmions crucially depend on finding new classes of skyrmion materials and new microscopic mechanisms for their stabilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, Okubo et al.21 studied numerically an isotropic Heisenberg spin model on a (centrosymmetric) triangular lattice with competing spin interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It shows a spiral ground state, which above a critical magnetic field transforms into the SkX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a state with two coexisting spirals was found in applied magnetic fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These multi-q states are induced by thermal fluctuations and appear at non-zero temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we discuss a mechanism that lends stability to multiply periodic states even at zero temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that a uniaxial magnetic anisotropy strongly affects spin ordering in the frustrated triangular magnet: tuning magnetic field and anisotropy at zero temperature, we find eight different phases, five of which are multi-q states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A large part of the phase diagram is occupied by the SkX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We clarify the nature of the phases found in numerical simulations and present results of analytical studies of instability of spiral states towards additional periodic modulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculate magnetic resonance spectra and magnetically induced electric polarization, which show strong sensitivity to spin ordering and can be used for experimental identification of complex magnetic states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We explore rich physics of isolated skyrmions in frustrated magnets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their monopole and toroidal moment densities oscillate with the distance from the skyrmion centre, which gives rise to alternation of attraction and repulsion between skyrmions, clustering of skyrmions in high magnetic fields and stability of skyrmions with topological charge 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dynamics of skyrmions in frustrated magnets is different from that of chiral magnets because of the additional collective degree of freedomskyrmion helicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coupling between the helicity and the skyrmion centre-of-mass motion leads to a dynamical magnetoelectric effect.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'In conclusion, the simultaneous presence of competing exchange interactions, uniaxial magnetic anisotropy and an applied magnetic field results in a plethora of multi-q states, including the skyrmion crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These complex magnetic states induce electric polarization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soft magnetic modes present in some of these states can be used to control them with an electric field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Physics of isolated skyrmions in frustrated magnets is very rich and more complex than that in chiral magnets due to the additional degrees of freedomvorticity and helicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Skyrmion vorticity equal ±1 or ±2 can be used to store information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Skyrmion helicity interacts with an applied electric field and the coupling between the helicity and centre-of-mass dynamics of skyrmions leads to a characteristic magnetoelectric effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These results show that frustrated magnets can host skyrmions with physical properties not found in conventional non-centrosymmetric chiral magnets, provided they satisfy the following requirements: (1) spiral spin ordering in zero magnetic field resulting from competing exchange interactions; (2) threefold or sixfold symmetry axis, which ensures that the spirals with the three wave vectors, q1, q2 and q3 forming the skyrmion crystal, have the same energy; (3) q1+q2+q3=0; and (4) easy axis magnetic anisotropy axis stabilizing multi-q states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Incommensurate magnetic orders resulting from the competition between NN FM and longer-range anti-FM interactions have been observed in triangular magnets with transition metal ions in edge-sharing octahedra, such as NiGa2S4 with strong third-NN interaction39,40, -NaFeO2 with J2/J11 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  41) and magnetically induced electric polarization P=60 Cm2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  42) as well as in some dihalides, for example, FexNi1xBr2 (refs 43, 44, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Magnetocrystalline anisotropy of dihalides can be tuned by chemical substitutions: NiBr2 has an easy plane anisotropy K/J1=0.1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  46), FexNi1-xBr2 is an easy axis magnet for x greater than 0.1 and FeBr2 is an Ising antiferromagnet with K/J1=1.3 (refs 45, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In -NaFeO2 and dihalides, the wave vectors of three incommensurate modulations do not add to zero because they have an out-of-plane component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A combination of frustrated interactions in the basal plane with a FM coupling between spin layers would help to make q1, q2 and q3 coplanar.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Energy minimization', 'The energy (1) has been minimized using the iterative simulated annealing procedure and a single-step Monte-Carlo dynamics with the Metropolis algorithm (for details, see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We imposed periodic boundary conditions and performed simulations for lattices of different sizes to check the stability of the numerical routine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Dynamical properties', 'The dynamical magnetic susceptibility for all multi-q states and the time evolution of spins in the oscillating magnetic field have been obtained by solving the LLG equation using the fourth-order RungeKutta method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a rather small dimensionless damping parameter, =0.01, to make visible all peaks in the imaginary part of dynamical magnetic susceptibility in Fig 5c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain initial spin configurations, we used the annealing technique supplemented by a further LLG relaxation for h=0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the convergence of the spin configurations was reached, we switched on a periodic magnetic field in the xy-plane to study the spin dynamics (Fig 6) or applied a magnetic field pulse at t=0 and monitored the response to obtain the magnetic susceptibility (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interactions between topological defects', 'The skyrmionskyrmion and skyrmionantiskyrmion interaction potentials shown in Fig 4 were calculated by minimizing the spin energy with the constraint, S =1, imposed at the centres of the topological defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To calculate the helicity dependence of the interactions, we constrained the helicity angle at six sites neighbouring to the skyrmion centre and imposed Sz=0.427 at these sites, which holds for an isolated skyrmion.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
