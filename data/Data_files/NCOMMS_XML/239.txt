Elastic spheres can walk on water  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Incited by public fascination and engineering application, water-skipping of rigid stones and spheres has received considerable study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While these objects can be coaxed to ricochet, elastic spheres demonstrate superior water-skipping ability, but little is known about the effect of large material compliance on water impact physics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that upon water impact, very compliant spheres naturally assume a disk-like geometry and dynamic orientation that are favourable for water-skipping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments and numerical modelling reveal that the initial spherical shape evolves as elastic waves propagate through the material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the skipping dynamics are governed by the wave propagation speed and by the ratio of material shear modulus to hydrodynamic pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With these insights, we explain why softer spheres skip more easily than stiffer ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results advance understanding of fluid-elastic body interaction during water impact, which could benefit inflatable craft modelling and, more playfully, design of elastic aquatic toys.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Water-skipping has been studied for centuries with diverse motivations including: the ancient art of stone skipping14; naval application510; water-surface craft11,12; and biological13,14 and biomimetic15 water-walking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While water ricochet of rigid objects has been well studied, the physics underlying the water impact of highly deformable elastic solids remains poorly understood12,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compliant bodies such as inflatable boats12 and elastic aquatic toys18,19 exhibit behaviour that is not readily explained within the traditional framework for rigid objects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For such elastic bodies, an understanding of the coupling between the material response and hydrodynamic loading is essential in unravelling the overall dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An object obliquely impacting a water surface with sufficient inertia will carve a cavity on the airwater interface20 and experience a pressure-driven hydrodynamic force dependent on object velocity, geometry and orientation4,8,21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Water-skipping occurs when the upward vertical component of this force is large enough to lift the object off the water surface8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies born from naval applications ranging from cannonball skipping tactics5,8 to the dam-busting Wallis bomb10 have revealed an upper bound on the impact angle o (angle between the free-surface and object velocity vector) below which rigid spheres will skip on water7,8,10,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disk-shaped stones are more amenable to skipping, particularly if one orients the stone at just the right angle2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further research has revealed more details regarding the oblique water impact of these and other canonical rigid body geometries23,24,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The referenced ricochet events are dominated by inertia, with negligible contributions from viscous and surface tension forces4,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regime, the physics of water-skipping also generalize to the water-walking ability of basilisk lizards13,14 and some birds14,27, and to surface craft slamming11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this work, we investigate the skipping of deformable elastic solid spheres on water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe that elastic spheres can skip for impact angles nearly three times larger than predicted for rigid spheres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments and numerical modelling show that the spheres deform throughout impact in response to elastic waves propagating in the material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some cases these elastic waves actually interact with the airwater interface to create nested cavities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determine how the deformed geometry scales with material properties and initial impact kinematics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using an analytical model to relate deformation to the hydrodynamic lift force, we identify the mechanisms by which elastic spheres skip so readily on water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we compute the normal and tangential restitution coefficients and find, surprisingly, that they display analogous behaviour to liquid droplets bouncing on inclined liquid films28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our findings about single impact events, we explain how elastic spheres are able to achieve multiple successive skips on water.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Perhaps the most mesmerizing manifestation of elastic sphere water impact is continual skipping across water (Supplementary Movie 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that our physical description of a single skip generalizes to multiple skip events, we predict the placement of successive impacts on the regime diagram (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An experimental investigation using isolated water tanks validates the predictions and shows the sphere traversing through the vibration modes with each impact (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As to how repeated skipping is sustained over very long skipping trajectories (Supplementary Movie 3), we gain insight from the behaviour of the restitution coefficients (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, t is consistently larger than n, which causes o to decrease and thus become more favourable with each skip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the restitution coefficients actually become larger as  decreases, until the sphere enters the mode 1 skipping and transitional regimes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, one could say it becomes easier to skip with every skip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 8: An elastic sphere experiences several modes in a multiple skip event.These image sequences correspond to the four successive experimental impacts shown as purple symbols in Figs 6 and 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The first skip displays mode 1+ behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) The impact angle o is reduced for the second skip, which is in the mode 2 regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) The third impact (mode 1 skipping) occurs with approximately the same value of o, but leads to reduced  and .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) The last skip shows mode 1 transitional behaviour, and results in such small values of the restitution coefficients that the ensuing impact ends in water entry (not shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All times are normalized by the wave time computed from the mode 1 transitional skip (d).Full size image', 'While toy elastic balls may bestow upon the casual sportsman the ability to break the world stone skipping record (88 skips by K. Steiner, Guinness World Records), we believe the physics underlying the elastic sphere impact are common to the large deformation hydroelastic response of surface-riding and skipping compliant bodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Models of these structures, such as inflatable boats, typically ignore extreme elastic deformation even though it is known to affect drag, stability and slamming loads12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanisms of form and force augmentation, as well as the secondary vibration-induced fluid interactions that we have revealed, can be exploited for functional advantage and incorporated into higher-fidelity hydroelastic models.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Sphere fabrication and material properties', 'In order to control material properties, custom elastomeric spheres were fabricated from a high performance platinum-cure silicone rubber called Dragon Skin produced by Smooth-On, Inc., which consists of two liquid constituent parts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once the two constituents are mixed, the material sets without requiring heat treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shear modulus was varied by adding a silicone thinner to the mixture before setting, which reduces the material shear modulus by decreasing the polymer cross-linking density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sphere materials with three different shear moduli were fabricated by adding 0, 1/3 and 1/2 parts thinner by mass ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before setting, the liquid mixture was placed in a vacuum chamber to remove any entrained air.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For our experiments, spheres were fabricated by curing the liquid mixture in smooth, machined aluminium moulds to produce spheres with three different radii: 20.1±0.8 mm; 26.2±0.8 mm; and 48.8±0.9 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A rigid sphere with R=25.8±1 mm was fabricated from Nylon DuraForm PA using selective laser sintering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The uncertainty on each sphere radius represents the 95% confidence interval based on several independent measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A thin Lycra casing was loosely fitted around each sphere in order to prevent undesired particles from adhering to the surface and to reduce the friction between the sphere and the launching mechanism from which it was fired.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The silicone rubber was so compliant that traditional uniaxial dogbone testing on our Instron machine was not feasible as the forces generated were too small to be reliably measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome this, we performed a test in which the spheres were compressed on the Instron to generate a quasi-static force-displacement curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This test set-up was then numerically modelled in Abaqus with the sphere material described by a neo-Hookean hyperelastic constitutive model, parameterized by the shear modulus G

.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then varied G to find the value that produced the best fit between the numerically simulated and experimentally measured force-displacement curves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elastomeric spheres used in our experiments had shear moduli of 97.2, 28.5 and 12.3 kPa corresponding to 0, 1/3 and 1/2 parts thinner, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the manufacturer of the rigid sphere (3D SystemsQuickparts Solutions), the elastic modulus of the selective laser sintering Nylon DuraForm PA material is 1.59 × 106 kPa, whichassuming a Poissons ratio of 0.4gives a shear modulus of G=5.66 × 105 kPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Sphere skipping experiments and data processing', 'Spheres were launched at the water surface from a variable-angle, pressure-driven cannon consisting of a pressure chamber for compressed air, a sliding cylindrical piston and interchangeable barrels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sliding the cylindrical piston allowed air to flow from the pressure chamber into the barrel, thus forcing the sphere to accelerate out of the barrel and strike the water surface with impact speed Uo and angle o.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Impact events were illuminated with diffuse white back lighting and filmed with either NAC GX-3 or Photron SA3 high-speed cameras acquiring at 1,0002,000 frames per second (fps).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The impact speed Uo and angle o were measured from images of the sphere before water impact using a cross-correlation algorithm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean uncertainties on Uo and o are ±1.09 m s1 and ±1.75°, respectively (computed at 95% confidence level).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same algorithm was used to measure the exit speed and angle of the sphere after lifting off the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the rigid body rotation of the sphere was estimated after skipping by tracking reference markers on the exterior of the Lycra casing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was found for mode 1 skip types that the rotational kinetic energy was typically  less_than 8% of the translational kinetic energy after water exit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, for these impacts the wave time tw was typically  less_than 30% of the period of rigid body rotation measured after skipping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The collision time tc, wave time tw and vibration mode classification were all determined from manual inspection of the high-speed images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The minimum skipping speed Umin was found experimentally by performing successive experiments with identical conditions but with increasing speed until the sphere skipped.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Abaqus numerical model', 'Details of the Abaqus numerical model of the elastic sphere impact are contained in reference30; clarifications relevant for the present work are summarized here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finite-element model uses the built in coupled eulerlagrange functionality of Abaqus/Explicit, which couples the contact region between the Lagrangian (sphere) and Eulerian (fluid) domains using a penalty method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct numerical simulation of the compressible NavierStokes equations is performed in the Eulerian domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the solid, conservation of momentum is solved with an incompressible neo-Hookean constitutive model describing the sphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all numerical model results presented herein, the mesh consists of eight-noded Eulerian hexahedral elements with spatial resolution of 3 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sphere radius R, density s and shear modulus G, as well as the impact speed Uo and angle o were set to match experimental values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three-dimensional computational domain consists of a water tank (length=30 R, depth=6.5 R) with a symmetry plane coinciding with the plane of motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the numerical results presented in Fig 4a, Umin is the average of the impact speeds for a skipping case and the non-skipping case with the nearest Uo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The numerical marker error bars reported in Fig 4a represent ±1/2 of the speed difference between the two cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Analytical model of elastic sphere skipping', 'An approximate analytical approach to modelling the impact between a compliant elastomeric sphere and a fluid surface is outlined (for a complete derivation, see Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we describe the sphere deformation and motion using a set of reduced, scalar generalized coordinates that are governed by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We begin by defining a fixed Cartesian coordinate system {e1, e2, e3} (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assume the sphere moves only in the e1e2 plane and undergoes no rigid body rotation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sphere deformation is first described by a rigid displacement d that describes the motion of the COM in terms of the generalized coordinates d1, d2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is followed by a volume preserving stretch V that deforms the sphere into an ellipsoid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coordinates of a material particle before deformation (x) and after deformation (y) are related by y=d+Vx.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The velocity and acceleration fields follow as

#@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Next, we propose an approximate model for the hydrodynamic forcing on the sphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is beyond the scope of this work to derive an analytical expression for the dynamic pressure distribution over the wetted sphere surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, our goal is to generate a simplified model that captures the first-order sphere motion and deformation during an oblique water impact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the hydrodynamic force F is computed using equation 1, which follows from work on skipping stones4 by considering the deformed sphere to be a circular disk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The disk radius is described by an equivalent principal stretch eq computed by equating the area of the equivalent circular disk with the cross-sectional area of the deformed sphere in
