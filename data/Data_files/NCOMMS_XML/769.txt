Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Electron pairing in the vast majority of superconductors follows the Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer (BCS) theory of superconductivity1, which describes the condensation of electron pairs with opposite spins in a singlet state with an isotropic order parameter (s-wave symmetry).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Superconductivity in a number of compounds is predicted to be unconventional in that the electrons pair in a triplet state with parallel spins and anisotropic p-wave symmetry, most notably in UPt3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2) and Sr2RuO4 (SRO)3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the investigation of compounds that are thought to be bulk p-wave superconductors has been intensive over the past two decades5,6 there is still much debate over the nature of the superconductivity in these compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theoretically, a p-wave superconducting state is highly sensitive to electron scattering which has meant that, with exception to ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7, all experiments to date on potential p-wave superconductors have focused on single-crystal samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A further complication relates to the typically low transition temperature (Tc) of these superconductors (SRO has a Tc below 1.5 K)5, which, in conjunction with the requirement of extreme purity, makes the fabrication of p-wave devices challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, tunnelling studies8,9 have suggested that p-wave superconductivity can emerge on the surface of topological insulators coupled to s-wave superconductors, but the manipulation of these states for device applications is still an open issue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Triplet (s-wave) states have also been reported in spectroscopic experiments involving magnetically inhomogeneous s-wave superconductor/ferromagnet hybrids10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Electrons in single-layer graphene (SLG) are predicted to condense to a superconducting state, either intrinsically by doping13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20 or by placing SLG on a superconductor with a BCS or a non-BCS pairing symmetry21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting symmetry depends on the position of the Fermi energy (EF) with respect to the Dirac point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, for EF shifts up to 1 eV, a p-wave15,16 state is predicted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the doping approaches the van Hove singularity (EF3 eV; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19), a singlet chiral d-wave and triplet f-wave symmetry are also predicted17,20, whereas ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18 found dominant chiral d-wave superconductivity near van Hove doping and argued that weak coupling superconductivity for doping levels between half-filling and the van Hove density is of KohnLuttinger type and likely to be f-wave pairing for disconnected Fermi pockets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reference 1616 predicted that a non-chiral p-wave symmetry is favoured for small nearest-neighbour repulsion ( less_than 1.1 eV), small onsite interaction U (8.4 eV) or large doping (above 10%), whereas the chiral p-wave state occurs as U or are increased or the doping level diminishes with respect to the aforementioned values (in pure SLG at half-filling U is 9.3 eV and is 5.5 eV; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At low density (20%) and including next-nearest neighbour hopping, a chiral p-wave state can emerge15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the possibility of spin-triplet s-wave pairing has been considered in bilayer graphene23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although intrinsic superconductivity in SLG has not been observed24, superconductivity has been induced by doping SLG with Li adatoms25, intercalating SLG sheets with Ca (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26) or by placing SLG on a superconductor27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the latter case, the intrinsic pairing potential for p- or chiral d-wave superconductivity can be enhanced theoretically21,22 to the point that a full transition to a superconducting state is triggered and manifested in the SLG superconducting density of states (DoS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Achieving p-wave or chiral d-wave superconductivity in SLG via a proximity effect would enable the fabrication of devices and allow the full investigation of how these symmetry states can be utilized in cryogenic technology related to spin transport with low dissipation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, it would be attractive for applications to achieve p-wave superconductivity in SLG above 4.2 K.', 'The standard technique to probe electron pair symmetry involves measuring the voltage (V) bias dependence of the non-linear differential conductance (dI/dVV) near the superconducting gap edge, which is proportional to the quasiparticle DoS in the tunnelling limit28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a conventional superconductor with s-wave (zero spin) pairing, dI/dV diminishes below the gap edge in the tunnelling limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, unconventional p- and chiral d-wave symmetries result in zero-energy quasiparticle excitations and surface bound states29, which manifest themselves in the tunnelling spectra as subgap structures in the DoS, including V-shaped gaps or strong zero-bias conductance peaks (ZBCPs)30,31,32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Tonnoir et al.27 locally probed the superconducting DoS in SLG on the s-wave superconductor Re by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They inferred induced superconductivity in SLG from the observation of a gapped DoS that matched the underlying layer of Re (s-wave).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of a subgap structure and, therefore, unconventional superconductivity, may indicate a modification of the SLG band structure34,35 due to the high carrier density of Re (ne4.5 × 1023 cm3) resulting in significant charge transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An alternative approach to ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27 is to place SLG on an oxide cuprate superconductor as the lower carrier concentrations of these materials (1020 cm3;

theory should be a mixture of V-shaped gaps (occurring for c-axis tunnelling), ZBCPs or split peaks (occurring for tunnelling from the ab-plane).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The surface roughness of the PCCO will also expose different crystal orientations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the spectroscopic features on SLG/PPCO will be related to a combination of PCCO crystal structure and surface roughness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 4 also shows that the V-shaped DoS calculated for SLG/PCCO does not reach zero, which is consistent with our experimental observations (Fig 2a and Supplementary Fig 3), but also with previous tunnelling experiments on PCCO even at temperatures much lower (1.8 K) than our measurement set-up of 4.2 K (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Local variations in the Z parameter can determine the amplitude of subgap features (ZBCPs or split peaks) and the depth of V-shaped gaps, as shown in Supplementary Fig 11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Z values can be changed intentionally by varying the set current and set bias-voltage values (before disabling the feedback loop and acquiring a dI/dV spectrum), care was taken to work with low set currents (0.10.3 nA) and bias voltages just above the gap region (810 mV), yielding junction resistances 5 × 107 , much larger than the quantum resistance h e2 (25.8 k) and thus well within the tunnelling regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regime, the overall spectral features (ZBCPs, split ZBCPs or V-shaped gaps) measured at a specific location on SLG/PCCO do not change upon varying the current and voltage set values, ruling out the possibility that these are related to single-electron tunnelling effects60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted, however, that the underlying orientation of the PCCO film and the degree of local PCCO-SLG electrical connectivity can also influence the tip-SLG distance and hence the Z value (for a given current-bias setting).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We exclude that variations in the spectral features are due to defects in SLG, since STM images do not reveal any structural inhomogeneity in SLG and no damage after transfer (consistent with the Raman analysis), and, in particular, no defects are observed in regions where the spectra are acquired.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, spectral anomalies disappear in the normal state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, we point out that in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  61 subgap features in the DoS including ZBCPs and split zero-bias peaks could be obtained via Andreev bound states, formed under a small Pb slab coupled to SLG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a system effectively constituted a quantum dot coupled to superconducting leads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the local and random doping inhomogeneities in SLG on PCCO are not likely to induce well-defined quantum dots, where confinement would be further suppressed by Klein tunnelling, and thus cannot account for the subgap features seen in our STM data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although our analysis is consistent with the triggering of an unconventional p-wave order parameter in SLG, we cannot determine the exact symmetry of the p-wave state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the DoS spectra look qualitatively different from those reported for a chiral spin-triplet p-wave state in a topological superconductor8,9, we believe our results to be consistent with an effective p-wave order parameter emerging at the Dirac points in SLG as a result of Andreev bound states induced by the proximity coupling with the d-wave pairing potential in PCCO (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results therefore suggest the exciting possibility of creating p-wave superconducting devices on SLG in which quantum coherent electron states, gate tunability and spin/charge could be addressed in the superconducting state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Measurements of quasiparticle interference modulations63 could provide further insights into the pairing symmetry induced in SLG on PCCO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that the superconducting pairing of the p-wave state in our system is spin-singlet, which means that the Andreev bound states providing the zero-energy peak seen in the STM data can be interpreted as an odd-frequency spin-singlet odd-parity state64,65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interfacial spinorbit coupling due to broken inversion symmetry at the PCCO/SLG interface may also in principle induce a triplet component in the system66; however, the induction of a triplet component would necessary require significant spinorbit coupling at the SLG/PCCO interface, unlikely here due to the low atomic numbers of the elements in PCCO and graphene.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'PCCO film growth', 'A 200-nm-thick PCCO film is grown by pulsed laser deposition on (001) STO using a stoichiometric target fabricated by a solid-state reaction method from high purity Pr6O11 (99.9% purity), CeO2 (99.9% purity) and CuO (99.99% purity) powders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The growth is carried out at 820 °C by firing a Lambda Physik KrF excimer laser (=248 nm) on a rotating PCCO target with a pulse rate of 7 Hz and energy density of 1.5 J cm2, after introducing 230 mTorr of N2O in a ultra-high vacuum chamber (base pressure of 108 mbar).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain an optimal superconducting transition (20.5 K; Supplementary Fig 1a), the PCCO films are annealed in situ67 by evacuating the chamber immediately after growth and holding the substrate at 720 °C for 4 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Films are then cooled to room temperature in a vacuum of 105 mbar within 2.5 h.', 'Growth and transfer of SLG on PCCO', 'SLG is grown by CVD on a 35-m-thick Cu foil loaded into a hot wall tube furnace, which is subsequently evacuated to a pressure 1 mTorr (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Cu foil is annealed in a hydrogen atmosphere (H2, 20 sccm) at 1,000 °C for 30 min to reduce the Cu oxide component and to increase the grain size41,68.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SLG growth is then initiated by adding 5 sccm CH4 to the H2 flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 30 min, the substrate is cooled in vacuum (1 mTorr) to room temperature and then unloaded from the reactor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'CVD is chosen over micromechanical exfoliation42,69 so as to cover large areas (5 × 5 mm2) of PCCO with SLG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is beneficial for a number of reasons: the localization and alignment of the sample is simplified (the scan size of our STM is limited to 1 × 1 m2, and the optical contrast of SLG on PCCO does not allow for an easy identification of SLG); the large area allows us to fabricate large arrays of metallic islands (covering 2 × 2 mm2 of the sample surface); the measurements benefit from larger statistics and the presence of local defects can be avoided, thus not disturbing tunnelling-current measurements, which only require nm-size areas to be performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The CVD-grown SLG is then transferred onto 200-nm-thick epitaxial films of electron-doped PCCO on (001) STO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do so, a 500-nm-thick layer of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is spin coated onto the SLG/Cu sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PMMA/SLG/Cu stack is subsequently immersed in an aqueous solution of ammonium persulfate (APS) to etch the Cu foil41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PMMA/SLG stack is then placed in de-ionized water to rinse off acid residuals and fished off the de-ionized bath using the PCCO substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the PMMA/SLG/PCCO sample is dried at room temperature and placed in acetone to remove the PMMA layer, leaving SLG on PCCO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Raman measurements', 'Raman spectroscopy is used to investigate the quality and uniformity of the as-grown SLG on Cu as well as to quantify the presence of defects and evaluate doping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Raman spectra are recorded at 514.5 nm using a Renishaw InVia spectrometer equipped with a Leica DM LM microscope and a × 100 objective (numerical aperture NA=0.85).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions the laser spot size is 1 m.
