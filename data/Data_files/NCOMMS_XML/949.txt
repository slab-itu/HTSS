Observation of stable Néel skyrmions in cobalt/palladium multilayers with Lorentz transmission electron microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Néel skyrmions are of high interest due to their potential applications in a variety of spintronic devices, currently accessible in ultrathin heavy metal/ferromagnetic bilayers and multilayers with a strong DzyaloshinskiiMoriya interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report on the direct imaging of chiral spin structures including skyrmions in an exchange-coupled cobalt/palladium multilayer at room temperature with Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, a high-resolution technique previously suggested to exhibit no Néel skyrmion contrast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phase retrieval methods allow us to map the internal spin structure of the skyrmion core, identifying a 25 nm central region of uniform magnetization followed by a larger region characterized by rotation from in- to out-of-plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The formation and resolution of the internal spin structure of room temperature skyrmions without a stabilizing out-of-plane field in thick magnetic multilayers opens up a new set of tools and materials to study the physics and device applications associated with chiral ordering and skyrmions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Magnetic skyrmions are topologically non-trivial chiral spin textures present in systems with a strong DzyaloshinskiiMoriya interaction (DMI) and a spatial extent of only tens to a few hundred nanometres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discovery of skyrmions in bulk non-centrosymmetric magnets and thin films has led to the proposal of a variety of skyrmionic devices, in which the skyrmion is used as the basic information carrier in next-generation logic and memory devices1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thin film heavy metal/ferromagnetic (HM/FM) bi- and multilayers have emerged as an ideal candidate for the development of such devices due to their tunability through a variation of the constituent components and relative layer thicknesses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, the spin Hall physics associated with the heavy metal underlayer allows for straightforward manipulation of the local magnetic state2,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these systems, strong interfacial spinorbit coupling results in a large interfacial DMI (iDMI), characterized by the DMI constant, D. The iDMI acts as an effective symmetry breaking in-plane field, HDMI, which can stabilize Néel walls of a fixed chirality12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For films that satisfy the condition , where Hk is the anisotropy field, a stable Néel skyrmion can form13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Néel skyrmions are characterized by the magnetization rotating from one out-of-plane direction to the other radially from the skyrmion centre, where the sense of rotation is set by the skyrmion chirality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Néel skyrmions have been experimentally observed at room temperature in a variety of the aforementioned bilayers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These skyrmions have been limited to sizes well over 100 nm, making them ill-suited for practical applications and, at these length scales, their claim as skyrmions is still controversial10,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the total magnetic thickness in these systems is below 1.5 nm, posing challenges for thermal stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, Moreau-Luchaire et al.11 demonstrated sub-100 nm magnetic skyrmions in dipolar coupled Pt/Co/Ir multilayers, in which the assymetric Pt and Ir layers result in an enhanced HDMI strong enough to generate skyrmions in films as thick as 6.6 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to date, no skyrmions have been observed in thick ferromagnetic multilayers in which the disperate magnetic layers are exchange coupled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, previous Néel skyrmion observations required either the presence of an out-of-plane bias field provided by either an external field or through dipole coupling to an adjacent ferromagnetic layer,10,11,15,16,17 or careful tuning of a geometric confining potential to stabilize the skyrmion structure18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cobalt/palladium (Co/Pd) is a prototypical exchange coupled multilayer, which shows strong spinorbit coupling effects in the bulk as evidenced by the large spinorbit torque (SOT) efficiencies in nanowire geometries19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in HM/FM/HM systems, the contributions to the DMI from top and bottom interfaces is predicted to cancel out for identical HM layers11,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this work, we have imaged the formation of room temperature Néel skyrmions in a symmetric 6.7-nm-thick Co/Pd multilayer with Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (L-TEM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the size of the observed skyrmions is significantly smaller than previously reported systems in which non-multilayer films are used15,16,23, and of nearly identical extent as those measured in Ir/Co/Pt multilayers11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following nucleation with an external magnetic field, the observed skyrmions persist even after removal of the external field and without geometric confinement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the film studied in this work is unique in that skyrmions are observed in an exchange-coupled system with a large magnetic volume despite utilizing symmetric interfaces, that is, Pd at both top and bottom interfaces for each layer as well as Pt layers at both outer surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work opens up a new set tools in which skyrmions can be designed, tuned and studied for use in possible spintronic devices.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Imaging Néel skyrmions with L-TEM', 'In comparison with other techniques such as Kerr microscopy and X-ray methods, which are limited by spatial resolution, L-TEM affords the advantage of a spatial resolution below 5 nm24,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the scattering cross-section for electrons is significantly larger than that of X-rays27, allowing for improvements in signal contrast in the ultrathin films which are typical of skyrmion systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contrast formed in L-TEM is traditionally explained as the result of the deflection of the electron beam due to an in-plane magnetic field, which leads to either increased or decreased contrast at a region of varying magnetization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Néel-type domain boundaries in materials with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, the Lorentz deflection follows the length of the wall, and suggests that no magnetic contrast is observed when the film is normal to the beam propagation direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the full electron-wave treatment of the electron beam within the small defocus limit28,29, the contrast in L-TEM resulting from the underlying magnetic structure is expressed by the curl of the magnetization along the beam propagation axis (), given by , where I(r, ) is the normalized intensity,  the defocus, e the electron charge, 0 the vacuum permeability,  is the electron wavelength, h Plancks constant, t the film thickness and M(r) the film magnetization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The valid defocus range is determined by the region which the contrast transfer function is linear with defocus, and is dependent on a variety of microscope specific parameters such as beam divergence angle29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a Néel skyrmion, the curl of the magnetization lies completely in the plane of the sample (Fig 1ad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, with zero sample tilt, a Néel skyrmion produces no contrast,10 and therefore, while used extensively in the imaging of Bloch skyrmions4,5,30, L-TEM has not been utilized to observe Néel skyrmions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, by tilting the sample with respect to the beam direction, a projection of the curl on the beam axis proportional to the degree of tilt can be obtained, enabling skyrmion contrast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This contrast corresponds to the projection of the magnetization that is directed out of the sample plane orthogonal to the beam direction.

L-TEM31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an input, a micromagnetically simulated Néel skyrmion of radius nominally 100 nm was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is apparent from the magnetization curl that the observed signal asymmetry is independent of the direction by which the magnetization rotates from the bulk state to the skyrmion centre; therefore, the chirality itself cannot be determined unless the sign of the DMI is known a priori.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the tilted geometry, L-TEM is sensitive to the Néel skyrmion polarity, defined as +1 when the magnetization at the skyrmion centre points up with respect to the film, and 1 when pointing down.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in contrast to the signal obtained for a Bloch skyrmion, in which case L-TEM is sensitive to the helicity (that is, the sense of rotation of the skyrmion magnetization from the +z to z direction), and not the polarity33,34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contrast asymmetry of the Néel skyrmion reverses depending on the sign of the tilt, and disappears for zero tilt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a given tilt angle, the largest contrast asymmetry occurs where the in-plane component of the magnetization curl is perpendicular to the tilt axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the distance between the point of minimum and maximum intensity represents the width of the projected skyrmion in the plane normal to the beam propagation direction.

well as map its internal spin structure, we have performed a phase reconstruction utilizing the differential transport-of-intensity (D-TIE) method38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method relates the change in phase of the electron beam due to the AharonovBohm effect to the difference in contrast between two magnetic states.25,39 We utilize an reference state of a saturated film along the +z direction, and a final state of an isolated Néel skyrmion with a polarity of 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both images were acquired with a tilt of 30° to the x axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of D-TIE in this case has the primary advantage of allowing for the removal of the electrostatic contribution to the TIE signal from the film and substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, a Néel skyrmion would appear as a dipole-like structure in D-TIE, with the projection of the magnetic induction appearing normal to the tilt axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the total difference between the final and reference state also includes stray fields originating from the skyrmion core, as diagrammatically shown in Fig 4a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tilting the sample results in a projection of the magnetic structure and associated stray field into the plane normal to the beam direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the phase reconstruction should show two flux closure loops in addition to a uniformly magnetized core region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The D-TIE reconstruction exhibits this structure, and confirms the presence and expected Néel skyrmion, as shown in Fig 4be.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the phase reconstruction, we find the central core in which the spin structure is nearly uniform along the +z direction extends nominally 25 nm, with the total extent of the skyrmion, inclusive of magnetization rotation, to be 90 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that, due to small thickness of these films, and hence weak magnetic signal, large defocus values were necessary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large defocus values can artificially increase the apparent skyrmion size due to delocalization effects29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for the experimental conditions used here, this effect is expected to be minimal40,41.

 While the seeded state corresponding to a D greater than 0 skyrmion does not change, the D less_than 0 skyrmion is unstable and transforms into a state identical to that of the initialized D greater than 0 skyrmion (Supplementary Fig 1 and Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This coupled with the fact that skyrmions are stable only above a critical value of D indicates that these structures

contributions between the top and bottom Pd layers for each Co layer should cancel11,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in Co/Pd multilayers, the large lattice mismatch between Co and Pd results in a lattice distortion that is 30% larger at the Co/Pd interface compared to the Pd/Co interface43, breaking the symmetry of the two interfaces and providing a mechanism for a non-zero DMI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

(metal layers) and r.f.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (oxide layers) magnetron sputtering in an argon environment, with a base pressure of 7 × 109 torr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TEM measurements were performed at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, using both a specially designed JEOL 2100F-LM and a JEOL ARM 200F microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zero-field imaging was performed in the JEOL 2100F-LM, which has a residual out-of-plane field in the specimen area of  less_than 0.4 mT and a spherical aberration coefficient, Cs, of 109 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reversal experiments were carried out in the JEOL ARM 200F, in which the out-of-plane magnetic field was tuned by varying the strength of the microscopes objective lens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnetic field at a given objective lens current was determined by mounting a Hall probe onto a TEM sample holder and measuring the Hall signal as the objective lens current was varied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Principal component analysis was used to smooth the EELS line profiles with a SavitzkyGolay filter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Image simulations', 'Simulated Lorentz images are taken from micromagnetically simulated skyrmion states in a 2 m disc with a 4.2 nm thickness using object-oriented micromagnetic framework with a cell size of 2 nm × 2 nm × 4.2 nm cell, D=2.0 mJ m2, Ku,eff=0.24 MJ m3, A=10 pJ m1 and Ms=880 kA m1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The skyrmion was used as input for Lorentz image simulations using micromagnetic analysis to Lorentz TEM simulation, with input parameters taken from the specs of the JEOL 2100F-LM used in this work and a defocus of 1 mm, at tilt angles varying from 30° to 30° (Supplementary Movie 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Micromagnetic simulations to obtain an estimate of D were performed using the experimentally determined Ms and Ku,eff.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While D and A were varied over a range of values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A cell size equal to 2 nm × 2 nm × 6.7 nm and a damping of =0.5 were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More details, including how variations in anisotropy can affect the estimate of D, can be found in Supplementary Notes 4 and 5, as well as in Supplementary Fig 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'The data of this study can be obtained from the corresponding authors on request.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
