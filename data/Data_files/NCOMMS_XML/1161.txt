Attenuation of RNA polymerase II pausing mitigates BRCA1-associated R-loop accumulation and tumorigenesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Most BRCA1-associated breast tumours are basal-like yet originate from luminal progenitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BRCA1 is best known for its functions in double-strand break repair and resolution of DNA replication stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is unclear whether loss of these ubiquitously important functions fully explains the cell lineage-specific tumorigenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro studies implicate BRCA1 in elimination of R-loops, DNA-RNA hybrid structures involved in transcription and genetic instability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that R-loops accumulate preferentially in breast luminal epithelial cells, not in basal epithelial or stromal cells, of BRCA1 mutation carriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, R-loops are enriched at the 5 end of those genes with promoter-proximal RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pausing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic ablation of Cobra1, which encodes a Pol II-pausing and BRCA1-binding protein, ameliorates R-loop accumulation and reduces tumorigenesis in Brca1-knockout mouse mammary epithelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our studies show that Pol II pausing is an important contributor to BRCA1-associated R-loop accumulation and breast cancer development.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Germ-line BRCA1 mutations are associated with significantly increased breast cancer incidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Breast epithelium consists of two layers: an inner layer of luminal progenitors and mature luminal cells, and a basal layer consisting of mammary stem cells and differentiated myoepithelial cells1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although most BRCA1-associated breast tumours are basal-like, they originate from luminal progenitor cells2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike their counterparts from non-carriers, luminal progenitor cells from BRCA1 mutation carriers exhibit hormone-independent proliferation2 and attenuation of gene expression associated with luminal differentiation4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recent studies indicate that the RANKRANKL axis that drives paracrine actions in luminal homeostasis is aberrantly activated in BRCA1 mutation carriers5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the molecular level, BRCA1 is best known for its roles in supporting homologous recombination (HR)-based double-strand break repair7,8,9 and suppressing DNA replication stress10,11,12,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is not known whether loss of these functions, which are ubiquitously important to all proliferating cells, is sufficient to account for cell lineage-specific tumorigenesis in breast epithelium of women carrying BRCA1 mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to HR repair and DNA replication stress, BRCA1 is implicated in transcriptional regulation7,16 and chromatin reorganization17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent cell-line studies indicate that BRCA1 also has a role in elimination of R-loops, transcriptional by-products that influence gene regulation and genomic integrity19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recently found HR repair-independent functional antagonism between BRCA1 and cofactor of BRCA1 (COBRA1)22 during mouse mammary gland development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  COBRA1, also known as NELFB, is a BRCA1-binding protein and an integral subunit of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-pausing, negative elongation factor (NELF)17,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with a functional role of BRCA1 in transcription, genome-wide studies found preferential association of BRCA1 with transcription start sites (TSS) in the human genome25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, whether a role of BRCA1 in transcription directly contributes to BRCA1-associated tumorigenesis remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we survey genome-wide R-loop dynamics in different breast cell types from BRCA1 mutation carriers and non-carriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that BRCA1 mutation-associated R-loops preferentially accumulate in luminal epithelial cells and at genomic loci with paused Pol II.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using mouse genetic models, we further show that attenuation of Pol II pausing reduces incidence of Brca1-associated mouse mammary tumour incidence in a DNA repair-independent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work thus uncovers a previously unappreciated functional antagonism between BRCA1 and Pol II pausing in breast tumorigenesis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'R-loops in breast tissue of BRCA1 mutation carriers', 'To ascertain clinical relevance of transcription-related BRCA1 functions, we first used immunofluorescence (IF) staining to compare R-loop intensity in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE), cancer-free breast tissue from BRCA1 mutation-carrying women versus non-carriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that R-loop intensity in BRCA1 mutation carriers (B1, n=55) was significantly higher than that in non-carriers (NC, n=36, P less_than 0.001 by two-tailed t-test, Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pretreatment of the FFPE samples with RNase H, which degrades RNA in R-loops, significantly reduced the IF staining in BRCA1 mutation carriers (Fig 1a), thus corroborating specificity of the IF signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A cohort of BRCA2 mutation carriers exhibited similar increase in R-loop intensity as compared to non-carriers, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the vast majority of luminal epithelial cells in a typical BRCA1 mutation carrier sample exhibited elevated R-loop staining, whereas basal epithelial and stromal cells from the same BRCA1 mutant specimen did not display higher intensity than their counterparts in non-carriers (Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This luminal cell-specific R-loop accumulation is reminiscent of the lineage-specific cell of origin for BRCA1-associated breast tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: BRCA1 mutation-associated R-loop accumulates preferentially in luminal breast epithelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Low and high (inlet) magnification images of R-loop staining in samples from non-carriers and BRCA1 mutation carriers, with and without pretreatment of RNase H.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Combined studies of clinical samples, cell culture and genetically engineered mouse models lead us to the conclusion that NELF-mediated Pol II pausing is an important source of R-loop accumulation in BRCA1-deficient mammary epithelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, attenuation of Pol II pausing can mitigate R-loop accumulation and reduce incidence of mammary tumour development due to BRCA1 deficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is conceivable that nascent transcripts produced by promoter-proximally paused Pol II are prone to R-loop formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that, through its direct association with COBRA1 and perhaps other transcription factors, BRCA1 is brought to genes with NELF-dependent Pol II pausing to ameliorate promoter-proximal R-loop accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduced BRCA1 expression and/or activity, while not affecting NELF-dependent Pol II pausing per se, can lead to excessive elevation of R-loop signals at those gene loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although NELF-dependent Pol II pausing is important for development-related transcription22, the ensuing R-loop accumulation in the absence of BRCA1 could ultimately contribute to tumorigenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, functional antagonism between BRCA1 and NELF enforces a fine balance between normal tissue development and tumour suppression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Attenuated R-loop levels in DKO mice clearly correlates with reduced tumour incidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous reports, we found that BRCA1-deficient mouse mammary epithelium is associated with compromised HR repair22, elevated DNA replication stress (Fig 6d) and increased RANKL expression (Supplementary Fig 12a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, unlike R-loop levels and tumour incidence, none of these abnormalities in BKO mice was rescued on further deletion of Cobra1 in DKO mice, nor were there any significant changes in levels of oestrogen receptor or progesterone receptor between BKO and DKO (Supplementary Fig 12b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared to their corresponding WT littermates, neither BKO nor DKO exhibited substantial transcriptomics changes in mammary epithelia (Supplementary Fig 13 and Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies will shed light on the underlying mechanism by which BRCA1/COBRA1-regulated R-loop dynamics influences BRCA1-associated tumour development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'DRIP-seq

RNA compared with myoepithelial cells37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This remarkable asymmetry of epigenetics status and steady-state transcript abundance is consistent with the notion that the higher R-loop levels in luminal cells result from more active nascent transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, direct measurement of nascent transcripts in human breast is technically challenging, because of the extensive tissue processing in vitro and limited number of resulting sorted primary cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A related question concerns the luminal-specific R-loop accumulation in BRCA1 mutation carriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because no R-loop elevation was observed at transcriptionally active genes in either stromal or basal cells of the same BRCA1 mutation-carrying individuals, the BRCA1 mutation-associated R-loop elevation in luminal cells is unlikely to be a mere by-product of active transcription per se.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BRCA1 is functionally and/or physically associated with a number of luminal cell-specific transcription factors that are involved in fate determination, including ER, GATA3 and FOXA1 (refs 7, 16, 38, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These functional links could in turn confine BRCA1 action to transcriptional regulatory regions in the luminal cell compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'MMTV-Cre-based gene KO tends to be biased towards the luminal compartment of mouse mammary epithelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, BRCA1 expression in BKO mice used in the current study was reduced equally effectively in luminal and basal epithelial compartments (Supplementary Fig 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, data from both mouse models and human clinical samples are valid in demonstrating cell lineage-specific R-loop enrichment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we realize that Brca1 KO mouse models do not entirely recapitulate disease development in human BRCA1 mutation carriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, unlike humans, tumour incidence is not higher in heterozygous Brca1 KO mice versus WT mice40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these species-dependent differences, parallel investigation of both clinical samples and mouse genetic models promises to shed more light on a clinically relevant and biologically underinvestigated problem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Genetic complementation between mouse Brca1 and Cobra1 in R-loop dynamics and mammary tumorigenesis strongly suggests that COBRA1 contributes to BRCA1-associated breast cancer development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is further supported by the positive correlation between COBRA1 expression and R-loop intensity in breast epithelium of BRCA1 mutation carriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also worth noting that tumour samples from triple-negative breast cancer patients, which contain the majority of BRCA1 mutation carriers, had significantly elevated COBRA1 mRNA as compared to normal breast epithelium from cancer-free individuals41 (2.55-fold, P=4.83 × 106 by two-tailed t-test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, our study suggests that NELF-dependent Pol II pausing is a previously unappreciated contributor to tumour development in BRCA1-deficient breast epithelium, which offers a potential cancer risk-assessing and -reducing tool.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
