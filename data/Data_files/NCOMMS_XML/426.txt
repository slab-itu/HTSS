Involvement of human ribosomal proteins in nucleolar structure and p53-dependent nucleolar stress  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The nucleolus is a potent disease biomarker and a target in cancer therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ribosome biogenesis is initiated in the nucleolus where most ribosomal (r-) proteins assemble onto precursor rRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we systematically investigate how depletion of each of the 80 human r-proteins affects nucleolar structure, pre-rRNA processing, mature rRNA accumulation and p53 steady-state level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We developed an image-processing programme for qualitative and quantitative discrimination of normal from altered nucleolar morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, we find that uL5 (formerly RPL11) and uL18 (RPL5) are the strongest contributors to nucleolar integrity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with the 5S rRNA, they form the late-assembling central protuberance on mature 60S subunits, and act as an Hdm2 trap and p53 stabilizer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other major contributors to p53 homeostasis are also strictly late-assembling large subunit r-proteins essential to nucleolar structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identification of the r-proteins that specifically contribute to maintaining nucleolar structure and p53 steady-state level provides insights into fundamental aspects of cell and cancer biology.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Within the nucleus, the nucleolus is a specialized functional domain essential to gene expression1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is the site where the initial steps of ribosome biogenesis take place2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ribosomes are ribonucleoprotein nanomachines converting the genetic information encoded in messenger RNAs (mRNAs) into proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The human ribosome contains four ribosomal RNA (rRNAs) and 80 r-proteins organized in two subunits, each performing specialized functions in translation3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The small subunit (SSU), which consists of a single rRNA (18S) and 33 r-proteins, decodes the mRNA, while the large subunit (LSU), comprising three rRNAs (5S, 5.8S and 28S) and 47 r-proteins, bears the peptidyl transferase centre where amino acids are joined together into proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the nucleolus, the 18S, 5.8S and 28S rRNAs are synthesized by RNA polymerase I (Pol I) as long precursors, pre-rRNAs are modified, folded and processed, and most r-proteins are assembled to form ribosomal subunits2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'r-proteins are not involved in ribosome-mediated catalysis of peptide bond formation3,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, r-proteins play essential roles in shaping and maintaining the overall structure of the ribosomal subunits, and mutations in r-proteins are frequently associated with developmental disorders and human diseases6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, ribosomopathies are cancer predisposition syndromes caused by ribosome biogenesis dysfunction7, due to mutations in r-proteins or ribosomal assembly factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  r-proteins are intimately linked to tumourigenesis, being directly involved in regulating the steady-state level of the anti-tumor protein p53 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This occurs via activation of specific anti-tumor surveillance pathways, through direct binding of specific r-proteins to the p53 regulator Hdm2 (see below and ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The nucleolus is not limited by a lipid membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This makes it a highly dynamic structure that responds promptly, sometimes by profound morphological and compositional alterations, to cell stresses such as viral infections, DNA damage and drug treatments10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During interphase, the nucleoli of amniotic eukaryotes display three morphologically distinct layers12,13, which can be drastically re-organized under stress14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During mitosis, the nucleolus undergoes a dramatic cycle of disassembly/reassembly that parallels Pol I activity controlled by specific phosphorylations15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of nucleoli per cell nucleus and the shape and size of the nucleoli also vary greatly in proliferative diseases such as cancers17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cancer cells are more sensitive than non-cancer cells to inhibition of ribosome synthesis, and are killed selectively by treatment with Pol I inhibitors18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the importance of the nucleolus as a cell stress sensor20, disease biomarker and target for cancer therapy21, how its structural integrity is maintained remains totally unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While the principles of assembly and maintenance of the nucleolus are far from being understood14, r-proteins which are very abundant, very basic and which assemble mostly in the nucleolus onto pre-rRNAs to form ribosomal subunit precursors are likely to play an important role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The assembly of r-proteins is not random but follows a precise sequence of events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Groups of r-proteins have been defined on the basis of their assembly at early, intermediate or late stages of ribosomal subunit biogenesis22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compromising the timely association of r-proteins with rRNA can indeed lead to severe pre-rRNA processing inhibitions, ribosomal subunit synthesis abortion and sometimes to nucleolar structural alterations visible at the microscopic level23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, no attempt has been made to systematically address the involvement of r-proteins in nucleolar structure maintenance or to grade their involvement in this process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we have depleted human cells systematically of each of the 80 r-proteins and investigated the consequences on nucleolar structural integrity, pre-rRNA processing, accumulation of mature rRNAs and p53 steady-state level (see experimental strategy in Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Systematic screening of human r-proteins reveals that uL5 (RPL11) and uL18 (RPL5) are the strongest contributors to nucleolar structure maintenance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Experimental strategy: all 80 r-proteins were depleted one by one in human cells by use of specific siRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nucleolar structure (fluorescence microscopy), the accumulation of mature 18S and 28S rRNAs (electropherograms), pre-rRNA processing (high-resolution northern blotting), and steady-state accumulation of p53 (fluorescent western blotting) were monitored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) PCA showing a classification of r-proteins according to their requirement for nucleolar structure maintenance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each r-protein was depleted in three knockdown experiments, each performed with a different siRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The image-processing algorithm that we designed for this analysis involves selecting five discriminant shape and textural features, computing five dk values, and reducing the five dimensions to two by PCA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the resulting plot, each coloured dot represents one population of cells treated with one siRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dot colour is indicative of the targeted protein: green for SSU r-proteins and magenta for LSU r-proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean of three populations of cells treated with a non-targeting control siRNA (SCR) is shown in red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blue symbols represent the six calibration controls (FBL, GFP, nucleolin, nucleophosmin, MOCK and TIF1A, see Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insets show images of the nuclei of cells depleted of representative proteins with the DNA stained in blue and the nucleoli appearing in green (FBL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a few representative examples, a specific symbol is used (for example, a diamond for uL5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RPL, r-proteins of the LSU; RPS, r-proteins of the SSU.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) r-proteins and calibration controls classified according to the severity of nucleolar disruption caused by their absence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The iNo was defined as the sum of the dk values of the five most discriminant shape and textural features identified in this work (Methods section).

eukaryotes).Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Effects of r-protein depletion on nucleolar structure', 'Human cells stably producing the nucleolar methyltransferase fibrillarin (FBL) fused to a green fluorescent protein (GFP) were transfected with siRNAs targeting the appropriate transcripts, incubated for 3 days, and imaged by fluorescence microscopy (Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each r-protein was depleted in three experiments, a different siRNA being used in each experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The entire screen was duplicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A non-targeting siRNA (SCR), mock-treated cells (MOCK) and a calibration set were included (Methods section and Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calibration set consisted of proteins whose depletion leads to moderate to severe nucleolar disruption, formation of nucleolar caps (see below), or a reduction in fluorescence intensity (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To characterize nucleolar morphology defects both qualitatively and quantitatively, we developed a specific image-processing algorithm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, we first segmented the observed nuclei on the basis of shape- and size-consistent adaptive thresholding of a nuclear stain (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) signal).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, within each nuclear mass, GFP signal thresholding and mathematical morphology (Methods section) were applied to segment nucleoli into connected components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To optimize discrimination of nucleoli of cells depleted of an r-protein from those of SCR-treated control cells, five shape and textural features were extracted from the largest connected components of each nucleolus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These five features, selected from a set of 11 as the most discriminant ones, were: area, elliptical regularity, percentage of pixels below an optimized intensity threshold, smallest intensity and number of local minima (Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each of the five features, a dk value corresponding to a statistically significant distance between the feature distribution in cells depleted of an r-protein and control cells were computed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each population of cells was thus characterized by five dk values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce these five dimensions to two, allowing ready visualization of the data in a scatter plot (Fig 1b) where each dot corresponds to a population of cells treated with one siRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The PCA revealed groups of proteins whose depletion leads to similar nucleolar morphological phenotypes (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four major groups emerged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest one, indicated by a grey ellipse containing the SCR control (shown as a red dot), comprises r-proteins whose depletion had no significant impact on nucleolar structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, most of the r-proteins are in this group, that is, nearly all of the SSU proteins (shown in green) and roughly two-thirds of the LSU proteins (in magenta).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second group, beneath the SCR control, comprises proteins whose depletion did not alter the nucleolar structure but reduced the fluorescence intensity (for example, control cells treated with siRNAs against GFP or FBL, see also Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells depleted of the RNA Pol I transcription factor TIF1A formed distinctive nucleolar caps, in keeping with the known effects of RNA Pol I inhibitions14, and appeared isolated in the upper left part of the graph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fourth group comprises the few r-proteins whose depletion was found to impact nucleolar structure very severely, remarkably they are almost exclusively LSU proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cluster forms a tail in the right part of the graph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cells depleted of these major contributors to normal nucleolar structure, the nucleoli were detected as unfolded beaded necklaces (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our automated classification was benchmarked with a manual one and found to be extremely robust (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complete data set is available in an information-rich database at http://www.RibosomalProteins.com.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To stratify the r-proteins according to the severity of nucleolar disruption caused by their absence, we defined an index of nucleolar disruption (iNo) as the sum of the absolute values of the five dk distances (Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each r-protein, an average iNo, based on the values obtained with the three different siRNAs used, was calculated and plotted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the resulting graph, the r-proteins are listed from top to bottom in the order of increasing impact on nucleolar structure (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As concluded from the PCA, depletion of most r-proteins appears to have no significant impact on nucleolar structure (iNo less_than 0.05), and the proteins whose depletion has the greatest effect belong to the LSU (magenta).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, the r-proteins uL5 (formerly RPL11, ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24) and uL18 (formerly RPL5) appear among the strongest contributors to maintenance of nucleolar structural integrity (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are precisely the proteins which, together with the 5S rRNA, form a small ribonucleoprotein complex, the 5S ribonucleoprotein, which acts as an HDM2 trap and controls the steady-state level of p53 in a regulatory circuit known as p53-dependent anti-tumor nucleolar surveillance25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, in unstressed cells, p53 is constitutively targeted for proteosomal degradation by Hdm2-mediated ubiquitination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the event of a nucleolar stress, such as a ribosome biogenesis dysfunction, unassembled ribosomal components accumulate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include the 5S ribonucleoprotein, which interacts with Hdm2, sequestering it away from p53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, p53 is stabilized and induces cell cycle arrest and cell death9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mature 60S subunits, the 5S ribonucleoprotein constitutes the central protuberance (CP), a late-assembling structure (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Ribosomal subunit assembly is a sequential process involving progressive binding of r-proteins to nascent rRNAs and gradual formation of ribosomal landmarks23,27,28,29,30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We wondered if the r-proteins important for nucleolar structure might map to particular areas on mature ribosomal subunits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colour-coding of the r-proteins according to their iNo values, on a three-dimensional model based on the crystal structure of the human ribosome32 (Fig 2a), made it obvious that the strongest contributors to nucleolar structure maintenance belong to the LSU and are not randomly distributed over it: rather, they are preferentially located at the subunit interface in areas corresponding to the CP, the L1-stalk and a region directly below the L1-stalk (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of these are late-forming structures (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Late-assembling r-proteins of the LSU are the strongest contributors to

infection20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In interphase, however, it is quite stable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is disassembled at the onset of mitosis and reassembled at the end of this process14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our nucleolar screens, cells were imaged after 3 days of r-protein depletion, as we reasoned that cells might have to undergo at least two cycles of nucleolar breakdown/nucleolar genesis for nucleolar alterations to become readily detectable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assumption was confirmed when we established the time course of the appearance of nucleolar morphological defects (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Focusing on 13 representative r-proteins, and monitoring changes at 24-h intervals over a 3-day depletion period, we indeed found nucleolar disruption to increase steadily (Supplementary Fig 3b), in parallel with an increase in iNo values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nucleolar disruption became obvious only after 72 h of depletion (Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The nucleoli of cells of amniotic organisms have three nucleolar subcompartments12,13,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our original screens, we used FBL, a dense fibrillar component marker, to assess nucleolar morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To extend our conclusions, we examined whether nucleolar structural defects due to r-protein depletion might be equally observable with a marker of a different nucleolar subcompartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose to monitor by immunofluorescence a granular component marker, the PES1 antigen, in depletion experiments focusing on 13 representative r-proteins (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected for a granular component protein, PES1 staining was peripheral to the FBL signal (Supplementary Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, we observed extreme closeness between the iNo scores computed from the FBL and PES1 signals, and the ranking of r-proteins according to phenotype severity was largely similar (Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that the nucleolar structural defects due to r-protein depletion can be monitored similarly with a dense fibrillar component or a granular component antigen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We conducted our nucleolar screens in HeLa cells because of the large size of their nucleus, which makes them ideal for use in high-throughput screens with visual readouts (for example, refs 34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To see how general the effects observed in HeLa-GFP-FBL cells might be, we tested five cell lines: two cervical carcinoma cell lines (HeLa-GFP-FBL and HeLa), one colon carcinoma cell line (HCT116) and two lung cancer cell lines (A549 and H1944).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We selected eight representative r-proteins, depleted them for 3 days in each of the five cell lines and monitored nucleolar structure by immunostaining of endogenous PES1 and iNo score computation (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the r-proteins tested, we found the weak and strong contributors to nucleolar structure maintenance to be largely the same in all five cell lines (Fig 3), with uL5 and uL18 playing an important role in each case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Quantitative monitoring of nucleolar

2 days, as we had established beforehand, precisely in HCT116 cells, that bona fide pre-rRNA processing inhibitions are early defects preceding cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and are best captured at this time point (discussed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The ratio of 28S to 18S mature rRNA was extracted from bioanalyzer electropherograms (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The accumulation of SSU 18S rRNA was strongly decreased, and the 28S/18S ratio accordingly increased, by SSU r-protein depletion (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reciprocally, LSU r-protein depletion led to decreased accumulation of the LSU 28S rRNA and to a reduced 28S/18S ratio (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Northern blots were probed with specific radioactively labelled oligonucleotides, revealing all major known pre-rRNA intermediates (Fig 4b, Supplementary Figs 5, 6 and 11 and www.RibosomalProteins.com).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each band detected was quantified with a phosphoimager and normalized with

depletion affects early cleavage steps (class 1), intermediate cleavage steps (class 3), late cleavage steps (class 4) or has no substantial impact on processing (class 2; Fig 4d and Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, no such classification of LSU r-proteins has been reported previously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our classification of r-proteins involvement in pre-rRNA processing thus confirms and largely extends previous work (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The r-proteins were mapped on a three-dimensional model of the human ribosome according to their involvement in processing (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This revealed, on both subunits, a strikingly asymmetric distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the mature SSU, the r-proteins required for early processing steps are those forming the body and platform (Fig 2b), both of which are known as early-assembling subunit structures27,28,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The r-proteins affecting late cleavage steps, in contrast, correspond to the head and beak (Fig 2b), which are late-forming structures27,28,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the LSU, the r-proteins important for early processing are mainly exposed on the solvent side of the ribosome (in blue on the right-hand-side cartoon Fig 2b), while those required for intermediate cleavages are at the interface side (in orange on the left-hand-side cartoon), below the L1 stalk, and those important for late processing correspond largely to the CP and L1-stalk (in red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, this is precisely the order in which these structures have been shown to form in budding yeast30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A comparison of our nucleolar structure and rRNA processing data reveals that the r-proteins whose depletion has the greatest effect on nucleolar structure (in red in Fig 2a) are largely those required for intermediate or late processing steps in the formation of the large ribosomal subunit (in orange and red in Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within this subunit, they belong mostly to late-assembling structures, including the L1-stalk and CP (uL5 and uL18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, while practically all r-proteins appear important for pre-rRNA processing,

proteins are CP components, we predicted that depletion of factors involved in CP formation should also cause profound nucleolar structure alterations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This proved to be true: we found depletion of BXDC1, RRS1 or both to affect nucleolar structure severely (Fig 5a), almost as strongly as does uL5 or uL18 depletion (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: The central protuberance

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In summary, we show here that depletion of the vast majority of the 80 human r-proteins does not impact nucleolar structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This notably applies to nearly all SSU r-proteins (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In striking contrast, about a third of the LSU proteins appear essential to maintaining normal nucleolar structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This marked dichotomy is in line with the notion that pre-40S subunits are exported to the cytoplasm more rapidly than pre-60S subunits, whose production is more complex and requires numerous additional nuclear maturation steps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the strongest contributors to nucleolar structure are uL5 and uL18, known to form with 5S rRNA an Hdm2 trap and p53 stabilizer25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Most r-proteins assemble with pre-rRNAs within the nucleolus, quite early in the subunit assembly process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notable exceptions are the acidic proteins uL10 (formerly P0), P1 and P2, which form the P-stalk on pre-60S subunits only after reaching the cytoplasm in yeast47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we found the acidic r-proteins to have no impact on nucleolar structure (Supplementary Fig 11 and www.RibosomalProteins.com).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While only a few r-proteins are required for nucleolar structure maintenance, most of them are essential to pre-rRNA processing (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The processing steps in which r-proteins are involved are primarily those which lead to synthesis of the rRNAs constituting the subunit to which they belong.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The r-proteins whose depletion has the strongest impact on nucleolar structure are required for late processing reactions in the pathway of LSU synthesis (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Pre-rRNA processing is an excellent proxy of ribosome assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, by establishing the precise involvement of each r-protein in processing, we incidentally extend the conclusion23,28,30,31,48 that the sequence of r-protein incorporation into maturing ribosomal subunits, and thus of ribosomal landmark formation, has been extremely well conserved throughout evolution from bacteria, to yeast and man (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we reveal this to be the case for human large ribosomal subunit assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is quite remarkable, considering the tremendous differences in cell organization, in gene expression strategies and the increased complexity in ribosomal assembly machineries between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On mature 60S, the r-proteins whose depletion has the strongest impact on nucleolar structure form specific landmarks: the CP (uL5 and uL18), the L1-stalk and a region directly below the L1-stalk (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are late-assembling subunit structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, nucleolar structure is disrupted when uL5 or uL18 incorporation, and hence formation of the CP, is prevented by depletion of specific CP assembly factors (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that the importance of these r-proteins in maintaining the integrity of nucleolar structure reflects the emergence, during evolution, of checkpoints important to cell homeostasis, ensuring that the late steps of LSU assembly, and particularly CP formation, occur properly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Why should CP formation be monitored?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, in the mature ribosome, the CP is involved in intersubunit interactions beneficial to translation49,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, CP formation might be tightly coupled to maturation of essential ribosomal landmarks on the LSU.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is plausible, given what is known about CP formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 5S ribonucleoprotein is incorporated into maturing 60S subunits as a pre-assembled block41, a step aided by the conserved assembly factors Rpf2(yeast)/BXDC1(human) and Rrs1/RRS1 (refs 26, 41, 51; see above).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In precursor 60S, however, the 5S ribonucleoprotein does not adopt its final conformation until it undergoes a 180° rotation51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This rotation seems to act as a power stroke promoting a cascade of subunit maturation events and the long-range transmission of mechano-chemical remodelling energy throughout the maturing 60S precursors52,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structures whose formation may be strictly linked to that of the CP include the conserved A-site finger helix 38, which is part of an intersubunit bridge that monitors the A-site transfer RNA throughout the decoding process54, the peptidyl transferase centre itself, where amino acids are joined together, and possibly the phospho-stalk52,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is now well established that several r-proteins are essential to regulating the p53 level (summarized in Supplementary Data 4)9,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In principle, depletion of any r-protein is expected to trigger a ribotoxic stress-response leading to accumulation of unassembled ribosomal components, including uL5, uL18 and the 5S rRNA, and to sequestration of Hdm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it was expected that most r-proteins would be involved, in one way or another, in regulating the p53 level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, setting a fivefold increase as significance threshold, we reveal that depletion of any one among two-thirds of the human r-proteins has no significant impact on p53 accumulation (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, we show that 24 r-proteins out of 80 are very important for p53 homeostasis, their depletion giving rise to a 5- to 10-fold increase in the p53 level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all of these cases, the increase in p53 accumulation requires the presence of uL5 and uL18 (Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies activation of the anti-tumor nucleolar surveillance regulatory loop described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The r-proteins whose depletion has the strongest impact on p53 homeostasis correspond to late-assembling structures on the subunits (Fig 2b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identification of the r-proteins whose depletion affects p53 accumulation provides essential insights into the aetiology of ribosomopathies, which are cancer predisposition syndromes caused by mutations in r-proteins or by ribosome assembly defects7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Up to now, it has been unclear whether the activation of nucleolar surveillance, leading to p53 stabilization, systematically involves disruption of nucleolar structure or simply inhibition of nucleolar function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Induction of p53 in response to ribosome biogenesis inhibition has indeed been attributed to nucleolar disruption55, but studies have also shown that a rise in the cellular level of p53 can occur after r-protein depletion, independently of gross nucleolar disruption44,56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is notably the case after uL30 (formerly: RpL7) depletion44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have confirmed this latter observation, showing that it applies, in fact, to a large group of 21 r-proteins (Supplementary Data 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The nucleolus is a long-known cancer biomarker17 and a recently demonstrated therapeutic target19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not widely used by pathologists, however, for lack of reliable clinical assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The image-processing algorithm and iNo developed here are robust and versatile tools for characterizing nucleolar morphological alterations both qualitatively and quantitatively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have used them consistently in multiple cell lines, in time course analyses, and with either the dense fibrillar component or the granular component of the nucleolus (Fig 3, Supplementary Figs 3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe they hold great diagnostic and prognostic potential in cancer biology and research on ribosomopathies, several of which involve marked disruption of nucleolar integrity due to r-protein loss or mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The complete data set and additional information are accessible in a fully searchable information-rich database at www.RibosomalProteins.com.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
