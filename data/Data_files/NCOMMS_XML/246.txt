G6PD protects from oxidative damage and improves healthspan in mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are constantly generated by cells and ROS-derived damage contributes to ageing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protection against oxidative damage largely relies on the reductive power of NAPDH, whose levels are mostly determined by the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report a transgenic mouse model with moderate overexpression of human G6PD under its endogenous promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, G6PD-Tg mice have higher levels of NADPH, lower levels of ROS-derived damage, and better protection from ageing-associated functional decline, including extended median lifespan in females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The G6PD transgene has no effect on tumour development, even after combining with various tumour-prone genetic alterations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that a modest increase in G6PD activity is beneficial for healthspan through increased NADPH levels and protection from the deleterious effects of ROS.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated as a result of normal intracellular metabolism and by the action of several external agents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ROS function as physiological signalling molecules that participate in the modulation of apoptosis, stress responses and proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, ROS can have a detrimental side by inflicting damage to macromolecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, organisms are endowed with antioxidant mechanisms that maintain ROS levels below a certain threshold under homoeostatic conditions1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During organismal ageing, regulation of ROS and oxidative repair become less efficient, thereby resulting in increased ROS production and accumulation of ROS-derived damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The free radical theory of ageing argues that ROS-derived damage contributes to the functional decline of organ systems and predisposes to pathologies such as cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this, transgenic mice with increased expression of antioxidant enzymes are generally protected from a number of pathologies and in a few cases they present an increased lifespan4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Thioredoxins, glutaredoxins and peroxiredoxins constitute a major antioxidant system that ultimately relies on the reductive power of NADPH5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NADPH also contributes to the maintenance of the active form of catalase, another important ROS-detoxifying enzyme6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the homeostatic levels of NADPH are thought to determine the rate of ROS-derived damage5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mammalian cells possess a few enzymes able to produce NADPH and, among them, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is considered the most important one7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  G6PD catalyses the rate-limiting step in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which provides nucleotide precursors for DNA replication, as well as NADPH reductive power for ROS detoxification and de novo lipid synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relevance of G6PD and the PPP in ROS detoxification is exemplified by the fact that mice deficient in G6PD have high levels of oxidative damage in the brain9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, human skin cells respond to acute oxidative stress by boosting their PPP-mediated NADPH production10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, G6PD overexpression in Drosophila melanogaster protects against oxidative stress and can extend lifespan11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite the central role of G6PD in antioxidant defence, nucleotide precursor synthesis and lipid synthesis, the consequences of G6PD overexpression in mammalian physiology have not been studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two points are of particular interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, G6PD may improve ROS detoxification and thereby reduce ROS-derived damage during ageing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, improved ROS detoxification and enhanced anabolism of nucleotides and lipids may favour tumoral growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we address these questions by generating transgenic mice with moderate ubiquitous overexpression of human G6PD under the control of its natural promoter.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Generation of G6PD transgenic mice', 'For the generation of the G6PD transgenic mice, we used a large intact genomic fragment (20.1 Kb) comprising the entire human G6PD gene, including upstream and downstream regulatory sequences12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this manner, we obtained a transgenic mouse line (G6PD-Tg) that expresses 2-fold levels of total G6PD mRNA (combined endogenous mouse mRNA and transgenic human mRNA) relative to wild-type (WT) littermates across all examined tissues and in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was accompanied by a similar increase in protein levels (mouse and human proteins detected with the same antibody) (Fig 1b;

Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) analysis revealed that old G6PD-Tg mice presented a normal lean mass and a slight reduction in fat mass, although the latter did not reach statistical significance (Supplementary Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glucose intolerance and insulin resistance are associated to mouse ageing, and these processes are more pronounced in males compared to females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, 1-year-old G6PD-Tg males were more glucose tolerant than their WT littermates, and presented improved insulin sensitivity at 15 min after insulin injection (Fig 2d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 6 months of age, G6PD-Tg males were equal to WT mice regarding glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (data not shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of females, glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were indistinguishable at one year of age between transgenic and WT genotypes (Supplementary Fig 3c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also performed a complete laboratory animal monitoring experiment on 1-year-old mice, measuring energy expenditure, food and water intake and locomotor activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of these parameters were changed between G6PD-Tg animals and their WT littermates (Supplementary Fig 3eh), indicating that the observed improvements in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity are not due to a significant alteration in energy expenditure, intake or activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we tested neuromuscular fitness in aged mice using the rotarod test, and we observed a significant improvement in the performance of G6PD-Tg females and a non-significant trend for improvement in G6PD-Tg males at 1.52 years of age (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, G6PD overexpression in mice partially protects from ageing-associated functional decline, which depending on the sex manifests on different ageing-associated processes, including glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, neuromuscular fitness, and median lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cancer susceptibility is not affected in G6PD-Tg mice', 'G6PD has been proposed to have pro-oncogenic properties based on its overexpression in several tumour types and studies with in vitro cultured cells19,20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, overexpression of G6PD in murine fibroblasts under the actin promoter is able to increase their proliferation rate and may induce oncogenic transformation22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We wondered if this could also be the case in our G6PD-Tg MEFs, which overexpress G6PD under its natural promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  G6PD-Tg MEFs proliferated at the same rate than their WT controls at different concentrations of serum (Fig 3a), and formed the same number of neoplastic foci after co-transduction of oncogenes E1A and HRasG12V (Fig 3b) or E6 and HRasG12V (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The process of reprogramming of differentiated cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) shares some similarities with neoplastic transformation and it can provide a readout of transformability and oncogenic potential23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, G6PD-Tg MEFs formed the same number of iPSC colonies than WT MEFs upon reprogramming with Oct4, Klf4 and Sox2 (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Cancer susceptibility is not affected in G6PD-Tg mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Growth curves of primary MEFs at the indicated serum concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b,c) Number of neoplastic foci in MEFs transduced with E1a/HRasGV12 (b) or with E6/HRasG12V (c) after 2 weeks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Fold change of reprogramming efficiency of primary MEFs after transduction with Oct4, Sox2 and Klf4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ei) Survival curves of the indicated mouse lines and experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) p53-KO;G6PD-WT, n=21, 7 females (F);

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Ageing is a complex process driven by multiple sources of damage, both internal and external.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic studies in animal models have uncovered genes that are able to affect the ageing process, but their discovery and characterization still remains challenging, particularly in mammals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work uncovers a novel genetic manipulation that improves some aspects of ageing in mammals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'G6PD is the rate-limiting enzyme for the PPP, which plays two important roles in cell physiology: synthesis of nucleotide precursors, and production of NADPH, which in turn is the main determinant of the antioxidant capacity of cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we have generated transgenic mice with modest (2-fold) overexpression of G6PD and we show in vivo that this reflects in higher levels of NAPDH and in higher production of nucleotide precursors (measured as uric acid in the blood).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Phenotypically, analyses of G6PD-Tg mice at different ages have revealed that these mice are partially protected from some ageing-associated processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, old G6PD-Tg mice presented improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in males, and improved rotarod function (an indicator of neuromuscular fitness) and increased median lifespan in females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are in line with previous overexpression mouse models of NADPH-dependent ROS-detoxifying enzymes, some of which present better glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity (PRX3-Tg or PRX4-Tg mice), neuroprotection (GPX1-Tg or GRX2-Tg mice), protection from cardiovascular damage (GPX4-Tg, TRX1-Tg, GRX1-Tg and GRX2-Tg mice), or extended median lifespan without increased maximum lifespan (TRX1-Tg mice)4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed improvement in healthspan in G6PD-Tg mice also coincides with observations in flies, where G6PD overexpression increased protection from ROS and maximum lifespan11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Of interest, G6PD overexpression has been found in a number of human cancers, and G6PD has been proposed to be pro-oncogenic19,20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our in vitro and in vivo data indicate that moderate overexpression of G6PD does not affect tumour onset in a WT background, nor in many other tumour-prone backgrounds (p53-null, Atm-null, MMTV-PyMT or E-Myc).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that G6PD overexpression in our G6PD-Tg mice has no impact on tumorigenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given the importance of NADPH in antioxidant defences, we also analysed molecular markers of oxidative damage in aged mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, liver and brain from old G6PD-Tg mice, male and female, presented lower levels of oxidized DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to this, G6PD-deficient mice have higher levels of oxidized DNA (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  G6PD-Tg females also presented decreased lipid oxidation in the liver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This protection against oxidative molecular damage was associated to a higher ratio between reduced and oxidized glutathione in the liver of old mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Together, these observations support a mechanistic link between increased G6PD activity, elevated NADPH and redox potential, and improved antioxidant protection, and this could explain the beneficial health effects observed in old G6PD-Tg mice.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
