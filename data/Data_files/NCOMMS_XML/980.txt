Drebrin-mediated microtubuleactomyosin coupling steers cerebellar granule neuron nucleokinesis and migration pathway selection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Neuronal migration from a germinal zone to a final laminar position is essential for the morphogenesis of neuronal circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While it is hypothesized that microtubuleactomyosin crosstalk is required for a neurons two-stroke nucleokinesis cycle, the molecular mechanisms controlling such crosstalk are not defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using the drebrin microtubuleactin crosslinking protein as an entry point into the cerebellar granule neuron system in combination with super-resolution microscopy, we investigate how these cytoskeletal systems interface during migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lattice light-sheet and structured illumination microscopy reveal a proximal leading process nanoscale architecture wherein f-actin and drebrin intervene between microtubules and the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional perturbations of drebrin demonstrate that proximal leading process microtubuleactomyosin coupling steers the direction of centrosome and somal migration, as well as the switch from tangential to radial migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the Siah2 E3 ubiquitin ligase antagonizes drebrin function, suggesting a model for control of the microtubuleactomyosin interfaces during neuronal differentiation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Understanding how neurons migrate from germinal zone (GZ) niches to their final laminar positions while synchronizing morphology to cytoskeletal organization is a classic problem in developmental neurobiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The clinical significance of neuronal migration is illustrated by the spectrum of neurological disorders in which lamination defects arising from disrupted neuronal motility lead to intellectual disabilities and epilepsy1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two recent conceptual advances have coalesced into an overall framework that guides cellular and molecular investigations of migration5,6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, most mammalian neurons undergo a stereotyped saltatory movement cycle as they migrate to their final laminae, despite the apparent diversity in migration substrates, adhesive receptor systems, guidance cues and migration pathways10,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each neuronal movement cycle begins with a leading process extending in the direction of migration14,15, followed by the transport of cytoplasmic organelles, such as the centrosome or Golgi apparatus, into an engorged proximal segment of the leading process, and ends with the directed nuclear movement termed nucleokinesis16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, insights gained from human neuronal migration disorders and genetic manipulations in mice highlight the importance of the neuronal cytoskeleton or cytoskeletal adaptors in producing the stereotyped motility patterns necessary for appropriate neuronal migration during development2,3,24,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Time-lapse imaging of elements of the microtubule or actin cytoskeletons has provided a detailed spatiotemporal framework for the two-stroke motility cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the first phase of the cycle, microtubule growth and bulk movement of centrosomal and noncentrosomal microtubules is oriented towards the proximal leading process17,19,20,27,28,29,30, where cytoplasmic organelles, including the centrosome, translocate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although cytoplasmic dynein within the proximal leading process has been implicated in microtubule and centrosome movement in the direction of migration19,31, it remains unclear where microtubules are anchored and how pulling forces are transmitted to the microtubule cytoskeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, after an initial focus on the role of actomyosin in the rear of migrating neurons18,19,32,33,34, time-lapse imaging revealed that the leading process is a major site for f-actin dynamics and myosin II motor activity23,35,36,37,38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Traction force microscopy shows that discrete leading process actomyosin contraction centres exert force before somal translocation, generating traction force between a neuron and its migration substrate40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, myosin II-powered actin flow from the proximal to distal leading process drives centrosome positioning, adhesion and/or guidance receptor dynamics23,35,36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, actomyosin simultaneously coordinates external traction with polarized organelle transport in the migrating neuron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite the definition of the individual contributions of the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons to two-stroke motility, our knowledge of how the two systems function together in migrating neurons remains fragmentary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we examined the cell biological underpinnings of microtubuleactomyosin crosstalk in cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) by utilizing drebrin, a protein that links microtubule movements to the actomyosin cytoskeleton in the growth cone and synapse41,42,43, as a molecular entry point44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Drebrin is required for neuronal migration in the mouse olfactory systems and chick spinal cord45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied advanced lattice light-sheet (LLS) microscopy and Super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SR-SIM) in combination with functional studies examining the dynamic localization and function of drebrin in migrating CGNs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies reveal that drebrin and f-actin in the proximal leading process/cytoplasmic dilation constitute a novel interaction interface directing movements of the centrosome and microtubules that steer the polarity of the two-stroke motility cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also define a novel functional antagonism between drebrin and the Siah2 E3 ubiquitin ligase that illustrates how the cytoskeletal underpinnings of the two-stroke motility cycle are regulated during neuronal differentiation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Drebrin reports leading process microtubule-actin interfaces', 'In CGNs, both the actin and microtubule cytoskeletal motor systems contribute to two-stroke motility (Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Figs 1 and 2); thus, we explored functional microtubuleactomyosin interactions as a means to define mechanistically how both systems work together to impact neuronal motility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reasoned that drebrin would be a useful reporter for establishing the sites of microtubuleactomyosin interaction in migrating CGNs, as it binds the sides of f-actin filaments and microtubule plus ends through direct interaction with the neuronal +TIP protein end-binding protein 3 (EB3)41,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Drebrin mediates f-actinmicrotubule interactions in growth cones or dendritic spines and is required for some forms of neuronal migration, but its dynamic localization had not been examined in migrating neurons, nor had its function been examined in the two-stroke motility model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined drebrin expression in the developing cerebellum to determine its suitability as a reporter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous drebrin expression analyses48,49,50, at postnatal day 7 (P7) drebrin displays a complementary expression profile with the granule neuron progenitor (GNP) markers Ki67 and Zeb1 and is expressed in the cerebellar lamina where differentiated CGNs reside (for example, the inner external granular layer (EGL), molecular layer and inner granular layer (IGL), (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CGN drebrin expression is linked to terminal differentiation, as it commences in CGNs that co-express the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory protein p27Kip1/Cdkn1b (p27 hereafter), a marker for newly postmitotic CGNs in the inner EGL (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The drebrin E isoform is the predominant drebrin protein expressed at this developmental stage as little drebrin A immunoreactivity is present in CGNs, consistent with previous expression analyses (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunohistochemical staining of purified CGNs from P7 cerebellum revealed endogenous drebrin protein in the neuronal soma and leading process, where it was largely coincident with myosin II motors and microtubules in important regions of migrating CGNs, such as the proximal leading process (Fig 1e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The leading process and soma also showed immunoreactivity for drebrin phosphorylated on serine 142, which indicates an active configuration to interact with the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons (Fig 1g and Supplementary Fig 3 for detailed phospho-Ser142 analysis)47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Drebrin protein is expressed in differentiated CGNs and is dynamically localized to the leading process during two-stroke motility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ac) Immunohistochemical examination of drebrin expression in the P7 mouse cerebellum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the P7 cerebellum, drebrin (red) is complementarily expressed with the GNP markers Ki67 (green) (a) or Zeb1 (green) (b) and is co-expressed in differentiated CGNs with p27Kip (green) (c), scale bar for each image equals 50 m.

drebrin flows down the leading process in the direction of migration before the contraction of the leading process drebrin domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arrows indicate the borders of the drebrin domain as it contracts during a migration cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (j) Analysis of the percentage of regional drebrin localization signal in the soma and leading or trailing process in migrating neurons expressing drebrin E 2x-KO1, in which drebrin accumulates in the leading process in the active phase of migration.Full size image', 'Previous studies have revealed a proximal-to-distal f-actin flow from the neuronal soma through the proximal leading process/cytoplasmic dilation that accompanies neuronal migration23,35,36,37,38,39,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This flow is required for centrosomal positioning in the first phase of the two-stroke motility cycle35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that if f-actinmicrotubule interactions occur in the proximal leading process, then f-actinmicrotubule crosslinking factors might be recruited there during the motility cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we generated a fluorescent drebrin E reporter for use in live-cell imaging experiments by fusing a tandem repeat of Kusabira Orange (KO1) to the 3 end of the mouse full-length drebrin E complementary DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We monitored drebrin dynamics in a well-established in vitro CGNBergmann glial model system for radial migration by imaging CGNs expressing drebrin E-2xKO1 and Map2c-yellow fluorescent protein (Map2c-YFP) with a spinning disk confocal microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A custom-written adaptive kymograph algorithm23 showed that drebrin E-2xKO1 is cyclically transferred from the neuronal soma to the proximal portion of the leading process during CGN migration with no significant fluctuations in the trailing process, much as we previously observed for f-actin35 (Fig 1hj).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The drebrin E-labelled domain contracts during migration (compare panel 1:41:59 with 1:43:59 in Fig 1h), and bending can be seen in the Map2c-YFP-labelled microtubule bundles in the centre of the contractile region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, treatment with the blebbistatin myosin II inhibitor halts drebrin translocation, suggesting that leading process actomyosin flow contributes to drebrin translocation (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show that drebrin is expressed in CGNs after they differentiate, with timing similar to that of the radial migration initiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, drebrin dynamically localizes to the proximal leading process before or during somal translocation and is the clearest reporter yet for detecting actomyosin component transference from the soma to the leading process during the two-stroke migratory cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'LLS and SR-SIM reveal leading process nanoscale structures', 'The images of endogenous drebrin and microtubules in our immunocytochemically stained fixed CGNs (Fig 1f) and of drebrin E-2xKO1 and Map2c-YFP in live CGNs indicated that, in the proximal leading process, drebrin was located in a layer outside the more central microtubule structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the resolution of standard confocal microscopy is insufficient to support such a conclusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we applied LLS microscopy, which utilizes ultrathin light sheets derived from optical lattices to rapidly section living cells with minimal phototoxicity and provide near isotropic imaging in the x, y and z dimensions52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the XZ sectioning of LLS is sufficient to resolve the plasma membrane interface of a CGN interacting with a glial cell in culture, which had previously only been examined in fixed cells using electron microscopy27 (Supplementary Videos 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Time-lapse imaging of CGNs expressing drebrin E-2xKO1 and glycophosphatidylinositol-pHluorin (GPI-pHluorin), a novel probe that exploits the pH sensitivity of super-ecliptic pHluorin to label only the exterior surface of the plasma membrane53, confirmed that drebrin flows down the CGN leading process before somal translocation but does not fully extend to its distal tip (Fig 2a, Supplementary Video 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With its superior signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution (enhanced by LucyRichardson deconvolution using measured point-spread functions), LLS microscopy revealed that drebrin is localized to two sub-plasma membrane collars parallel to the long axis of the CGN leading process that were difficult to observe by spinning disk confocal microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We should note that not all CGNs are synchronized to the same stage of the migration cycle and can stochastically change migration directions along glial fibres in vitro leading to minor variability in the appearance of drebrin in the trailing process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next used an enhanced green fluorescent protein-labelled utrophin actin-binding domain (EGFP-UTRCH-ABD) as a reporter of f-actin localization54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During CGN migration, levels of EGFP-UTRCH-ABD in the neuronal soma and leading process were high, and it localized to a cortical collar (Fig 2b, Supplementary Video 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the leading process f-actin signal was evident before somal translocation (see time-point 8:47 in Fig 2b) and became enriched in the proximal leading process, drebrin E-2xKO1 became most clearly coincident with f-actin when it enriched in the proximal leading process during movement (see time-point 22:40 in Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imaging drebrin E-2xKO1 in combination with Tau-Emerald, a microtubule marker, revealed that as drebrin became enriched in the dilated proximal leading process, it appeared to envelop a central core of microtubules (Fig 2c, Supplementary Video 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, time-lapse imaging of CGNs expressing pHluorin-tagged JAM-C, an immunoglobulin superfamily adhesion molecule essential for CGN migration55, and drebrin E-2xKO1 revealed surface JAM-C at punctate junctions within the leading process and neuronal soma (Fig 2d, Supplementary Video 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although many adhesive puncta were present in the distal leading process, a subset was located in the drebrin E-enriched portion of the proximal leading process, suggesting that these adhesions are substrate contact points for contractile forces generated in the drebrin E-enriched domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: LLS microscopy reveals unappreciated relationships between

of diffraction-limited microscopy56,57,58 and is thus ideal to extend our analysis of the proximal leading process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the relationship of drebrin in the proximal leading process to the plasma membrane, f-actin and microtubules, we developed a live-cell labelling protocol that involved imaging two genetically encoded fluorescent probes (drebrin E-2xKO1 and EGFP-UTRCH-ABD or GPI-pHluorin) in combination with the far-red SiR-tubulin microtubule dye.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This protocol avoided artefacts associated with cytoskeletal fixation and used a commercial SR-SIM system with a resolution of 110 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imaging CGNs with dilated proximal leading processes treated with two label combinations (GPI-pHluorin/drebrin E-2xKO1/SiR-tubulin or EGFP-UTRCH-ABD/drebrin E-2xKO1/SiR-tubulin) revealed that (1) the proximal leading process does indeed possess a central core of microtubules, and (2) a layer of drebrin and f-actin intervenes between the plasma membrane and microtubules in this domain (Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analysed our SR-SIM data with a novel full-width half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian peak detection algorithm (see Methods) and found clear separation of the respective channels in the SIM images (see the Gaussian peak graphs in Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative measurements in multiple cells from the centre of each Gaussian peak showed the drebrin centre to be 170 nm from the plasma membrane centre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The centre of the f-actin or drebrin Gaussian peaks was, on average, between 400 and 430 nm from

slow imaging speeds and high photobleaching, but LLS microscopy allowed us to probe the dynamic relationship of microtubule plus ends with drebrin E-enriched regions of the proximal leading process.

 Taken together, our LLS and SR-SIM imaging reveal a hitherto unappreciated cytoskeletal architecture in the CGN proximal leading process in which the drebrin f-actinmicrotubule binding protein

system that recapitulates the migration patterns of developing CGNs in vivo, that is, tangential migration near the cerebellar surface followed by radial migration away from the EGL and then across

#@NEW_LINE#@#  After 2 days of ex vivo culture, CGNs transfected with the control shRNA had migrated into deeper layers of the organotypic slices, whereas drebrin silencing decreased CGN migration toward the IGL (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next evaluated drebrin function by a dominant-negative approach: overexpression of the drebrin binding region of EB3 (EB3M) titrates drebrin from the plus ends of microtubules, whereas overexpression of the corresponding region of EB1 (EB1M), which cannot bind drebrin, does not41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assayed drebrin plus end-specific functions in CGN GZ

long-term time-lapse microscopy followed by quantitative analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our observations in fixed slices, EB1M-expressing CGNs transitioned to IGL-directed migration after 36 to 48 h of ex vivo culture, whereas EB3M-expressing cells underwent no such transition (Fig 4b, Supplementary Videos 8 and 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the average velocities of EB1M- and EB3M-expressing cells (0.01 m s1 for EB1M versus 0.009 m s1 for EB3M) showed little change, detailed analysis of the migration angles relative to the overall vector of movement showed reduced forward migration efficiency of EB3M-expressing CGNs (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, mean squared displacement (MSD) calculations showed these cells spent more of their migration in a random walk (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, EB3M expression reduced the number of CGNs choosing radial migration angles towards the IGL (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that drebrin loss of

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Time-lapse microscopy in migrating CGNs shows that drebrin translocates to the proximal leading process before CGN somal translocation, thereby revealing potential sites of microtubule and actomyosin coordination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lattice light-sheet microscopy and SR-SIM reveal a novel nanoscale architecture of the CGN proximal leading process, with a layer of cortical actin and drebrin intervening between the microtubule cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In functional studies, drebrin gene silencing and dominant-negative inhibition not only perturb ex vivo CGN migration but also randomize centrosome and somal motility dynamics, a functional reporter for actomyosinmicrotubule interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we discovered a functional antagonism between drebrin and the Siah2 E3 ubiquitin ligase that restrains CGN GZ exit, neurite extension, and two-stroke motility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the proximal leading process represents a region of active coordination between the microtubule and actomyosin cytoskeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Siah2 regulation of drebrin activity offers insights into how newly differentiated CGNs transition to a two-stroke motility cycle during GZ exit and radial migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The neuronal leading process is the locus for the guidance, adhesion and cytoskeletal events that drive neuronal migration throughout the brain6,8,9,60,61,62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our understanding of the role of leading process microtubule arrays has progressed from investigations into the polarized mechanics of two-stroke motility and the function of cytoplasmic dynein and its cofactors that are mutated in human neuronal migration disorders19,63,64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other cell-biological model systems, microtubule tethering to sub-plasma membrane f-actin or scaffolding molecules associated directly with the plasma membrane is essential in order for microtubule motors, such as cytoplasmic dynein, to exert traction forces on microtubule arrays31,65,66.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparison, how and where microtubules interface with the cell cortex, or f-actin cytoskeleton in migrating neurons is not well understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, f-actin, f-actin regulatory proteins and f-actin-associated motors are located in the proximal leading process cytoplasmic dilation in an increasing number of neurons and, as with cytoplasmic dynein, the actomyosin cytoskeleton coordinates centrosome positioning and the polarity of two-stroke motility, suggesting there is functional crosstalk in the proximal leading process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These findings prompted us to examine the relationship of the plasma membrane, the microtubules, f-actin and the drebrin microtubuleactin crosslinking protein in live CGNs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a novel combination of imaging probes and super-resolution imaging technologies to gain insights into microtubule-actomyosin cooperation during two-stroke motility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, super-resolution imaging revealed an intervening layer of f-actin and drebrin between the plasma membrane and the longitudinal core of the microtubules in the centre of the leading process or EB3-labelled +TIPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dynamic live-cell imaging with LLS microscopy and the absence of potential fixation artifacts showed that plasma membranemicrotubule displacement occurs throughout multiple stages of the CGN migration cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although classical electron microscopy studies noted significant displacement between sites of neuron-glial apposition and microtubules27, our findings define a hitherto unappreciated nanoscale architecture of the proximal leading process in which all the major cytoskeletal components were determined precisely by imaging probes, suggesting that a microtubule interface with the proximal leading process plasma membrane is unlikely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Non-super-resolution imaging of IQGAP67 and APC68 function implied that the leading process tip harbours microtubule tethering sites; however, questions regarding the relationship of microtubules to the plasma membrane or f-actin-rich cortex, the nanoscale architecture of these sites in live cells, and the mechanism of microtubule tethering in the proximal leading process were unaddressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intervening layer of f-actin and the drebrin microtubuleactin crosslinker indicate that (1) the proximal leading process/cytoplasmic dilation is a novel microtubule tethering site, as suggested by Vallee et al.31 and (2) the microtubule interface in the proximal leading process is probably submembranous f-actin and associated proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cytoskeletal architecture is reminiscent of the relationship between f-actin and microtubules in growth cones, wherein f-actin corrals microtubules, and factors such as drebrin are proposed to enhance the affinity of interactions between these two cytoskeletal polymers42,69.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Drebrin was an attractive molecular entry point to probe microtubuleactomyosin interactions in migrating neurons as it binds both f-actin and EB3, can recruit microtubules into f-actin-enriched regions in growth cones or dendritic spines, and modulates migration in developing oculomotor neurons or SVZ neuroblasts41,43,44,45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Little is known about the microtubule-coordinating activities of drebrin in migrating neurons, despite studies demonstrating its necessity for efficient tangential and radial migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Time-lapse analysis of drebrin localization via LLS microscopy revealed a dynamic transfer of drebrin from the neuronal soma to the proximal leading process before nucleokinesis that is similar to leading-process f-actin flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Drebrin silencing or dominant-negative inhibition of EB3drebrin interaction randomized CGN motility in ex vivo slice preparations, leading to a failure to transition to radial migration directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mechanistic imaging studies show that drebrin loss of function and inhibition of drebrinEB3 interactions not only randomize the direction of both phases of the two-stroke motility cycle but also disrupt the positioning of photoactivated fiduciary marks placed on the microtubule cytoskeleton in the proximal leading process while leaving the overall structure of leading process f-actin intact (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our -tubulin photoactivation protocol first revealed the predicted translocation of the microtubule arrays in the neuronal leading process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the average velocity of microtubule translocation in wild-type CGNs (0.011 m s1) is nearly identical to that of centrosome translocation and slightly slower than that of f-actin flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results show that the proximal leading process is a specialized site for microtubulef-actin interactions that is required to direct the polarity of the two-stroke motility cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As f-actin is present before drebrin translocation, the dynamic recruitment of drebrin to the proximal leading process/cytoplasmic dilation suggests that it is an adaptable scaffold coupling f-actin flow to microtubule positioning at key points in the movement cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent traction force microscopy studies demonstrating contractile units at the leading process tip and proximal leading process have interesting implications for microtubule tethering in the leading process40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present work showing drebrin function in the proximal leading process, together with earlier studies showing IQGAP67 or APC68 function at the leading process tip, suggests that the leading process contains distinct microtubule tethering factors near each contractile unit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As drebrin binds to the side of actin filaments, it is well positioned to coordinate microtubulef-actin interactions in the proximal leading process70.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also note in some cases a limited amount drebrin or microtubule plus ends are located in other regions of migrating CGNs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While evidence for actin flow and drebrin function in the leading process is strong, we cannot rule out additional contributions of the drebrin/plus tip system in these other sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most relevant is drebrin/EB3 localization to the distal tip of the leading process as drebrin in this region may act as was described in previous studies in the growth cone where it supports process extension41,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also possible that random nuclear movement could be due to drebrin function in the cell body and not just randomization of the centrosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Site-specific drebrin inactivation may be required to answer these detailed mechanistic questions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Drebrin is regulated through alternative splicing44 or phosphorylation of its serine 142 residue by CDK5 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate functional antagonism between drebrin and the Siah2 E3 ubiquitin ligase that controls GZ exit of differentiating CGNs, under the control of the Shh mitogen that regulates GNP proliferation and differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not only do drebrin loss of function and Siah2 gain of function phenocopy at the level of morphology, migration and two-stroke motility, and drebrin activity is required for Siah2 loss of function induced GZ exit, but drebrin NxN, with a mutated Siah degron sequence, also rescues most Siah gain-of-function phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, drebrin NxN expression in GNPs, that express low levels of drebrin, induces early GZ exit, demonstrating that drebrin activity is not only essential for IGL directed migration but is also sufficient to initiate the move to a final position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results represent a novel mechanism regulating drebrin function and provide an example of how the cytoskeletal regulatory mechanisms that govern the key processes in two-stroke motility are controlled during neuronal differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In future studies, it will be interesting to define whether proper leading process formation, bipolar
