Projection-type see-through holographic three-dimensional display  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Owing to the limited spatio-temporal resolution of display devices, dynamic holographic three-dimensional displays suffer from a critical trade-off between the display size and the visual angle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show a projection-type holographic three-dimensional display, in which a digitally designed holographic optical element and a digital holographic projection technique are combined to increase both factors at the same time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the experiment, the enlarged holographic image, which is twice as large as the original display device, projected on the screen of the digitally designed holographic optical element was concentrated at the target observation area so as to increase the visual angle, which is six times as large as that for a general holographic display.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the display size and the visual angle can be designed independently, the proposed system will accelerate the adoption of holographic three-dimensional displays in industrial applications, such as digital signage, in-car head-up displays, smart-glasses and head-mounted displays.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Technology that can achieve three-dimensional (3D) images floating in air an important goal in display research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since holography is the only technique that can reproduce all the depth cues in the human visual system, holography is the most promising technology for realizing 3D visualization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Static hologram print services have already been commercialized1,2, and 3D models designed in computer graphics can be printed out as full-colour holograms based on the well-known holographic stereogram (HS) technique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, dynamic holographic displays are still at the research stage, and there are not yet any practical systems on the market.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mark-1 developed by a group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was a pioneering technology, and it achieved 3D reconstruction covering a 25 × 25 × 25 mm volume in full-colour with a viewing angle of 15° by employing horizontal parallax only3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since then, many research groups have attempted to improve various quality factors of holographic displays via a number of approaches, such as the tiling of spatial light modulators (SLMs) to expand the display size4 or the viewing angle5,6, the horizontal parallax only approach to markedly reduce the cost of calculating the hologram data and increase the horizontal viewing angle7, eye-tracking to reduce the computational cost8, the use of updatable photosensitive materials to overcome the resolution limitation of current SLMs9 and so forth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'From the viewpoint of the practical use of holographic 3D displays, it is important to be able to freely design the display size and the visual angle to view the entire display area to realize a wide range of applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as long as display devices having severe spatio-temporal resolution limitations are used in hologram reconstruction, we still face the inherent trade-off between the display size and the maximum diffraction angle of the controllable light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A small diffraction angle results in a small visual angle, since these angles are identical when the hologram on the display device is illuminated by a plane wave.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This trade-off between the display size and the visual angle has been well formulated, as the theory of the space-bandwidth product (SBP)10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One approach to overcoming this problem so as to increase both the display size and the visual angle at the same time is to concentrate the reconstructed light at a target observation area by using a convex lens11 or a custom-designed mirror12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is costly to fabricate these optical elements with a diameter large enough to cover the whole display, and in addition, the design of the display system, such as the location of the observation area, is quite limited due to the limitations of the optical characteristics of general optical elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In 1977, Komar13 proposed a primary concept of holographic projection with a holographic screen as a holographic cinematography technique, in which an analogue holographic image recorded on a 70 mm hologram film was projected on the holographic screen by a projector lens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The projected image was then reflected to the assumed observation point by a screen function that is a replica of a large concave mirror.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In that paper, however, Komar pointed out several problems, namely, the difficulty of fabricating a large holographic screen, the severe image distortions of 3D space owing to the mismatch between the axial and lateral dimensions caused by the enlarged projection, and the image distortion due to observation of the hologram screen from an oblique direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recently, digital holographic projection methods in which a two-dimensional (2D) image reproduced by holographic reconstruction of digital hologram data is projected on a diffuse screen have been proposed14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Image size zooming and focusing can be controlled during the holographic data calculation process, and this is expected to simplify and reduce the size of current 2D projectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these approaches cannot realize 3D reconstruction, since the directionality of the holographic reconstructed light is lost due to the use of a diffuse screen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A screen based on a holographic optical element (HOE) would be well suited for realizing 3D reconstruction using holographic projection because of its potential to possess arbitrary optical characteristics at multiple wavelengths for a full-colour display system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in common HOE fabrication methods, the optical characteristic of the HOE is once analogy shaped by using an optical element then recorded into a hologram, and thus, the achievable optical functions are limited to those approximating real optical elements for 3D display applications17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also difficult to fabricate large HOEs due to the difficulty of forming such a large wavefront in the recording process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, to overcome the difficulty of large HOE fabrication, Bruder et al.18 have reported a new HOE fabrication technique, in which the divided wavefront of the desired optical function is reconstructed using computer-generated holograms (CGHs) and then optically recorded in a tiling manner to form the entire size of a transparent-type HOE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report a projection-type holographic 3D display with a high degree of freedom of the display size and visual angle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our display system is achieved by a combination of digital holographic projection and a digitally designed HOE (DDHOE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the DDHOE can have an arbitrary concave reflection function, an enlarged holographic image projected on the screen is concentrated into a target observation area with a large visual angle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach can also resolve the above problems pointed by Komar13, since the DDHOE does not require any large optical elements to form the wavefront of the optical function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the DDHOE can have an appropriate reflection function to cancel out the distortion factor, and digital holographic projection can correct the mismatch of axial and lateral magnifications on the hologram data for distortion-free imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison with Bruders18 technique, because our DDHOE is fabricated in the manner of reflection-type hologram recording, practically no effect on the light coming from behind the HOE can be realized with higher wavelength selectivity, which is an important factor for applications such as see-through 2D or 3D head-up displays and head-mounted displays.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Spatial-temporal limitation of typical holographic displays', 'Consider the simple one-dimensional case as an example (Fig 1a), where the display width, W, is defined as W=p × M, where p is the pixel period and M is the number of pixels in the display device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum diffraction angle, DIF, is defined as DIF=2sin1(/2p), where  is the wavelength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under the condition that a plane wave illuminates the hologram displayed on an SLM, the minimum distance, ZMIN, at which the entire display area can be viewed is given by ZMIN=W/(2tan(DIF/2)), with visual angle VIS identical to the above maximum diffraction angle DIF (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the SBP theory10, a stationary observer is assumed to be in front of the holographic display, as shown in Fig 1a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SBP is a product of the hologram size, given as the space, W, and the maximum spatial frequency of the hologram, given as the bandwidth, fMAX=sin(VIS)/.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bandwidth is not only related to the visual angle, but also defines the sharpness of the reconstructed contents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If W is enlarged by increasing the pixel period, DIF and VIS become small, and vice versa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is clear that the SBP cannot be increased as long as the display resolution M is fixed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even an 8 K (7,680 × 4,320 pixels) display resolution cannot achieve a suitable display size with a visual angle large enough for practical use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case where an 8 K display device with a pixel period of 4.8 m is used, the above parameters in the horizontal direction are W=3.6 cm, DIF=VIS=6.8° and ZMIN=32.4 cm at =532 nm (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If W is doubled to 7.2 cm by increasing the pixel period to P=9.6 m, DIF and VIS are roughly halved to 3.17° and ZMIN becomes 129.8 cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: General electronic holography system and the new approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) ZMIN is the minimum observation distance for viewing the entire display area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a trade-off between the display size W and the visual angle VIS due to the limitation of the maximum diffraction angle DIF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) The new approach combining the digitally designed holographic optical element (DDHOE) screen and the holographic projector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to the arbitrary reflection function of the DDHOE fabricated by a wavefront printing technique20,21,22,23, the holographic image enlarged by projection is concentrated to a target observation area with high freedom in the design of W, VIS and ZMIN.Full size image', 'Digital holographic projection incorporating DDHOE screen', 'The proposed holographic 3D display is constructed with a digital holographic projection technique and a holographic screen of DDHOE (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DDHOE is a kind of HOE, but is fabricated by using a wavefront printing technique20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wavefront printing technique has recently been proposed as a static hologram recording technique for high-definition 3D visualization, in which the wavefronts of 3D objects or scenes are reproduced by CGHs and then recorded as volume holograms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For 3D visualization, owing to the recent progress in high-speed computing techniques, our wavefront printer is capable of printing over 77 billion pixels of wavefront information in a 10 × 10 cm2 hologram (Fig 2a,b)23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By replacing CGHs of 3D objects or scenes with those of the desired optical functions, this technique has the potential to offer reflection-type volume HOEs with digitally designed arbitrary optical characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the DDHOE fabrication process, since the entire hologram recording is divided into sub-regions and executed sequentially in a tiling manner, the HOE size is not limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike recent diffractive optical elements using CGH techniques and fabricated by milling or microlithography24, our DDHOE has low weight, flexibility and wavelength selectivity owing to the use of the volume hologram recorded on a photopolymer holographic recording film, which is one of the requirements for realizing see-through screens for a wide range of applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Some examples of our wavefront printing technique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) 10 ×

DDHOE that will concentrate the large holographic image projected by the holographic projector at the target observation point (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modulation angle, M, in the reflection of the incident light was derived from two factors: the specular direction of the incident light from the centre of the holographic projection, S, and the direction of the assumed observation point, O, from the current sampling point on the DDHOE (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We set the centre of the projection at (x, y, z)=(0, 0, 100 cm) and the observation point at (x, y, z)=(0, 5.9, 20 cm) in the XYZ coordinate system depicted in Fig 3a, in which the origin was set at the centre of the holographic screen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M was then translated into the phase distribution, , and it was encoded into

divided and each sub-hologram data reconstructed part of the object light at 532 nm of wavelength in the same manner as an electronic holography system19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reconstructed each object

full-colour holographic reconstruction in the near future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Design and fabrication of digitally designed holographic optical element.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The reflection

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our display system, namely, holographic projection with a DDHOE as a holographic screen, is one of the improved solutions to overcome the restriction of the pixel resolution of current display devices even though the observable area will be limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proposed system has achieved the twofold enlargement of the display size and the sixfold enlargement of the visual angle compared with a conventional holographic display19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Note that our display does not increase the maximum diffraction angle, that is, the observable area of a holographic image is still limited by the spatio-temporal resolution of current display devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the high degree of freedom of the display size and visual angle of our display system will allow limited, but new practical applications of holographic 3D displays, such as in-car head-up displays, smart-glasses and head-mounted displays; they will permit the design of displays with a narrow observable area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the fabrication of a full-colour display system with a higher diffraction efficiency of the DDHOE will be considered in future work to more clearly show the prospect of our approach for practical use, since several papers25,26 have shown the potential of the fabrication of full-colour and brighter HOEs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, multiple holographic projections from different incident directions to the DDHOE will enable us to extend the observable area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Since the DDHOE has several advantages compared with the general diffractive optical element/HOEs, such as the freedom of applying optical functions without any real optical elements to the object light of an arbitrary wavefront in fabrication, the ease of fabricating large screens and good transparency due to its wavelength selectivity, the applications of the DDHOE are not limited to only holographic 3D displays, but also cover other fields, such as wearable displays, the beam shaping of laser light sources, the formation of reference wavefronts for aspheric and freeform elements in interferometry, and so forth.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
