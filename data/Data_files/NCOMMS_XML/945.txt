Steviol glycosides enhance pancreatic beta-cell function and taste sensation by potentiation of TRPM5 channel activity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Steviol glycosides (SGs), such as stevioside and rebaudioside A, are natural, non-caloric sweet-tasting organic molecules, present in extracts of the scrub plant Stevia rebaudiana, which are widely used as sweeteners in consumer foods and beverages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TRPM5 is a Ca2+-activated cation channel expressed in type II taste receptor cells and pancreatic -cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that stevioside, rebaudioside A and their aglycon steviol potentiate the activity of TRPM5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that SGs potentiate perception of bitter, sweet and umami taste, and enhance glucose-induced insulin secretion in a Trpm5-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Daily consumption of stevioside prevents development of high-fat-diet-induced diabetic hyperglycaemia in wild-type mice, but not in Trpm5/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results elucidate a molecular mechanism of action of SGs and identify TRPM5 as a potential target to prevent and treat type 2 diabetes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Steviol glycosides (SGs) are found in the leaves of a scrub plant native to the subtropical regions of South America, Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stevia extract has been used for centuries as a sweetening food additive in South America1, and was recently approved for this purpose also in the European Union and the United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These molecules have a common aglycone core structure steviol (ent-13-hydroxykaur-16-en-18-oic acid), and differ in their glycosylation pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two major glycosides found in the leaves are stevioside and rebaudioside A2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both taste 200300 times sweeter than sucrose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Non-caloric sweeteners are increasingly introduced into common foods such as diet sodas, cereals and desserts, as sugar replacement, and are for this reason recommended for weight loss and for individuals suffering from glucose intolerance and diabetes3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, stevia extracts might have direct insulinotropic and anti-hyperglycaemic effects in type 2 diabetic animal models4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistic insight into the biological and health effects of Stevia extract and SGs is lacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Taste perception in type II taste receptor cells relies on the activity of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily melastatin member 5 (TRPM5), a monovalent cation channel, activated by a rise in intracellular calcium5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In short, type II taste receptor cells detect sweet, bitter and umami tastants on the tongue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taste specificity of the cell is accomplished by expression of a specific G-protein-coupled receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sweet, bitter and umami taste receptors have a common downstream signal transduction cascade, which consists of the activation of phospholipase C, release of Ca2+ from IP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores and activation of TRPM5 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TRPM5 activity depolarizes the cell, which triggers the voltage-gated channel calcium homeostasis modulator 1 that mediates the release of ATP neurotransmitter, which in turn activates afferent signalling to the brain7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TRPM5 is also present in insulin-producing -cells in the pancreas and in peripheral enteroendocrine cells in the gut5,8,9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed recently that TRPM5 determines the frequency of glucose-induced calcium oscillations of insulin-releasing pancreatic -cells10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the cellular expression and action of TRPM5, the systemic phenotype of Trpm5-deficient mice includes loss of sweet, bitter and umami taste responsiveness13, and decreased glucose tolerance due to impaired glucose-induced insulin release10,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also interesting to note that Trpm5 expression in the small intestine from diabetic patients is negatively correlated with blood glucose concentrations15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, WFS-1 diabetic pancreatic islets show a reduced Trpm5 expression16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, TRPM5 variants are associated with a prediabetic phenotype in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TRPM5 single-nucleotide polymorphisms occurred more often in patients with disturbed insulin secretion, elevated plasma glucose, lower glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) levels and decreased insulin sensitivity17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific TRPM5 polymorphisms showed increased prevalence in patients with obesity-related metabolic syndrome18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of these observations, the hypothesis was developed that TRPM5 might be a pharmacological target for the development of a novel type of insulin secretagogue19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, since pharmacology for TRPM5 is currently limited to fairly non-selective-blocking agents, this hypothesis remained untested22,23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our current results indicate that SGs potentiate TRPM5 ion channel activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, they potentiate the glucose-induced insulin secretion (GIIS) from pancreatic islets and enhance peripheral taste responsiveness in type II taste receptor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chronic stevioside consumption effectively prevents development of high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced diabetes in mice, in a TRPM5-dependent manner.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our results can be summarized as follows: (i) we show that TRPM5 is essential for the biological action of steviol and SGs; (ii) we show that potentiation of TRPM5 ion channel activity by SGs modulates taste responses and insulin release; and (iii) potentiation of TRPM5 activity protects mice against the development of HFD-induced hyperglycaemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data indicate that stevioside, rebaudioside A and their aglycon steviol are novel leads for the further development of antidiabetic drugs targeting TRPM5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the tremendous health cost of type 2 diabetes and that stevioside is a widely used natural product, we believe that stevioside might be a cost-effective compound for the global battle against diabetes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Steviol, stevioside and rebaudioside A are not direct agonists of TRPM5, but potentiate Ca2+-dependent activity of the channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The steviol group of SGs is sufficient for the interaction, but the interaction site on the TRPM5 protein remains unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inside-out patch-clamp experiments indicate that steviol can interact with TRPM5 directly, independent of an intracellular signal transduction pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, our data do not exclude other receptors for SGs, but, as outlined below, our data strongly suggest that TRPM5 is essential for the effect of SGs on taste sensation and glucose-induced insulin secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previously, it was shown that TRPM5 is essential for sweet, bitter and umami taste detection, which are type II taste receptor cell-dependent taste modalities6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stevioside and steviol specifically enhance these modalities in WT mice: avoidance of a bitter compound (quinine) and preference for sweet (sucrose) and umami (MKG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sour taste (which is TRPM5-independent6) is not affected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of steviol and SGs on taste is divergent, in a sense that avoidance and preference are intensified depending on the tastant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observation that taste preference is markedly affected as short as 5 min into the preference test, excludes a significant contribution of post-ingestive effects independent of acute tasting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our data are consistent with the model that TRPM5-mediated depolarization of type II taste receptor cells serves as the link between taste receptor activation and initiation of afferent signalling via ATP release from these cells, and that SG-mediated potentiation of TRPM5 activity potentiates this signalling pathway (Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data identify steviol as a novel, potent and specific modulator of bitter, sweet and umami taste, which is taste neutral on itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is tempting to speculate that the extreme sweetness of SGs originates likely from a dual interaction with the sweet taste receptor but also via potentiation of TRPM5 channel activity, via its steviol core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 9: Schematic overview of intracellular pathways in type II taste receptor cells and pancreatic -cells.Important factors in the regulation of taste perception and insulin secretion, relevant for this work, are highlighted in this figure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effects of stevioside through TRPM5 are highlighted with red arrows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In type II taste receptor cells, positive modulation of TRPM5 increases ATP release and afferent signalling from the receptor cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the pancreatic -cell, upon glucose application -cells display parallel Vm and Ca2+cyt oscillations, which drive insulin secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TRPM5 is active during the lag phase in between bursts of action potentials, and determines the frequency of Vm and Ca2+ oscillations, which modulates insulin secretion: enhanced TRPM5 activity results in a higher oscillation frequency, which results in more insulin secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that steviol and its derivatives (for example, stevioside) only enhance TRPM5 activity and insulin secretion, but that glucose is the trigger for cell signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, sulfonylureas such as glibenclamide (not depicted) block KATP channels directly and trigger Ca2+ signalling and insulin secretion independent of glucose transport.Full size image', 'Steviol and SGs augment glucose-induced Ca2+ oscillations and insulin release in WT pancreatic islets, but not Trpm5/ islets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are consistent with the idea that TRPM5 serves as a facilitator of fast glucose-induced Ca2+ oscillations, which trigger insulin release (Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model was originally proposed from our analysis of Trpm5/ mice10, and SGs are the first compounds that can validate this hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth noting that steviol and SGs yield a very similar effect as GLP-1 on glucose-induced Ca2+ oscillations in islets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Shigeto et al.32 could show that TRPM5 is directly involved in the signal transduction in the pancreatic -cell elicited by GLP-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This further supports the similar action of TRPM5 activators and GLP-1R agonists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data exclude that the GLP-1R is involved in the functional effect of steviol and SGs on pancreatic islets, as the effect of stevioside and GLP-1 is additive, and the stevioside effect is not affected by a GLP-1R blocker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The dosage of stevioside used in the drinking water of mice in both our drinking test and during the HFD experiments was 124 M or 100 mg l1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This concentration is half of the maximum allowed dosage of SGs in soft drinks allowed in the European Union, and  less_than 25% of the suggested maximal dose by the World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consumption of this dosage of stevioside in the drinking water resulted in a plasma concentration of 396 nM steviol in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that also at these physiological concentrations steviol has clear effect on glucose-induced Ca2+ signalling in pancreatic islets, indicating that the dosages of stevioside that we use are realistic and physiologically relevant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It has been suggested that SGs interact with the mammalian sweet taste receptor, TAS1R2/TAS1R3 (refs 29, 30) and ATP-sensitive K+ channels in pancreatic -cells41, which might explain some of the data we observe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our results exclude that the potentiating effect of steviol and stevioside on pancreatic islet function is mediated via the TAS1R2/TAS1R3 receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed essentially the same effect of steviol and stevioside on Ca2+ signalling in Tas1r2,Tas1r3(/)2, as in WT islets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observation that stevioside does not induce Ca2+ signals and insulin release in pancreatic islets in low-glucose conditions (3 mM) argues against the idea that stevioside would be a direct blocker of ATP-sensitive K+ channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Acute oral administration of stevioside reduces hyperglycaemia in a GTT in WT, but not in Trpm5/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the same effect is present in alloxan-diabetic WT-recipient mice that received WT islets, but not in WT-recipient mice that received Trpm5/ islets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shows that the glucose-lowering effect of stevioside is dependent on the expression of TRPM5 in pancreatic islets, and not from a TRPM5-dependent action in peripheral tissue outside of the pancreatic islet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Long-term oral intake of stevioside improves the development of plasma hyperglycaemia in WT mice on HFD, but not in Trpm5/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no difference in the development of insulin resistance in the control and stevioside-treated group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HFD-induced obesity in mice is commonly used for the development of insulin resistance and IGT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because obesity is induced via food-intake/composition and not by genetic manipulation, this model is considered to be relevant for the human condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, two studies suggest that Trpm5/ mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity; in Larsson et al.42 on a HFD and in Glendinning et al.43 on a carbohydrate-based diet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in both studies, Trpm5/ mice had a significantly lower caloric intake, which could explain the apparent resistance to obesity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, WT and Trpm5/ mice had the same caloric intake and gained the same amount of weight on HFD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Similar as GLP-1, stevioside treatment is weight neutral or even slightly limits weight gain during HFD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, stevioside and steviol do not induce hypoglycaemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stevioside enhances the physiological profile of insulin secretion, instead of inducing increased plasma insulin levels independent of plasma-glucose concentrations, as sulfonylureas and exogenous insulin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this respect, we propose that TRPM5-potentiating compounds might be functionally equivalent to GLP-1 mimetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GLP-1R agonists are highly successful in diabetes care.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The drawback of current GLP-1R agonists is the way of administration, as they are often injectables, the high price and the short time of action44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although advances are being made in improving GLP-1R agonists, the identification of TRPM5 as a new pharmacological target with an analogous mode of action broadens the possibilities for drug development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Considering the epidemiological development of type 2 diabetes and
