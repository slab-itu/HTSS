Syntrophic anaerobic photosynthesis via direct interspecies electron transfer  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Microbial phototrophs, key primary producers on Earth, use H2O, H2, H2S and other reduced inorganic compounds as electron donors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe a form of metabolism linking anoxygenic photosynthesis to anaerobic respiration that we call syntrophic anaerobic photosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that photoautotrophy in the green sulfur bacterium Prosthecochloris aestaurii can be driven by either electrons from a solid electrode or acetate oxidation via direct interspecies electron transfer from a heterotrophic partner bacterium, Geobacter sulfurreducens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photosynthetic growth of P. aestuarii using reductant provided by either an electrode or syntrophy is robust and light-dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, P. aestuarii does not grow in co-culture with a G. sulfurreducens mutant lacking a trans-outer membrane porin-cytochrome protein complex required for direct intercellular electron transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Syntrophic anaerobic photosynthesis is therefore a carbon cycling process that could take place in anoxic environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process could be exploited for biotechnological applications, such as waste treatment and bioenergy production, using engineered phototrophic microbial communities.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Photosynthetic CO2 fixation by cyanobacteria (oxygenic phototrophs), and purple and green sulfur bacteria (anoxygenic phototrophs) accounts for nearly one-half of global primary productivity1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Major electron donors for anoxygenic photosynthesisan anaerobic processinclude reduced inorganic compounds such as H2S, So, H2 and Fe2+(2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In anoxic environments, electrons flow between microbes that form intimate syntrophic consortia to support complementary metabolisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps the most intriguing of these electron flow mechanisms is the discovery of direct interspecies electron transfer, a process in which electrons are carried between cells through physical contact of conductive electron carriers3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some examples include anaerobic ethanol oxidation by consortia composed of two Geobacter species5 and the conversion of ethanol to methane by co-cultures of Geobacter species, and methanogenic Archaea such as Methanosaeta6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although studies have suggested that direct interspecies electron transfer is common in anoxic methanogenic environments3,4,7,8,9, whether related phenomena are more widespread, including in illuminated anoxic environments, is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we investigate this possibility and report the discovery of a new form of syntrophic metabolism, syntrophic anaerobic photosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that photoautotrophy in the green sulfur bacterium Prosthecochloris aestaurii can be driven by either electrons from a solid electrode or acetate oxidation via direct interspecies electron transfer from a heterotrophic partner bacterium, Geobacter sulfurreducens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both interspecies electron transfer between G. sulfurreducens and P. aestuarii, and electron uptake by P. aestuarii are light-dependent processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Light is required to drive photosynthetic metabolism in the phototroph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discovery of syntrophic anaerobic photosynthesis reveals new possibilities for bioengineering phototrophic microbial communities for applications in the areas of waste treatment and bioenergy production.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Electrode as electron donor for P. aestuarii', 'Until now, the purple non-sulfur bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris TIE-1 has been the only phototroph known to be able to assimilate electrons from a solid electrode10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A few studies also suggested that some anaerobic phototrophs in a mixed culture are capable of using an electrode as an electron donor for photosynthesis11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, neither the mechanisms nor the phototrophs responsible for electron exchange with electrodes have yet been identified, leaving an open question of whether other phototrophs can also capture electrons directly from a solid electrode for photosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a previous study on electron transfer in a microbial mat harvested from Hot Lakean episomitic lake in northern Washington (WA, USA)we found the green sulfur bacterium Prosthecochloris aestuarii to predominate at the tip of a carbon microelectrode inserted into the illuminated mat13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In subsequent experiments, a pure culture of P. aestuarii was isolated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P. aestuarii can grow photoautotrophically utilizing sulfide or elemental sulfur (So) as an electron donor14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies have described several sulfur-oxidizing bacteria that are also capable of donating/accepting electrons from an electrode15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether the Hot Lake P. aestuarii can also utilize electrons from a solid electrode, we inoculated it into a sterile, two-chamber bioelectrochemical system containing growth medium in which CO2 was the sole carbon source with it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrode was polarized at 600 mVAg/AgCl (slightly lower than the redox potential of H2S (Eo So/H2S479 mVAg/AgCl)), and electron transfer from the electrode was assessed as cathodic current.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A light-dependent cathodic current was detected that gradually increased over 24 h; after 17 days, the current reached 104 A (36.74 A cm2) (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This electron uptake rate with a phototroph is well above that previously achieved with R. palustris TIE-1 (1.5 A cm2)10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The continued development of cathodic current after medium exchanges indicates that no soluble electron shuttles are required for electron uptake by P. aestuarii (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Solid electrode as electron

on the electrode (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To examine whether molecular hydrogen (H2) mediated electron transfer between the electrode and P. aestuarii, we inoculated medium containing H2 as the sole electron donor under illumination with P. aestuarii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P. aestuarii did not grow under these conditions, even after prolonged incubation ( greater than 10 days), indicating that this phototroph cannot use H2 as an electron donor for photosynthesis (Supplementary Fig 2a) and that uptake of electrons from the electrode was not mediated by H2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Co-culture of P. aestuarii with G. sulfurreducens', 'Bolstered by our findings with electrode-dependent photosynthesis by P. aestuarii (Fig 1), we investigated the possibility that this organism could be grown in co-culture with a heterotrophic partner bacterium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to transferring electrons to other bacterial species, the anaerobic and chemoheterotrophic bacterium Geobacter sulfurreducens can donate electrons to a solid electrode17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since our experiments showed that P. aestuarii grew photoautotrophically using the electrons supplied by an electrode (Fig 1), we hypothesized that G. sulfurreducens could also donate electrons to cells of P. aestuarii to support the growth of both species under conditions in which neither could grow independently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this, we cultivated the two organisms in an illuminated, anoxic medium containing acetate but devoid of HS, So or any other potential electron donors or acceptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A small amount of thiosulfate (0.5 mM) was added as a source of sulfur for biosynthetic needs; however, thiosulfate is used neither as a photosynthetic electron donor by P. aestuarii14,20 nor as an electron acceptor by G. sulfurreducens21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since P. aestuarii is unable to fix CO2 in the absence of HS or S0 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14) and G. sulfurreducens is unable to oxidize acetate in the absence of an electron acceptor, we reasoned that if a co-culture containing both organisms grew, it must be the result of interspecies electron transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In these co-culture experiments, growth did indeed occur concomitantly with acetate consumption (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both P. aestuarii and G. sulfurreducens grew within the co-culture, as evidenced both by flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig 3) and electron microscopy (Fig 2ce), in which the morphologically distinct species could be quantified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TEM whole mount images of P. aestuarii (P.a) and G. sulfurreducens (G.s) co-cultures also displayed intimate cell connections, possibly functioning in electron transfers from G. sulfurreducens to P. aestuarii (Fig 2d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The changes of acetate consumption and cell density when switching the co-cultures from dark to illuminated condition and vice versa (Fig 3) suggest that the syntrophic growth between G. sulfurreducens and P. aestuarii is strictly light-dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Syntrophic growth of G. sulfurreducens and P. aestuarii.Variation in (a) cell

containing acetate, they continued to grow and consume acetate (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the syntrophic interaction was stable over multiple generations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slower increase of biomass in subcultures than in original co-cultures is likely due to the cell density in the co-culture inoculum being lower than that in the two pure cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that growth of the co-culture represents a previously unrecognized form of anoxygenic photosynthesis that exploits the complementary metabolisms of a heterotroph and a phototroph to the benefit of both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because growth of the co-culture strictly depends on the metabolic activities of each partner bacterium, we term this process as syntrophic anaerobic photosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Direct electron transfer supports syntrophic anaerobic photosynthesis', 'Although our co-culture experiments revealed a metabolic interdependency between a chemotroph and a phototroph, the mechanism of electron transfer remained unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemically mediated interspecies electron transfer via exchange of a soluble organic compound such as formate, or of H2, was a possible mechanism for the transfer of electrons from G. sulfurreducens to P. aestuarii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this was eliminated as a possibility in our co-cultures because P. aestuarii is unable to use H2 or formate as an electron donor (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three additional lines of evidence support our conclusion that the metabolic interdependency between G. sulfurreducens and P. aestuarii is not the result of a soluble electron carrier but instead requires cellcell contact and direct interspecies electron transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the two organisms did not grow when cultured in the same medium but physically separated into two chambers by membrane filters (0.1-m pore size), whereas a parallel culture containing both organisms in the same reactor grew (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, in contrast to co-cultures with wild-type G. sulfurreducens under identical conditions, co-cultures of P. aestuarii and a G. sulfurreducens deletion mutant lacking the ombB-omaB-omcB-orfS-ombC-omaC-omcC gene cluster did not grow and acetate was not consumed (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ombB-omaB-omcB-orfS-ombC-omaC-omcC gene cluster encodes a trans-outer membrane porin-cytochrome protein complex essential for extracellular electron transfer by G. sulfurreducens to solid electron acceptors such as ferrihydrite22 or a solid electrode (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kanamycin (200 g ml1) was added to the culture in order to maintain the ombB-omaB-omcB-orfS-ombC-omaC-omcC mutant of G. sulfurreducens; however, it did not affect the growth of this strain of P. aestuarii, which we found to be naturally kanamycin-resistant (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, when the G. sulfurreducens mutant was genetically complemented with the ombB-omaB-omcB gene cluster, which was previously shown to restore extracellular electron transfer capacity to Fe3+(22) and electrodes (Fig 4a), and then tested in the co-culture setup, light-dependent acetate consumption resumed (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Current production and acetate consumption in co-culture by mutant and

Fe(III) oxide) and other organisms23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electron micrographs of the co-culture showed intimate connections between cells of G. sulfurreducens and P. aestaurii (Supplementary Fig 6a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Connections included cell-to-cell contacts between the naturally protruding prosthecae of the phototroph and the cell surface and cell appendages of G. sulfurreducens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, haem-stained cell preparations from the co-culture showed an abundance of haem-stained filamentous structures that connected the cells (Supplementary Fig 6c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of these structures suggests that electron transfer between cells of G. sulfurreducens and P. aestaurii is mediated by haem-containing proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Based upon these results, we propose a conceptual model for direct interspecies electron transfer between G. sulfurreducens and P. aestuarii in syntrophic anaerobic photosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electrons originating from acetate are transferred from the heterotroph to the autotroph and used by the latter to fix CO2 into cell material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transfer benefits both organisms because it allows G. sulfurreducens to oxidize acetate as an electron donor and dispose of the electrons to an electron acceptor (the steps necessary to drive its bioenergetics), while simultaneously supplying the electrons needed by P. aestaurii to support photoautotrophic metabolism (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated that P. aestuarii can obtain electrons from electrodes that were polarized at 600 mVAg/AgCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  G. sulfurreducens is well known for its ability to transfer metabolic electrons directly to extracellular electron acceptors including electrodes17,21,23,24,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the formal potential of the G. sulfurreducens biofilm grown on the surface of an electrode was shown to be around 400 mVAg/AgCl (refs 17, 26, 27, 28), some studies have suggested that this bacterium can adjust its redox activity to the potential of the electron acceptor12,18,19,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, G. sulfurreducens is capable of reducing elemental sulfur21, which is a known electron donor for P. aestuarii14,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is likely that in the co-culture the potential of G. sulfurreducens was lowered sufficiently for it to serve as a donor for P. aestuarii photosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Conceptual model of syntrophic anaerobic photosynthesis of G. sulfurreducens and P. aestuarii via direct electron transfer.Syntrophic growth of both species is supported through acetate oxidation by the heterotroph and CO2 reduction by the phototroph.Full size image', 'We here demonstrated the growth of a photoautotroph supported by direct electron transfer from a heterotrophic partner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several recent studies point to syntrophic interspecies electron transfers between various anaerobes as a major means of heterotrophic carbon metabolism in anoxic microbial habitats3,4,8,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Syntrophic anaerobic photosynthesis broadens this concept to include electron transfer from heterotrophs to phototrophs and reveals a previously unknown form of syntrophy that links anaerobic photosynthesis directly to anaerobic organic carbon metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, although demonstrated here with the morphologically distinct green bacterium Prosthecochloris, we suspect that other species of green (and even purple) bacteriaorganisms that are widely distributed in nature2may also establish direct interspecies electron transfer relationships with electrogenic heterotrophic partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'From an ecological perspective, syntrophic anaerobic photosynthesis could represent an important form of carbon metabolism in the anoxic zones of poorly mixed freshwater lakes, where sulfide limitations restrict the activities of anoxygenic phototrophs and a shortage of inorganic electron acceptors limits anaerobic respiration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the ecological importance of direct electron transfer between heterotrophs and phototrophs, the discovery of syntrophic anaerobic photosynthesis reveals new possibilities for bioengineering phototrophic microbial communities for applications in the areas of waste treatment and bioenergy production.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Chittenden Scientific Glass, CA, USA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two chambers (100 ml working volume/each), which housed the counter and working electrodes, were separated by a cation-exchange membrane (5.07 cm2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Counter and working electrodes were prepared by soaking ¼-inch-diameter rod-type graphite electrodes in 1 N HCl overnight, followed by sonication twice in 100% ethanol and twice in ultrapure DI water (30 min each).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrodes were immersed in electrolyte, creating a consistent projected surface of 2.83 cm2 for the working electrode and 4.3 cm2 for the counter electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An Ag/AgCl reference electrode was inserted into the working chamber through a sampling port.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The internal resistance of all BESs was  less_than 5 .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All the electrodes (working, reference, and counter electrodes) were electrically connected with potentiostat cables using alligator clips.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before inoculation, the chambers were filled with anaerobic, modified Geobacter medium as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To inoculate, 10 ml of grown P. aestuarii culture were centrifuged and the supernatant was discarded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The suspended cells were suspended in 2 ml of fresh medium and used to inoculate the 100-ml working chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The control experiment was conducted by filtering the supernatant from 10 ml of P. aestuarii culture through a membrane filter (0.22 m) and introducing it into the working chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All experiments were conducted in an anaerobic chamber (to maintain an oxygen-free environment) containing an incandescent 25 W bulb with a constant temperature of 26±0.7 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dark cycle experiments were conducted by covering the BESs with a cardboard box to prevent light exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The working electrode was polarized at 600 mVAg/AgCl using a Gamry R300 (Gamry, PA, USA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For testing the current production from the ombB-omaB-omcB-orfS-ombC-omaC-omcC mutant strain of G. sulfurreducens and the complemented strain into which the ombB-omaB-omcB gene cluster was reintroduced, we used 3-electrode flat-plate reactors (60 ml working volume).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The working electrode was graphite (ground finish isomolded graphite plates, Glassmate grade GM-10, 25 mm × 25 mm × 3 mm, Poco Graphite, Inc., Decatur, TX).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiments were conducted in an incubator (dark, 28±0.5 °C) under continuous sparging with a CO2:N2 (20%:80%) gas mixture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The working electrode was polarized at 300 mVAg/AgCl using a custom-built potentiostat34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reactors were operated in batch mode with the modified Geobacter medium supplied with 10 mM acetate as the sole electron source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Operation of membrane-filter reactors', 'A membrane-filter reactor was used for testing the growth of each of the species physically separated into different chambers but exchanging the same medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reactor was constructed using two vacuum filter holders (Millipore) connected by silicon tubing (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 0.1-m pore size membrane filter was added to each filter holder such that the medium (100 ml) in each chamber was separately inoculated with a pure culture of a single bacterium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The outlet of each filter chamber was pumped (0.15 ml min1) to another one after being filtered a second time through another filter (0.45 m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this setup, the two bacteria were physically separated but the bulk solutions were well mixed to eliminate diffusion times between the G. sulfurreducens and P. aestuarii chambers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'After sterilization and addition of membrane filter, all reactors were moved to the anaerobic chamber and filled with the same modified Geobacter medium containing acetate as the sole electron donor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P. aestuarii and G. sulfurreducens from cultures previously grown with sulfide and acetate/fumarate, respectively, were harvested, washed and introduced into the reactor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first chamber was inoculated with P. aestuarii, while the second chamber was inoculated with G. sulfurreducens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The acetate concentration in each chamber was monitored over time to assay the growth and activity of cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a control experiment, two bacteria were inoculated together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The acetate concentrations of samples from each chamber were monitored using HPLC (UV) as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'All relevant data are available from the authors upon request.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
