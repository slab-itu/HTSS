Large near-term projected snowpack loss over the western United States  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Peak runoff in streams and rivers of the western United States is strongly influenced by melting of accumulated mountain snowpack.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A significant decline in this resource has a direct connection to streamflow, with substantial economic and societal impacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Observations and reanalyses indicate that between the 1980s and 2000s, there was a 1020% loss in the annual maximum amount of water contained in the regions snowpack.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that this loss is consistent with results from a large ensemble of climate simulations forced with natural and anthropogenic changes, but is inconsistent with simulations forced by natural changes alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A further loss of up to 60% is projected within the next 30 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Uncertainties in loss estimates depend on the size and the rate of response to continued anthropogenic forcing and the magnitude and phasing of internal decadal variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The projected losses have serious implications for the hydropower, municipal and agricultural sectors in the region.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'It is well established that the North American continent is warming1, partly due to increasing emissions of well-mixed greenhouse gases2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the winter season, this warming contributed to snowpack loss over the western United States3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also well known that the regions climate is substantially influenced by decadal variability originating in the adjacent Pacific Ocean7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study we employ observations, land surface reanalyses and climate model simulations to characterize the combined influences of decadal variability and external forcing on recently observed and near-term projected changes in snowpack over the western United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recognition of the pronounced influence of decadal variability on regional trends in climate is motivating efforts to generate large initial condition ensembles of global climate model simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These ensembles provide estimates of the relative contributions of internal variability and external forcing to regional-scale climate changes8,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An initial condition ensemble consists of many individual simulations performed with a given coupled climate model; each simulation uses the same external forcing, but is initiated from slightly different conditions of the atmosphere and/or ocean state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each ensemble member has a different realization of internal variability superimposed on the underlying externally forced response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Because of their high computational cost, large ( greater than 10-member) ensembles are rare.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also rare for groups to perform multiple large ensembles, one consisting of simulations with anthropogenic forcing only, and one with simulations incorporating solar and volcanic forcing alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we generate and analyse 50-member anthropogenic and naturally forced ensembles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also rely on a large ensemble of higher-resolution regional climate model simulations driven with the output from the global climate model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although several studies have found an anthropogenic contribution to snowpack loss over the western United States, the combined influences of decadal variability and external forcing remain poorly quantified in observations and near-term projections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we show that losses in regional snowpack over the past few decades are consistent with natural and anthropogenic changes, but are inconsistent with natural changes alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We predict an additional loss of snowpack water storage of up to 60% within the next three decades due to combined influences from anthropogenic forcing and internal decadal variability.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Observed snowpack loss', 'Observations of snow water equivalent (SWE) were acquired from the United States Natural Resource Conservation Service Snow Telemetry (SnoTel) network of automated snow pillow measurements across alpine sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These measurements were taken from a quality-controlled data set discussed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We restrict our analysis to the post-1981 period since the number of observations before this time is too low to allow calculation of reliable regional averages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monthly-mean (January-May) SnoTel observations are continuously available from 1982 to 2016 at 354 stations with elevations greater than 1,500 m.

this is expressed as the per cent difference between the decadal averages of SWEmax in 19821992 and 20002010 (the first and last decades of the period of maximum overlap).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This multi-decade decline in regional snowpack is consistent with results from refs 13, 14, 15, despite the fact that these studies used different time periods, data sets and metrics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (The sensitivity to the metric used, for example, 1 April SWE or SWEmax, has been discussed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we note that the accumulated SWE over the winter months is primarily controlled by snowfall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant losses in SWE are observed throughout the snowfall season (Supplementary Fig 1) and are not restricted to April, the month typically associated with SWEmax.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Climatology and trend in area-average annual maximum snow water equivalent.The green bars show snow telemetry (SnoTel) ranges (±1 s.d.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  computed from random samples of stations from the SnoTel network (see main text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pink bars show ranges (±1 s.d.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  from four land surface reanalyses (REANAL4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The black ellipse encompasses 95% of the climatology and trend values across 50 simulations of a global climate model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The circles represent the average climatology and trend for SnoTel, REANAL4 and the CanESM2 ALL simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All values in this figure are area averages of annual maximum snow water equivalent (SWEmax) at elevations greater than 1,500 m and north of 30°N and south of 50°N.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The period considered is the maximally overlapping period from 1982 to 2010.Full size image', 'We also consider a group of four gridded SWE data sets obtained from reanalysis products (hereafter referred to as REANAL4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These four data sets have been assessed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17 over the common period of availability from 1982 to 2010.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the SnoTel measurements provide a purely observational perspective, the REANAL4 group has been produced using snow schemes of varying complexity embedded in land surface models forced by meteorological reanalyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following data sets were used: (1) the Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18);

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our analysis makes innovative use of a large ensemble of simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ensemble was generated with the same climate model and external forcings, but with each ensemble member commencing from slightly different initial conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ensemble provides estimates of the relative contributions of internal variability and external forcing to near-term loss of regional snowpack over the western United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over this region, and over a relatively short (ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30-year) time horizon, decadal variability may offset some of the anthropogenically forced loss in snowpack.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of greater concern, however, is that decadal variability has the potential to substantially enhance the near-term decline in snowpack expected in response to anthropogenic forcing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These reductions in snowpack water storage have broad implications for future forest productivity and carbon storage30, forest vulnerability to fire31, as well as streamflow and water supply32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such sensitivities should be carefully considered in mitigating climate risks, particularly in the context of water resource and land management in the western United States.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
