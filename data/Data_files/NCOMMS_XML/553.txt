Genome-wide compendium and functional assessment of in vivo heart enhancers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Whole-genome sequencing is identifying growing numbers of non-coding variants in human disease studies, but the lack of accurate functional annotations prevents their interpretation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We describe the genome-wide landscape of distant-acting enhancers active in the developing and adult human heart, an organ whose impairment is a predominant cause of mortality and morbidity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using integrative analysis of  greater than 35 epigenomic data sets from mouse and human pre- and postnatal hearts we created a comprehensive reference of  greater than 80,000 putative human heart enhancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To illustrate the importance of enhancers in the regulation of genes involved in heart disease, we deleted the mouse orthologs of two human enhancers near cardiac myosin genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, we observe in vivo expression changes and cardiac phenotypes consistent with human heart disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study provides a comprehensive catalogue of human heart enhancers for use in clinical whole-genome sequencing studies and highlights the importance of enhancers for cardiac function.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death worldwide1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diseases of the heart include a spectrum of adult-onset conditions, as well as congenital phenotypes that collectively represent the most common category of severe birth defects2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Causes of heart disease include environmental risk factors1, common variants with moderate effect sizes3, and rare and de novo mutations that cause familial cases with Mendelian inheritance patterns3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular for the latter category, candidate gene sequencing has proven powerful for obtaining molecular diagnoses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, for familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, candidate gene sequencing identifies a clear genetic cause in 60% of patients4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, this approach is by design limited to the coding sequence of candidate genes and fails to identify non-coding mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can in principle detect non-coding mutations and is becoming increasingly adopted for patients with unexplained heart disease5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, early WGS studies illustrate major challenges in the interpretation of non-coding variants, and particularly of rare non-coding variants6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of accurate annotations linking non-coding loci to in vivo functions, non-coding WGS findings are largely uninterpretable and, thereby, most cases with non-coding mutations remain unresolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To address the pressing need for a high-quality, genome-wide annotation of functional non-coding sequences active in the developing and adult heart, in the present study we describe a comprehensive catalogue of more than 80,000 candidate distant-acting cardiac enhancers (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enhancers are a major category of non-coding regulatory elements that activate gene expression from a distance in a cell type-specific7 and temporally restricted8 manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are hypothesized to play a major role in development and disease, and sequence variants that alter enhancer function are associated with a variety of human phenotypes (for example, refs 9, 10, 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We derived the heart enhancer compendium from more than three dozen epigenomic data sets mapping enhancer-associated chromatin marks in developing and adult heart tissue from mice and humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This catalogue of human heart enhancers can be easily and immediately implemented in human disease studies, and to further facilitate its utilization in clinical studies, we provide confidence scores for each predicted enhancer that correlate strongly with in vivo validation rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that more than 2,000 human variants implicated in heart-related phenotypes through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), either directly as lead variants or indirectly by linkage disequilibrium (LD), fall into putative heart enhancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anticipating downstream validation of WGS studies, which will likely focus first on regulatory sequences near genes already implicated in disease, we experimentally validated putative enhancers and provide in vivo characterization of more than 20 novel cardiovascular enhancers near known heart disease genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, as there remains a limited understanding of the general phenotypic impact of lost or impaired enhancer function, we deleted two enhancers near heart disease genes in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, we observed loss of target gene expression, as well as cardiac phenotypes consistent with heart disease in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results highlight the functional importance of enhancers for normal heart function, as well as the potential contribution of enhancer mutations to heart disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Generation and validation of a genome-wide cardiac enhancer catalogue.Integrative analysis of  greater than 35 epigenomic data sets from ex vivo human and mouse heart tissue resulted in a catalogue of  greater than 80,000 putative human heart enhancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate the utility of this catalogue for the discovery of enhancers near heart disease-associated genes by characterizing the in vivo activity patterns of 22 novel cardiovascular enhancers in transgenic mouse assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show the functional importance of enhancers by deleting two cardiac enhancers, which resulted in reduced gene expression and impaired cardiac function.Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Genome-wide mapping of heart enhancers', 'Genome-wide profiling of enhancer-associated proteins and histone modifications such as p300/CBP or H3K27ac via chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq directly applied to primary tissue is a powerful approach for the identification of in vivo enhancers12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial application of this technique to cardiac tissue samples established the general utility of the method for the identification of heart enhancers, but detected only modestly sized sets of candidate enhancers due to limited sampling14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To generate a comprehensive genome-wide catalogue of cardiac enhancers in the human genome that can easily be incorporated into human disease studies, we integrated epigenomic data from multiple developmental stages and all major anatomical subregions of the heart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, we examined  greater than 35 genome-wide p300/CBP and/or H3K27ac profiles from different ex vivo cardiac tissue samples, nearly all of which are known to be or presumed to be normal (see Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1 for tissue information and data sources)8,14,15,16,17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sampled conditions include prenatal human heart, major anatomical subregions of childhood and adult human hearts, and a closely spaced developmental time series of prenatal and postnatal mouse heart (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the inclusion of mouse samples could create bias towards the prediction of more highly conserved enhancers (see Supplementary Note 1), it allows for better discovery of enhancers active exclusively during prenatal development, a timespan for which there is only a single human data set considered for analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To enable integrative analysis across samples and antibodies, all raw data was analysed using a uniform processing pipeline (see the Methods section, Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because H3K27ac and p300 are associated with both enhancer and promoter sequences20,21, we excluded peaks overlapping promoters, defined as those centred within 1.5 kb of a gene transcription start site (TSS; promoters and their scores are included separately in Supplementary Data 1 but were not further evaluated).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peaks identified in mouse samples were mapped to the human genome (see Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Merging the peaks from all data sets resulted in a single list of 82,119 unique candidate heart enhancers in the human genome (Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nearly all ( greater than 95%) of the putative enhancers were  less_than 10 kb in size (Supplementary Fig 2a), and most (85%) were smaller than 5 kb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 3,677 candidate enhancer regions  greater than 10 kb were identified, consistent with previous observations of subsets of very long enhancers that may form central nodes of tissue-specific regulatory networks (Supplementary Note 2)22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Data sets included in the integrative epigenomic analysis.Full size table', 'Two initial lines of evidence support that this catalogue is comprised of cardiac-specific enhancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, gene ontology analysis23 showed that the identified regions are highly enriched near genes with relevant functions (Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, 11 out of the 12 most enriched human phenotypes represent cardiovascular conditions (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, 152 out of 170 (89%) heart enhancers reported in the VISTA Enhancer Browser, a large collection of in vivo enhancers validated in transgenic mice24, are identified as candidate heart enhancers in the present catalogue (Fig 2a, Supplementary Fig 2b, Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This high rediscovery rate highlights the sensitivity of the approach and suggests that most known heart enhancers are recovered by the integrative analysis in the present study.

using various additional criteria (for example, transcription factor (TF) binding and DNase hypersensitivity (DHS))25 and/or supervised analysis methods trained on experimentally validated enhancer sets26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess whether additional types of data sets or methods would substantially improve enhancer prediction, we first performed a similar integrative analysis using available human and mouse heart DHS and TF data sets (data sets and their references are listed in Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, DHS and TF ChIP-seq identify sets of loci that substantially overlap those captured by H3K27ac and p300 (Supplementary Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those sites displaying DHS or TF binding in the absence of H3K27ac or p300 are not associated with cardiac-specific function, suggesting they do not identify cardiac enhancers missed by our integrative H3K27ac and p300 analysis (Supplementary Fig 3c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We additionally found that our unsupervised approach performs with an accuracy similar to EMERGE (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26) and EnhancerFinder (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27), supervised methods for enhancer prediction (Supplementary Table 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our analysis, using a large number of data sets and relatively permissive criteria for the identification of candidate heart enhancers, identifies a considerable proportion of the human genome (264 Mb or 8% of the total genome) as potential enhancers under at least one of the conditions studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, individual predicted enhancer sequences vary substantially in the strength of the supporting evidence, which includes the intensity of ChIP-seq signal in individual data sets (peak scores), as well as recurrent observation of the same peak across multiple cardiac source tissues (Fig 2b, top).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that these differences provide a means to distinguish higher- from lower-confidence predictions, allowing for rational experimental prioritization of candidate sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such evidence-based ranking is critical because WGS studies identify far more rare and de novo non-coding variants than can be reasonably followed up experimentally6, even with emerging high-throughput methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We developed confidence scores to assess the support for a putative enhancer based on two criteria: (1) the statistical significance of the ChIP-seq enrichment observed at a locus and (2) the number of conditions under which a putative enhancer is observed (Methods section, Fig 2b,c and Supplementary Data 2, Supplementary Note 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each predicted enhancer sequence we provide a combined score, on a scale from 0 (weakest evidence) to 1 (strongest evidence), reflecting the strength of evidence from all data sets combined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enhancer usage has previously been shown to be temporally dynamic, with the majority of enhancers not active throughout the entirety of development8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we have also provided scores from prenatal data alone and postnatal data alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These stage-specific scores may be more applicable for studies, respectively, of congenital heart diseases, which typically present around birth, and phenotypes, such as coronary artery disease, that have adult onset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We assessed the validity and utility of the confidence scores by comparing the genome-wide compendium against the collection of  greater than 2,000 experimentally tested enhancers available in the VISTA Enhancer Browser24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of the previously validated heart enhancers were retrospectively confirmed to be among the highest-ranking scored loci in the present study (Fig 2d), and validation rates correlated positively with confidence scores (Fig 2c, also see Supplementary Note 3, Supplementary Fig 4, Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, this retrospective analysis shows that the scoring scheme is a good indicator of the likelihood that a putative enhancer is active in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As an example of how this cardiac compendium can be integrated into human disease studies, we intersected it with variants associated with a variety of heart-related phenotypes reported in the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Including all variants in strong LD with the reported lead variants (r20.8), more than 18,000 sequence variants are associated with human heart phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 2,300 of these fall within a predicted heart enhancer, with 900 in predicted enhancers that have a score of at least 0.2 (ranked list and corresponding heart enhancer scores provided in Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This includes a variety of loci where protein-altering variants have not been identified to explain the association signal, such as (1) the 6q22 region near GJA1 that has been strongly implicated in heart rate29, (2) the 1p32 region overlapping PLPP3 implicated in coronary artery disease30 and (3) the 15q24 locus containing HCN4 implicated in atrial fibrillation31 (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of the GJA1 locus, more than 200 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) fall within multiple phenotype-associated LD blocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intersecting those SNPs with the heart enhancer compendium identified 11 variants that fall within predicted enhancers, including one in a very high-scoring element (score=0.719).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a number that is tractable to downstream experimental validation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of the HCN4 locus, the strongest scoring putative enhancer in the region (score=0.313) includes a SNP (rs7172038) in perfect LD (r2=1) with the reported lead variant (rs7164883), and we included this enhancer in the functional validation performed below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the heart enhancer compendium can be easily intersected with human disease data to identify strong candidates for further experimental validation and should help prioritize enhancer sequence variants found in human resequencing studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In vivo validation of heart enhancers near disease genes', 'Given the large number of rare and de novo non-coding sequence variants that are identified in WGS studies, initial analyses will likely focus on characterizing variants in putative enhancers near genes previously implicated in heart disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore the utility of the heart enhancer compendium for identifying in vivo enhancers near genes of interest, we examined 58 candidate sequences in transgenic mouse enhancer assays32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The selected regions spanned the full range of combined cardiac integrative analysis scores and were all located within 100 kb of a heart disease-associated gene (Supplementary Data 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the close proximity, there is evidence from the chromatinchromatin spatial interaction database34 that most of the tested sites physically interact with the putative target gene (Supplementary Data 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, 22 of the tested sequences drove reproducible reporter gene expression in the developing heart or blood vessels at embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) (Fig 3, Supplementary Data 4 and Supplementary Table 6), including the enhancer upstream of HCN4 that overlaps with a variant associated with atrial fibrilation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This enhancer had strong activity in the ventricles and weaker but reproducible activity in the atria (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examples of additional newly identified in vivo-validated cardiac enhancers include elements near TGFB3 (Fig 3c) and PRKAG2 (Fig 3d), two genes previously implicated in heart disease35,36 but without known associated distant-acting heart enhancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we characterized new enhancers near genes such as GATA4 (Fig 3f, Supplementary Table 6), where several in vivo enhancers had been previously identified15,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall transgenic validation rate (38% with cardiovascular activity) is somewhat lower than that reported by previous heart enhancer validation efforts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in large part due to our inclusion of candidate sequences from across the scoring range, in contrast to previous efforts, which tended toward validating loci with high ChIP-seq enrichment scores14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as expected, elements that were confirmed as in vivo cardiovascular enhancers had a higher average combined confidence score than those for which no cardiovascular activity was observed (mean combined scores: cardiovascular positive=0.509, cardiovascular negative=0.385, P=0.021, one-tailed t-test; Supplementary Data 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results illustrate the utility of the genome-wide scored data sets for identification of in vivo cardiac enhancers near heart disease genes of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: In vivo activity of human heart enhancers near heart disease genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (af) Whole mount (left), heart close up (top right) and

enhancer is sufficient to activate tissue-specific gene expression, it does not illuminate whether a sequence is necessary for proper development or health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such information is, however, crucial to understanding the phenotypic consequences of non-coding mutations in the human genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the biological necessity of heart enhancers for proper cardiac development and function, we created knockout mouse models for two different heart enhancers, mm77 and mm771, upstream of Myl2 and Myh7, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations in either of these genes are associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and their coding sequences are routinely screened for mutations in the clinic4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both enhancers fall in regions with very high

#@NEW_LINE#@#  In mice homozygous null for mm77, Myl2 RNA expression is reduced by 7580% compared with wild-type levels at both E11.5 and in adulthood (both P less_than 4.9 × 1019, see the Methods section, Fig 4c, Supplementary Fig 9, Supplementary Data 5), establishing that Myl2 is a direct regulatory target and that the enhancer is required for normal expression of Myl2 in both embryonic and adult heart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to Myl2, embryonic and adult mm77-null animals show a deficit of Ubc, a ubiquitin gene more than 3 Mb away from the enhancer (both P less_than 5.3 × 1011).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Embryonic mm771 mice show downregulation of Myh7 by 85% compared with wild-type (P=5.7 × 1024) but show no change in Myh6 or any other gene in cis, indicating that the enhancer

expression were observed in adult mm771 mice (Supplementary Fig 10a, Supplementary Data 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cases, the expression changes observed by RNA-seq were confirmed by targeted quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR; Fig 4e,f, Supplementary Figs 9c and 10b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the affected myosin genes, gene expression changes are dose dependent, with heterozygotes having a reduction in myosin gene expression by 35% compared with wild-type (mm77: P=2.7 × 105, mm771: P=9.6 × 103, one-tailed t-test, Fig 4e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next examined whether these mRNA expression changes result in decreased myosin protein abundance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot analysis on whole-heart tissue established that both enhancer deletions result in 70% reduction of cardiac protein levels (Myl2, P=2.1 × 103; Myh7, P=1.7 × 104, one-tailed t-test; Fig 4gj, Supplementary Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cumulatively, these results show that mm77 and mm771 are required for normal levels of Myl2 and Myh7 protein in the heart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To evaluate potential cardiac dysfunction resulting from the loss of the Myl2 or Myh7 enhancer, we performed histological and pathological analysis on both lines (Supplementary Data 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In heart tissue from both mm77 and mm771 mice, we observed cases of myocardiocyte disarray and karyomegaly (cell nucleus

'Technological advances have enabled routine WGS for the study of human disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, initial WGS analyses have focused primarily, or exclusively, on the  less_than 2% of the genome that encodes proteins6,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the strong contribution of non-coding sequences in many human disease traits is now widely recognized41, the skew towards coding sequence in the analysis of WGS data persists because of a lack of annotations and analytical tools to assess whether rare non-coding mutations are associated with phenotypes6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we begin to fill this void by generating a comprehensive compendium of more than 80,000 enhancers predicted to be active in the developing and adult human heart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since these sequences represent functional units with defined boundaries, this allows for the binning of rare non-coding variants for association testing, analogous to aggregating coding variants by gene42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To facilitate the prioritization of non-coding regions for experimental follow-up studies, each predicted enhancer is provided along with a confidence score summarizing the strength of the supporting epigenomic evidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the present study focuses on a single organ system of major epidemiological importance, the approach described here is applicable to nearly all human organ systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we expect that similar resources for other phenotype-relevant tissues will serve as a critical foundation for the analysis of genetic data from many additional classes of human disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Non-coding sequence annotation is a critical first step for interpreting whole-genome sequence data but is generally insufficient to conclusively implicate specific mutations as causal in disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One powerful complementary approach is through the use of genome engineering in animal models to formally test the importance of a sequence change in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we illustrate how enhancers identified using genome-wide approaches can be prioritized and assessed for normal organismal function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Focusing on two heart enhancers located near disease-associated genes, we show in mouse models how their loss of function results in cardiac phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While a few enhancers previously knocked-out in mice have the potential to result in cardiac phenotypes (for example, refs 43, 44), to our knowledge, the Myl2 and Myh7 enhancers are the first examples whose loss has been shown to result in a phenotype consistent with heart disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the recent advances in genome editing technology45, it appears likely that in vivo engineering approaches will be increasingly used for large-scale modelling of both coding and non-coding human mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, this study highlights the important role enhancers play in cardiac health and provides a valuable compendium of human heart enhancers that can be easily integrated into cardiovascular disease studies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
