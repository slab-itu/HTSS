Chirality-driven orbital magnetic moments as a new probe for topological magnetic structures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'When electrons are driven through unconventional magnetic structures, such as skyrmions, they experience emergent electromagnetic fields that originate several Hall effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Independently, ground-state emergent magnetic fields can also lead to orbital magnetism, even without the spinorbit interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The close parallel between the geometric theories of the Hall effects and of the orbital magnetization raises the question: does a skyrmion display topological orbital magnetism?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we first address the smallest systems with nonvanishing emergent magnetic field, trimers, characterizing the orbital magnetic properties from first-principles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Armed with this understanding, we study the orbital magnetism of skyrmions and demonstrate that the contribution driven by the emergent magnetic field is topological.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that the topological contribution to the orbital moment does not change under continuous deformations of the magnetic structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we use it to propose a new experimental protocol for the identification of topological magnetic structures, by soft X-ray spectroscopy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The magnetic moment has two contributions: the spin magnetic moment and the orbital magnetic moment, which are due to lifting of spin and orbital degeneracy, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The familiar mechanism lifting the orbital degeneracy is the spinorbit coupling (SOC), , which leads to an orbital moment (L) tied to the spin moment (S).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  is the strength of the SOC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more general picture emerges by analogy with the classic orbital moment, a closed current loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In quantum physics, ground states hosting bound currents also require lifting of orbital degeneracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such ground-state currents have been proposed for magnetic structures where the magnetic moments do not all lie in the same plane, that is, with nonvanishing scalar spin chirality, C123=S1·(S2 × S3)0 (refs 1, 2, 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ground-state magnetic structures with C1230 can be stabilized by SOC-driven interactions, such as the magnetic anisotropy or the DzyaloshinskiiMoriya interaction, or by interactions independent of SOC, such as frustrated bilinear exchange interactions4 or higher-order exchange interactions, exemplified by the biquadratic and four-spin interactions5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, electronic structure calculations have predicted orbital moments without SOC6,7,8, but the properties of the orbital moments and their usefulness are unexplained and unexplored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Electrons flowing through a magnetic system couple to emergent electromagnetic fields, leading to several Hall effects9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noncoplanar magnetic structures (C1230) have a finite emergent magnetic field in their ground state10, with the most well-known examples being skyrmions13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scalar spin chirality, C123, is closely related to the emergent magnetic field11,12, a natural concept in the geometric theories of the Hall effects and orbital magnetization17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The net flux of the emergent magnetic field in a skyrmion is quantized and corresponds to the topological charge or skyrmion number of the magnetic structure10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7 suggested a link between the emergent magnetic field and orbital moments, but did not atttempt to investigate it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Possible consequences of the topological properties of the magnetic structure on the orbital magnetism remain open.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Establishing the topological character of a given magnetic structure experimentally is challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The topological Hall effect, driven by the emergent magnetic field, is the most direct signature, but all other contributions to the Hall signal have to be unpicked and carefully subtracted9,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The topology can also be ascertained via full knowledge of the three-dimensional magnetic structure, which can be mapped via small-angle neutron scattering14, Lorentz force microscopy15, scanning tunnelling microscopy20 and soft X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) adapted for microscopy21,22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All these techniques focus on the spin magnetism, ignoring the orbital aspect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this work, we consider three aspects of the chirality-driven orbital moment physics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we characterize their properties using symmetry and the underlying electronic structure, clearly separating the SOC-driven from the chirality-driven orbital moments, by performing first-principles calculations for magnetic trimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, we show that the chirality-driven orbital moments inherit the topological properties of the magnetic structure that generates them, focusing on skyrmionic structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Last, we exploit the distinct properties of the chirality- and SOC-driven orbital moments to propose a new experimental protocol, based on XMCD, that can directly establish whether a given sample has a topological magnetic structure.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Chirality-driven orbital moments in magnetic trimers', 'A nonvanishing scalar spin chirality requires at least three magnetic atoms, so as prototypes we take magnetic trimers formed by Cr, Mn, Fe and Co atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are supported on the Cu(111) surface (see Fig 1a for the atomic structure), a common choice of substrate with weak SOC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electronic structure of a target magnetic state is found using constrained density functional theory (DFT) calculations25,26,27 (see Methods and Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three kinds of magnetic structures are considered: ferromagnetic (F), chiral right-handed (R) and chiral left-handed (L) (Fig 1bd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the orbital moments depend on the chirality of the magnetic state (C1230), the R and L structures should show dissimilar behaviour; the F structures serve as reference (C123=0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Atomic and magnetic structures of trimers on Cu(111).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a)

we consider the Fe trimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Varying the polar angle  from 0 to 90° brings the spin moments from pointing normal to the surface to lie in the surface plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spin moment of Fe #1 follows the same angular path for all three kinds of magnetic structures, as emphasized in Fig 1bd.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 2a, we focus on the projection of its orbital moment on the z axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find a nearly cos  dependence for the F angular sweep, as the orbital moment follows the direction of the spin moment very closely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the two chiral structures show opposite deviations from the F curve, with their average leading to a cos -like trend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2b reveals that the difference between the R and L curves has a distinct angular dependence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Redoing the calculations without SOC, the orbital moment for the F structure vanishes, while the orbital moments for R and L are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign, reproducing the orbital moment difference computed with SOC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate that the orbital moment comprises two parts: a SOC-driven part, dominated by the local atomic SOC; and a nonlocal chirality-driven part (C123), determined by the entire magnetic structure of the trimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the magnetic structure is chiral, that is, C1230, but SOC is absent, the

trimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The properties of the chiral orbital moments depend on the electronic structure of the trimers (Supplementary Figs 1 and 2; Supplementary Note 1), in particular on which orbitals are near the Fermi energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fe3 and Co3 have partially filled d-states, with orbital degeneracies that can be easily lifted by the SOC or by the chiral magnetic structure, leading to sizeable orbital moments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Cr3 and Mn3 are close to half-filling, and so the orbital moments are one order of magnitude smaller.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orientation of the chiral orbital moment depends additionally on the local site symmetry (here Cs; the global symmetry of the trimer is C3v).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Counterintuitively, and in contrast to the SOC-driven orbital moment, the chiral orbital moment is independent of the absolute real-space orientation of the spin moments: if all spin moments are rotated together in a way that leaves C123 unchanged, the chiral orbital moment is also unchanged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Chirality-driven topological orbital moments in skyrmions', 'Armed with our understanding of the chirality-driven orbital moments provided

theoretical input, only the ability to drive a sample from a reference ferromagnetic state into a (possibly unknown) noncollinear state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the TOMR is finite and also insensitive to

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have shown that orbital magnetic moments arise in magnetic materials not only from the spinorbit interaction but also from the emergent magnetic field due to nonvanishing scalar spin chirality of the magnetic structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chirality-driven orbital magnetic moments have properties distinct from the SOC-driven ones, and have comparable magnitudes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only requirement is a finite scalar spin chirality, so they should be present both in small clusters, wires, thin films and in bulk samples, as long as the spin structure is noncoplanar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For topological magnetic structures, the chirality-driven orbital magnetic moments inherit the underlying topology through the emergent magnetic flux that drives them, and so can be used to fingerprint skyrmionic magnetic structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These topological chiral orbital moments do not change appreciably under deformations of the spin structure that leave its topology unchanged, in contrast to the usual SOC-driven ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They present a new way to characterize and investigate candidate materials for skyrmionic applications, via experimental determination of their orbital magnetic properties, with soft X-ray or other appropriate optical measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a different perspective, comparing the spin and orbital magnetic moment distributions yields a real-space map of the emergent magnetic field in topological magnetic structures.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
