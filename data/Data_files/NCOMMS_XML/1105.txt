Cascaded spintronic logic with low-dimensional carbon  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Remarkable breakthroughs have established the functionality of graphene and carbon nanotube transistors as replacements to silicon in conventional computing structures, and numerous spintronic logic gates have been presented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, an efficient cascaded logic structure that exploits electron spin has not yet been demonstrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, we introduce and analyse a cascaded spintronic computing system composed solely of low-dimensional carbon materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose a spintronic switch based on the recent discovery of negative magnetoresistance in graphene nanoribbons, and demonstrate its feasibility through tight-binding calculations of the band structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Covalently connected carbon nanotubes create magnetic fields through graphene nanoribbons, cascading logic gates through incoherent spintronic switching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exceptional material properties of carbon materials permit Terahertz operation and two orders of magnitude decrease in power-delay product compared to cutting-edge microprocessors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hope to inspire the fabrication of these cascaded logic circuits to stimulate a transformative generation of energy-efficient computing.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Manipulation of the spin-degree of freedom for spintronic computing requires the invention of unconventional logic families to harness the unique mechanisms of spintronic switching devices1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cascading, one device directly driving another device, has been well known as a major challenge and fundamental requirement of a logic family since von Neumanns15 1945 proposal for a stored-program electronic computer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the input and output signals are not of the same type and magnitude, it is difficult to connect devices without an additional device for translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This extra device consumes power, time and area, and severely degrades the utility of the logic family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we present an alternative paradigm for computing: all-carbon spin logic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cascaded logic family creatively applies recent nanotechnological advances to efficiently achieve high-performance computing using only low-dimensional carbon materials16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A spintronic switching device is proposed utilizing the negative magnetoresistance of graphene nanoribbon (GNR) transistors25,26,27,28,29 and partially unzipped carbon nanotubes (CNTs)30,31, unzipped30,32,33,34,35 from metallic CNT interconnect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These carbon gates can be cascaded directly; no additional intermediate devices are required between logic gates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The physical parameters necessary for proper switching operation are evaluated through mean-field tight-binding calculations of the band structure to enable an analysis of computational efficiency and to provide guidance for an experimental proof of concept.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results demonstrate the potential for compact all-carbon spin logic circuits with Terahertz operating speeds and two orders of magnitude improvement in power-delay product, thus motivating further investigation of the proposed device and computational structure.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

#@NEW_LINE#@#  The gate voltage is held constant, and the GNR conductivity is therefore modulated solely by the magnetic fields generated by the CNTs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These magnetic fields can flip the orientation of the strong on-site magnetization at the GNR edges, which display local antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering due to Hubbard interactions36 (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2, the magnetization at each edge is controlled by its neighbouring CNT, with magnetization decaying towards the centre of the GNR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of an external magnetic field or with edge magnetizations of opposite polarities, the GNR exhibits global AFM ordering in the ground state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significantly, GNRs with edge magnetizations of the same polarity exhibit global ferromagnetic (FM) ordering in the ground state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: All-carbon spin logic gate.Magnetoresistive GNR unzipped from carbon nanotube and controlled by two parallel CNTs on an

conductivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Zeeman interaction can switch the magnetic ground state, causing spin-dependent band splitting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are conduction modes in the FM state for all energies, but no conduction modes in the AFM state for Fermi energy EF within the AFM state bandgap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By tuning EF into the AFM bandgap through control of the gate voltage, the application of magnetic fields at the GNR edges causes a colossal change in conductivity, switching the GNR from the resistive AFM state to a conductive FM state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, if EF is outside the AFM bandgap, conduction modes are always available, and switching of the magnetic ordering does not cause a change in conductivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is one possible explanation for the lack of magnetoresistance observed by Bai et al.28 when applying an in-plane magnetic field to a GNR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be further noted that given the proximity between the CNTs and GNR, the attractive van der Waals and repulsive Casimir forces may alter the electronic wavefunctions and energy dispersion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these effects do not change the nature of the highly conductive CNT transport, nor the electronelectron repulsion among lattice sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the spontaneous AFM ordering and edge magnetization are not sufficiently affected to alter the GNR magnetoresistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Edge effects and operation temperature', 'The spin-dependent band splitting is strongest with pristine zigzag edges37 as achieved in ref.

perturbation in the magnetic ordering around these defects37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the magnetic state is quickly regained within two unit cells ( less_than 1 nm) from the defect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the switching mechanism persists with defect spacing  greater than 3 nm, increasing the magnitude of the critical magnetic field for large defect density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the magnetic ordering originates from the GNR edges, it is not affected significantly by defects present away from the edges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of very rough edges, a lack of sufficient contiguous zigzag

order of 1 nm around the defect location37, this abundance of zigzag edges of 5 nm or larger elicits strong magnetic ordering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sufficient contiguous zigzag edges between defects thus enable a persistence of the magnetic order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Yazyev39 indicated a GNR Curie temperature near 10 K, below which the spin correlation length grows exponentially.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At temperatures around 70 K, correlation lengths are on the order of 10 nm, presenting a limitation for device operation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correlation length approaches 1 nm at room temperature,

The magnetic instability energy is dependent on the GNR width (Supplementary Note 1), and determines the edge magnetic field required to switch the global ground state from AFM to FM ordering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3c,d, the CNT current sufficient to overcome the magnetic instability energy is strongly affected by the proximity of the CNT control wires to the GNR edges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current requirement can be tuned through control of the Hubbard U parameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The required current ranges from exceptionally small magnitudes to significant fractions of an Ampere, and can be minimized with a wide GNR positioned close to the CNT control wires.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the GNR width is increased, the magnetic instability energy decreases as nearly the

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'While these circuits may be implemented with other materials exhibiting high conductivity and negative magnetoresistance, the exceptional properties of CNTs and GNRs make these structures ideal candidates for use in this logic family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current is the state variable in all-carbon spin logic, enabling exceptionally fast computation with switching delay determined by electromagnetic wave propagation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in stark contrast to conventional computing systems in which voltage is the state variable, leading to CMOS switching and RLC interconnect delays limited by charge transfer and accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As described by Fig 5, the GNR conductivity switches far faster than the signal can propagate through the CNTs48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The all-carbon spin logic switching time td=tmag+tgnr+tprop is the summation of the times required for a CNT current to switch a magnetic field in a neighbouring GNR (tmag), the GNR magnetoresistance to switch in response to a magnetic field (tgnr) and the electric field to propagate through the CNT to switch the current (tprop).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The propagation time tprop is significantly larger than tmag and tgnr, and therefore determines td.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electromagnetic wave propagation speed in a CNT is , where LK=400 pH nm1 is the kinetic inductance and CQ=0.4 aF nm1 is the quantum capacitance48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For 400 nm CNT interconnect length lcnt, the worst-case logic gate switching time is .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-performance circuits operating with clock frequencies of 2 THz can therefore be realized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average power dissipation per logic gate is , given a differential supply voltage Vsupply=V+V=1 V and an on-state current Ion=IC20 A sufficiently small to flow through a single-walled CNT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The power-delay product for each gate, a metric of computing efficiency, can be determined for all-carbon spin logic as PDP=Ptd5 × 1018 J.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is approximately 100 times more energy-efficient than 22 nm CMOS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Analysis of switching and propagation delay.Following a switch in the current through CNT0 at a time t=0, the magnetic field at the edge of GNR1 switches at t=tmag, the resistance of GNR1 switches at t=tmag+tgnr and the current through CNT1 switches at t=tmag+tgnr+tprop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This marks the end of one complete switching and propagation cycle, and is immediately followed by the switching of GNR2.Full size image', 'Furthermore, the power dissipation of all-carbon spin logic is nearly independent of frequency, whereas conventional CMOS circuits dissipate increasing power as clock frequency is increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This two orders of magnitude improvement outweighs the power costs of low-temperature operation and leaves significant room for second-order parasitic effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This direct comparison can be made due to the absence of additional circuitry between logic gates, in contrast to other spintronic logic proposals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, each GNR switching device in the all-carbon spin logic family performs the functionality of between four and twelve CMOS transistors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The one-bit full adder of Fig 4, for example, has only four active GNR gates and a propagation time of 3td, yielding a PDP of 6 × 1017 J.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'All-carbon spin logic permits the development of cascaded spintronic logic circuits composed solely of low-dimensional carbon materials without intermediate circuits between gates, resulting in compact circuits with reduced area that are far more efficient than CMOS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though a complete all-carbon spin logic system is several years away from realization, currently available technology permits experimental proof of the concept as shown in Fig 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By exploiting the exotic behaviour of GNRs and CNTs, all-carbon spin logic enables a spintronic paradigm for the next generation of high-performance computing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Proposed proof-of-concept experiment.By measuring the change in IOUT in response to a change in IIN, the central component of all-carbon spin logic can be demonstrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The carbon nanotube CNTOUT can be partially unzipped such that a portion forms a GNR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second CNT, CNTIN, is then placed nearly parallel to CNTOUT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A constant voltage should be applied across CNTOUT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not necessary to achieve the dimensions described in this work; rather, to make the experiment more facile, CNTIN must merely be close enough to the GNR to cause a measurable response in IOUT when IIN is varied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, as shown in the figure, CNTIN need not be as long as CNTOUT, thereby preventing the CNTs from making contact even if the CNTs are not perfectly parallel.Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
