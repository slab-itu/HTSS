Intracellular mGluR5 plays a critical role in neuropathic pain  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Spinal mGluR5 is a key mediator of neuroplasticity underlying persistent pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although brain mGluR5 is localized on cell surface and intracellular membranes, neither the presence nor physiological role of spinal intracellular mGluR5 is established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that in spinal dorsal horn neurons  greater than 80% of mGluR5 is intracellular, of which 60% is located on nuclear membranes, where activation leads to sustained Ca2+ responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nerve injury inducing nociceptive hypersensitivity also increases the expression of nuclear mGluR5 and receptor-mediated phosphorylated-ERK1/2, Arc/Arg3.1 and c-fos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spinal blockade of intracellular mGluR5 reduces neuropathic pain behaviours and signalling molecules, whereas blockade of cell-surface mGluR5 has little effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decreasing intracellular glutamate via blocking EAAT-3, mimics the effects of intracellular mGluR5 antagonism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings show a direct link between an intracellular GPCR and behavioural expression in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blockade of intracellular mGluR5 represents a new strategy for the development of effective therapies for persistent pain.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Many G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are not only expressed at the cell surface but also on various intracellular membranes including the nucleus1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although intracellular GPCRs have been shown to play critical roles in gene transcription, ionic homeostasis, cell proliferation, neural circuit remodelling and synaptic plasticity2,5,6,7,12, the physiological relevance of intracellular receptors in intact organisms remains unknown1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metabotropic glutamate 5 receptor (mGluR5) is a GPCR associated with both cell surface and intracellular membranes in striatum, hippocampus and visual cortex, where it couples with Gq/11/PLC/IP3 to release cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic calcium (Ca2+)7,8,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intracellular mGluR5 is activated following glutamate transport into the cell via excitatory amino-acid transporters (EAATs), or cysteineglutamate exchangers (xCT), located on cell surface and endoplasmic reticular (ER) membranes8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selective activation of intracellular versus cell-surface mGluR5 triggers unique Ca2+ patterns and downstream signalling cascades associated with each receptor pool7,8,9,10,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'mGluR5 is abundantly expressed in neurons of the spinal cord dorsal horn (SCDH)13,14, which serves as the first CNS relay in the transmission of nociceptive information15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SCDH mGluR5 plays a key role in glutamate-induced plasticity of pain-related processes, including nociceptive hypersensitivity after nerve injury16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, spinal mGluR5 activation induces nociception in normal animals19,20, while its blockade produces analgesia16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite spinal mGluR5s key role in neuropathic pain16,17,18, it remains unknown whether its effects are due to cell surface or intracellular signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we show that mGluR5 and associated effector molecules are increased on SCDH nuclear membranes following spared-nerve injury (SNI), a model of neuropathic pain21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclear receptor-associated generation of downstream messengers are also increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blockade of spinal intracellular mGluR5 inhibits pain behaviours and mGluR5-linked signalling molecules in nerve-injured rats, whereas blockade of cell surface mGluR5 has little effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, inhibition of spinal EAAT3 mimics the effects of intracellular mGluR5 antagonism by preventing intracellular uptake of ligand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate a selective involvement of spinal intracellular mGluR5 in pain processing and provide in vivo evidence for a pathophysiological function of a GPCR associated with intracellular membranes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'SCDH nuclear mGluR5 activates nuclear Ca2+ responses', 'We used immunocytochemistry in neonatal SCDH cultures, as well as sections and cellular fractions of adult lumbar (L4L6) tissue to assess the subcellular distribution of mGluR5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found SCDH cultures expressed mGluR5 on the cell surface, dendrites and on intracellular membranes including the nucleus where mGluR5 colocalized with lamin-B2, a nuclear envelope marker (Fig 1a; upper panels).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detectable mGluR5 staining was seen only on neurons, identified with the neuronal nuclear antigen, NeuN (Fig 1a; lower panels).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on the tissue preparation, mGluR5-positive neurons constituted 30% of the cells plated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electron microscopy was used to assess mGluR5 subcellular localization in adult rat SCDH with pre-embedding, silver-intensified immunogold labelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mGluR5 was detected on the plasma membrane and intracellularly especially on nuclear membranes (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclear mGluR5 was only detected on SCDH neurons; glial and endothelial cell nuclei were not labelled (Fig 1b; Supplementary Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No mGluR5 labelling occurred in the absence of primary antibody (Supplementary Fig 1c), and mGluR5 labelling was prevented by preincubation of primary antibody with a specific mGluR5 blocking peptide (Supplementary Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subfractionation studies showed mGluR5 in both nuclear and plasma membrane fractions, indicated by membrane-specific markers, lamin-B2 and pan-cadherin (Pan-Cad), respectively (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The neuronal sodium-dependent EAAT3 was also found on nuclear and plasma membranes (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio of nuclear to plasma membrane protein was higher for mGluR5 than for EAAT3 (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, mGluR5 is highly expressed on intracellular and especially nuclear membranes of SCDH neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Functional nuclear mGluR5 in SCDH neurons.Fluorescence-microscopy showing (a) mGluR5 (red), Lamin-B2 (green-upper) or NeuN-IR (green-lower) in cultured rat SCDH neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 10 m.

3.3) is membrane permeable7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To directly test whether sodium- or chloride-dependent processes were involved in glutamate, quisqualate, DHPG or LY393053 uptake in SCDH neurons, cultures were treated with radiolabelled ligand in the presence and absence of transport or exchange inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sodium-dependent transporter activity accounted for 80% of glutamate, but only 25% of quisqualate uptake, whereas chloride-dependent uptake, likely via xCT transport, blocked only 20% of glutamate uptake, but 50% of quisqualate uptake (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sodium- and chloride-free conditions reduced quisqualate and glutamate uptake by  greater than 80% (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DHPG and LY393053 did not compete with glutamate uptake, confirming their designation as impermeable, non-transported ligands (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two potent inhibitors of all EAAT subtypes, threo--benzyloxyaspartate (TBOA) and threo--OH-aspartic acid (THA) blocked about 60% of glutamate uptake, whereas L-cystine, a blocker of the xCT exchanger, had no significant effect (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, sodium-dependent, EAAT-mediated activity primarily accounts for intracellular glutamate uptake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Since mGluR5 couples to Gq/11 and PLC to generate IP3-mediated release of Ca2+, we used Ca2+ imaging to test whether activation of intracellular SCDH mGluR5 is functionally active.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SCDH cultures grown on glass coverslips were loaded with the Ca2+ indicator, Oregon Green BAPTA-AM, and subsequently treated with agonists and/or antagonists with variable intracellular access.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bath application of the impermeable, non-transported DHPG (100 M) led to a rapid, transient Ca2+ rise (Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the impermeable, transported agonist, quisqualate (10 M), produced a long, sustained rise in Ca2+ in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, which was terminated by addition of the permeable mGluR5 antagonist, MPEP (10 M; Fig 1h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the impermeable antagonist LY393053 blocked DHPG-mediated Ca2+ responses (Fig 1i), it did not affect those induced by quisqualate (Fig 1j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that functional activity is generated by two separate pools of mGluR5on the cell surface and on intracellular membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although surface receptors always contribute to the time course of the Ca2+ response, their appearance of doing so varies depending on the scan speed at which images are collected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because SCDH mGluR5-positive neurons are not as abundant as in striatal or hippocampal cultures, a scan speed of 5.36 s per scan was used here to capture a larger area with more neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, compiled data in Fig 1k reflect group differences in which the contribution of the surface receptor is obscured due to the slow scan speed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Results from multiple experiments assessing drug-induced changes of both the amplitude of the initial Ca2+ peak and the magnitude of the overall Ca2+ response revealed that DHPG peak amplitudes (for example, Fig 1g) were 61.2±3.56% of the LY393053+quisqualate peak amplitudes (Fig 1j) and that at most the DHPG response constituted 10% (9.79±2.27%) of the overall quisqualate response (4 min).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, during periods of high activity and/or sustained presynaptic glutamate release, intracellular uptake of glutamate can lead to a Ca2+ response that is not only spatially and temporally unique, but also approximately nine times larger than a surface response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Since Oregon Green Bapta AM is a global Ca2+ indicator dye, the specific contribution of nuclear mGluR5 to intracellular Ca2+ changes is equivocal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this we performed two experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, SCDH neurons were transiently transfected with a genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator (pCMV-NL-S-R-GECO) that is restricted to the cell nucleus (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once correct targeting to the nucleus was verified, receptor-mediated Ca2+ responses were determined as before.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the previous data, bath application of the impermeable, non-transported agonist, DHPG, did not induce changes in the nuclear-restricted Ca2+ indicator, whereas quisqualate did (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pretreatment with the cell permeant mGluR5 antagonist fenobam blocked all quisqualate responses (Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To more directly assess nuclear mGluR5 function, isolated nuclei were prepared from P30 L46 SCDH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclei were resuspended in intracellular medium, and Oregon Green BAPTA-AM was allowed to accumulate while nuclei were attaching to coated coverslips (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although heterogeneous, 5 to 10% of isolated nuclei were mGluR5 positive (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quisqualate, but not DHPG, induced a sustained Ca2+ rise (Fig 2f) that could be blocked by fenobam (Fig 2g,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm the presence of mGluR5 on responding nuclei, coverslips were fixed and processed for mGluR5 immunoreactivity combined with lamin B2 staining and then field-relocated immediately following imaging (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Responsive nuclei were always mGluR5 positive, although not all mGluR5-positive nuclei responded, possibly due to damage in the course of nuclear preparation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data unequivocally establish that nuclear mGluR5 is functionally active.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: mGluR5-mediated nuclear Ca2+ changes in SCDH neurons or isolated nuclei.Cultured rat SCDH neurons were transfected with the nuclear-targeted red fluorescent, genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator, CMV-NL-S-R-GECO, on DIV6 and then immunostained or imaged in real time on DIV9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Images of SCDH neurons transfected with CMV-NL-S-R-GECO (red) expressed in neuronal cells (as indicated by MAP2 staining;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Some GPCRs, like mGluR5, are localized on intracellular membranes where, in vitro, they trigger unique signalling effects9,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we found that a membrane permeable agonist activating intracellular SCDH mGluR5 produced sustained Ca2+ responses, whereas an impermeable, non-transported agonist produced transient Ca2+ peaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identical responses were observed in SCDH neurons expressing a genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator restricted to the nucleus, as well as in acutely isolated SCDH nuclei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When activated, the peak amplitude of nuclear Ca2+ responses was 40% higher and ninefold greater than at surface mGluR5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Akin to striatal10 and hippocampal7 receptors, intracellular mGluR5 uses the canonical PLC/IP3R signalling pathway to play a dynamic role in mobilizing Ca2+ in a specific, localized manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using ultrastructural, cellular and pharmacological techniques, we also showed that nerve injury increases nuclear mGluR5 levels, along with the synaptic plasticity effectors pERK1, pERK2, Arc/Arg3.1 and c-fos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Behaviourally, blocking only cell-surface mGluR5 with an impermeable antagonist had little effect on neuropathic pain assays, whereas inhibiting intracellular mGluR5 using a permeable antagonist markedly reduced all pain indices and pERK1, pERK2, Arc and c-fos expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with intracellular mGluR5 driving pain behaviour, blocking glutamate entry into SCDH neurons also produced analgesia and decreased c-fos, whereas blocking glial glutamate transporters increased pain behaviours and c-fos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, these are the first experiments demonstrating a role for an intracellular GPCR in an in vivo behavioural model (see schematic summary diagram in Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although many GPCRs are found on nuclear membranes (for example, receptors for epinephrine, endothelin, platelet-activating-factor and bradykinin), deducing the functional significance of such receptors remains challenging because of limited techniques to probe the nucleus in situ, and since most GPCRs are also present at the cell surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One exception is the 1Aadrenoceptor, which is only detected on nuclear membranes in cardiac myocytes4, where binding results in PKC activation and translocation leading to troponin phosphorylation and sarcomere shortening4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A caged cell-permeable analog of endothelin-1 was used to detect nuclear endothelin receptor-mediated increases of nucleoplasmic Ca2+ in cardiac myocytes after intracellular uncaging5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, activation of the GPCR F2Rl1 anchored at plasma membranes triggered the expression of Ang1, whereas nuclear-activated F2Rl1 induced Vegfa in retinal ganglion cells6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these observations, until now in vivo behavioural outcomes resulting from activation of endogenous intracellular receptors have not been assessed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given that mGluR5 is an important target, many drugs have been optimized for mGluR5 selectivity, affinity, and pharmacokinetic parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although recent compounds34,35,36 have been developed that overcome the off-target effects35 and short-half-lives36 of earlier drugs, little emphasis has been placed on which receptor pool ligands act.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In blocking cell surface mGluR5, the impermeable antagonist, LY393053, demonstrated only weak analgesia in pain models examined here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the cell permeable antagonist, fenobam (a negative allosteric modulator that has both non-competitive antagonist and inverse agonist activity) significantly reduced mechanical allodynia, glutamate-induced pain and c-fos expression in neuropathic rats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that drugs interacting with intracellular mGluR5 are superior against neuropathic pain to those acting at cell surface mGluR5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, while fenobam (IC50 80 nM)37 is more potent than LY393053 (IC50 1.6 M)38,39, we did not see increased analgesic activity when the intrathecal dose of LY393053 was increased from 10 nmoles to 1 mole suggesting that its analgesic effects plateaued at 10 nmoles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the reported IC50 values for LY393053 may be unavoidably high, since this impermeable antagonist was assessed using an assay (PI hydrolysis) that employed the transportable mGluR5 agonist quisqualate38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, these same investigators reported an in vivo ED50 for LY393053 of 654955 fmoles against DHPG-induced PI hydrolysis (that is, when the agonist is impermeable) and 9 nmoles against DHPG-induced seizures, when administered centrally as we did here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fenobam-induced analgesic CPP in neuropathic, but not naive, rats suggests that agents acting at intracellular mGluR5 may produce analgesia with low potential for abuse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, LY393053s lowering of c-jun in SNI rats is consistent with its analgesic effects in acute inflammatory pain38,40, and suggests a minor contribution from cell-surface mGluR5 in persistent pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That LY393053 reduced glutamate-induced c-jun, but not c-fos, while fenobam reduced both, confirms in an in vivo model, our previous demonstration in vitro that separate intracellular cascades are triggered by cell surface and intracellular mGluR5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we previously showed in striatal cultures7,9,12 that cell surface mGluR5 stimulates CAMKIV, p-CREB and c-jun, while intracellular mGluR5 phosphorylates ERK1/2 and Elk-1, and enhances c-fos, erg-1 and Arc/Arg3.1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The importance of intracellular mGluR5 for c-fos induction was further supported here by the significant reduction of glutamate-induced c-fos following EAAT3 inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'EAAT3 inhibition not only replicated the analgesic and c-fos-reducing effects of fenobam, but also explains the paradoxical antinociceptive effects of pan-EAAT inhibitors on persistent pain30,31,32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here a selective EAAT3 inhibitor produced antinociception in SNI rats, whereas EAAT1,2 inhibitors produced pronociception, with similar diverging effects on glutamate-induced pain, mechanical allodynia, CPP and glutamate-induced c-fos expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our c-fos studies, explain recent results showing that intracisternal TBOA significantly increased noxious heat-induced Fos immunoreactivity in the medullary dorsal horn of naive animals, while it significantly reduced this response in animals with earlier inflammation of the vibrissa pad41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, TBOAs c-fos reducing effects in animals with persistent pain are likely due to EAAT3 blockade, while its c-fos enhancing effects in naive animals are likely due to inhibition of EAAT1/2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results refute an alternative hypothesis proposing abnormal reverse-operation of EAAT1,2 in rats with persistent pain31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, our in vivo microdialysis studies demonstrated that EAAT1,2 inhibitors increased spinal extracellular glutamate concentration after noxious stimulation in both sham and SNI rats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data provide direct evidence that neuropathic pain does not depend on reverse-operation of glutamate transporters; rather analgesia is achieved by blocking the transporters responsible for ligand uptake into SCDH neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Intracellular glutamate

immunogold electron microscopy studies indicate that particles representing glutamate are densest in terminal fields reaching 10 mM, whereas far fewer particles are present in somas and/or dendrites and spines (1 mM)43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter studies also show large numbers of gold particles over cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria, ER and the nucleus43,44,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data, combined with glutamates complex metabolism and the myriad of studies demonstrating that it is highly compartmentalized in neurons46,47, suggest that there may be far less free cytoplasmic glutamate than previously suggested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Techniques such as 13C-NMR, 13C- and/or 15N-GC/MS provide compelling evidence that glutamate has many fates within the cell46,47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, a large proportion of extracellular glutamate is transaminated and enters the mitochondria where it serves as a substrate for the tricarboxylic acid cycle46,47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then too, there is growing precedent for many types of ERcell surface contacts that might be specialized for given functions49,50,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether such a relationship exists between EAAT3 and mGluR5 is unknown at this moment and awaits further study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our electron microscopy studies would suggest that there is more nuclear mGluR5 (55%) than there is intracellular (25%), thus the sustained Ca2+ response should be largely due to a nuclear source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we have shown in other studies that hippocampal dendrites7 exhibit intracellular mGluR5 responses mirroring the sustained nuclear Ca2+ release seen here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it seems likely that mGluR5 associated with dendritic ER membranes can also proportionately contribute to the intracellular signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it has also been proposed that glial mGluR5 may contribute to glutamate signalling, evidence for mGluR5 in glia comes mostly from studies of cultured glia52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, although mGluR5 immunostaining has been reported colocalized with markers of astrocytes or microglial in spinal cord, this typically occurs in pathological conditions such as spinal cord injury or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, particularly when there is reactive gliosis53,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we see evidence of reactive astrogliosis in SCDH after SNI, we found very little colocalization of staining for mGluR5 and GFAP (astrocyte marker) in either sham or SNI rats (Supplementary Fig 2e), consistent with an earlier finding showing no change in such colocalization in rat SCDH after nerve root compression55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although our study emphasizes the physiological significance of the two pools of mGluR5, the mechanism by which nuclear mGluR5 is increased in neuropathic rats remains unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altered trafficking and/or scaffolding are suggested by the significantly decreased plasma membrane and cytosolic mGluR5 and increased nuclear receptors in SNI rats (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies suggest the scaffolding proteins Homer 1b/c and Preso1, which interact with mGluR556,57,58, may be critical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, expression of Homer 1b/c is altered in neuropathic rats56, and genetic manipulation of Homer 1b/c or Preso1 significantly affects pain and SCDH Fos57,58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By
