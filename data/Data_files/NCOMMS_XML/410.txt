Targeted proteomics identifies liquid-biopsy signatures for extracapsular prostate cancer  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Biomarkers are rapidly gaining importance in personalized medicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although numerous molecular signatures have been developed over the past decade, there is a lack of overlap and many biomarkers fail to validate in independent patient cohorts and hence are not useful for clinical application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these reasons, identification of novel and robust biomarkers remains a formidable challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We combine targeted proteomics with computational biology to discover robust proteomic signatures for prostate cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative proteomics conducted in expressed prostatic secretions from men with extraprostatic and organ-confined prostate cancers identified 133 differentially expressed proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using synthetic peptides, we evaluate them by targeted proteomics in a 74-patient cohort of expressed prostatic secretions in urine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We quantify a panel of 34 candidates in an independent 207-patient cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We apply machine-learning approaches to develop clinical predictive models for prostate cancer diagnosis and prognosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate that computationally guided proteomics can discover highly accurate non-invasive biomarkers.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The worldwide incidence of prostate cancer has been steadily increasing, but many patients harbour tumours of an indolent nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These indolent tumours grow slowly and pose minimal threat to the life of the patient, in the absence of treatment (that is, are clinically insignificant).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, once prostate cancer begins to grow aggressively, it metastasizes quickly with lethal consequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The management of prostate cancer has become an urgent clinical dilemma with significant over-diagnosis and challenges in predicting patient survival1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prostate cancers are uniquely heterogeneous with major spatial2,3 and temporal4 variability in their genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, once cancer has been confirmed, the optimal course of action is tailored to spare patients with indolent disease from unnecessary procedures, while identifying and treating those who would benefit from treatment intensification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current clinical stratification employs the Gleason score (GS), estimates of tumour size and pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, generating the GS requires obtaining biopsy specimens, a procedure that increases the risk of hospitalizations from post-biopsy complications, posing a significant burden on healthcare and risking serious complications5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, biopsies under-sample the prostate, and significant lesions are frequently missed7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Localized prostate cancer has excellent prognosis, with almost 100% 5-year survival (http://seer.cancer.gov/statistics/summaries.html), but 70% of these men receive early intervention in the form of surgery or radiotherapy8,9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These therapies carry significant morbidities and healthcare costs, and surveillance protocols rely on repeat PSA testing, digital rectal examination (DRE) and multiple biopsies13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A major gap that currently exists in prostate cancer diagnostics is that no accurate biomarkers are available that could overcome these potential complications (that is, invasive and heterogeneity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A fluid-based biomarker would be ideal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Liquid biopsies, such as circulating tumour cells15 and cell-free DNA16, have been proposed as promising non-invasive prostate cancer biomarkers, but their detection and enrichment remain technically challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cataloguing the secreted and soluble factors released into the interstitial fluid that bathes the organ of interest may provide a novel inventory of putative disease biomarkers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have interrogated the collection of proteins comprising a prostate-proximal fluid, expressed prostatic secretions (EPSs)17,18,19,20, that is collected either directly from the prostate before radical prostatectomy (termed: direct EPS) or from post-DRE urine (termed: post-DRE urine or EPS urine).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reproducible detection and quantification of multiple proteins in complex biological matrices is an essential requirement for any potential disease biomarker, but verification of these candidates is a major bottleneck in the pipeline from discovery to clinical implementation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Traditionally, immunoaffinity-based assays, namely, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays are used to validate protein biomarkers, but this approach is time-consuming, costly and relies on the existence of validated antibody pairs for every target protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeted mass spectrometry (MS) offers an alternative approach for the rapid verification of candidate biomarkers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (SRM-MS) is currently the leading method for targeted quantification of proteins via MS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It offers excellent selectivity, sensitivity and throughput, without the need for validated antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we build on our proteomics studies of EPS and systematically develop SRM-MS assays in post-DRE urine samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Step-wise applications of these assays to two independent, richly annotated patient cohorts in conjunction with computational modelling identify liquid-biopsy signatures that accurately distinguish patients with organ-confined (OC) stage pT2 and extracapsular stage pT3 prostate cancers, before radical prostatectomy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data highlight the value of readily accessible tissue proximal fluids and multiplexed quantitative proteomic signatures to identify extracapsular disease before invasive surgery, potentially modifying the treatment options for these patients.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Candidate selection and assay evaluation', 'Our previously generated discovery proteomic profiles from direct EPS derived from extracapsular (EC) or OC prostate cancers laid the foundation for the current project18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative quantification revealed 133 proteins that were significantly differentially expressed between both patient groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These proteins were identified by 1,346 distinct peptide sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data mining of all peptides based on sequence and biophysical properties led to 232 proteotypic peptides (phase 1 peptides) suitable for evaluation by SRM-MS in EPS urine samples (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To abrogate potential confounding influences due to the differing modes of data acquisition (discovery proteomics versus targeted proteomics), instruments (ion trap versus triple quadrupole) and sample types (direct EPS versus EPS urine), all phase 1 peptides were first evaluated for reproducible detection by SRM-MS in EPS urine samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each phase 1 peptide was purchased as a crude heavy-isotope-labelled synthetic peptide and spiked into pooled EPS urine samples to evaluate their suitability for targeted proteomics assays, directly within the biomarker matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Light (endogenous) and heavy (synthetic) peptides were monitored in SRM mode, and data were manually inspected to select peptides that had at least three fragment ions aligned at the expected peptide elution time, had co-eluting light and heavy peptides, had minimal interference and were reproducible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, 147 peptides (63%) met these quality criteria (phase 2 peptides), and were taken forward to an independent cohort of EPS urine samples (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that systematic SRM-MS assay development based on previous discovery proteomics data is rapid and feasible in clinically useful EPS urine samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Systematic development of targeted proteomics assays in EPS urine samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Discovery proteomics data from direct EPS derived from patients with extracapsular (EC) or organ-confined (OC) prostatic tumours was used to select putative candidates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteotypic peptides from these candidates were carefully selected and evaluated by SRM-MS in an EPS urine background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) All peptides that passed the above selection criteria were analysed in clinically stratified EPS urine samples (cohort A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peptide quantification by SRM-MS was performed, and 34 candidates with diagnostic and prognostic potential were identified based on the relative abundance changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Venn diagram depicting the distribution of peptides with diagnostic potential (that is, differential expression in cancer versus controls) and the number of peptides with prognostic potential (that is, differential expression in EC versus OC tumours).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Bar charts depict directional expression of the 34 peptide candidates;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The timely verification of extensive lists of candidate disease biomarkers generated by high-resolution proteomic technologies is becoming increasingly feasible and necessary to identify putative candidates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this, the implementation of biomarkers into clinical practice is largely lagging behind.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is, in part, attributed to the lack of validated methods of candidate testing and further evaluation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeted proteomics by SRM-MS has emerged as the method of choice for candidate protein quantification and verification, due to its relatively low cost and amenability to robust high-throughput assay development workflows26,27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The aim of the current study was to systematically evaluate targeted proteomic assays in a clinically applicable, yet to date rarely utilized tissue proximal fluidEPS urineand develop liquid-biopsy signatures for accurate patient classification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This work is an extension of previously published proteomics data in direct EPS from patients with EC and OC tumours18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The feasibility of obtaining coordinates (peptide elution times and the most intense fragment ions) from different modes of data acquisition and instrumentation was demonstrated by extracting relevant information from shotgun proteomics to lay the foundation for targeted assay development using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By performing multiple rounds of assay refinement and statistical evaluation, we narrowed over 200 promising candidates to 34 peptides with high biomarker potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using heavy-isotope-labelled peptide standards, we estimated and later absolutely quantified these candidates in richly annotated cohorts of EPS urine samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interestingly, a small number of peptides in EPS urine overlapped with those that were previously explored in urine29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cancer-associated proteins that were evaluated in that study were empirically gathered from reports based on protein and nucleic-acid changes in human plasma and tissue29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, we directly compared prostate-proximal fluids from EC and OC tumour groups to derive biomarker candidates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously demonstrated that post-DRE urine samples (EPS urine samples) contain a unique subset of proteins, when compared with matched urine samples from the same patient, supporting our hypothesis that prostate-enriched proteins are released as a result of the DRE19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, applying a subset of our SRM-MS assays to an independent cohort of prostate cancer urine samples (non post-DRE urine samples) demonstrated that the majority of peptides were not quantifiable and likely below our detection limits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A notable finding from the work presented here is the trend towards lower abundance of the majority of candidates with advancing disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, elevated serum levels of PSA are indicative of prostate cancer; however, EPS levels of PSA have been consistently lower in disease involving EC extension (EC and/or pT3)18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, a trend of decreased PSA in EPS urine from cancer patients compared with controls has been noted by Drake et al.31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be indicative of PSA leakage out of the prostate gland and into the circulation32 or by diminished secretory functions that have been observed for high GS tumours, a histology hallmark of which are smaller, rounder glands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, it can be conceptualized that other proteins are escaping the prostate and entering the circulation due to the deteriorating structural integrity of advanced prostate cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It would be beneficial to measure both EPS and serum levels of such proteins from the same patient to further test this observation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the majority of candidate expression levels were in agreement between cohorts A and B, some differences were noted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the protein ANXA3 has one peptide (LTFDEYR) that is upregulated in the EC group of EPS urine samples in cohort A, while the other peptide (SEIDLLDIR) is downregulated in the EC group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could be due to inaccurate quantification, the presence of multiple proteoforms33, post-translational modifications or variations in proteolytic digestion efficiencies of endogenous proteins34,35 and warrant further investigation using additional peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To evaluate the effect of extra peptides from the same protein on risk assessment, we examined the performance of our predictors by adding these additional peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cohort B, there are six proteins (ANXA3, IDHC, PEDF, PRDX6, SERA and TGM4) that each have two unique peptides used in our SRM-MS assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our original predictive models contained both IDHC peptides and one SERA peptide (diagnostic model) and one SERA peptide (prognostic model).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hence evaluated if adding the second SERA peptide would change the performance of our predictors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As it turns out, there is no significant performance change between our original predictors (AUC of 0.79 for diagnosis and 0.77 for prognosis) and the modified prediction models using both peptides (AUC of 0.81 for diagnosis with P value=0.18, AUC of 0.77 for prognosis with P value=0.97, Students t-test;
