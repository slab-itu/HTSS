Live cell imaging of low- and non-repetitive chromosome loci using CRISPR-Cas9  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Imaging chromatin dynamics is crucial to understand genome organization and its role in transcriptional regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, the RNA-guidable feature of CRISPR-Cas9 has been utilized for imaging of chromatin within live cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these methods are mostly applicable to highly repetitive regions, whereas imaging regions with low or no repeats remains as a challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this challenge, we design single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) integrated with up to 16 MS2 binding motifs to enable robust fluorescent signal amplification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These engineered sgRNAs enable multicolour labelling of low-repeat-containing regions using a single sgRNA and of non-repetitive regions with as few as four unique sgRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We achieve tracking of native chromatin loci throughout the cell cycle and determine differential positioning of transcriptionally active and inactive regions in the nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate the feasibility of our approach to monitor the position and dynamics of both repetitive and non-repetitive genomic regions in live cells.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The spatiotemporal organization of chromatin structure plays a critical role in regulating lineage-specific gene expression during cellular differentiation and embryonic development1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Global three-dimensional (3D) genome organization and relative gene positioning have been studied primarily using genome-wide technologies, such as chromosome conformation capturing assays1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These methods have proven instrumental in identifying long-range intra-genomic interactions and cell type-specific global chromatin states1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)2,3,4 has been used to determine the precise nuclear positions of specific genetic loci in fixed cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To study chromatin dynamics in living cells, zinc fingers (ZNF)5 and transcription activatorlike effector (TALE) proteins6 have been engineered to target repetitive genomic regions, such as centromeres and telomeres, and track the spatiotemporal dynamics of these regions in live cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these advances, these approaches are difficult to implement for imaging non-repetitive genomic loci, since they require constructing a large array of TALEs/ZNFs proteins targeting the same locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas) serve as a simpler and more versatile tool for targeting specific DNA sequences in the genome7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the type II CRISPR system, a Cas9 endonuclease enzyme is targeted to a specific genomic region containing an NGG motif (referred to as the protospacer adjacent motif, PAM) via a 20-nucleotide complementary sgRNA sequence9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RNA-guidable nature of CRISPR-Cas9 provides greater flexibility over TALEs/ZNFs targeting, and has been repurposed to perform locus-specific genome editing9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17 and whole-genome knockout screens18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the catalytically inactive mutant of Cas9 (dCas9) has been used for a wide-range applications including control of gene regulation21,22,23,24, purification of specific genomic regions25 and whole-genome knockdown screens26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous studies have used fluorescently labelled dCas9 for targeting repetitive regions of the genome in live cells7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method has been extended for multiplexed targeting of telomeres and centromeres by co-expression of several dCas9 orthologs fused to different colours of fluorescent proteins and their cognate sgRNAs27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, dual-colour imaging of telomeres and centromeres using modified sgRNAs has also been demonstrated28,29,30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeting dCas9 to a non-repetitive genomic locus is more challenging, because fluorescence signal of a few dCas9-sgRNA complexes at the target region is not sufficient for detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This bottleneck can be overcome by transfection of cells with 26 unique sgRNAs targeting the same region7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this approach is difficult to implement for biological applications due to the challenges in the delivery of dozens sgRNAs into cells and increase in off-target sites by the large number of sgRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we developed an efficient and robust CRISPR-Cas9-based approach to simultaneously image multiple genomic loci in live cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method relies on re-engineering an sgRNA containing up to 16 MS2 motifs that bind to the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein (MCP)32 and labelling these motifs with fluorescently tagged MCPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach enables targeting of multiple genomic regions in human cells using a single dCas9 and a modular set of sgRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing the copy number of the MS2 sites on a single sgRNA significantly improved the signal-to-noise ratio and reduced the number of dCas9-sgRNA complexes required for reliable detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a single sgRNA, we successfully imaged multiple genomic loci with as few as eight tandem repeats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Non-repetitive genomic regions were detected using as few as 4 separate sgRNAs when imaged using lattice light sheet microscopy (LLSM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extended sgRNAs also enabled us to track the targeted loci over the course of the entire cell cycle, and to distinguish the nuclear positions of various transcriptionally active and inactive sites in the genome of live cells.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Targeting low-repeat-containing loci using a single sgRNA', 'We extended Cas9 cognate sgRNAs by inserting up to 14 tandem MS2 stem-loop sequences (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether the extended sgRNAs (sgRNA 14 × -MS2) form a functional complex with dCas9 while binding to MCPYFP, we co-transfected HeLa cells with dCas9-mCherry, MCPYFP, and a single sgRNA 14 × -MS2 targeting an 84-repeat sequence located within the MUC4 gene (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative PCR (ChIPqPCR) assays verified that both dCas9 and MCP were substantially enriched at the MUC4 site (Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the enrichment levels were comparable to that of conventional sgRNAs, indicating that the MS2 sites introduced at the 3 terminal end of the sgRNA did not interfere with assembly of the dCas9-sgRNA complex at the target region29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confocal imaging of transfected cells revealed colocalization of bright nuclear mCherry and YFP spots (Fig 1e), indicating that Cas9 and sgRNA localize to the same genomic region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: CRISPR-mediated chromatin imaging with conventional and extended sgRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematics show the conventional sgRNA and an sgRNA extended with 14 MS2 sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  dCas9 is fused to mCherry and MS2 binding sites are decorated with MCPYFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) sgRNA targetable tandem repeats containing four or more unique sites with a PAM sequence (red ticks) for each chromosome of human genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genomic loci targeted in this work are shown with larger symbols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c,d) ChIPqPCR results show relative enrichment levels of Flag-tagged dCas9 (c) and HA-Tagged MCPYFP (d) at the targeted loci when guided by conventional sgRNA (c) and extended sgRNA 14 × -MS2 (d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  N=3 independent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars show s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Representative images show colocalization of MCP and dCas9 spots in the nucleus of HeLa cells transfected with dCas9-mCherry, MCPYFP and a single sgRNA 14 × -MS2 targeting MUC4, locus #1 or #2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 3 m.

20-nucleotide sequences that can be targeted with an sgRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences that repeat multiple times within a 1 kb vicinity of each other and appear only in a single region of the whole genome were analysed further.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, we identified  greater than 62,000 unique hotspots that contain 4 or more sgRNA-targetable repeats (see Supplementary Data 1 for the complete list of hotspots) with eight repeats on average per hotspot (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we selected four unique loci that contained 8, 15, 21 and 33 repeat sequences (locus #1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively, Fig 1b) and separately transfected HeLa cells with a single sgRNA complementary to each loci (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CHIPqPCR assays confirmed the enrichment of dCas9-sgRNA to these target sites (Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cells that show bright YFP and mCherry spots in the nucleus, every YFP spot colocalized with an mCherry spot (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with a previous report7, we detected 3.4±0.3 (mean±s.e.m., Ncells=57) spots per cell corresponding to the MUC4 loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While a similar number of spots were observed for loci #1, #3 and #4, a higher number of spots were detected using the sgRNA targeting locus #2 (8.0±0.6 mean±s.e.m., Ncells=106, P less_than 0.001 for a two-tailed t-test, Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

been used for imaging highly repetitive telomeric and centromeric sequences simultaneously28, dual-colour imaging of low-repeat-containing loci has not been demonstrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2:

in cells that show bright YFP and mCherry spots, every YFP spot colocalized with an mCherry spot (Fig 2b,c), but only 62% of the mCherry spots colocalized with YFP spots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained similar results for each combinatorial targeting of conventional and extended sgRNAs, demonstrating that our findings are not specific to the pair of sgRNAs used (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that multicolour labelling of low-repeat-containing genomic loci is feasible with dCas9 using a single extended sgRNA, thus eliminating the need for pooling multiple sgRNAs to achieve sufficient fluorescent signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To further improve the versatility of our dCas9-mediated chromatin imaging platform, we test a variety of different sgRNA designs (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we utilized the high-affinity interaction (similar to the MS2-MCP pair) between the bacteriophage PP7 coat protein (PCP) and its RNA-binding site (PP7) by engineering an sgRNA with 2 × -PP7 sites28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, by inserting MS2 binding sites into regions of the sgRNA backbone that do not interact with Cas9, we designed sgRNA 2.0 MS2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29) to increase the efficiency of dCas9-mediated transactivation complexes34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ChIPqPCR analysis revealed substantial recruitment of dCas9 and MCP-PCP to the target sites with comparable

low-repeat-containing locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cases, we observed 100% colocalization of YFP and mCherry spots in the nucleus (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of spots in these cells (Fig 3e) was significantly less than those that observed using sgRNA 14 × -MS2 (t-test, P less_than 0.05, Fig 1f), suggesting that these sgRNAs are less susceptible to off-target recognition events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Targeting of non-repetitive genomic loci', 'In previous studies, imaging of non-repetitive sites has required the co-expression of as many as 26 unique sgRNAs to achieve sufficient signal-to-noise ratio for spot detection7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because our extended sgRNAs recruit a higher number of fluorescent proteins per dCas9-sgRNA complex, we reasoned that this approach could reduce the number of sgRNAs required to target a non-repetitive locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would significantly enhance the efficiency of targeting and imaging native chromatin loci virtually anywhere in the genome of individual cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this possibility, we first attempted to co-transfect HeLa cells with plasmids for dCas9-mCherry and MCPYFP, along with 30 unique sgRNAs targeting the same locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we were not able to distinguish any cells with bright nuclear spots, due to the low transfection efficiency associated with introducing large numbers of plasmids into a cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We aimed to develop a more viable approach for targeting non-repetitive regions in live cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we stably expressed dCas9-mCherry in RPE1, HeLa, U2OS and observed recruitment of dCas9 and MCP to locus #1 in these cell lines (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested the efficiency of dCas9 imaging to stable dCas9-GFP U2OS cells7 when the sgRNA was targeted to the satellite repeat region at centromeres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasmid transfection or lentiviral transduction resulted in bright nuclear spots in 60% and 87% of the cells, respectively (Ncells=500, Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for the less repetitive MUC4 locus, lentivirus transduction resulted in discernible nuclear spots within 53% of observed cells (Ncells=260, Supplementary Movie 2), whereas plasmid transfection yielded discernable spots in only 5% of the cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also generated a stable U2OS cell line co-expressing both dCas9-GFP and MCP-mCherry (Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We targeted the centromeric satellite repeats in this cell-line, and observed both GFP and mCherry spots in 20% of the cells (Ncells=500).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the GFP and YFP spots colocalized with each other in the nucleus (Supplementary Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On the basis of these results, we attempted to detect a non-repetitive genomic site in the stable dCas9-GFP-MCP-mCherry U2OS cell line using lentiviral transduction of sgRNA 14 × -MS2s targeting the same locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We designed 30 different sgRNA 14 × -MS2s that targeted a non-repetitive 5 kb region in the first intron of the MUC4 gene7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because co-transduction of the cells with these 30 sgRNAs failed to yield any discernable nuclear spots, we re-engineered sgRNA 2.0 with an additional 14 × -MS2 extension at its 3 end (sgRNA 2.0 16 × -MS2, Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, we were able to detect the colocalization of GFP and mCherry spots in the nucleus using confocal microscopy (Ncells=12, Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when the cells were transduced with only 8 of these sgRNA 2.0-16xMS2s, we only observed the mCherry spots, while the GFP spots were no longer detectable (Ncells=11, Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, the mCherry spots were not detectable in cells transduced with 8 sgRNA2.0 2 × -MS2s, demonstrating that extension of sgRNA 2.0 with additional MS2 binding sites reduces the number of sgRNAs needed for accurate detection of a single genomic locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

'Our imaging platform based on re-engineering the sgRNAs of the CRISPR-Cas9 system from S. pyogenes allowed us to image genomic loci with low- or non-repetitive regions with a minimal number of unique targeting sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we simultaneously tracked multiple endogenous loci by using the single CRISPR-Cas9 system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By utilizing these flexible sets of chromatin imaging tools separately as well in a combinatorial fashion, we were able to monitor the position and dynamics of distinct chromatin regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We anticipate that CRISPR-based imaging will simplify future efforts to reveal the dynamic nature of long-range interactions between regulatory genomic regions, such as promoter-enhancer interactions43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Current CRISPR imaging technologies require tandem targeting of multiple sgRNAs to endogenous loci28,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our approach possesses several unique advantages over recent studies that achieved multicolour chromatin imaging using CRISPR-Cas9 by demonstrating that our method is not mainly limited to imaging highly repetitive regions within the genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By increasing the copy number of the MS2 sites within a single sgRNA, we substantially improved the fluorescent signal per dCas9-sgRNA complex and detected as few as eight repeat-containing loci using a single sgRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our methodology potentially enables multicolour imaging of thousands of distinct low-repeat-containing loci within the human genome as well as in other model organisms using a single sgRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Remarkably, the extended sgRNA 2.0 16 × -MS2 design enabled detection of non-repetitive loci with only four unique sgRNAs using LLSM, compared to the 26 sgRNAs reported in previous studies7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While it is possible to further reduce the number of sgRNAs required to robustly image a non-repetitive locus, we note that efforts to increase the imaging sensitivity need to be weighed against the potential loss of dCas9 targeting specificity likely to result from significant sgRNA modification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A whole-genome dCas9 mapping studies have revealed a wide range of off-target binding activities exhibited by the CRIPSR-Cas9 system, thus raising an additional technical challenge45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, multiple sgRNAs must be targeted to the same genomic locus in order to form a significantly brighter spot than off-target binding sites and minimize false-positive fluorescent readouts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies will be required to increase the specificity and efficiency of sgRNA targeting by engineering dCas9 variants with reduced off target affinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sensitivity in fluorescence imaging of dCas9-sgRNA spots can also be further improved using split fluorescent proteins47 and novel protein labelling approaches48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these future challenges, we expect that our extended sgRNA-dCas9 imaging method will serve as an important step towards directly visualizing dynamics of single genomic loci at high spatiotemporal resolution.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
