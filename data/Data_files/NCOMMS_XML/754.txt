Dynamical observations on the crack tip zone and stress corrosion of two-dimensional MoS2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Whether and how fracture mechanics needs to be modified for small length scales and in systems of reduced dimensionality remains an open debate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, employing in situ transmission electron microscopy, atomic structures and dislocation dynamics in the crack tip zone of a propagating crack in two-dimensional (2D) monolayer MoS2 membrane are observed, and atom-to-atom displacement mapping is obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electron beam is used to initiate the crack; during in situ observation of crack propagation the electron beam effect is minimized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed high-frequency emission of dislocations is beyond previous understanding of the fracture of brittle MoS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strain analysis reveals dislocation emission to be closely associated with the crack propagation path in nanoscale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The critical crack tip plastic zone size of nearly perfect 2D MoS2 is between 2 and 5 nm, although it can grow to 10 nm under corrosive conditions such as ultraviolet light exposure, showing enhanced dislocation activity via defect generation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Fracture is a process relevant to many kinds of applications of materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Competition between two modes, namely, the crystal plane cleavage and dislocation nucleation at the crack tip, is the main factor governing the ductile or brittle behaviour of crystals1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the establishment of the well-known Griffith model3, it has been questioned whether linear elastic fracture mechanics hold true in the crack tip down to all length scales and, specifically, whether it holds true for recently developed two-dimensional (2D) materials4,5 is debatable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Direct electron microscopy observations of crack tips in ceramic materials such as Si, SiC and Al2O3 show perfect fringe lattices at the vicinity of the crack tips, and confirmed the absence of dislocations6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The revealed atomic sharpness at the crack tip without any blunting process is a signature of pure brittleness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, 2D materials such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) come into view for the realization in fabrication and for their exceptional physical properties7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, in the monolayer form, they only consist of one atom (such as graphene) to three atoms (such as TMD) in thickness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The basal plane (intralayer) fracture of the bulk type covalent-bonding graphite or 2h-molybdenite (hexagonal MoS2, to differentiate from the tetragonal phase) is purely brittle at room temperature8, and their fracture toughness GIC equals to 2, where  is the surface energy per unit area8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indentation tests using atomic force microscopy on monolayer graphene4,9 and monolayer hexagonal(h)-MoS2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5) have demonstrated ultra-high strength that is close to the theoretical limit, followed by catastrophic failure, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) could distinguish the transgranular fracture from intragranular fracture; however, no atomistic information was given9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fracture toughness of monolayer graphene was quantitatively measured by in situ TEM with supportive molecular dynamics simulations, suggesting pure brittleness10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cracks in monolayer graphene are along the preferable zigzag edge11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, several types of basal plane dislocations, or zero-dimensional dislocations, can emerge and are mobile in graphene or TMD12,13,14, especially at high temperature or under electron beam irradiation, indicative of the easier dislocation dynamics in 2D form than in bulk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is expected that the defect-free nature and high strength in 2D4,5 may provide a higher chance to achieve the onset of plasticity, but on the other hand, most molecular dynamics simulations show that the fracture of graphene as well as MoS2 is brittle15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand the atomistic features when fracture occurs in 2D materials, a direct observation of the cracking process at the crack tip is necessary from the viewpoint of basic physics and practical use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work by in situ TEM demonstrated the capability of dynamical atomic-scale observations on the sublimation and cracking process of few layer graphene17 or monolayer graphene17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, environment-assisted cracking in MoS2 also needs to be investigated and compared with pure cracking that is of particular importance in real-world applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The environmental susceptibility of MoS2 has drawn much attention18 that would have significant influence on their physical properties19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, by using in situ transmission electron microscopy to resolve the atomic structures, we directly observed the limited plastic behaviour at the forefront of a singular crack tip of monolayer h-MoS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cracks can be initialized at holes, and electron beam damage and especially creation of sulfur vacancies was carefully suppressed to ensure the crack propagation is close to pure mechanical loading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emission, glide and climb of the dislocations that can influence the propagation of the cracks were captured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-quality MoS2 monolayer samples with 1% sulfur deficiencies have around 25 nm size plastic zone (dislocation distributed area) near the crack tip in vacuum and extends to 510 nm under corrosive environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results also suggest that the specific 2D geometry improves ductility, in combination with the reported ultrahigh strength of 2D graphene4 or MoS2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5), creating potential applications for these materials.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The Fourier filtering method was applied to reduce the noise level and enhance contrast of the images22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The beam intensity was  less_than 0.01 pA nm2 in order to obtain the HRTEM images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The beam intensity at the sample in TEM mode is measured by the screen current multiplied by the square of magnifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of contamination problems, it was difficult to obtain high-resolution STEM images during or after cracking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Annular dark-field STEM imaging was conducted using a probe aberration-corrected JEM ARM200F operated at 80 kV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Annular dark-field images were acquired at a 20 mrad convergence angle, with beam current 120150 pA, beam size 1 Å, acquisition times of 40 s per pixel and collection angle from 50 to 180 mrad.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the energy of the low-voltage electron beam was below the damage threshold energy, the pristine MoS2 remains stable after regular scanning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'UV light exposure', 'MoS2 grown on sapphire was placed in a chamber equipped with a low-pressure Hg lamp (LH-arc, Lichtzen, with an output of 20 mW cm2), with the majority of emitted light at a wavelength of 254 nm and 10% of emitted light at a wavelength of 185 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Humidity was introduced into the chamber by connecting it to a humidifier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The humidity level in the chamber was monitored using a hydro-thermometer (accuracy of ±3%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The humidifier was disconnected from the chamber after reaching 65% humidity level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MoS2 on sapphire was then irradiated under UV light for 2 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radicals are generated under UV and humidity conditions as follows: O2O3; O3+H2OO2+H2O2; 2O3+H2O22OH*+3O2; H2OH*+OH*.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Scanning electron microscopy', 'The surface morphology of the TMDs on the SiO2/Si substrate was examined by field-emission SEM (JSM7000F, JEOL, Japan).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An accelerating voltage of 15 kV was utilized to obtain a high contrast at different magnifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
