Regulation of persistent sodium currents by glycogen synthase kinase 3 encodes daily rhythms of neuronal excitability  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'How neurons encode intracellular biochemical signalling cascades into electrical signals is not fully understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurons in the central circadian clock in mammals provide a model system to investigate electrical encoding of biochemical timing signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, using experimental and modelling approaches, we show how the activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) contributes to neuronal excitability through regulation of the persistent sodium current (INaP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  INaP exhibits a day/night difference in peak magnitude and is regulated by GSK3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using mathematical modelling, we predict and confirm that GSK3 activation of INaP affects the action potential afterhyperpolarization, which increases the spontaneous firing rate without affecting the resting membrane potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results demonstrate a crucial link between the molecular circadian clock and electrical activity, providing examples of kinase regulation of electrical activity and the propagation of intracellular signals in neuronal networks.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Much information processing in the brain occurs through electrical signalling, where the opening and closing of ion channels controls the properly timed firing of action potentials (APs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, biochemical networks within neurons separately regulate transcription, translation and post-translational modifications to determine cell fate, time cellular events and control cell size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How neurons integrate information between the two levels has remained a key open problem in neuroscience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An important model system for studying this phenomenon is the neuronal network within the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus, which forms the central circadian (24-h) pacemaker1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the neurons of the SCN, an intracellular clock generates daily rhythms through regulation of transcription factors, kinases, and other signalling molecules2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Timing information is relayed to the rest of the body through a variety of electrical behaviours and signals produced by SCN neurons3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding how cellular timekeeping and electrical activity are integrated is an essential ongoing question in the field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since many of the molecular and electrical components of the clock are well characterized, the SCN is a perfect system for investigating the greater question in neuroscience of how intracellular biochemical information is electrically encoded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One potential link between cellular biochemistry and electrical activity is glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GSK3 activation enhances the spontaneous firing rate (SFR)4, is regulated in a circadian manner5,6, and modulates molecular timekeeping within SCN neurons5, providing a potential link between the molecular and electrical activities of the SCN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we test the hypothesis that GSK3 regulates specific ionic currents that affect the spontaneous firing of APs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As GSK3 is implicated in many other intracellular processes (for example, inflammatory pathways, neurotrophic signalling, Wnt and mTOR cascades)7,8,9,10, GSK3 could provide a universal link between the biochemical state of the cell and its electrical activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It has been previously reported that several specific ionic currents are activated in a circadian manner3, and thus, may provide a primary mechanism for controlling circadian variation in electrical activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presumed mechanism of circadian regulation of many currents, however, is through transcriptional regulation of their channels, which is energetically inefficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another challenge to this hypothesis is that experimental and computational studies implicate sodium currents as the most important regulators of firing rate in SCN neurons11,12, but no evidence to support a daynight difference in these currents has been presented to date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we propose another mechanism for the regulation of the electrical activity of a neuron by molecular signalling through GSK3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a combination of mathematical modelling and experimental work, we show that GSK3 efficiently regulates the firing rate of the cell by modulation of a persistent sodium current without causing the significant depolarization that could signal back to the molecular circadian clock.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'GSK3 inhibition reduces spiking in a time-specific manner', 'We initially determined whether acute regulation of GSK3 changes the electrical activity of SCN neurons during the day and night using the minimally invasive loose-patch technique13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared to vehicle, inhibition of GSK3 with a pharmacological inhibitor (CHIR-99021, abbreviated CHIR throughout the manuscript; 1 M) significantly decreased the SFR of SCN neurons from hypothalamic slices in a phase-specific manner (P=0.018; Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GSK3 inhibition significantly suppressed SFR during the day between Zeitgeber time (ZT) 4 and 8 (P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, at night (ZT 1418), both treatment groups were similarly quiescent (P=0.608).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed day-time suppression was replicated with another GSK3 inhibitor (SB415286; 1 M), which significantly decreased SFR by 66% compared with vehicle (mean±s.e.m., vehicle: 5.05±0.44; SB415286, 1.71±0.28; n=3438 cells/group).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that inhibition of GSK3 suppresses SCN neuronal excitability during the day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: GSK3 inhibition suppresses excitability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Spontaneous AP frequencies (mean±s.e.m.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  from 2-min loose-patch recordings of neurons treated with vehicle (0.002% DMSO; black) or CHIR-99021 (CHIR, 1 M; blue) during the day (ZT 48) or early-night (ZT 1418).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CHIR significantly suppressed SCN activity during the day (***P less_than 0.001) but not the night (NS; P=0.608).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two-way ANOVA; treatment X time interaction, F(1,146)=5.772, P=0.018.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From left to right, n=38 cells, 4 animals; 41 cells, 4 animals; 38 cells, 3 animals; 33 cells and 3 animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Representative cell-attached loose-patch traces (10 s) from each group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 1 s.

Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was also no significant difference in input resistance (Supplementary Fig 1a,b), suggesting that the decreased excitability in CHIR-treated neurons was not due to an increase in the potassium leak conductance17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As seen in the vehicle-treated controls during the mid-day (Fig 1c), SCN neurons are capable of exhibiting multiple phenotypes in spontaneous electrical activity18, and these characteristics (for example, spiking versus silent) can impact neurophysiological response19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a k-means cluster analysis based on RMP and event amplitude, we classified each neuron into one of four categories while blind to treatment condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the results, SCN neurons were classified as either (i) silent, (ii) spiking, (iii) having depolarized electrical states with low-amplitude membrane oscillations or (iv) exhibiting depolarization block, in which spiking could be reinstated by injecting hyperpolarizing current (Supplementary Fig 2) as reported in other brain areas20,21 as well as in the SCN16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the remaining spontaneously spiking neurons, APs were separated (or generated) by smooth depolarizing ramps to threshold (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When GSK3 was inhibited, however, cells within this same voltage range seldom exhibited spontaneous APs (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, some cells displayed low-amplitude membrane potential oscillations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These oscillations were very similar to the effects of the voltage-gated sodium channel blocker, tetrodotoxin (TTX), when applied to SCN neurons12,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the frequency of these oscillations was not different from vehicle-treated cells (Supplementary Fig 1c), we hypothesized that, like TTX, GSK3 inhibition may modulate SCN excitability through suppression of a TTX-sensitive, voltage-gated sodium current.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The voltage-gated sodium channels that are responsible for different components of Na+ current23 are expressed in SCN neurons (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While rapidly activating and inactivating transient current (INaT) plays a role in the peak of the AP, the persistent Na+ current is important in maintaining repetitive firing in many neuron types24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focused our studies on the persistent Na+ current (INaP), given that it provides excitatory drive to AP threshold in SCN neurons12, which appeared to be diminished in CHIR-treated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we next considered the effect of GSK3 inhibition and activation on this current.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'GSK3 inhibition suppresses INaP specifically during the day', 'Several sodium channels have been shown to play a role in conducting a slowly inactivating, or persistent, sodium current or INaP, in central neurons, including NaV 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.6 (refs 24, 25), all of which are expressed in the SCN (Supplementary Fig 3), and at least NaV1.6 has been shown to be regulated by GSK3 (refs 26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although small in magnitude, INaP typically contributes to excitation of repetitively firing neurons by augmenting small depolarizations during the interspike interval12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In SCN cells, INaP is proposed to provide the excitatory drive towards threshold12, and silencing INaP suppresses AP firing in SCN cells28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we examined the effect of GSK3 inhibition on INaP by measuring the current response to a slow (59 mV s1), depolarizing voltage ramp from 100 mV to 10 mV (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29) before and after treatment with the selective persistent sodium channel blocker riluzole (20 M, 3 min).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The voltage ramp elicited an inward current in vehicle-treated cells at the range of INaP activation, starting at 52.4±1.1 mV and peaking at 26.8±0.7 mV (as in refs 30, 31, 32;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Here, we present evidence that the rhythmically phosphorylated kinase GSK3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5) promotes neuronal excitability through regulation of INaP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we find that: (1) GSK3 activity regulates INaP, (2) INaP exhibits a day/night difference in peak magnitude that is regulated by GSK3 and (3) INaP promotes firing and decreases AP AHP without affecting RMP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experiments were conducted in the SCN, the site of the central circadian pacemaker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As molecular circadian timekeeping can be found in many parts of the brain38, this mechanism could be widely used in the brain to control many systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of particular interest are the regions of the brain that regulate mood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Impaired molecular circadian timekeeping has been implicated in mood disorders39, and differentiated neurons from induced pluripotent stem cells isolated from patients with bipolar disorder show enhanced SFRs and over-excitability40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that GSK3 phosphorylation and INaP are altered by mood stabilizing drugs such as lithium41 and riluzole42, respectively, this work may provide a potential basis for the chronotherapeutic control of mood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite the known importance of INaP as a pacemaker potential in many types of spontaneously active neurons43,44,45,46, including the SCN12,28,29, INaP has been largely overlooked as a potential contributor to the circadian modulation of rhythmic firing3,28,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the present study is the first to show that INaP is greater in magnitude during the day (5 pA) than at night.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference in INaP magnitude is sufficient to have a notable impact on excitability of compact, high Rinput neurons such as those in the SCN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior work has shown that blockade of INaP with riluzole acutely silences spontaneous firing28 and chronically dampens the circadian amplitude of SFR rhythms of individual SCN neurons47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, our results demonstrate that high, day-like INaP levels seen in GSK3-KI neurons at night are sufficient to induce spiking in neurons that would normally be silent (Fig 6) as well as increase the SFR of already spiking neurons (Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, lower INaP level following GSK3 inhibition reduces the SFR (Figs 1 and 2), while transient sodium current was minimally affected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although GSK3 may impact neurophysiological properties of neurons through regulation of other ionic conductances yet to be identified (including IKCa), our results show a novel effect of GSK3 activity on excitability through modulation of INaP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This GSK3-mediated increase in INaP may be the result of several different channel protein modifications including channel trafficking, distribution and phosphorylation state3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, recent work in the hippocampus has shown that fibroblast growth factor 14 forms a complex with at least one sodium channel alpha subunit (that is, NaV1.6) in a GSK3-dependent manner26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is interesting to note that four of the alpha subunits implicated in INaP are expressed in the SCN (Supplementary Fig 3), with enrichment specifically for NaV1.3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to alpha subunits, GSK3 may also activate other regulatory subunits of voltage-gated sodium channels, such as the NaV  subunits, which can enhance INaP magnitude33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future research will be necessary to elucidate the contribution of the various TTX-sensitive NaV channel subunits responsible for daynight differences in INaP magnitude in SCN neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our work also shows how changes in INaP permeate throughout the SCN network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the SCN is coupled via mainly inhibitory GABA, increasing the firing rate causes more inhibitory post-synaptic currents, which could slow firing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, inhibitory post-synaptic currents can both increase and decrease firing in SCN neurons36, so the effects of inhibitory GABA are not always intuitive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, our modelling and experimental data show an increase in firing rate throughout the network, and in particular, a change in the electrical state of neurons that produces an increase in the proportion of neurons that are firing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, this work suggests GSK3 as a way of modulating not just firing of a single cell, but also global network properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work can improve our mathematical models by considering the morphology of SCN neurons, additional neurotransmitters and neuropeptides besides GABA and the stochasticity of neuronal firing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Further clarification of the details of GSK3 regulation is an interesting question for future study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite much work, how the circadian clock precisely regulates GSK3 activity is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to rhythmic inhibitory phosphorylation, GSK3 function within the SCN could also be reduced by sequestration, localization or through priming kinases48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although suppression of INaP by pharmacological GSK3 inhibition was time-of-day specific (that is, restricted to the day, when GSK3 activity is high), GSK3-KI mice with chronic GSK3 de-phosphorylation had enhanced, but unexpectedly rhythmic INaP, suggesting that other mechanisms of GSK3 inhibition may still be rhythmic in these mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, we cannot rule out a compensatory mechanism or developmental effect as an explanation of this result; however, it should be noted that no gross developmental differences have been previously reported in this animal model34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By combining modelling and experimental approaches, we present an intriguing method by which the molecular circadian clock controls electrical activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike Na+ leak currents which were recently shown to promote excitability of clock neurons by membrane depolarization49, our data show a mechanism for how INaP regulates the firing rate of APs without affecting the RMP of neurons that are hyperpolarized or spiking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show that the balance between INaP and IKCa controls both the depolarizing ramp towards the AP threshold and, surprisingly, the magnitude of the AHP following an AP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, pharmacological inhibition of INaP increased AHP magnitude without affecting RMP, consistent with a prior study that showed that reduction of INaP due to genetic loss of SCN8A significantly increases peak AHP in cerebellar granule cells50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, sub-threshold ionic balance could be crucial to rhythmic changes in AP frequency independent of circadian phase, especially in light of a previous modelling/experimental study which showed that changes in RMP can feedback to phase shift the circadian clock36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanism we propose, therefore, can faithfully reflect the state of the circadian clock in firing rate without disrupting molecular circadian timekeeping itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Intriguingly, aging-induced circadian decline is associated with reduced SCN firing rate amplitude and smaller nocturnal AHP in the absence of altered PER2 expression51,52, leading to the proposal that SCN neuronal activity may be the weak link in the circadian system3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that p-GSK3 levels are decreased in the SCN of aged rodents, GSK3 control of INaP may be one source of age-related circadian disruption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While more work is necessary to explore this concept as well as the biophysical mechanism by which GSK3 activates INaP, this work suggests a promising new motif in which a kinase can directly regulate electrical activity acutely and without transcriptional cost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of its efficiency, this is a motif likely to be found in other brain regions as well.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

in Supplementary Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reproduces the daynight difference in INaP amplitude described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compensate for the addition of this current, we reduce the circadian drive of gKCa and gK-leak to 60% of its original value (R=6.81*clk*(G-0.25)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the magnitude of the GABA current was reduced (gGABA=0.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All other parameters including intercellular signalling and network connectivity were as in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For network simulations, the experimentally measured chloride distribution was used to determine GABA reversal potentials as in Fig 3 of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With these small modifications, the model reproduces the circadian variation in electrical activity seen experimentally and the many electrical states seen within the normal SCN 24-hour cycle (Fig 5c and data not shown)16,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'The code for our single-cell model of the electrical activity of SCN neurons with INaP has been deposited on ModelDB (accession number: 196197).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this code, the single cell and network behaviour can be generated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details of our model network simulations can be found in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data that support the findings of this study are
