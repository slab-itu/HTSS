Modelling kidney disease with CRISPR-mutant kidney organoids derived from human pluripotent epiblast spheroids  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Human-pluripotent-stem-cell-derived kidney cells (hPSC-KCs) have important potential for disease modelling and regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether the hPSC-KCs can reconstitute tissue-specific phenotypes is currently unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that hPSC-KCs self-organize into kidney organoids that functionally recapitulate tissue-specific epithelial physiology, including disease phenotypes after genome editing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In three-dimensional cultures, epiblast-stage hPSCs form spheroids surrounding hollow, amniotic-like cavities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GSK3 inhibition differentiates spheroids into segmented, nephron-like kidney organoids containing cell populations with characteristics of proximal tubules, podocytes and endothelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tubules accumulate dextran and methotrexate transport cargoes, and express kidney injury molecule-1 after nephrotoxic chemical injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of podocalyxin causes junctional organization defects in podocyte-like cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockout of the polycystic kidney disease genes PKD1 or PKD2 induces cyst formation from kidney tubules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of these functional phenotypes are distinct from effects in epiblast spheroids, indicating that they are tissue specific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings establish a reproducible, versatile three-dimensional framework for human epithelial disease modelling and regenerative medicine applications.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Both undifferentiated stem cells and terminally differentiated somatic cells form epithelia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These can function to establish axes for differentiation in the embryo, or to perform barrier and transport roles in adult organs such as the kidney.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture in vitro is a powerful tool for investigating epithelial morphogenesis, physiology and disease, being readily accessible to microscopic inspection, chemical treatment and experimental manipulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies of epithelial cell lines such as MadinDarby canine kidney (MDCK) cells have, for instance, revealed polarity and apoptosis pathways contributing mechanistically to lumen formation1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conventional epithelial cell lines, however, are lineage-restricted and lack genetic diversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the 3D structures that arise are relatively simple, and it has been challenging to perform controlled comparisons of different epithelia of the same genetic background, or the same epithelia with different genetic backgrounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these limitations, interest in the cellular microenvironment and 3D culture systems has been increasing steadily, particularly for stem cell applications2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a significant need for genetically diverse cell culture platforms that accurately reconstitute tissue-specific epithelial function, particularly in humans where speciesspecific toxicology and disease pathophysiology is of significant biomedical relevance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are capable of extensive self-renewal and can differentiate into diverse somatic cell types and tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  hPSCs are also genetically diverse, including thousands of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines with patient-specific or gene-targeted mutations3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  hPSCs have therefore emerged as a powerful and reproducible source of diverse human tissues for disease modelling and regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  hPSCs resemble the implantation-stage human epiblast, a tissue that forms the axes for the developing embryo and cannot be studied in living human embryos owing to ethical considerations2,7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like the epiblast, hPSCs are epithelial cells, but their polarity, barrier and lumenogenesis characteristics remain very poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse ESCs (mESCs) were recently shown to form polarized rosettes with small cavities when surrounded by Matrigel extracellular matrix, suggesting the possibility of modelling early amniotic cavity formation in the epiblast11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because these experiments were performed with mESCs, which more closely resemble the more primitive inner cell mass (ICM) than the epiblast, it remains unclear whether the observed rosettes truly represent epiblast and whether hPSCs could form similar structures8,12,13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Better understanding of human epiblast-stage biology may lead to improvements in the directed differentiation of hPSCs into specific cell types and organoids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The kidney is an epithelial organ of major interest to the field of regenerative medicine17,18,19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kidney epithelial subsets are highly specialized and their dysfunction can result in a variety of clinical disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, polycystic kidney disease (PKD) features cystic expansion of tubular epithelial cells, whereas glomerulopathies involve injury to the podocyte epithelium through which blood is filtered into the tubules22,23,24,25,26,27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As proof-of-principle for using hPSCs to model kidney disease, we have identified a ciliary phenotype in undifferentiated iPSCs and descendant epithelial cells from PKD patients17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, hPSCs have been directed to differentiate in vitro into hPSC-derived kidney cells (hPSC-KCs) expressing markers typical of kidney progenitor cells, proximal tubules and podocytes18,19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these markers may not be exclusive to the kidney, and no study to date has demonstrated an ability to form renal-like structures in vitro and recapitulate a disease-relevant phenotype in hPSC-KCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ideally, such phenotypes would be expected to be present in kidney tissues but be absent in other epithelial cells not similarly affected by the disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reconstitution of kidney-specific microphysiology and injury/disease states in hPSC-KCs is therefore important to more conclusively identify these epithelia and to advance their translational application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we establish adherent, 3D growth conditions for reconstitution of two distinct epithelial structures, epiblast spheroids and kidney organoids, which arise sequentially in a single continuous culture of hPSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using small molecule treatments and genome-edited hPSCs, we demonstrate that these structures are capable of reconstituting tissue-specific epithelial transport, toxicity responses and disease phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results reveal both common and tissue-specific features in hPSCs and descendant hPSC-KCs, and establish an innovative human organoid model for kidney injury and disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings are broadly relevant for functional studies of human microphysiology, pathophysiology and regenerative medicine.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'hPSCs form cavitated spheroids in 3D culture', 'To evaluate the tissue-specific functions of undifferentiated hPSCs and descendant hPSC-KCs, we developed an adherent, 3D culture system for hPSCs that first produced epiblast spheroids and subsequently kidney tubules (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dissociated, undifferentiated hPSCs sandwiched between two layers of dilute Matrigel (0.2 mg ml1) formed compact, ball-like colonies; by 48 h, these formed internal cavities (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mature spheroids consisted of a simple columnar epithelium surrounding a hollow lumen (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spheroid cells exhibited polarized localization of podocalyxin (PODXL) to the luminal surface, zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) to apical cellcell junctions, and -catenin (CAT) to primarily basolateral membranes (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar apicobasal polarization patterns were observed in monolayer hPSCs (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: hPSCs form cavitated spheroids in 3D culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic of spheroid-to-organoid culture protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Phase contrast images of ESCs in sandwich (3D) or monolayer (2D) cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consecutive days are shown, with d0 indicating the time point immediately before sandwiching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Confocal optical sections showing PODXL, ZO-1 and CAT immunofluorescence through a representative spheroid with cavity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vertical distance from top to bottom row is shown at left.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Representative brightfield images of hPSCs in 3D cultures that were dissociated (coloured frames) and passaged (matching coloured arrows).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dashed arrows represent serial passages in the 3D condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lower row shows cells plated into 2D cultures from dissociated spheroids from each passage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of teratomas generated from hPSC serial 3D passages p3, p6 and p9 showing pigmented epithelium (ectoderm), cartilage (mesoderm) and glandular epithelium (endoderm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) Cell number (average of duplicate counts for each time point, or AVG of all five time points shown in the last column) in 2D and 3D cultures 72 h after plating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (g) Representative immunofluorescence images showing OCT4 and sex-determining region Y box-2 (SOX2) or tumor rejection antigen 160 (TRA-1-60) and NANOG localization in p3 and p7 serially sandwiched hPSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars, 100 m.

Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sine oculis homeobox homologue 2 (SIX2) was expressed in mesenchyme adjacent to the tubules but not in the tubules themselves, consistent with the developmental restriction of this marker to the metanephric mesenchyme (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The endocytosis receptors low density lipoprotein-related protein 2 (megalin) and cubilin were co-expressed apically and co-localized with LTL in tubule segments (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apical microvilli and tight junctions were observed in tubules by electron microscopy (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We furthermore observed anatomical progression of tubules from segments expressing E-cadherin, a distal tubule marker30, to LTL+ segments (proximal tubule), to capsule-like structures containing PODXL+ podocyte-like cells (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These PODXL+ cells aggregated at the termini of tubules, at the periphery of the organoids (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They exhibited a spherical and tightly clustered morphology, lacked LTL reactivity, and co-expressed additional markers of kidney podocytes31,32,33, including Wilms tumour protein (WT1) and synaptopodin (Fig 2f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Endothelial cords expressing CD31 and von Willebrand factor also arose within organoids, contacting both tubular and podocyte-like cell populations (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggested that tubular organoids contained self-organizing hPSC-KC subpopulations capable of nephron-like segmentation and vascular structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using this protocol, H9 hESCs and three different iPSC lines produced organoids incorporating cells and structures with characteristics of proximal tubules, endothelial cells and podocytes, in kidney-like segmental arrangements (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  hESCs showed the highest efficiency of differentiation, yielding 90 organoids per 1.9 cm2, with LTL+ cells representing 25% of the total culture (Fig 2h and Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 80% of LTL+ organoids included endothelial (CD31+) and podocyte-like (PODXL+) cell populations (Fig 2h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Markers of neuroectoderm (TUJ1) or intestine (CDX2) were absent within organoids; however, separate clusters of TUJ1+ cells were observed in the cultures at a ratio of approximately 1:2 to kidney organoids, and projected axon-like processes towards the tubules (Supplementary Fig 4bd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA and protein analysis during the time course of differentiation revealed sequential induction of markers characteristic of mesendoderm, nephron progenitors and finally proximal tubules and podocyte-like cells (Supplementary Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess their potential to engraft in vivo, tubular organoid cultures were dissociated and implanted into kidneys of neonatal immunodeficient mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 3 weeks, we identified human nuclear antigen-positive (HNA+) epithelial structures within the mouse kidney cortex, with LTL intensities comparable to neighbouring mouse tubules (Fig 2i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We concluded that tubular organoids most likely represented the kidney lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Organoids recapitulate tissue-specific injury and transport', 'Tissue-specific functions or disease phenotypes have not been demonstrated in hPSC-KCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore investigated the potential of kidney organoids to upregulate a clinical biomarker of proximal tubule injury, kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), also known as T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 and hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1 (refs 34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When treated with the nephrotoxic drugs cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin) or gentamicin, KIM-1 immunofluorescence was detected at the luminal surface of tubules in 80% of organoids, and was confirmed using two different antibodies (Fig 3ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, while epiblast spheroids exhibited dose-dependent sensitivity to both cisplatin and gentamicin (disintegration), they did not upregulate KIM-1 after treatment, indicating that this response was specific to kidney organoids (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, LTL+ tubules remained stable in extended cultures for at least 120 days, and cultures could also be miniaturized to a 96-well format (Fig 3e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kidney organoids might therefore provide a long-term, high-throughput model system to evaluate human nephrotoxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Tubular organoids create a microphysiological model for kidney nephrotoxicity studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Co-localization of KIM-1 antibody AKG7 with LTL or (b) with a second KIM-1 antibody (KIM1ab2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Quantification of organoids expressing KIM-1 after treatment with 50 M cisplatin (Cispl.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  or 5 mM gentamicin (Gent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), compared with vehicle-treated controls (n=3/condition,  greater than 50 organoids/experiment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Phase contrast of living cells, or KIM-1 and NANOG immunofluorescence, in epiblast spheroids treated with titrations of cisplatin and gentamicin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No KIM-1 expression is observed at any dose including 5 mM gentamicin, a concentration sufficient to induce KIM-1 upregulation in kidney organoids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cisplatin was toxic to spheroids at concentrations greater than 1 M.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The epithelial characteristics of hPSCs and derived kidney cells are poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reconstitution of epithelial physiology and morphogenesis in these cell types is important for advancing their potential as human laboratory models and regenerative therapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The described culture system and assays establish a framework for generating and functionally profiling undifferentiated hPSCs and descendant hPSC-KCs in three dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  hPSCs are a well-characterized, homogenous and genetically diverse cell type that includes patient-specific, immunocompatible iPSCs45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Well-functioning hPSC-derived epithelia may therefore have applicability for regenerative medicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We demonstrate, for the first time, that undifferentiated, epiblast-stage hPSCs form cavitated spheroids in 3D culture, similar to rosettes recently derived from mESCs, but with expanded lumens11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By directly comparing 2D and 3D cultures, our studies reveal that spheroid formation at the epiblast stage can significantly affect subsequent cell fate decisions, producing tubular organoids instead of cardiomyocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These organoids recapitulate key characteristics of kidney development and physiology in vitro, which have been challenging to model using primary adult or embryonic kidney cells1,47,48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to previous protocols for kidney directed differentiation from hPSCs18,19,20,21, our simple, two-step procedure of spheroid formation followed by GSK3 inhibition in growth-factor reduced Matrigel does not require exogenous supplementation with fibroblast growth factor 2, activin or bone morphogenetic protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tubular structures are surrounded by dilute extracellular matrix in an adherent, microplate format that is experimentally accessible, scalable and potentially high throughput18,19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These structures exhibit a lineage complexity that differs from conventional kidney cell lines and organoids1,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All the major components of the developing proximal nephrontubular cells, endothelial cells, nephron progenitors and podocyte-like cellsare represented within each individual organoid, in kidney-like architectures (Fig 8b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proximal tubules transport fluorescent cargoes in a characteristic manner, which is distinct from the pluripotent spheroid epithelia from which they derive36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When injured, tubules express a clinical biomarker, KIM-1, a response that is highly characteristic of the proximal tubule in vivo but lost in de-differentiated primary cultures34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may provide a quantifiable human standard with which to predict proximal tubule nephrotoxicity, a frequent cause of failure in drug development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 8: Models of hPSC-derived epithelia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Model of hPSC lumenogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ICM-stage hPSCs lack polarized tight junctions, resulting in randomized aggregate formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Epiblast-stage hPSCs are polarized with continuous tight junctions, and thus organize into a single-cell epithelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 3D growth, polarized accumulation of podocalyxin (blue) at the apical membrane results in charge repulsion (negative charges), promoting separation of the cells to form a lumen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tight junctions (red) permit the entry of small (green) molecules but exclude macromolecules (red), which accumulate in intercellular spaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zoom of boxed area is shown, highlighting polarized epithelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Architecture of a proximal tubule within a kidney

levels of podocalyxin and form a less organized, aggregate structure at tubular termini.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZO-1 (red) is expressed at a sub-apical position, restricted by podocalyxin (blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Endothelial cells interact closely with both tubular and podocyte-like compartments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Faded background structures place epithelial structures formed in vitro into their proposed context in vivo.Full size image', 'As our studies of PODXL/ hPSCs illustrate, this advanced differentiation system can be combined with CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to determine the function of specific genes in different human cell types, on an isogenic genetic background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest a molecular model whereby the combination of apicobasal polarization, tight junction organization and podocalyxin expression distinguishes epiblast-stage hPSCs from ICM-stage progenitors and promotes formation of the early amniotic cavity (Fig 8a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although podocalyxin upregulation and tight junction organization occur simultaneously, tight junctions can organize and function independently of podocalyxin in hPSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in podocyte-like cells, podocalyxin plays a dominant role in the organization of junctions and the spacing of adjacent cells (Fig 8b), consistent with reports of tight junction phenotypes during rodent glomerulogenesis and in MDCK cells26,27,38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although podocalyxin plays an anti-adhesive role in both epiblast and podocyte, its effect on cell polarity and tight junctions is limited to podocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further investigations are required to determine the precise molecular mechanisms underlying these cell type-specific differences, which suggest the presence of co-regulatory factors present in one cell type but not the other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As alterations in podocalyxin expression and the podocyte cytoskeleton are a well-described characteristic of human glomerular disease states24,25,26,27, such studies may produce new insights into pathophysiology and treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'PKD is among the most common monogenic diseases and of major interest to both clinicians and cell biologists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Existing cellular systems have reported quantitative differences in the formation of simple spheroids or cysts attributed to defects in PKD gene expression50,51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, even wild-type cells frequently form cysts in these systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A reproducible system for PKD-specific cyst formation from tubules is therefore an important goal for the field, particularly in humans where speciesspecific pathophysiology and therapy is of clinical interest17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that loss-of-function PKD mutations result in cyst formation from hPSC-derived tubular cells, which is not observed in isogenic controls17,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggests that PKD-specific cystogenesis from tubules is a cell-intrinsic phenomenon that can be modelled in a minimal system in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As cystogenesis was observed for both PKD1 and PKD2 mutants, and was specific to the kidney organoids but not epiblast spheroids, the phenotype is both gene specific and lineage specific in this system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies are required to determine the cellular basis of cystogenesis in this system and whether iPSCs from PKD patients, which have heterozygous mutations and variable genetic backgrounds, also produce cysts17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As cysts are a relatively rare phenomenon, improvements in iPSC differentiation efficiencies may be required to perform such experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The described hPSC system does have limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, we have not yet observed formation of a vascularized glomerulus from hPSC podocyte-like cells and neighbouring endothelia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tubules also do not contain a full brush border.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although SIX2+ mesenchyme was observed adjacent to tubular cells, we did not observe evidence of ureteric bud markers in these tubules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, the tubules have characteristics of proximal tubules derived from the SIX2+ mesenchyme, which was induced to differentiate through a non-developmental pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurons were abundant in these cultures and might possibly represent a source of inductive signals for kidney tubular differentiation in the absence of ureteric bud, similar to embryonic spinal cord53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A further limitation of this hPSC-based system is the lack of widely available fluorescent reporter lines with which to perform lineage tracing experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possible solution to this problem would be to adapt this protocol for mouse EpiSCs, which are similar to hPSCs in phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, EpiSCs from the Six2-eGFPCre reporter mouse might be used to determine with greater certainty whether all tubular cells in our system derive from the SIX2+ mesenchyme, using developing kidneys from this mouse as positive controls54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, our findings suggest that while kidney differentiation is indeed occurring from hPSCs, this process in vitro does not fully recapitulate developmental kidney nephrogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dedicated studies involving fluid flow and the tissue microenvironment in vivo are required to further develop this system into fully functional nephrons, for more advanced disease modelling and therapeutic application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we have developed a 3D culture system that reconstitutes functional, structured epithelia modelling the epiblast, kidney tubular cells and podocyte-like cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These pluripotent and descendant epithelia share certain key structural features, but they can nevertheless recapitulate stage-specific transport characteristics and morphogenesis mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provides an accurate and reproducible platform in which to model human microphysiology, injury and disease at distinct developmental stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome-modified tubular organoids functionally recapitulate kidney disease phenotypes, strengthening the identification of these structures as kidney and establishing innovative cellular systems for studying human renal physiology and pathophysiology in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The described methodologies are broadly applicable and adaptable to diverse tissues and genetically diverse backgrounds, and can be used immediately to experimentally investigate molecular pathways relevant to human epithelial diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the longer term, this system may provide a useful setting in which to optimize and test the functionality of patient-derived epithelia in vitro, before regenerative graft administration.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

(5-GTGGGTGCGAGCTTCCCCCCGGG-3) were transiently transfected into H9 hESCs, and green fluorescent protein-expressing cells were isolated by flow cytometric sorting, clonally expanded and screened for clones with biallelic loss-of-function indels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 200,000 sorted hESCs were plated per well of a 6-well plate in hESC-conditioned mTeSR1 plus Y27632.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The media was replaced the following morning without Y27632 and cells were clonally expanded and the PODXL gRNA region was amplified by PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chromatogram sequences were analysed manually

to measure differences or similarities between separate cultures detectable by eye.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample size was chosen based on the researchers qualitative assessment of the reproducibility and variability of each particular experiment (higher variability required greater sample size), and the nature of the data being quantified (whole experiment percentage versus metrics of individual structures).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiments were not randomized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The investigators were not blinded to the conditions during the experiments or analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all experiments, equal numbers of cells were plated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental and control wells (for treatment), fields and samples (for imaging and quantification), and the order of cell lines in plate wells were chosen at random for each experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Processing was performed simultaneously and in parallel for all conditions within each experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For fluorescence intensity quantifications, images were taken in a single imaging session and at identical exposures and processed identically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of cavitated colonies (ellipsoid with lumen) versus flat colonies (non-ellipsoid or without a lumen) was scored manually in phase contrast images of living cells, in which lumens were discerned more easily than in fixed samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify intensities, line scans of equal length were drawn through randomly selected structures imaged with identical exposures to obtain raw fluorescence values in NIS Elements software (Nikon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The averaged line scan values were plotted with error bars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For CHIR-induced differentiation, 6,000 individual cells were identified in low-magnification immunofluorescence images using Cell Profiler 2.0 and fluorescence intensities were measured automatically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical comparisons used a two-tailed t-test for two
