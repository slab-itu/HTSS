Lasing in dark and bright modes of a finite-sized plasmonic lattice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Lasing at the nanometre scale promises strong light-matter interactions and ultrafast operation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasmonic resonances supported by metallic nanoparticles have extremely small mode volumes and high field enhancements, making them an ideal platform for studying nanoscale lasing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At visible frequencies, however, the applicability of plasmon resonances is limited due to strong ohmic and radiative losses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, plasmonic nanoparticle arrays support non-radiative dark modes that offer longer life-times but are inaccessible to far-field radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show lasing both in dark and bright modes of an array of silver nanoparticles combined with optically pumped dye molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Linewidths of 0.2 nm at visible wavelengths and room temperature are observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Access to the dark modes is provided by a coherent out-coupling mechanism based on the finite size of the array.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results open a route to utilize all modes of plasmonic lattices, also the high-Q ones, for studies of strong light-matter interactions, condensation and photon fluids.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Plasmonic systems offer small mode volumes, ultrafast dynamics and nanoscale operation, which opens new prospects for light-matter interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strong coupling between plasmonic modes and ensembles of emitters has been demonstrated1,2, and strong coupling even at the level of a few emitters has been reached at room temperature3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gain assisted propagation of plasmon polaritons, spacing and lasing have been predicted5,6,7,8,9 and studied experimentally10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24, and the possibility of photon condensates has been proposed25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fundamental tradeoff between the confinement of optical fields and losses26 render plasmonic systems inherently lossy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This motivates a search for hybrid modes where losses can be reduced by a narrow-linewidth component while still preserving the near-field characteristics of the plasmonic component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Lattices of metal nanoparticles support modes called surface lattice resonances (SLRs) which are hybrids of localized nanoparticle surface plasmon resonances and diffracted orders (DOs) of the periodic structure27,28,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mode energies, losses and optical density of states can be tuned by lattice and particle geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SLRs combine extreme optical confinement with the narrow linewidths inherent in the DO part of the hybrid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, strong coupling with organic molecules in such a system has been observed2,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infrared lasing at weak coupling regime has been realized in such lattices15,24, with linewidths of  less_than 1.3 nm (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the losses of an optical dipole scale as 4, noble metals can suffer considerably higher losses at visible compared to IR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A key question has been whether similar nanoparticle structures could support lasing also at visible frequencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, plasmonic lattices can also support so-called dark SLR modes, whose subradiant character results to significantly higher Q-values as compared with their radiant (bright) counterparts33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus plasmonic dark modes are promising candidates for realizing lasing, single-emitter strong coupling, and photon fluids at visible wavelengths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A central challenge is how to excite and couple out these inherently subradiant modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we experimentally demonstrate lasing at the visible wavelengths in both bright and dark modes of the plasmonic lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A new concept to access the dark modes is introduced, which is based on a gradual, coherent build-up of dipole moments in a finite lattice.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

shown, where kx is the in-plane momentum in the x-direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yellow features correspond to the bright modes that respond to the far-field radiation incident on the sample in the transmission measurement, while the location of the dark mode is indicated by a circle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1e,f shows the corresponding electric field and charge distributions found by Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations for an infinite array.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 1e, a standing wave antinode at each particle location induces a large dipole moment and radiation to the far field, thus it is referred to as a bright mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 1f, however, the field gradient related to a field node induces a quadrupole moment into each particle resulting to zero net dipole moment and negligible far-field radiation, a feature of a dark mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both cases, the plasmonic component of the hybrid is evident from the strong near fields in the particle vicinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A dark mode here specifically refers to one band-edge mode missing in the far field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are other categories of dark modes in plasmonics systems which present a subradiant mode, especially in metamaterials with symmetry-breaking features34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Measured dispersion of the SLR modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The angle-resolved

lattices with a 31 mM solution of Rhodamine 6G molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For concentrations of this order of magnitude, formation of aggregates is not significant36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of the dye molecules modifies the refractive index surrounding the structure, shifting the SLR resonances slightly from Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We excite the molecules with a 100 fs laser pulse (500 nm centre wavelength) and observe the emission, see Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2ac shows the momentum and energy distribution of the sample emission with different pump fluencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below threshold, the emission closely follows the dispersion of the SLR mode (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emission spectra in Fig 2d shows that at threshold, an intense and narrow emission peak at 2.185 eV is observed, and well above threshold a second peak appears at 2.178 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The momentum distributions of these two peaks are shown in Fig 2b,c, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both peaks, characteristic signatures of lasing, such as rapid nonlinear increase of emission intensity, reduction of linewidth, and a blue shift of the emission are observed in response to increasing pump fluence, see Fig 2e,f.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, a high beam directionality with divergence of 0.3° is observed for both modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The qualitative behaviour of lasing thresholds is well reproduced by an FDTD simulation with the dye molecules described as four-level systems (for details see Methods), as shown by Fig 2g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulations show lasing at two separate

remarkably low beam divergence of FWHM=0.3°.Full size image', 'Control experiments', 'To further characterize the lasing, several control experiments were carried out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, a sample with equal area and amount of nanoparticles but at random positions exhibits no lasing, ruling out random lasing37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FDTD simulations of our structures show that the near fields decay, in the z-direction perpendicular to the array, to 5% of the peak value within 100 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We deposited polymer poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) layers of various thicknesses on top of the array so that the gain medium was separated from the nanoparticles: for thickness of about 100 nm we observed lasing, but not for 500 nm (Supplementary Fig 1; Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For phenomena reliant on strong coupling, the presence of the emitters extremely close to the nanoparticles is expected to be more essential than for our lasing which takes place in the weak coupling regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As one more control, in contrast to ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23 where SLRs hybridize with waveguide modes, our samples exhibit no lasing when over 75% of particles are removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For more information about the control experiments with 0, 50 and 75% of particles removed, see Supplementary Figs 24 and Supplementary Note 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Real space images', 'From Fig 2df we note that the higher energy lasing mode has a lower threshold, higher emission intensity, and a slightly narrower linewidth compared with the lower energy peak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It could therefore be associated with the low loss dark mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in case of an infinite array size, the dark mode should not radiate to the far field, see Fig 1f.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Curiously, the higher energy mode exhibits multiple peaks in k, whereas the lower energy lasing mode shows only a single peak at k=0, see Fig 2c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A striking difference between the two cases is observed also in real space images of the lasing action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These far field microscope images correspond to the real space distribution of radiation from the sample but are not the same as the near-field distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3a,b shows that the lower energy mode lases in the middle of the array, while in the case of the upper energy mode the lasing light is predominantly visible at the edges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 3c,d are shown multipolar scattering simulations, without a gain medium, of a finite 85 × 85 particle array under the y-polarized plane wave excitation (for details see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the simulations the particle polarizabilities include both dipolar and quadrupolar components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The real-space images in far field result from radiation emitted by the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The far field emission power is dominated by dipoles, thus the radiated far field intensities in Fig 3a,b are proportional to the square of induced dipole moments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the phase of the dipole moment stays nearly constant across the array for the lower energy mode (Fig 3e), whereas for the higher energy mode the phase undergoes an abrupt -phase shift at the centre of the array (Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amplitudes and phases of the quadrupolar moments for both modes are shown in Supplementary Fig 5, and the related discussion can be found from Supplementary Note 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Real space images of the lasing action and multipole expansion of scattering for y-polarized planewave.

image', 'Finite size effects', 'We hypothesize that the higher energy mode is indeed the dark mode, and that its visibility, the peculiar beating pattern in k and the real space distribution of the lasing light are all consequences of gradual evolution of radiation fields in the array due to finite-size effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 4 shows schematically how finite size effects can lead to radiating dipoles near the edge of the array that are either in the same (bright mode) or opposite (dark mode) phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, such a picture holds only if spatial coherence is preserved over the whole array.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The profoundly different character of the two modes is manifested in their dipole moment distributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the argument of Fig 4, for the bright (dark) mode, the induced dipole moments maximize in the centre (edges) of the array.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dark mode in a finite lattice is thus a hybrid mode containing also features typical for a bright mode of an infinite lattice, such as dipoles, which makes it visible in the far field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expected radiation in real space is strongest where the dipoles maximize.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, in the real space images of the lasing action, the bright mode mainly emits from the centre of the array (Fig 3a), whereas the dark mode radiates from the edges (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar behaviour is visible in the simulations (Fig 3c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Evolution of the radiation fields in the case of a finite array size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) For a bright mode, the phase across the array remains constant due to constructive interference of the counter-propagating radiation fields at each particle location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amplitude at the edge, however, will be reduced to one half as there are no particles and therefore no radiation incident from the other side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) For a dark mode, particles in the array are driven by left- and right-propagating radiation fields, which destructively interfere at the particle locations and therefore create a standing wave node and a quadrupole excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As one moves away from the centre; however, the destructive interference becomes gradually less complete due to unequal number of particles contributing to left- and right-propagating waves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This results in a buildup of dipole moments whose relative weight compared to the quadrupoles gradually increases when moving away from the centre of the array.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, for the dark mode the dipoles induced by the left- and right-propagating radiation fields are out of phase by .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dark mode in a finite lattice is thus different from the one in an infinite lattice: it features dipole moments and can thus be viewed as a hybrid mode with characteristics of both the bright and dark modes of an infinite lattice.Full size image', 'The different real-space distributions of the two lasing modes are expected to lead to distinct behaviour of the corresponding far-field momentum distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analogous to single slit interference, the bright mode acts as a source with a constant phase and nearly equal amplitude, leading to an odd beating pattern in k (constructive interference at k=0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the dark mode, radiation maximizes towards the edges, and thus a double slit analogy can be made.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the -phase shift in the radiation fields across the array, an even beating pattern in k is expected (destructive interference at k=0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, in Fig 2c, we observe a peak at k=0 for the lower energy mode and two peaks shifted away from k=0 for the higher energy, as expected for bright and dark modes, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As the ultimate test to our hypothesis, the even beating pattern in k for the dark mode should depend on the array size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is exactly what we observe: as the array size is decreased, the spacing of the beating pattern maxima gradually increases (Fig 5), depending linearly on the inverse of the array size, which is expected for small angles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The associated beating pattern in k shows that spatial coherence of the lasing action extends over the whole array for the system sizes (50100 m) considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the lasing spectra for different array sizes (Fig 5c) it is apparent that while smaller arrays have a higher pump threshold, the mode linewidth is not increased significantly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have thus shown lasing in the dark mode which can be coupled out by a unique approach based on the finite size of the array.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Dependence of the k-space

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In summary, we have demonstrated lasing at visible wavelengths both in dark and bright modes of a nanoparticle array.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though plasmonic systems at visible wavelengths are lossy, we achieve remarkably narrow (0.2 nm) linewidths, an increase of four orders of magnitude in emission intensity above threshold, low beam divergence of 0.3°, and spatial coherence lengths of 100 m. This achievement, together with earlier reaching of the strong coupling regime31,32, paves the way for studies of phenomena, which combine strong interactions with macroscopic mode population, for example thresholdless lasing, photon and polariton condensation, and photon fluids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dark-mode out-coupling mechanism that we introduce is not simple scattering or leakage from sharp edges of the system, rather, it is gradual, coherent build-up of dipole moments and radiation intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This inspires ideas for the design of not only out-coupling schemes but also beam guiding, trap potentials, topologically non-trivial lattices and edge modes, for instance by gradually changing the pitch and by particle shapes supporting higher order multipoles.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
