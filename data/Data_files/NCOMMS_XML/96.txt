Realization of a vertical topological pn junction in epitaxial Sb2Te3/Bi2Te3 heterostructures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators are a new state of quantum matter, which exhibits both a bulk band structure with an insulating energy gap as well as metallic spin-polarized Dirac fermion states when interfaced with a topologically trivial material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There have been various attempts to tune the Dirac point to a desired energetic position for exploring its unusual quantum properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show a direct experimental proof by angle-resolved photoemission of the realization of a vertical topological pn junction made of a heterostructure of two different binary 3D TI materials Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3 epitaxially grown on Si(111).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that the chemical potential is tunable by about 200 meV when decreasing the upper Sb2Te3 layer thickness from 25 to 6 quintuple layers without applying any external bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results make it realistic to observe the topological exciton condensate and pave the way for exploring other exotic quantum phenomena in the near future.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'It is well-known that binary compounds X2Y3 based on high-Z elements with sufficiently strong spin-orbit coupling, such as X=Bi or Sb and Y=Te or Se, belong to the class of strong three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators (TIs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They host an odd number of gapless Dirac cone-like linear dispersive surface states with chiral spin-momentum locking, which are located around high symmetry points in the surface Brillouin zone1,2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a practical point of view, these materials can be a basis for novel dissipationless spintronic devices because the propagation direction of their surface electrons is robustly locked to their spin orientation, that is, back-scattering in charge transport is prohibited as long as time-reversal symmetry is preserved6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Studying the Dirac fermion states promises the verification of exotic quantum phenomena, such as the image magnetic monopole, which may exist in TIs due to proximity effects to a ferromagnetic material8, or Majorana fermions, which can be induced at the interface of a strong TI and an s-wave superconductor9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, the spatial separation of variable Dirac cone structures opens up the possibility to study what was proposed as the horizontal topological pn junction10, where the effect of the lateral variation of the chemical potential on the spin-locked transport can be investigated, including its control by external electric fields11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Moreover, the vertical (with respect to the sample plane) separation of the Dirac cones might enable the observation of the so-called topological exciton condensate, which is proposed to exhibit fractionally charged excitations (similar to Majorana fermions) in its vortices without any additional interface12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only prerequisites are separated electron- and hole-type Dirac fermions on opposite surfaces which interact electrostatically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'There has been considerable amount of research to precisely tune the position of the Fermi level EF in topological Dirac cones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, this can be achieved by surface doping13 which, however, does not lead to a suppression of the bulk conductivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another successful path is to gradually tune the composition in a ternary11,14,15,16 (or even quaternary16) alloy, like (Bi1xSbx)2Te3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since typical epitaxially grown layers of Bi2Te3 (Sb2Te3) turn out to be of n-(p-)type charge character, which are dominated by electron (hole) transport in the bulk17, this alloying leads to an effective compensation of charge and thus to a shift of the chemical potential and tunable surface states and eventually also suppression of the bulk conductivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Similarly, bringing together two different binary TI films to create a vertical topological pn junction should also lead to compensation of charge within the depletion layer formed at their interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the effect of such a topological pn junction on the topologically protected surface states or the surface electronic structure in general has not been reported so far.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this article, we present the direct observation of thickness-dependent electronic shifts of the chemical potential in vertical topological pn junctions by means of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The junctions are created in Sb2Te3/Bi2Te3 heterostructures of variable layer thickness, grown by molecular beam epitaxy, which assures high-crystalline quality and high accuracy of the thickness and composition of the thin films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thickness of the underlying Bi2Te3 layer is kept constant for all samples as approximately six quintuple layers (QLs), whereas the Sb2Te3 layer thickness t is varied t=25, 15, 7, 6 QL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modifying the top layer thickness results in a varying influence from the buried layer on the probed upper surface and thus to a Dirac point (DP) shifting up to 200 meV with respect to the Fermi level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way we are able to alter an Sb2Te3 surface from being of p-type charge carrier character to n-type by reducing the thickness above the Bi2Te3 layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Thus, we believe that our findings add a fundamentally new approach to the conventional ones, such as doping or biasing, to engineer the band structure in TIs and especially their Dirac cone by intrinsic interfacial effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, we believe that such advanced synthesis techniques will allow for the study of the interaction of opposing Dirac cones and potential new quantum states such as the topological exciton condensate.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Structural analysis', 'High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements were carried out to investigate structure and quality of the heterostructures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1a displays a high-angular annular dark field (HAADF) image of a 15 QL Sb2Te3/6 QL Bi2Te3 sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the difference in atomic number, Bi atomic columns appear brightest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystalline quality and the degree of structural order of the individual QLs, which are clearly separated by van der Waals gaps, are very high.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only at the interface to the Si substrate, the contrast is slightly deteriorated due to amorphization during preparation of the sample for STEM (see Methods section) or the additional Te bilayer at the Si interface, which was reported by Borisova et al.18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This contrast change is also observed in very thin areas of the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, only thick areas are suitable for investigation, which implies a loss of resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the individual atomic columns are clearly revealed, which is highlighted in the inset displaying four QLs across the interface at higher magnification with a structural model as overlay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 1b the intensity averaged within the red frame (in Fig 1a) is plotted versus distance (also serving as scale of the STEM image in Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Towards the Si substrate, a decrease in counts is observed indicating a reduction in specimen thickness, which is in line with the observed amorphization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the Sb2Te3/Bi2Te3 interface, the intensity is observed to decrease over a region of two QLs, that is, 2 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the contrast within the Sb2Te3 remains constant, we assume a constant thickness across the interface as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the intensity gradient across the small interface region implies intermixing of Bi and Sb.

electrons are scattered, that is, chemical contrast is obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To estimate the size of the intermixed interface region a line profile is plotted in b, integrated over the red

donors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides vacancies, also ionized BiTe antisite defects generate the n-type doping17,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the contrary, in Sb2Te3 the major defects are SbTe antisite defects, which impose p-type charge carriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, Sb2Te3/Bi2Te3 heterostructures are expected to exhibit a separation of opposite carrier character making them a natural pn junction system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prove the existence of different regimes of charge carrier types, we performed magnetic field-dependent transport measurements at 1.4 K in standard Hall-bar geometry with sample widths between 20 and 40 m and lengths between 150 and 300 m..  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting Hall resistances are shown in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Field-dependent transport measurements.Hall resistance Rxy of four different samples with varying top Sb2Te3 layer thickness investigated at fixed gate voltages and low temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For thinner top layer thickness of 3 QL (black curve) and 6 QL (green curve), the heterostructure is in an n-type (electron) transport regime, whereas for thicker films of 17 QL (red curve) and 28 QL (blue curve) p-type (hole) transport is dominant.Full size image', 'We observe a transition from n- to p-type regime for increasing top Sb2Te3 layer thickness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slope of the transversal Hall resistance Rxy changes from negative to positive between a sample thickness of 6 QL (green curve) and 17 QL Sb2Te3 (red curve).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that the electronic transport is mostly dominated by electron (n-type) and hole (p-type) transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There exists a non-linearity of the Hall resistance at lower fields, which is interpreted as an effect due to the coexistence of both p- and n-type charge carriers in the samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is neither as strong nor it changes its slope as it was previously reported for certain gate voltages in similar heterostructures20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slight change of the slope between the green (six QL sample) and black curve (three QL sample), which is opposite to the general trend, is due to the accuracy of this measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Electronic structure', 'The surface electronic structure of the studied heterostructures was mapped in detail using high-resolution ARPES.

#@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectra reveal that for decreasing Sb2Te3 top layer thickness the chemical potential of the sample surface is shifted from within the valence band through the forbidden band gap and towards the conduction band.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereby, the DP crosses the Fermi level at about 15 QL Sb2Te3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The samples consisting of pure Sb2Te3 (Fig 4a,f,k) and the

charge of 1 × 1012 cm2 at the Bi2Te3/Si interface and the Sb2Te3 surface (all details of the model are given in Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To account for our knowledge of the slight intermixing at the interface, we also include into the model a 5-nm-wide interface region where the charge carrier density follows an experimentally deduced profile (by AES depth profiling, see Supplementary Fig 1), which lead to further improvement of the comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementary Fig 2 additionally compares the result of the model for estimated limits of the carrier

Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In conclusion, we have presented a new reliable way to precisely and robustly tune the charge carrier character and the chemical potential in 3D TIs by the creation of built-in interfacial electric fields in a vertical topological pn junction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method does not introduce disorder due to doping and does not require any external bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our heterostructures are a convenient playground for the study of Majorana fermions, which are predicted to be observed in tunnelling spectroscopy measurements of 3D TI-superconductor interfaces, if the DP is adjusted precisely at the Fermi level9,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Dirac electrons which reside in the (n-type) topological state at the interface between Bi2Te3 and silicon (which cannot be probed by ARPES) can couple to the (p-type) surface Dirac electrons such that a topological exciton condensate with similar properties as a topological superconductor is formed12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This new state of correlated quantum matter is so far elusive, but opens up a feasible alternative to probe effects like charge fractionalization in vortices or topological magnetoelectric effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this respect, compared with dual-gating of a single TI layer, our approach of combining two binary TI layers in a pn junction is much more versatile and, moreover, has the advantage of linearly dispersing Dirac states on both sides of the heterostructure, which enables the existence of two identical electron and hole Fermi surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the built-in spatial asymmetry of the Dirac bands and the reliable tunability of the chemical potential by manipulating purely internal structural parameters pave the way for studying exciting novel phenomena with potential applications in spintronics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
