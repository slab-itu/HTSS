Genome scale patterns of supercoiling in a bacterial chromosome  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'DNA in bacterial cells primarily exists in a negatively supercoiled state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extent of supercoiling differs between regions of the chromosome, changes in response to external conditions and regulates gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the use of trimethylpsoralen intercalation to map the extent of supercoiling across the Escherichia coli chromosome during exponential and stationary growth phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that stationary phase E. coli cells display a gradient of negative supercoiling, with the terminus being more negatively supercoiled than the origin of replication, and that such a gradient is absent in exponentially growing cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This stationary phase pattern is correlated with the binding of the nucleoid-associated protein HU, and we show that it is lost in an HU deletion strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that HU establishes higher supercoiling near the terminus of the chromosome during stationary phase, whereas during exponential growth DNA gyrase and/or transcription equalizes supercoiling across the chromosome.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'DNA from living cells is mostly negatively supercoiled in vivo1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This negative supercoiling is important for transcription, replication and recombination2,3,4,5,6 and is brought about by the combined action of transcription, replication, topoisomerase activity, and the binding of proteins such as bacterial nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) to DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'During transcription, the moving RNA polymerase creates a region of positive supercoiling (overwinding) in front of itself and negative supercoiling (underwinding) behind7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Escherichia coli, these negative supercoils are relaxed by the action of Topoisomerase I and the positive supercoils are relaxed by ATP-dependent DNA gyrase, so that the balance between the activities of the two enzymes determines the overall level of supercoiling7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is referred to as unconstrained supercoiling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supercoiling can also be constrained by nucleoid-associated proteins such as H-NS, HU and FIS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HU is present in 30,000 dimers per cell9,10 and is the most conserved NAP across bacterial species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It binds across the bacterial chromosome and has been shown to constrain negative supercoils on DNA in vitro11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in conflict with transposon insertion screens14, which identified H-NS and FIS, but not HU or its homologue IHF, as modulators of DNA supercoiling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, other studies15,16 have seen reduced supercoiling of both plasmid and chromosomal DNA in HU knockouts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H-NS, a gene silencer that binds in long tracts to A+T-rich and / or intrinsically bent DNA, has been shown to constrain negative supercoils both in vivo and in vitro17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FIS, the most abundant NAP during exponential growth of E. coli, constrains a low superhelical density in vitro and also modulates the activity of DNA gyrase19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The extent of supercoiling is sensitive to changes in the extracellular environment such as nutrient starvation21, anaerobic growth22, osmotic shock23,24, and temperature25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also acts as a global regulator of gene expression, with sets of genes showing distinct changes in expression upon changes in supercoiling26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the superhelical state of the DNA connects environmental changes to gene expression states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One condition where chromosomal supercoiling has been suggested to respond to an environmental change and regulate gene expression is stationary phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E. coli cells enter stationary phase upon exhaustion of nutrients; in this state, transcription, translation and proliferation are reduced and cells become more stress-tolerant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of the changes in gene expression underlying this process are attributable to the reduced activity of the housekeeping sigma factor 70 and the increased activity of the alternative sigma factor 38 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Average chromosomal supercoiling decreases during stationary phase21,26,29 and it has been suggested that this contributes to the reduced synthesis of ribosomal RNA30 and increased activity of 38 over 70 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite these studies, we do not know whether there exists a global pattern to supercoiling along a bacterial chromosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on ChIP-chip (chromatin immunoprecipitation) studies of DNA gyrase, it has been suggested31 that during exponential growth there is a gradient of supercoiling with the origin of replication more negatively supercoiled than the terminus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this is an indirect measure of supercoiling, one step away from a direct measure of superhelical density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we address this gap using psoralen crosslinking of chromosomal DNA followed by DNA microarray experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the stationary phase E. coli chromosome displays a gradient of negative supercoiling, with maximal supercoiling near the terminus, and that this gradient is lost in exponential phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gradient is also absent in a strain lacking the nucleoid-associated protein HU.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that HU binding maintains negative supercoiling around the terminus in stationary phase, and that DNA gyrase and / or transcriptional activity near the origin equalize supercoiling across the chromosome in exponential phase.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Measuring genome-wide supercoiling with psoralen', 'Psoralens are furanocoumarin compounds that intercalate between DNA base pairs and form crosslinks with DNA under ultraviolet light32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Psoralen binds preferentially to negatively supercoiled DNA34, with the frequency of crosslinking being proportional to the superhelical density of the DNA35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intercalation of psoralen and its derivatives has therefore been used as a measure of average supercoiling of E. coli plasmids and genomic DNA36, and supercoiling near specific genes37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, it has been used to measure local supercoiling across the genome in yeast35 and human cells38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is to be noted here that psoralen crosslinking measures the contribution of twist, but not writhe, to the degree of supercoiling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We grew E. coli cells to mid-exponential or stationary phase in LB medium (growth curves in Supplementary Figure 1), treated them with trimethylpsoralen (hereafter referred to simply as psoralen) and exposed them to UV light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions, psoralen enters cells, intercalates between DNA base pairs, and crosslinks the two strands of DNA at a rate proportional to the local superhelical density35,36,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Following this principle, we standardized a method to measure the extent of psoralen crosslinking along the E. coli chromosome by fragmenting DNA and hybridizing crosslinked and non-crosslinked DNA fragments separately to high-resolution tiling microarrays that cover the entire E. coli genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since crosslinking by psoralen increases with local supercoiling, we expected that the more negatively supercoiled a given portion of the genome was at the time of psoralen treatment, the more it would be enriched in the crosslinked fraction relative to the non-crosslinked fraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated this enrichment in the form of the log2 ratio of the crosslinked and the non-crosslinked fluorescent signals corresponding to each probe on the microarray.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enrichment ratios were represented as a function of the position on the chromosome to which the corresponding probe mapped.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The noisy nature of the data necessitated smoothing of the signal, and the degree of smoothing was as small as possible to provide replicate correlations of 0.75 or greater (Supplementary Figure 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The smoothed and log-transformed ratio between the signals from the crosslinked and the non-crosslinked fractions was taken as a measure of psoralen binding and thus of local negative supercoiling38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A terminus centric supercoiling gradient in stationary phase', 'In stationary phase, we observe that negative supercoiling is greatest close to the terminus of the chromosome and decreases in either direction (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The range of psoralen binding is from 0.1 to 0.1, consistent with similar data from human chromosomes38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Earlier experiments35,36 have shown that DNA with high physiological levels of negative supercoiling has only about twofold higher psoralen intercalation than relaxed DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The terminus region of the chromosome has higher A+T content, and psoralen is known to have a preference for binding to A+T-rich DNA35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the gradient of supercoiling during stationary phase remains when the signal is corrected for the A+T content of the microarray probes (Supplementary Figure 3), indicating that the observed higher psoralen binding around the terminus is not merely an artifact due to its preference for the higher A+T content in this region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In exponential phase, the level of negative supercoiling is similar across the chromosome, with the origin only slightly more negatively supercoiled than the terminus (Fig 1b).

'Factors influencing exponential phase supercoiling', 'DNA gyrase introduces negative supercoils into the chromosome by an ATP-dependent mechanism40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activity of DNA gyrase depends on the cellular ATP/ADP ratio and therefore increases during exponential growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the average negative supercoiling of the entire chromosome is higher in exponential phase than in stationary phase21,26,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, DNA gyrase does not bind uniformly across the genome in exponential phase; its binding is lowest at the terminus and increases toward the origin41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the gradient of DNA gyrase binding is opposite to that of stationary phase supercoiling, we reasoned that DNA gyrase might be one of the factors responsible for neutralizing the supercoiling gradient in exponential phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference between the exponential and stationary phase supercoiling levels across the chromosome is plotted in Fig 2a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Negative supercoiling increases more around the origin than the terminus in exponential phase, and the pattern of this increase is similar to that of DNA gyrase binding across the chromosome41 which is plotted in Fig 2b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A scatter plot of the change in supercoiling from stationary to exponential phase against DNA gyrase binding to each gene (Fig 2c) illustrates the positive correlation between the two (permutation test, P less_than 105).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that this pattern of increased supercoiling may be created, at least in part, by the action of DNA gyrase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: The effect of DNA gyrase binding and transcription on chromosome supercoiling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Change in negative supercoiling from stationary to

G+C-rich Repetitive Extragenic Palindromic (REP) sequences42, which are present in 700 copies in the E. coli chromosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density of REP sequences is highest near the origin and lowest at the terminus (Supplementary Figure 4a), somewhat similar to the pattern of DNA gyrase binding, and genes near REP sequences show higher DNA gyrase binding (Supplementary Figure 4b, Wilcoxon test P less_than 103).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'However, in addition to this, the function of DNA gyrase is tightly linked to transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activity of RNA polymerase generates positive supercoils in front of it, and negative supercoils behind.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Topoisomerases release these tensions, with DNA gyrase responsible for releasing the positive supercoils generated in front.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, transcription by itself might negatively supercoil DNA in wild-type E. coli with functional DNA gyrase and topoisomerase I; this might be explained by the formation of the transcription bubble43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe that exponential phase gene expression measurements from tiling microarrays are correlated, to a small extent, with the binding profile of DNA gyrase (Supplementary Figure 5), as well as with the difference in psoralen crosslinking between exponential and stationary phases (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it remains unclear whether the changes in supercoiling patterns between the stationary and exponential phases of growth emerge directly from the activity of DNA gyrase itself, or whether it is a function of the combined action of the RNA polymerase and the two topoisomerases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Separating these effects presents a significant challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The role of HU in maintaining the supercoiling gradient', 'We next examined the association of negative supercoiling with the binding of prominent NAPs of E. coli: H-NS, HU, IHF and FIS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While binding sites of IHF and FIS showed no difference in psoralen binding compared to neighbouring regions of DNA (Supplementary Figure 6; Supplementary Figure 7), we found an association with psoralen binding for HU and H-NS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'HU binds throughout the E. coli chromosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To study its effects on DNA supercoiling we divided the genome into 5 Kb bins, and calculated the extent of HU binding in each bin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a positive correlation between psoralen binding and the binding of the HupA subunit of HU during stationary phase (Fig 3a, Pearson correlation coefficient 0.44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results were similar for the HupB subunit (Supplementary Figure 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H-NS binding sites had higher psoralen binding (and therefore higher negative supercoiling) compared to 1 Kb long stretches of DNA flanking them on either side, during stationary phase (Fig 3d, paired Wilcoxon test P less_than 1015).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note, however, that during exponential phase, the binding profile of HU shows no correlation with psoralen crosslinking (Fig 3b), and H-NS binding sites also tend to have lower psoralen binding than their flanking regions (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possible explanation could be reduced DNA gyrase binding at HU or H-NS-bound loci (Fig 3c,f), due to reduced accessibility of the DNA or reduced transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3:

HU or H-NS be responsible for the supercoiling gradient in stationary phase?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Towards answering this, we first performed a computational analysis, followed by an experimental investigation for HU.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the computational approach, using the relationship between the binding profiles of HU or H-NS (Fig 4a,b) and the psoralen binding signal in stationary phase (Fig 4c upper), we estimated what the supercoiling pattern of the stationary phase chromosome would be in the absence of these proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To correct for the effect of HU we divided the genome into 5 Kb bins and plotted the residuals of the loess fit between psoralen binding and HU binding levels in each bin (Fig 4c middle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To correct for the higher negative supercoiling of H-NS binding sites, we took the psoralen binding in each H-NS binding site plus 2.5 Kb flanking regions on either side, and replaced these values with the average psoralen binding in the 2 Kb regions on either side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2.5 Kb flanking region was included as this region also has slightly increased supercoiling, decaying with distance from the H-NS binding site (Supplementary Figure 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus we reduced the psoralen binding signal within and immediately adjacent to the H-NS binding site to that of neighbouring unbound DNA, and plotted the resultant pattern of psoralen binding (Fig 4c lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that correcting for the effect of H-NS did not change the basic pattern of supercoiling in stationary phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correcting for HU had a considerably larger effect, suggesting that HU may have a larger role in maintaining the pattern of supercoiling during stationary phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

global negative superhelicity45, at least in exponential phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A role for HU in unwinding bound DNA has also been shown46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we experimentally investigated

predicted, the absence of HU resulted in the loss of the peak of supercoiling surrounding the terminus, giving a flat supercoiling profile (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is unlikely to be due to changes in transcription in the HU knockout, as there was no particular difference in gene expression around the terminus between the HU knockout and the wild-type, during stationary phase

to have higher psoralen binding than their flanking regions was reversed in the absence of HU (Fig 4f), suggesting that the connection between H-NS and psoralen binding shown in Fig 3d was not a direct consequence of H-NS binding to DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Thus the binding of HU leads to higher negative supercoiling of its bound or neighbouring DNA, resulting in overall higher negative supercoiling surrounding the chromosomal terminus during stationary phase.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have demonstrated that stationary phase E. coli cells maintain a gradient of negative supercoiling with its peak near the terminus of the chromosome, whereas exponentially growing E. coli show relatively even supercoiling across the chromosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously, Sobetzko et al.31 have proposed that during exponential phase, DNA gyrase maintains a gradient of supercoiling with the origin higher than the terminus, favoring transcription of origin-proximal genes as well as the initiation of replication at OriC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though overall negative supercoiling is known to increase in exponential phase, we see very little difference between the origin and other regions of the chromosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We propose that during stationary phase, factors such as the nucleoid-associated protein HU maintain a higher level of supercoiling around the terminus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have shown that psoralen crosslinking to the DNA is prevented by nucleosomes38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis suggests that HU-bound DNA shows higher psoralen crosslinking; an association which is lost in HU-deficient cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This appears to be in conflict with the accepted wisdom that psoralen crosslinking typically occurs at unconstrained and unwound DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The level to which DNA bound to HU is unwound may favour crosslinking by psoralen, whereas a nucleosome wrapping DNA around it might pose a greater steric challenge for psoralen-DNA interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, psoralen crosslinking might occur at unwound DNA adjacent to where HU is bound: the present experiments are unlikely to help resolve this.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On entry into exponential phase, the increased ATP/ADP ratio leads to increased DNA gyrase activity, which together with high transcription (and possibly other factors) brings about higher negative supercoiling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the activities of DNA gyrase and RNA polymerase increase with proximity to the origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the general increase in negative superhelicity of the chromosome of exponentially growing E. coli might be localised to origin-proximal regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This is the first study of genome-wide supercoiling patterns in bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future experiments may further elucidate how these patterns change under different conditions and species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While we have experimentally shown the role of HU in maintaining chromosomal supercoiling in stationary phase, further experiments will evaluate our predictions on the functions of DNA gyrase and transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect that inhibition of DNA gyrase should restore the terminus-to-origin supercoiling gradient in exponential phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a challenge here would be to decouple the interlinked effects of DNA gyrase and transcription.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
