Triamidoamine thorium-arsenic complexes with parent arsenide, arsinidiide and arsenido structural motifs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Despite a major expansion of uraniumligand multiple bond chemistry in recent years, analogous complexes involving other actinides (An) remain scarce.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For thorium, under ambient conditions only a few multiple bonds to carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and chalcogenides are reported, and none to arsenic are known; indeed only two complexes with thoriumarsenic single bonds have been structurally authenticated, reflecting the challenges of stabilizing polar linkages at the large thorium ion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report thorium parentarsenide (ThAsH2), arsinidiides (ThAs(H)K and ThAs(H)Th) and arsenido (ThAsTh) linkages stabilized by a bulky triamidoamine ligand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ThAs(H)K and ThAsTh linkages exhibit polarized-covalent thoriumarsenic multiple bonding interactions, hitherto restricted to cryogenic matrix isolation experiments, and the AnAs(H)An and AnAsAn linkages reported here have no precedent in f-block chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7s, 6d and 5f orbital contributions to the ThAs bonds are suggested by quantum chemical calculations, and their compositions unexpectedly appear to be tensioned differently compared to phosphorus congeners.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Despite the developed nature of uraniumligand multiple bond chemistry1,2,3,4that is burgeoning due to a pressing need to improve our fundamental understanding of the chemical bonding of actinide (An) elements5,6,7,8,9 and how this might impact reactivity and nuclear waste clean-up10,11the chemistry of other Anligand multiple bonds, aside from actinyls, AnO2n+ (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12), remains extremely rare13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in order to truly delineate bonding trends across the actinides, and thus draw inferences as to their competitive bonding and reactivity, comparisons between structurally analogous complexes that contain different actinide metals are required, but concerted comparisons of such families of compounds remain relatively rare14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21 due to a paucity of synthetic methodologies to prepare them or the radiological limitations encountered in this area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, thorium is an attractive element to study, both in terms of radiological practicality and also the nature of its bonding when compared to uranium, that is, 6d versus 5f character19,21,22,23,24, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Thoriumligand multiple bond chemistry is an attractive area for studying chemical bonding because of the intrinsic features of metalligand multiple bonds, but it is far less developed than uranium1,2,3,4, being restricted to a few carbene21,25,26,27,28,29,30, imido31,32,33 and chalcogenido22,23,24,34,35,36 complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Very recently the first thoriumphosphinidene and -phosphido complexes under ambient conditions37 added to the preparation of a thoriumphosphido complex in frozen argon matrix isolation conditions38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bonding contrast between uranium and thorium is usually framed in terms of computationally determined straight trade-offs between 5f and 6d orbital character23, but our recent work on ThP bonds37 showed an unexpected intrusion of 7s orbital character into the bonding, and notably this effectively came at the expense of 6d and not 5f orbital participation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to ascertain whether this is a unique or more broadly applicable phenomenon would require comparison to closely related compounds and in that regard arsenic congeners are the logical next step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, reflecting the cumulative instability of pairing a large, polar metal like thorium with increasingly large, soft p-block elements39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47 presents an increasing synthetic challenge regarding their preparation and isolation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, examples of thorium complexes with bonds to pnictide (Pn) elements heavier than phosphorus are exceedingly rare, and under ambient conditions the only two structurally characterized thoriumarsenic complexes are the Zintl-polyarsenide {Th(5-1,3-But2C5H3)2}2(-3:3-As6) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  48) and the bis(arsenide) Th(5-C5Me5)2(AsH-2,4,6-Pri3C6H2)2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39), which are principally ThAs -bonded species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, thoriumarsenic multiple bonded compounds are restricted to F3ThAs formed under cryogenic matrix isolation conditions38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, there are very few thoriumarsenic bonds, and none with polarized-covalent multiple bonding interactions under ambient conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More widely, even multiple bonds between transition metals and arsenic remain quite rare49,50,51,52,53,54,55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previously, following on from our uranium-nitride work56,57,58,59 we have reported the synthesis of terminal parent uraniumamide, phosphanide, and arsenide complexes U(TrenTIPS)(EH2) TrenTIPS=N(CH2CH2NSiPri3)3; E=N, P, As, the corresponding parent uraniumimido, phosphinidene and arsinidene complexes U(TrenTIPS)(EH)K(L)2 (L=a 15-crown-5 ether), and the arsenido tetramer U(TrenTIPS)AsK24 (refs 60, 61, 62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently we extended this chemistry to thorium and prepared parent phosphanide, phosphinidene, phosphinidiide and -phosphido analogues37, and noted that the increase of single bond covalent radii of thorium (1.75 Å) compared to uranium (1.70 Å) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  63) resulted in the thorium derivatives being on the cusp of stability compared to uranium analogues; this prompted us to consider the preparation of the thoriumarsenic analogues since according to Pyykkö arsenic is 0.1 Å larger than phosphorus63, and thus represents a significant synthetic challenge to be stabilized at thorium from a steric perspective in addition to aforementioned bond polarity and covalency arguments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of thoriumarsenic complexes with ThAsH2 parentarsenide, ThAs(H)K and ThAs(H)Th parentarsinidiide and ThAsTh arsenido linkages stabilized by the TrenTIPS ligand59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thoriumarsenic linkages in this study are the most ionic of our AnPn combinations to date, but quantum chemical calculations suggest that both ThAsH2 and ThAs(H)K display modest covalency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provides an opportunity to compare to previously reported uraniumarsenic, and thoriumphosphorus congeners, revealing unexpected contrasts of the balance and tensioning of the 7s/6d/5f contributions in the ThAs bonds when compared to ThP congeners37,62.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Th(TrenTIPS)(AsH2) (2) in 71% yield, Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the TrenTIPS proton environments are clearly observed in the 1H NMR spectrum of 2, the AsH2 hydrogen resonances could not be located.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the presence of AsH2 in 2 is confirmed by two AsH stretches at 2,051 and 2,064 cm1 in its ATR-IR spectrum, and these stretches compare very well to computed AsH stretches of 2,050 and 2,066 cm1 from an analytical frequencies calculation (Supplementary Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, when KAsD2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  37) is used in the synthesis instead of KAsH2 to prepare Th(TrenTIPS)(AsD2) (2D) for isotopic labelling purposes, the absorptions at 2,051 and 2,064 cm1 shift, as expected, into the fingerprint region of the ATR-IR spectrum (Supplementary Figure 1).

19) when reacted in a 1:1:1 ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complex 3 is typically obtained as an analytically clean microcrystalline powder in 70% isolated yield.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like 2, the AsH resonance of 3 could not be located in the 1H NMR spectrum, but a weak and broad AsH stretch is found around 1,930 cm1 in the ATR-IR spectrum, which compares to a computed AsH frequency stretch of 1,974 cm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that the 1,930 cm1 absorption is an AsH stretch we prepared Th(TrenTIPS)(-AsD)K(15C5) (3D) and found like 2/2D that upon deuteration the 1,930 cm1 band to be greatly reduced in intensity (Supplementary Figure 2) due to an isotopomer shift into the fingerprint region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'When the 1:1 reaction of 4 with KAsH2 is carried out in the absence of 15C5 the yellow dithorium parent arsinidiide complex {Th(TrenTIPS)}2(-AsH) (5) is the only isolable compound from a complex mixture of otherwise intractable decomposition products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the mixture of products, however, 5 is isolated in 74% crystalline yield, Scheme 1, presumably with concomitant elimination of K2AsH, which is a known product from the reaction 2 KAsH2K2AsH+AsH3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As above, the AsH resonance could not be located in the 1H NMR spectrum, but the ATR-IR spectrum reveals a broad and weak absorption at 1,922 cm1 that compares well to a computed AsH stretching frequency of 1,987 cm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inspection of the ATR-IR spectrum of {Th(TrenTIPS)}2(-AsD) (5D) reveals a major reduction in intensity of the 1,922 cm1 absorption,

access a terminal Th=AsH unit by another route to that which resulted in the production of 5, when two equivalents of 15C5 or one equivalent of 2,2,2-cryptand are used in the deprotonation of 2 with benzyl potassium, unlike the analogous uranium chemistry62, the terminal arsinidene complex Th(TrenTIPS)(AsH)K(L)2 (L=crown or cryptand) could not be isolated despite exhaustive efforts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It would seem that the combination of the large thorium and arsenic centres with a weak, polar and labile putative Th=AsH linkage exceeds the steric stabilizing properties of TrenTIPS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, with no bulky As-group to kinetically protect the terminal Th=AsH linkage, the dithoriumarsenido complex {Th(TrenTIPS)}2(-As)K(15C5)2 (6) is the sole isolable product with elimination of KAsH2 implicated; in effect K(15C5) and Th(TrenTIPS) thus act as protective trapping groups to the (TrenTIPS)ThAsH units in 3 and 5, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Since the AsH linkages are evidently polar and labile, we sought to prepare 6 rationally, and find that 6 can be accessed via a deliberate synthesis where 4 is reacted with KAsH2 in a 2:1 ratio in the presence of

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The synthesis and characterization of thorium parentarsenide (ThAsH2), arsinidiides (ThAs(H)K and ThAs(H)Th) and arsenido (ThAsTh) linkages stabilized by a bulky triamidoamine ligand introduces a new range of AnAs bonds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parent AsHn linkages are notable for their sterically unencumbered natures at an ion as large as thorium67,68,69,70, and the ThAs(H)K and ThAsTh linkages, even though not terminal, represent the first thoriumarsenic multiple bonds under ambient conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, given recent progress in non-aqueous actinide chemistry, the ThAs(H)Th and ThAsTh linkages reported here have no precedent in f-block chemistry and indeed are rare even in transition metal chemistry69,70,71,72,73,74,75.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All attempts to prepare a terminal parent Th=AsH linkage resulted in the isolation of a compound with a ThAsTh arsenido structural motif, demonstrating that Th=AsH is too fragile to be stabilized even by the very bulky TrenTIPS ligand, and thus this thoriumarsenic combination surpasses the stabilizing capability of TrenTIPS highlighting the synthetic challenges of stabilizing bonding between such large metal/metalloidal ions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability to prepare complex 3 by more than one method is notable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same situation was found for the ThP analogue, but is perhaps more remarkable here due to the increased polarity of the resulting ThAs bond; while greater reactivity could be anticipated, this would be expected to result in less product selectivity so the fact that a well-defined product can be routinely isolated as the majority product is unexpected when considering the number of bond-breaking and -forming steps that occur concurrently to give 3 when prepared from cyclometallate 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The thoriumarsenic single bond in 2 and double bond in 3 can be considered to be long when compared to the additive sum of the single bond radii of thorium and arsenic; this trend has been observed with the related UP, UAs and ThP complexes and can be related to the steric demands of the TrenTIPS ligand and for 3 to the anionic formulation of the Th-component37,61,62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thoriumarsenic bond lengths in 5 are intermediate to 2 and 3, which reflects the dianionic nature of the (AsH)2 unit coupled to its bridging nature and the presence of two highly polarizing thorium centres in 5 but only one thorium and a softer potassium ion in 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The additional charge load of As3 compared to (AsH)2 accounts for the moderately shorter thoriumarsenic bond lengths in 6 compared to 5 and 3 even when two polarizing thorium ions are coordinated to the trianionic arsenido ion, and suggests that a Th=As=Th core with two formal double bond interactions, in a Lewis bonding scheme, can be considered to be present in 6 as is the case with the ThPTh analogue37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One notable observation is that in {Th(TrenTIPS)}2(-P) the ThNamine distances are quite long, suggesting a trans-influence of the trianionic phosphido ligand; however, an analogous effect is not duplicated in 6, which perhaps reflects the lower charge density at arsenic compared to phosphorus and the more ionic ThAs bonding compared to ThP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ThAsH angle in 3 of 79.1(2)° suggests, like the ThP analogue37, that a Th···H agostic- or anagostic-type interaction may be present, but unlike the ThP analogue unfortunately no AsH coupling constant data are available from which to judge whether this is actually the case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The computational data for 2, 3, 5 and 6 are largely in-line with tetravalent uranium and thoriumTren complexes, but comparison of 2 and 3 to U(TrenTIPS)(AsH2) (I) and U(TrenTIPS)(-AsH)K(2,2,2-crypt) (II) is particularly informative, Table 2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For 2 and I, the AnAs Mayer bond orders and MDC-q charges are essentially the same, but the AnAs bond in I is 13% U compared to 8% Th in 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the uranium component to the UAs -bond in I is split 3/2/47/48% 7s/7p/6d/5f the corresponding breakdown in 2 shows similar 6d participation in both complexes, but in 2 the 5f contribution is depleted due to a 7s component increased 15% compared to I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For 3 and II, the uraniumarsenic Mayer bond order of 1.35 in II is clearly larger than the thoriumarsenic value of 1.09 in 3, but the uranium and arsenic MDC-q charges of 2.68 and 1.34 in II are similar to the corresponding values in 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In II the uraniumarsenic -bond is 17% U (1/0/48/51% 7s/7p/6d/5f) and 83% As (5/95% 4s/4p) and the -bond is 22% U (0/1/36/63% 7s/7p/6d/5f) and 78% As (100% 4p).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, the corresponding thorium contributions to the thorium - and -bonds in 3 are diminished by 813% compared to the uranium contributions in II, and again although the 6d contributions in the - and -bonds are essentially the same for uranium and thorium, in the -bond the 5f contribution for thorium is lower due to 7% increased 7s contribution but for the -bond the 5f contribution is the same for thorium and uranium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the picture that emerges is that thorium is more ionic than uranium, but for these actinidearsenic complexes uranium and thorium essentially utilize similar levels of 6d contributions, and the difference is that uranium uses more 5f whereas thorium uses less 5f and more 7s in the bonding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, this is opposite to what is found for the analogous thorium and uraniumphosphorus complexes Th(TrenTIPS)(PH2) (III), U(TrenTIPS)(PH2) (IV), Th(TrenTIPS)(PH) (V), U(TrenTIPS)(PH) (VI) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  37), where similar 5f contributions were found and instead 6d participation was compromised by 7s contributions when those complexes are compared to the analogous uraniumphosphorus complexes overall (Table 2) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the thoriumarsenic linkages here are more polarized than the analogous thoriumphosphorus ones where comparisons are available37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these results certainly suggest a more nuanced bonding picture than that typically found, that is, a straight 5f versus 6d situation, and when phosphorus versus arsenic are considered provide evidence that the tension of 7s versus 6d versus 5f is also more complicated that might have previously been considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Why the tension between 7s, 6d, and 5f orbitals varies between phosphorus and arsenic when bonded to thorium is currently unclear, and will require further isostructural series of compounds to be prepared and studied to be fully understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 2 Comparison of computed NBO data for a selection of structurally related actinide-pnictide complexes.Full size table'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
