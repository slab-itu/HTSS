The increasing threat to stratospheric ozone from dichloromethane  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'It is well established that anthropogenic chlorine-containing chemicals contribute to ozone layer depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The successful implementation of the Montreal Protocol has led to reductions in the atmospheric concentration of many ozone-depleting gases, such as chlorofluorocarbons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, stratospheric chlorine levels are declining and ozone is projected to return to levels observed pre-1980 later this century.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recent observations show the atmospheric concentration of dichloromethanean ozone-depleting gas not controlled by the Montreal Protocolis increasing rapidly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using atmospheric model simulations, we show that although currently modest, the impact of dichloromethane on ozone has increased markedly in recent years and if these increases continue into the future, the return of Antarctic ozone to pre-1980 levels could be substantially delayed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sustained growth in dichloromethane would therefore offset some of the gains achieved by the Montreal Protocol, further delaying recovery of Earths ozone layer.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In the 1970s, it was recognized that chlorine and bromine released from long-lived anthropogenic compounds, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons, could destroy ozone in the stratosphere1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Industrial emissions of these halocarbons have led to widespread depletion of Earths ozone layer in recent decades, including the Antarctic Ozone Hole phenomenon3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peak ozone depletion was observed around the turn of the century, when globally the stratospheric ozone column was reduced by 5% relative to 1980 levels (a benchmark before which substantial ozone depletion had not been observed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While ozone depletion today remains a persistent environmental issue, there are signs that ozone recovery is underway6,7,8,9, owing to controls on the production of ozone-depleting compounds introduced by the 1987 Montreal Protocol and its amendments10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given compliance with the Protocol, stratospheric levels of chlorine derived from controlled ozone-depleting compounds should continue to steadily decline in coming decades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, stratospheric column ozone is projected to return to pre-1980 levels in the middle to latter half of this century, depending on location7,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Several human-produced chlorocarbons not controlled by the Montreal Protocol are present in Earths atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the most abundant of these compounds is dichloromethane (CH2Cl2)an industrial solvent also used as a feedstock in the production of other chemicals, among other applications13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike CFCs, which are virtually inert in the troposphere and have long atmospheric lifetimes (decades to centuries), CH2Cl2 is a so-called very short-lived substance (VSLS)15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Historically, VSLS have been thought to play a minor role in stratospheric ozone depletion due to their relatively short atmospheric lifetimes (typically  less_than 6 months) and therefore low atmospheric concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, substantial levels of both natural and anthropogenic VSLS have been detected in the lower stratosphere15,16,17,18 and numerical model simulations suggest a significant contribution of VSLS to ozone loss in this region19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long-term measurements of CH2Cl2 reveal that its tropospheric abundance has increased rapidly in recent years15,21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, between 2000 and 2012, surface concentrations of CH2Cl2 increased at a global mean rate of almost 8% per year, with the largest growth observed in the Northern Hemisphere (NH)21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that natural emissions of CH2Cl2 are small, this recent growth likely reflects an increase in industrial emissions15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the precise nature of the source remains poorly characterized, industrial CH2Cl2 emissions from Asiain particular from the Indian subcontinentappear to be growing in importance23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The impact of these observed changes and continued CH2Cl2 growth in coming decades on the timescale of stratospheric ozone recovery have not yet been considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, a state-of-the-art global chemical transport model (CTM) is used to examine the sensitivity of future stratospheric chlorine and ozone levels to sustained CH2Cl2 growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CTMs are commonly used to investigate detailed chemical processes and here, because transport is specified in the model, we are able to isolate the ozone response solely to increasing levels of CH2Cl2 in the atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that continued growth in the atmospheric loading of CH2Cl2 could offset some of the future benefits of the Montreal Protocol and lead to a substantial delay (more than a decade) in the recovery of stratospheric ozone over Antarctica.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Recent CH2Cl2 trends and future growth scenarios', 'Figure 1 shows the measured surface abundance of CH2Cl2 from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) long-term surface monitoring network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Globally, CH2Cl2 concentrations approximately doubled between 2004 and 2014 (Fig 1a), although growth rates varied considerably during this period (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The abundance of CH2Cl2 at mid-latitudes in the NH is around a factor of 3 greater than in the Southern Hemisphere (SH), reflecting NH industrial sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At present, it is unknown if a single industrial application of CH2Cl2, or several, is contributing to the observed upward trend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a common solvent, CH2Cl2 has numerous applications, which include use in metal cleaning/degreasing, in paint remover, and use by the pharmaceutical industry for preparing drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also used as blowing agent in production of foam plastics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A specific use of CH2Cl2, which seems likely to have increased in recent years, is in the manufacture of hydrofluorocarbonsthe non-ozone-depleting chemicals used as replacements for CFCs and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given these sources, it is probable that demand for CH2Cl2 from developing countries now, and in coming years, will be relatively high.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is supported by elevated levels of CH2Cl2 detected over Asia, where Indian emissions are estimated to have increased by two- to fourfold between 1998 and 2008 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

#@NEW_LINE#@#  Both are based on observed long-term surface trends (Fig 1c), and are designed to test the sensitivity of ozone to potential future changes in chlorine derived from CH2Cl2 growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scenario 1 assumes that surface CH2Cl2 continues to increase at the mean rate observed during the 20042014 period: 2.85 parts per trillion (p.p.t.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  per year at mid-latitudes in the NH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scenario 2, a more extreme growth scenario to test the sensitivity of ozone to larger CH2Cl2 increases, assumes CH2Cl2 continues to increase at the mean rate observed in the 20122014 period only: 6.1 p.p.t.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  per year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This period saw comparatively large CH2Cl2 growth compared to other recent years (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the two growth scenarios, we also consider a third scenario in which no further CH2Cl2 growth occurs post 2016 (Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this scenario (Scenario 3), surface CH2Cl2 concentrations are fixed at 2016 levels throughout the forward simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Constrained by the growth scenarios, our model simulations show a monotonic increase in chlorine

1 or 2, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Critically, the model reproduces well observed levels of CH2Cl2 around the tropopause in the recent past (Fig 1d, inset) and, therefore, the stratospheric chlorine perturbation in response to increasing surface CH2Cl2 concentrations is realistic in our simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Impact of CH2Cl2 growth on stratospheric inorganic chlorine', 'The dissociation of ozone-depleting compounds in the stratosphere liberates chlorine radicals which catalyse ozone loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to its relatively short stratospheric partial lifetime (of the order of 12 years in our model outside of the poles), CH2Cl2 dissociates rapidly and thereby makes its largest relative contribution to the pool of inorganic chlorine (Cly) in the lowermost stratosphere, at low latitudes (Fig 3ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At present, CH2Cl2 accounts for  less_than 10% of stratospheric Cly, although this contribution would increase significantly in coming decades if CH2Cl2 growth continues and as chlorine from long-lived gases decreases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By 2050 under Scenario 1, CH2Cl2 is projected to account for 2030% of total Cly in the lower stratosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An examination of the stratospheric Cly trend in recent decades in our model reveals a peak in Cly around the turn of the century at mid-latitudes (Fig 3d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of CH2Cl2, here lower stratospheric Cly is projected to return to pre-1980 levels by 2049, in line with ongoing decreases in levels of CFCs and other controlled long-lived Cly precursors7.

than the influence of potentially eliminating remaining small levels of production or emission of CFCs and HCFCs24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the upper stratosphere, Cly return dates occur later than in the lower stratosphere and are less sensitive to future CH2Cl2 growth (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the contribution of CH2Cl2 to total Cly remains at  less_than 10% in 2050 (Fig 3c).

decreases here remain small ( less_than 1%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recall, our simulations in the future period reflect the ozone response to changes in projected stratospheric composition only, comparing scenarios with CH2Cl2 growth to one with no CH2Cl2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future ozone is also expected to be influenced by other factors, including climate-driven changes to stratospheric temperature and

evolution in coming decades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such findings could also be relevant from a climate perspective21 as ozone absorbs both ultraviolet and infrared radiation, and as ozone perturbations in

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The Montreal Protocol has been extremely successful in alleviating polar ozone loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, it has been estimated the Antarctic Ozone Hole would have been 40% larger by 2013 had the Protocol not come into effect30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on current understanding, the Ozone Hole is expected to recover in this century.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 17 chemistry-climate models (CCMs) that took part in the Stratospheric Processes and their Role in Climate (SPARC) CCMVal project predict that the Antarctic Ozone Holedefined by the October average column ozone abundancewill return to pre-1980 levels between 2046 and 2057 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7), in line with the anticipated decline in controlled ozone-depleting substances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recent model simulations have suggested a later ozone return date that approaches the end of the century31,32, though none of these previous estimates have considered CH2Cl2, or indeed CH2Cl2 growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6 shows our model estimate of Antarctic Cly and column ozone evolution with and without CH2Cl2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antarctic column ozone returns to pre-1980 levels in 2065 when CH2Cl2 is not considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inclusion of CH2Cl2 delays the ozone return by 30 years under growth Scenario 1 (note, under Scenario 2 ozone does not return to pre-1980 levels this century).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the difference that would be expected between an atmosphere without any CH2Cl2, for example, if its production was completely phased out, to an atmosphere in which sustained future growth of CH2Cl2 continues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recall, Scenario 1 simply assumes CH2Cl2 continues to increase in the atmosphere following the average upward trend observed over the last decade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimate that even if the stratospheric input of CH2Cl2 remains at 2016 levels (that is, Scenario 3, a no future growth scenario), the return of ozone in the Antarctic Ozone Hole region is still delayed by 5 years, relative to the no CH2Cl2 simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Long-term changes in stratospheric inorganic chlorine and column ozone over Antarctica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a)

highly uncertain, owing to a paucity of atmospheric measurements at that time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a global emission source of 800 Gg CH2Cl2 per year in the early 1980s has been derived from bottomup methods33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this estimate and adjusting the ozone baseline to account for the presence of CH2Cl2 would change the 1980 return dates to 2063 (no CH2Cl2 simulation) and 2090 (growth Scenario 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, additional increases in atmospheric CH2Cl2 could lead to an underestimate of the timescale for stratospheric ozone recovery in coming decades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, as CH2Cl2 already has a non-negligible impact on polar ozone, which has increased in the recent past (Supplementary Fig 2), in the nearer term CH2Cl2 growth could confound the search for ozone recovery attributable to the phase-out of controlled ozone-depleting compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that as the Antarctic column ozone changes scale to a good approximation linearly with the Cly load under each CH2Cl2 scenario (Supplementary Fig 3), our results can be used to estimate the impact of different future trajectories of CH2Cl2, or indeed other chlorinated VSLS, on ozone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While the future trajectory of CH2Cl2 is uncertain, in the absence of policy controls on its production, it is likely that future trends in this gas will fall within the range of the three scenarios presented here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From Fig 5, the absolute impact of CH2Cl2 on SH polar ozone will exhibit some year-to-year variability, depending on stratospheric meteorology (Fig 5), though the 1980 Antarctic ozone return date delay due to CH2Cl2 exhibited a weak sensitivity to the choice of future meteorology in our SLIMCAT simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we note these runs did not consider inter-annual dynamical variability in the future or the effects of climate change, such as an acceleration of the Brewer-Dobson circulation or prolonged stratospheric cooling, as predicted by most CCMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although ozone trends in the Antarctic lower stratosphere are most strongly affected by trends in ozone-depleting gases (that is, the time evolution of the stratospheric halogen content) and relative to the Arctic, are less sensitive to anticipated greenhouse gas changes in the future7, climate change is expected to accelerate ozone recovery in this region12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, given the current spread of return dates predicted by CCMs, the delay in the ozone return due to CH2Cl2 is likely to vary between models, even when considering the same CH2Cl2 growth scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a given 1980 ozone baseline, models with an inherent slower rate of ozone return will see a greater impact of CH2Cl2 on the ozone return date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is due to the divergence of stratospheric Cly concentrations in time between an atmosphere without CH2Cl2 in the future, and one in which sustained CH2Cl2 growth occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To explore the above, we performed simulations with the UMSLIMCAT CCM, forced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) 6.0 scenario, and with evolving meteorology in the future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  UMSLIMCAT was evaluated in the SPARC CCMVal project12 and is participating in the ongoing Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative34 (CCMI  Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our CCM results show marked differences between a run with CH2Cl2 growth (Scenario 1) and a reference run without CH2Cl2 (Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest ozone decreases occur over Antarctica, where (i) the difference in October mean ozone between the with and without CH2Cl2 runs is statistically significant at the 95% confidence interval, and (ii) the influence of CH2Cl2 on ozone increases in coming decadescorroborating our main CTM findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both models, inclusion of CH2Cl2 growth delays the return of Antarctic lower stratospheric Cly to 1980 levels by 13 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In UMSLIMCAT, column ozone return is delayed by 17 years (Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a substantial delay, albeit it is smaller than that predicted by the CTM, which assumed fixed dynamics in the future, and which predicts more severe springtime polar ozone loss (that is, for a given amount of chlorine from CH2Cl2, the ozone impact is smaller in the CCM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ozone increases as a result of upper stratospheric cooling, a consequence of climate change7, may provide additional influence on the magnitude of the ozone delay from CH2Cl2 in CCM experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our CCM shows that ozone closely tracks the trajectory of Cly, highlighting the dominant influence of the halogen loading on Antarctic ozone trends7,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As previously noted, the delay from CH2Cl2 growth will vary across models and crucially these results highlight that CH2Cl2 growth should be considered within the framework of multi-model ozone assessments in the future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the Antarctic Ozone Hole is known to affect surface climate of the SH in several ways, such as by modifying the Southern Annular Mode35, a delayed recovery caused by CH2Cl2 may also be relevant for refining future climate predictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: Future

'In summary, although currently modest, the impact of CH2Cl2 on stratospheric ozone is increasing and if CH2Cl2 concentrations continue to increase they could significantly offset a portion of the decline in anthropogenic chlorine provided by the Montreal Protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This adds uncertainty into future assessments of ozone evolution and could lead to a significant delay in recovery of the ozone layer, particularly over Antarctica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we note that while this study has focused on CH2Cl2, for which long-term surface monitoring data exists, several other anthropogenic VSLS (for example, 1,2-Dichloroethane, C2H4Cl2) have been detected in Earths atmosphere22, though atmospheric measurements of these compounds are sparse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A broader consideration of the atmospheric trends of these non-Montreal Protocol compounds and other VSLS would be beneficial to improve future ozone predictions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

the above period were derived in each bin (selected bin results are shown in Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data form the basis of our current emission estimates and future CH2Cl2 growth scenarios.

assumes that surface CH2Cl2 increases linearly over this period, with a growth rate equal to the mean growth rate observed over the 20042014 period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In NH mid-latitudes, surface CH2Cl2 increases at a rate of 2.85 p.p.t.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  per year under Scenario 1 (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scenario 2 is a larger growth scenario and assumes that CH2Cl2 increases linearly with a rate equal to that observed over the 20122014 period only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these years, CH2Cl2 growth was large compared to the decadal average used for Scenario 1, resulting in a surface trend of 6.1 p.p.t.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  per year in NH mid-latitudes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A third scenario, Scenario 3, was also considered in which it is assumed that no further growth of CH2Cl2 occurs beyond 2016 (that is, the surface concentration of CH2Cl2 is fixed throughout the forward simulation at 2016 levels, Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Global emission estimates of CH2Cl2', 'A simple 1-box model, previously used to study CH4 and CH3CCl3 emissions, was used to derive global CH2Cl2 emissions required to sustain the observed surface concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model treated emissions of CH2Cl2 with a parameterized global mean lifetime of 0.43 years, based on this work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present day, global CH2Cl2 emissions estimates (Fig 2) agree well with similar independent estimates15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The box model was also used to estimate that an emission source of 2.8 Tg CH2Cl2 per year is required to sustain the modelled 2050 atmospheric CH2Cl2 concentration under

injection of CH2Cl2 over the 20042100 period using a detailed tropospheric configuration of TOMCAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model contains a comprehensive description of tropospheric chemistry, including VSLS oxidation, and reproduces the tropospheric abundance of chlorine-containing VSLS well in the present day22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A transient simulation between 2004 and 2014 was performed in which surface CH2Cl2 was constrained in the model using the time-dependent surface measurements from NOAA, in the 5 latitude bins discussed above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between 2015 and 2100, the model was
