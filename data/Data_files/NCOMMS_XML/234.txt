ZEB1 turns into a transcriptional activator by interacting with YAP1 in aggressive cancer types  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Early dissemination, metastasis and therapy resistance are central hallmarks of aggressive cancer types and the leading cause of cancer-associated deaths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The EMT-inducing transcriptional repressor ZEB1 is a crucial stimulator of these processes, particularly by coupling the activation of cellular motility with stemness and survival properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZEB1 expression is associated with aggressive behaviour in many tumour types, but the potent effects cannot be solely explained by its proven function as a transcriptional repressor of epithelial genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe a direct interaction of ZEB1 with the Hippo pathway effector YAP, but notably not with its paralogue TAZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In consequence, ZEB1 switches its function to a transcriptional co-activator of a common ZEB1/YAP target gene set, thereby linking two pathways with similar cancer promoting effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gene set is a predictor of poor survival, therapy resistance and increased metastatic risk in breast cancer, indicating the clinical relevance of our findings.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Central hallmarks of cancer progression and aggressiveness are tumorigenic capacity, dissemination, metastasis and resistance to conventional radio/chemotherapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These traits are responsible for the major clinical problems and prevent successful treatment of many cancer patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The uncovering of the underlying molecular mechanisms is crucial for developing novel therapeutic concepts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the past decade it became evident that, like in leukemia, also in most solid cancers, a subpopulation of tumour cells termed cancer stem cells (CSCs) has high tumour-initiating capacity and is the source of metastasis and treatment relapse1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, it has been demonstrated that the embryonic epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT)-program can be activated in cancer cells, which not only induces an aberrant motility triggering dissemination and metastasis, but also confers stemness properties resulting in a migrating CSC-phenotype3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The program is activated by EMT-inducing transcription factors including members of the Snail-, Twist- and ZEB families5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The EMT-activator ZEB1 turned out to be particularly potent6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZEB1 is associated with aggressive behaviour, metastasis, treatment resistance and poor prognosis in different tumour types, including breast, pancreatic and lung cancer8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In breast cancer, highest ZEB1 expression in tumor cells was found in the aggressive triple negative and basal types9,11 and to be upregulated in circulating tumour cells with a CSC-phenotype12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistically, ZEB1 is a transcriptional repressor of epithelial genes, for example, for E-cadherin and cell polarity factors, thereby stimulating an undifferentiated and highly motile phenotype13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This property of ZEB1 is considered important for metastasis as shown in many model systems10,14,15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By repressing the expression of the stemness-inhibiting microRNAs miR-200 and miR-203, ZEB1 can also confer stemness properties, thereby linking motility and stemness towards a migrating cancer stem cell phenotype17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover ZEB1, likely through its stemness-promoting effect, can confer survival and therapy resistance, as shown for many different cancer types, such as pancreatic, breast and lung cancer17,19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to these pleiotropic effects, ZEB1 is considered the central factor for high cancer cell plasticity as a motor towards aggressive, metastatic and therapy-resistant cancer types22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'However, the strong effects of ZEB1 cannot be solely explained by the ascribed functions as a transcriptional repressor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, by analysing ZEB1-dependent gene expression patterns, we demonstrate mechanistic links explaining the extraordinary potency of ZEB1 in driving tumour progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We describe a direct interaction between ZEB1 and the Hippo pathway effector YAP, shifting ZEB1 from a repressor to a transcriptional activator and thereby linking two pathways with very similar cancer-promoting effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, ZEB1 directly binds to YAP, but not to the paralogue factor TAZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional cooperation of ZEB1 and YAP stimulates the transcriptional activation of a common ZEB1/YAP target gene set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gene set is a predictor of poor survival, therapy resistance and increased metastatic risk in hormone receptor-negative breast cancer, indicating the clinical relevance of our findings.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'YAP target gene expression depends on ZEB1', 'ZEB1 expression in tumour cells of human cancers is heterogenous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In breast cancer, the aggressive triple-negative (ER, PR, HER2) or the basal subtypes often express high amounts (Fig1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZEB1 expression in these subtypes is correlated with poor survival, therapy resistance and high risk for distant metastasis (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We wanted to further investigate ZEB1-dependent mechanisms resulting in aggressive cancer types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene expression analyses comparing aggressive cancer cells with high ZEB1 levels of different entities (breast, pancreas, colon) and corresponding ZEB1 knockdown cells revealed a strong reprogramming with expression changes ( greater than 3-fold up or down) in thousands of genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About 60% of the changes resulted from genes which were upregulated upon knockdown of ZEB1 and thus represent potential direct targets of its well-established transcriptional repressor function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the remaining 40% of the genes were downregulated upon knockdown, indicating that their expression directly or indirectly (for example, through upregulation of miR-200) depends on the aberrant expression of ZEB1 in cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we hypothesized that for certain gene patterns, ZEB1 can switch from a transcriptional repressor to a transcriptional activator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: ZEB1 correlates with YAP target gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Representative immunohistochemistry of different breast cancers for E-cadherin and ZEB1, showing mutual exclusion of both proteins in cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars, 40â€‰m.

analysis (GSEA) of ZEB1-dependent genes in breast, colon and pancreatic cancer cells revealed gene sets strongly enriched compared with ZEB1 knockdown cells (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the most significant overlaps regarding all analysed cancer cell entities was found for an evolutionary conserved signature of the Hippo-pathway effector YAP (Yes-associated protein) described by Cordenonsi et al.24 (Fig 1c and Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strong overlap is striking, since the Hippo-pathway and particularly its main downstream effectors, the transcriptional co-activators YAP and TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif), have emerged as having important roles during tumour formation and malignant progression25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a remarkable congruency in the effects of YAP/TAZ with those of ZEB1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As demonstrated for ZEB1, also YAP/TAZ expression is associated with aggressive behaviour, metastasis, treatment resistance and poor prognosis in different tumour types27,28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also YAP/TAZ can confer stemness traits, therapy resistance and metastasis in experimental models of different tumour types including mammary tumours24,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focused on breast cancer and particularly on those genes of the YAP target gene set that were most differentially regulated between control and ZEB1 knockdown cells and thus contributed most to the enrichment result.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the triple-negative breast cancer line MDA-MB231, ZEB1 is aberrantly expressed11 and, as also described for YAP31, is important for the invasive, metastatic, drug-resistant and stemness phenotype of this cell line16,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In MDA-MB231, most of the described YAP target genes were also depending on the expression of ZEB1 (termed common ZEB1/YAP set) (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About 20% of YAP target genes were not downregulated, but upregulated upon ZEB1-knockdown (termed YAP only gene set).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further extended this finding by analysing breast cancer cell lines from the cancer cell line encyclopedia33, which revealed strong correlations of ZEB1 and common ZEB1/YAP target gene expression (Fig 1e and Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene expression analyses in breast cancer have led to the definition of five molecular subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, basal-like and claudin-low) and the claudin-low subtype has been characterized as a subtype of aggressive triple-negative breast cancers displaying a high enrichment for EMT-markers (including ZEB1) and genes providing stem cell-like features34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes of the common ZEB1/YAP target gene set were highly expressed in breast cancer cell lines assigned to the claudin-low and basal B subtype (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We validated the findings on mRNA level and further showed that ZEB1 depletion in MDA-MB231 reduced protein expression of the YAP/TAZ targets CTGF and AXL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was true for cells carrying a stable ZEB1 knockdown (Fig 2a), and for a doxycycline (dox)-inducible ZEB1-depletion (Fig 2b), thus excluding that the observations were due to selective or adaptive effects of long-term ZEB1 depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vice versa, dox-induced overexpression of ZEB1 in the human mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A, expressing low levels of ZEB1, led to upregulation of YAP target genes (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, expression of ZEB1 resulted in an EMT, indicated by typical morphological changes and downregulation of the epithelial marker E-cadherin (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that in addition to its well-characterized role as transcriptional repressor of epithelial genes, ZEB1 co-activates the expression of a selective YAP-target gene set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further used another, more physiological setting of ZEB1 induction by treating MCF10A cells with TGF until the cells had entered a stable EMT state as judged by cell morphology and ZEB1 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with the results of ectopically expressed ZEB1, TGF-induced ZEB1 expression also activated the expression of YAP target genes (Fig 2d and Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: ZEB1 is critical for YAP target gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Stable knockdown of ZEB1 in

CTGF, CYR61, AXL and others for cancer progression including metastasis35, drug resistance36,37 and poor clinical outcome38 was already demonstrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus the detection of a common ZEB1/YAP target gene set points to a new mechanism how ZEB1 drives malignant cancer progression, towards invasion, metastasis and therapy resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The regulation of YAP target genes is ZEB1 specific', 'We further determined the interdependence of ZEB1, the Hippo effectors YAP/TAZ and the EMT-activator SNAI2 (Slug), which is co-expressed with ZEB1 in the investigated cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with results for stable ZEB1 depletion, transient ZEB1 knockdown significantly decreased the expression of YAP target genes to an extent comparable with YAP knockdown (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, loss of ZEB1 did not interfere with YAP expression and even slightly upregulated TAZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, knockdown of the EMT-activator SNAI2 did not affect YAP target gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is further in line with the finding that ZEB1 knockdown in MDA-MB231, although downregulating YAP target genes, did not affect expression of SNAI2 (Fig 2b), ruling out that the effects of ZEB1 depletion were mediated indirectly by reduction of SNAI2 and that SNAI2 can substitute for a loss of ZEB1 in this context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further determine whether ZEB1-mediated activation of YAP targets is depending on YAP or TAZ, we depleted both factors in ZEB1-overexpressing MCF10A cells (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of YAP reverted the ZEB1-induced expression of CTGF without affecting ZEB1 levels, indicating that YAP is necessary for this function of ZEB1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, depletion of TGF-induced ZEB1 in MCF10A cells was sufficient to abrogate the expression of YAP target genes to an extent comparable to YAP knockdown (Fig 3c and Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depletion of TAZ had no consistent effect in this setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data further support a role of ZEB1 and YAP in activating a common target gene set important for tumour progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure

phosphorylation or localization', 'Upstream regulators of the Hippo pathway include cell polarity factors such as the apical Crumbs and the basal Scribble complex24,39 and EMT-triggered delocalization or loss of Scribble results in reduced LATS-mediated phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ subsequently increasing protein stability24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously shown that ZEB1 directly represses expression of cell polarity factors including members of the Crumbs and Scribble family, resulting in a loss of cell polarity16,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore wanted to rule out that ZEB1 indirectly stimulates YAP target gene expression by preventing Crumbs- or Scribble-dependent YAP/TAZ degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we assayed YAP and TAZ protein levels by western blot analysis and did not observe any reduction in response to ZEB1-knockdown or increase after overexpression of ZEB1, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, also phosphorylation of YAP on serine 127, a target site of LATS kinase downstream of the Hippo pathway41, was not altered (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we monitored the subcellular localization of YAP/TAZ, which is nuclear in their dephosphorylated, active state but re-localizes to the cytoplasm upon activation of LATS-mediated phosphorylation42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In MDA-MB231 cells siRNA-mediated or Dox-induced depletion of ZEB1 had no effect on YAP/TAZ nuclear localization (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also in MCF10A cells, YAP/TAZ localization was irrespective of the presence or absence of ZEB1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hippo-pathway effectors were shown to activate EMT43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particularly, TAZ was shown to activate ZEB1 expression in retinal pigment epithelial cells45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we tested whether YAP and TAZ can stimulate ZEB1 in our cellular systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, neither depletion of YAP or TAZ, nor overexpression of both factors affected expression and nuclear localization of ZEB1 (Figs 3a,c and 4a and Supplementary Fig 2c, d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, regulation of YAP target genes by ZEB1 cannot simply be ascribed to a Hippo-pathway mediated regulation of YAP/TAZ activity, for example,

mediators of the oncogenic properties of YAP/TAZ25,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding of YAP to the promoters of CTGF and AXL was previously shown46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses and demonstrated that ZEB1 and YAP bind to the CTGF, CYR61, SDPR and AXL promoters (Fig 5a,b and Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By applying a sequential ChIP (first ChIP for ZEB1 and re-ChIP for V5-tagged YAP), we confirmed that ZEB1 and YAP can simultaneously bind to the same promoter region at the CTGF locus in a native context (Fig 5c and Supplementary Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, only ZEB1 but not simultaneous binding of YAP was detected at the CDH1 and MIR200C loci, two genes which are repressed by ZEB1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further confirmed CTGF as direct ZEB1 target by demonstrating that ZEB1 synergizes with YAP in stimulating CTGF and CYR61 promoter activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, E-boxes as known ZEB1 binding sites are dispensable for functional interaction of ZEB1 and YAP, since deletion of E-box containing promoter regions did not significantly reduce the co-stimulation (Fig 5a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of either the TEAD binding domain or the transactivation domain of YAP completely abolished the co-activation by YAP and ZEB1 (Fig 5d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicated that not the known ZEB1 binding sites (E-boxes) but the YAP/TEAD bindings sites (MCATs) are crucial for the functional interaction of ZEB1 and YAP in stimulating transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assumption was further fostered by showing that sequential mutation of the TEAD binding sites inhibited co-stimulation of the CTGF promoter by ZEB1 and YAP (Fig 5e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we cloned a polymerized TEAD binding site upstream of a minimal promoter, and demonstrated that ZEB1 and YAP can strongly co-stimulate the reporter gene in a highly synergistic manner, whereas mutation of the TEAD sites abolished this effect (Fig 5f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings demonstrate that ZEB1 and YAP can functionally interact to co-activate common target genes through conserved TEAD binding sites.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Here, we describe a direct functional link between ZEB1 and the transcriptional co-activator YAP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistically, we found that ZEB1, in a complex with YAP, binds to gene promoters resulting in transcriptional activation of YAP target gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of clinical data and patient material provides evidence for a particular relevance of our findings in aggressive breast cancer types, showing that a common ZEB1/YAP target gene set is a strong predictor of poor relapse free survival, therapy resistance and increased metastatic risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous analyses of ZEB1 target genes were mainly focused on EMT-related genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repression of epithelial marker genes such as E-Cadherin, Crumbs3, PATJ or the miR-200 family and activation of mesenchymal markers such as Vimentin, N-Cadherin or matrix metalloproteinases can sufficiently explain the ZEB1-mediated gain in cell motility and invasiveness5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, ZEB1-related stemness properties and drug resistance were shown to be mainly indirectly achieved through transcriptional repression of miRNAs, such as miR-200 and miR-203 (refs 17, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we describe a new subset of genes depending on ZEB1 expression, which strongly overlaps with a YAP target gene signature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The importance of YAP/TAZ target genes such as CTGF, CYR61, AXL and others for cancer progression was already demonstrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CTGF is a secreted extracellular matrix-associated protein and important mediator of the oncogenic properties of YAP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In breast cancer, CTGF is associated with drug resistance36,37, metastasis35 and poor clinical outcome38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AXL is an oncogenic transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase which promotes survival, proliferation, migration and metastasis50 and has recently been identified as a YAP target gene47,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In MDA-MB231 cells, AXL was shown to be required for the tumorigenic, invasive phenotype and metastatic capacity52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also expression of the YAP-target gene CYR61 was associated with aggressiveness, therapy resistance and poor clinical outcome in breast cancer36,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, a group of known YAP-target genes, which we termed YAP only set (see Fig 1d), is not co-activated, but downregulated in the presence of ZEB1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The underlying molecular mechanisms of this differential regulation of YAP target genes by ZEB1 are currently unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, expression of individual members of the YAP only set as well as a cluster of the top three genes of this set did not correlate with poor prognosis, but even indicated better therapy response and particularly a reduced metastatic risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A link to the underlying biology is currently unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, the detection of a common ZEB1/YAP target gene set points to a new mechanism how ZEB1 drives malignant cancer progression, towards invasion, metastasis and therapy resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We wanted to rule out that activation of a common ZEB1/YAP target gene pattern important for tumour progression is a general EMT-associated effect on the Hippo pathway and its effectors, which is indirectly and unspecifically exerted by different EMT-inducers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upstream regulators of the Hippo pathway include cell polarity factors such as the apical Crumbs and the basal Scribble complex24,39 and EMT-triggered delocalization or loss of Scribble results in reduced LATS-mediated phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ and subsequent increased protein stability24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the Crumbs complex was shown to interact with YAP/TAZ and leads to its cytoplasmic retention and suppression of TGF-induced EMT39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously shown that ZEB1 directly represses expression of cell polarity factors including members of the Crumbs and Scribble family, resulting in a loss of cell polarity16,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We ruled out that ZEB1 indirectly stimulates YAP target gene expression by preventing Crumbs- or Scribble-dependent YAP/TAZ degradation or cytoplasmic retention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A specificity of ZEB1 in functional interaction with YAP is further underscored by showing that maintained expression of SNAI2 (Slug) cannot substitute for loss of ZEB1, which also indicates important functional differences between ZEB1 and other EMT-activators, such as SNAI2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, indirect EMT-associated and Hippo pathway-mediated regulation of YAP/TAZ activity, protein stability or subcellular localization does not seem to be the primary mechanism of ZEB1 action in this context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, regulation of YAP target genes by ZEB1 cannot simply be ascribed to Hippo-pathway mediated regulation of YAP/TAZ activity, for example, through ZEB1-induced loss of cell polarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'ZEB1 is mainly known as a repressor of epithelial gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct transcriptional activation has also been reported for a few target genes and likely involves the recruitment of a different set of co-factors6,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, ZEB1 was found to repress genes when in complex with PC2-CtBP-LSD1-LCoR or the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelling protein BRG1, whereas formation of a ZEB1-Smad3-p300-P/CAF complex resulted in transcriptional activation6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Smad3 can also complex with YAP/TAZ-TEAD and cooperatively induce the expression of CTGF downstream of TGF signaling in breast cancer cells7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that ZEB1 interacts with YAP, binds to the CTGF promoter and co-stimulates activation of a subset of target genes (termed common ZEB1/YAP set) (Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding of ZEB1 to E-boxes, its well-defined elements for transmitting transcriptional repression, seems to be not important for transcriptional co-stimulation with YAP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that indirect binding to TEAD factors co-activate target genes through MCAT-sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However a direct DNA-binding of ZEB1 to unknown target sequences cannot be ruled out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also an interaction with other transcription factors may confer the transcriptional co-activation by ZEB1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Very recently it was shown that AP-1 can co-stimulate transcriptional activation of YAP-target genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, AP-1 components do not directly bind to YAP/TAZ, but to TEAD factors and the interaction mainly takes place at target enhancers and not promoters55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An involvement of ZEB1 in this interaction is currently not known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  YAP interacts with ZEB1 at its N-terminal and C-terminal ends, which were already shown to bind the transcriptional co-activator p300 binding (N-terminal end) and possess a transcriptional activation domain (C-terminal end)13,56,57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We describe that YAP binds to ZEB1 with its central portion containing two WW-domains, already shown to be the binding domain for other transcription factors, such as Runx1,2 and Smad1,7 (refs 29, 58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, we found that TAZ cannot bind ZEB1 with high efficacy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be explained by major structural differences between YAP and TAZ, which in contrast to YAP possesses only one WW-domain in the central part29,58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our findings demonstrate a significant functional difference of the major Hippo-pathway effectors YAP and TAZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 9: Model of the dual function of ZEB1.ZEB1 is a transcriptional repressor of differentiation-associated genes, thereby inducing EMT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct interaction of ZEB1 with YAP (but not with TAZ) switches its function to an activator of a common ZEB1/YAP target gene set, known to stimulate cancer aggressiveness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  YAP1 and ZEB1 bind indirectly through MCAT sites of target genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of E-boxes and putative additional binding partners (x) remains to be clarified.Full size image', 'We validated the translational and clinical relevance of a functional ZEB1/YAP interaction and its common target gene activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Survival analysis of breast cancer data sets demonstrated that irrespective of the subtype, tumours with high expression of ZEB1 and common ZEB1/YAP target genes displayed a significant shorter relapse-free and overall survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particularly for hormone receptor-negative cancers (ER/PR), which include the most aggressive subtypes48, expression of the common ZEB1/YAP target gene set strongly correlated with poor relapse-free survival, resistance to chemotherapy and high risk for distant metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, expression of the YAP only target gene set, which is even downregulated in the presence of ZEB1, did not correlate with poor prognosis, but even indicated better therapy response and particularly reduced metastatic risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore propose that the function of ZEB1 is dominating and determines the clinical outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fits to ambiguous role of Hippo-pathway components on cellular processes described in development and cancer39,59,60,61,62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, there are also studies, showing that YAP is deleted in breast cancer and that it functions as tumour suppressor61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences might be linked to the subtype, since an oncogenic YAP function was found in aggressive subtypes, like the basal type, which also express ZEB1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prospective clinical studies will demonstrate whether the common ZEB1/YAP target gene set will be a useful tool to predict clinical outcome and therapy response of breast and other cancer types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate a high tumour biological and clinical relevance of a functional interaction between ZEB1 and YAP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we here describe that, in addition to its established role as transcriptional repressor and EMT-activator, ZEB1 co-activates the expression of a subset of YAP target genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereby, other EMT-activators cannot substitute for ZEB1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZEB1 directly binds to YAP, but not to its paralogue TAZ, demonstrating an important functional difference between YAP and TAZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of the identified common ZEB1/YAP target gene set is a strong predictor of poor clinical outcome in hormone receptor negative breast cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We link two pathways with very similar oncogenic and cancer promoting effects6,7,25,29 and contribute to the understanding of the pleiotropic roles of ZEB1 and the Hippo-pathway effector YAP in cancer progression and metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding of a direct molecular interaction of ZEB1 and YAP indicates novel strategies to interfere with tumour progression.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
