Profiling protein expression in circulating tumour cells using microfluidic western blotting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) are rare tumour cells found in the circulatory system of certain cancer patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The clinical and functional significance of CTCs is still under investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein profiling of CTCs would complement the recent advances in enumeration, transcriptomic and genomic characterization of these rare cells and help define their characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe a microfluidic western blot for an eight-plex protein panel for individual CTCs derived from estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precision handling and analysis reveals a capacity to assay sparingly available patient-derived CTCs, a biophysical CTC phenotype more lysis-resistant than breast cancer cell lines, a capacity to report protein expression on a per CTC basis and two statistically distinct GAPDH subpopulations within the patient-derived CTCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeted single-CTC proteomics with the capacity for archivable, multiplexed protein analysis offers a unique, complementary taxonomy for understanding CTC biology and ascertaining clinical impact.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The role of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) in cancer progression is still under investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CTCs are rare cells that shed from a tumour into circulation at an occurrence of 1500 cells per 7.5 ml of blood1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, substantial research has focused on the isolation of CTCs by exploiting distinctive characteristics of these cancer cells (for example, surface protein expression, size and deformability)2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High CTC counts are associated with reduced survival rates6 and low responsiveness to therapies7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, characterization of CTCs by next-generation sequencing has identified discordance in the gene expression between CTCs and their primary tumours8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies suggest that distinct CTC sub-populations may exist and contribute to metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, although CTC enumeration and genomics provide insight, neither measurement fully describes phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, recent studies show weak correlation between genomics/transcriptomics and protein expression in some instances11,12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Yet, unlike single-cell genomics and transcriptomics, advances in single-cell protein assays are lagging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, most single-cell protein assays (for unmodified endogenous targets) are single-stage immunoassays, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (with direct or sandwich readout) and immunocytochemistry, as well as newer immunoassay formats designed to improve multiplexing using spatial barcoding15,16 or mass cytometry17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CTC protein analyses primarily focus on surface and secreted proteins18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although important, the capability to multiplex and assay a wide range of protein targets (including intracellular signalling pathways) has been limited20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct measurement of multiple proteins in single-CTCs comprises a critical complement to single-CTC transcriptomic and genomic studies, as well as enumeration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Nevertheless, target detection by single-stage immunoassays remains constrained by the specificity and availability of immunoreagents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These limitations stymie understanding of CTC phenotype in two crucial aspects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, single-stage immunoassays have difficulty with multiplexed measurements of surface and intracellular proteins for each single cell21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoassays are the de facto standard for solid tumour and CTC classification (that is, CK+, EpCAM+ and CD45 expression).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, clinical immunoassays (for example, immunohistochemistry) are limited to 5 proteins due to spectral imaging limitations with conventional filter sets22,23 and difficulty in de-staining cells (removing antibody probes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flow cytometry also suffers from multiplexing shortcomings, especially with intracellular protein targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even more importantly, neither flow cytometry nor mass cytometry can assay small numbers of CTCs, owing to cell handling losses and dead volumes24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, immunoassays cannot uniquely detect a protein if a high specificity probe is unavailable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is of particular importance in cancer, as isoform expression is increasingly implicated in patient outcome25 and key isoforms do not have specific antibodies available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although mass spectrometry can measure most protein isoforms, the analytical sensitivity is insufficient for detection of key signalling proteins with single-cell resolution26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For decades, researchers have addressed single-stage immunoassay specificity limitations by prepending an upstream polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) protein separation to a downstream immunoassay, thus creating a two-stage assay known as western blotting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Separating proteins by molecular mass (or mobility) before the immunoassay can identify off-target, non-specific antibody binding27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spatially resolving proteins by size first allows a single antibody probe to detect multiple, distinct protein forms28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Still, the analytical sensitivity of slab-gel western blotting requires pooling of cells to achieve detectable protein concentrations, which obscures important CTC-to-CTC protein expression level variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To surmount this gap, we recently introduced a single-cell resolution western blot29 optimized for study of protein expression in each of thousands of single, cultured neural stem cells30 and glioblastoma cells31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the current format of the single-cell western blot requires 1000s of cells to account for cell losses when settling into the microwells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we introduce a rare-cell, single-cell resolution western blot (scWB) to measure a panel of proteins in single CTCs isolated from patients with primary estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rare-cell scWB quantifies multiple surface and intracellular signalling proteinsin each individual CTCallowing estimates of biological protein expression variation among CTCs, as compared with a quantitative threshold for technical variation that we establish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the rare-cell scWB is compatible with established CTC isolation tools, thus successfully analysing CTC populations with as few as two starting cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a pilot study of ER+ metastatic breast cancer patient-derived CTCs, we observe a lysishardy CTC phenotype and the unique capacity to normalize target protein expression by the number of CTCs analysed per assay, just one CTC per scWB microwell here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rare-cell scWB offers a new approach to examining CTCs, with relevance spanning from understanding CTC biology to monitoring an individuals response to therapy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Workflow enables rapid protein analysis of rare cells', 'We develop a microfluidic assay to measure multiple protein targets in individual CTCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rare-cell scWB couples PAGE of single-CTC lysate with subsequent antibody probing of PAGE-resolved protein targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rare-cell scWB assay is designed for (i) integration with existing rare-cell enrichment and isolation tools to minimize cell loss, and (ii) rapid lysis and protein separation (seconds) of isolated cell lysate to maximize local protein concentrations for detection, even with low protein copy numbers (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The microfluidic scWB device comprises an array of 50 m diameter microwells stippled into a 60 m-thin polyacrylamide (PA) gel layered on a silanized microscope slide29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells are seated into the microwells, lysed and protein contents are electrophoretically injected into the surrounding gel where all steps of a western blot (PAGE, blotting and probing) are performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The integrated design of the multi-stage assay makes rapid (seconds) assay stages possible, as is needed to minimize lysate dilution by diffusion and maintain high local protein concentrations for detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Microfluidic rare-cell workflow for multiplexed western blotting of single patient-derived CTCs.Patient-derived CTCs are: Step i: enriched from 2 to 4 ml of blood using a size- and deformability-selective microfluidic tool (Vortex HT chip)4 followed by Step ii: cell-enriched effluent (300 l) is deposited directly in a mesofluidic chamber on planar scWB device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Putative CTCs are visually identified using Hoescht 33342 nuclear stain, and each identified CTC is micropipetted (under microscopy) into a 50 m diameter microwell (micrographs in inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Step iii: after the seating of one CTC into one microwell, single-cell western blotting proceeds as in-microwell chemical CTC lysis, single-CTC protein PAGE, covalent immobilization of proteins to the gel (photo-blotting) and in-gel immunoprobing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Step iv: single-CTC lysate is analysed by western blotting and rounds of immunoprobing support the multiplexing of 12 proteins, with expression is compared among patient-derived CTCs and to spiked cell line validation studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale

cell size and deformability (Vortex chip CTC isolation technology)32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the rare-cell scWB is designed as agnostic to CTC collection technology, integration with a label-free cell enrichment tool allows scrutiny of cell surface receptor identity, signalling protein levels and cell variation based on characteristics that are independent of receptor expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our protein panel comprises targets having accepted utility in cancer subtype classification (ER, HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) oncoproteins), cancer cell identification (epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), panCK and CK8 expression), known expression in mammalian cells (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and -tubulin) and indicative of white blood cells (WBCs; for example, high CD45, negative for EpCAM, panCK and CK8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Profiling multiple proteins aids cancer subtype classification and may inform prognosis and therapy selection in ways not otherwise apparent from primary tumour classification33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, incongruences in protein expression between the primary tumour and CTCs have been observed34, suggesting that measurement of cancer markers in both CTCs and tumours could be informative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpressed intracellular, downstream targets (that is, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)35, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK-1/2) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e (eIF4E)37) were also assayed by scWB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibition of intracellular signalling is an active subject of clinical trials38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, breast cancer cells have been found to have upregulated GAPDH expression, leading to interest in profiling of seemingly innocuous housekeeping proteins40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To initiate the rare-cell scWB workflow, we dilute blood samples in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and process the cells using the Vortex chip technology (Fig 1, Step i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 300 l sample effluent is then deposited into a 700 l mesofluidic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chamber mated onto the top surface of the scWB device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once inside the mesofluidic chamber, we stain with Hoechst 33342 all enriched cells to identify large, nucleated cells using both bright-field and epifluorescence microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The microtransfer of a single putative cancer cell follows previously established protocols by Hannemann et al.41 and others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, although monitoring under epifluorescence microscopy, each large nucleated cell was picked individually using a precision Eppendorf Transferman micromanipulator and transferred to a microwell at a target occupancy of one cancer cell per microwell (Fig 1, Step ii and Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strongly Hoechst-stained cells with diameters larger than an average WBC were selected to exclude freely suspended red blood cells and WBCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, cells associated with the putative cancer cell could also be transferred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-transfer of CTCs and CTC-associated cells (clusters), which includes WBCs and other cell types, offers potential utility, as the presence of associated cells is hypothesized to have an impact on patient prognosis42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Next, the rare-cell scWB assay is initiated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each cell is subjected to in-microwell chemical lysis (15 s at 55 °C, 0.5% SDS, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.25% sodium deoxycholate (Na-DOC)) and an electric potential is applied across the scWB device for single-cell PAGE (25 s, E=40 V cm1, sieving matrix in an 8%T PA gel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After PAGE, proteins are immobilized in the gel using photo-blotting (45 s ultraviolet exposure, PA copolymerized with 100 mM N-3-(3-Benzoylphenyl)formamidopropyl methacrylamide)43, followed by several buffer exchanges and antibody-probing cycles (Fig 1, Step iii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strong covalent immobilization of protein onto the gel, achieved by photo-blotting, enables multiple in-gel re-probing rounds, here demonstrated for a diverse panel of protein targets for each CTC (Fig 1, Step iv).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Rare-cell scWB validation for CTC-specific protein profile', 'To perform assay development and validation, we utilized healthy donor blood spiked with cancer cell lines representing three major and diverse breast cancer subtypes: triple-negative (BT-20), ER+ (MCF7) and HER2+ (SK-BR-3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To create cell suspensions, we released plated cells using trypsin and spiked 300600 cells from one cell line at a time into a 2 ml vial of healthy donor blood diluted 10 × in PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antibody probes used bind to the cytoplasmic domains of EGFR and HER2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with literature44, our fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based validation (Supplementary Fig 2) demonstrate negligible effect of trypsin release on the detection of surface EpCAM using the antibody probe selected here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The single-cell PAGE assay is operated under denaturing but non-reducing conditions, which retains intact EpCAM epitopes45 suitable for immunoreagent-based detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After spiking the cancer cells into healthy blood, the samples were purified in the same manner as patient-derived CTCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We first sought to assess the feasibility of the rare-cell workflow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 50110 min was sufficient for breast cancer cell isolation from the blood (20 min), followed by cell selection and seating of a single putative cancer cell into each microwell (3090 min).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given a 3090 min duration for cell selection and transfer, we measured one-cell-to-one-microwell transfers with: 42±19 s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BT-20 transfers (n=3 devices), 31±6 s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MCF7 transfers (n=3 devices), and 39±7 s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SK-BR-3 transfers (n=3 devices) achieved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once microwells were populated with individual cancer cells, the scWB assay proceeded as follows: in-microwell chemical cell lysis (seconds), protein PAGE and photo-blotting (immobilization; 2 min), subsequent in-gel primary (2 h) and secondary (1 h) antibody probing with one wash step after each probing cycle (1 h per wash), collection of fluorescence data (45 min) and an overnight (12 h) antibody stripping step for subsequent re-probing of additional proteins (Fig 2a).

rare-cell scWB handling and analysis of healthy blood samples, each spiked with a cancer subtype: EGFR+(BT-20), ER+(MCF7) and HER2+(SK-BR-3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Negative controls include analysis of WBCs only and blank microwells (that is, devoid of a cancer cell).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein panel comprises the following: control and housekeeping proteins (GAPDH and -tubulin), oncoproteins (HER2, ER and EGFR), signalling proteins (ERK, eIF4E and mTOR), common CTC classifiers (EpCAM, panCK and CK8) and a WBC indicator (CD45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 50 m.

Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In corollary studies of each of the three breast cancer cell lines, we confirmed that scWB measurements of protein expression were comparable between unique scWB devices (MannWhitney U-test, P greater than 0.05 for BT-20, SK-BR-3 and MCF7; Supplementary Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Second, we considered variability in protein expression measurements by benchmarking (i) epifluorescence imaging of intact, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing MCF7 cells (MCF7-GFP cells) seated in microwells against (ii) scWB analysis of immunoprobed GFP from those same cells (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we observed an appreciable linear correlation between the GFP signal measured in intact MCF7-GFP cells and the corresponding immunoprobed GFP signal (R2=0.83, Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we estimated the technical variation threshold that distinguishes biological from technical variation, as has been utilized in both proteomics and single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Defining detectable biological variability in protein expression as variation that is  greater than 3 s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  from the mean protein expression CV yields a technical variation cutoff of 32.4% (GFP-MCF7 area under the curve (AUC) mean CV+3 s.d., where mean CV=11.0% and s.d.=7.1%; Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To establish the selectivity of the protein panel targets (Supplementary Table 1) and to assess blood matrix effects, we compared the rare-cell scWB analyses of spiked cell lines with two negative controls as follows: (i) microwells occupied only by WBCs and (ii) microwells containing no cancer cells (that is, blank microwells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rare-cell scWB reported positive signal for cancer markers for all spiked cell lines (BT-20, SK-BR-3 and MCF7) when a large, nucleated putative cancer cell was microtransferred into each microwell (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In no instance did microscopy indicate transfer of more than one cancer cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, in conjunction with microscopy, other researchers have shown microtransfer to be effective for isolation of individual cancer cells41,48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In negative controls, rare-cell scWB analyses of pure WBC populations reported only CD45 and GAPDH signal, with no measurable signal from any cancer-specific protein target, thus establishing co-expression of CD45 and GAPDH, and negative cancer marker response as selective for WBCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When microwells were empty in the spiked cancer cell studies (blank wells), the rare-cell scWB did not detect CD45 or GAPDH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In assessing potential cross-talk between proximal microwells, we did not observe detectable protein in empty microwells proximal to cancer marker-positive cell-laden microwells, with the exception of low-level EpCAM background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the validation study suggests that (i) the cancer markers are selective for putative cancer cells (as expected from the literature) and (ii) the protein panel allows the rare-cell scWB to distinguish between cancer cells and WBCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As a corollary observation regarding possible association of WBCs with cancer cells, rare-cell scWB analysis detected CD45 signal at the level of  less_than 1% of the total protein signal in putative cancer cells (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps more surprising is the observation that the cancer cell-associated CD45 signal is not detected in blank microwells proximal to cancer cell-laden microwells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observation indicates that WBC sedimentation into neighbouring microwells does not occur often, perhaps in light of the 104- to 105-fold reduction in WBCs during cancer cell isolation32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the CD45 signal detected concomitant with the cancer panel-positive scWBs suggests the possibility of WBCs associated with the putative cancer cells and not simply dissociated (or lysed) WBCs as background in the cancer cell-enriched blood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent transcriptomic data suggests that WBCs physically associate (cluster) with circulating tumour cells42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As is relevant to emerging clinical indicators of prognosis, the observation corroborates the utility of the rare-cell scWB to capture both single CTCs and perhaps also CTCs associated with other cells (although association mechanisms are not currently understood).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Rare-cell scWB enables detailed assessment of key proteins', 'After establishing the selectivity of the cancer markers for cancer cells from three distinct cell lines and establishing the technical variation in the assay performance, we sought to scrutinize the known molecular classifier of each cancer subtype by rare-cell scWB and compare with the literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each nucleated cell seated in a microwell, we ranked the relative expression of the three oncoproteins considered here (HER2, ER and EGFR; Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed concordance between the molecular classifications reported in the literature50,51,52 and those measured by the scWB (that is, high HER2 expression in SK-BR-3, high ER expression in MCF7 and moderate EGFR expression in BT-20; Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, the rare-cell scWB detected EGFR protein in the MCF7 cell line, in accordance with literature reports that indicate non-zero, yet low-level EGFR expression in these cells53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primary molecular classification marker exhibited higher variability than other classification markers in two of the cancer cell lines (HER2: SK-BR-32=2.08 × 1012, n=27, ER: MCF72=1.24 × 1015, n=35; EGFR: BT-202=3.15 × 1011, n=27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For all protein panel targets across all three breast cancer cell lines (Fig 2b), we measured variability in protein expression that exceeded the 32.4% technical variation cutoff; thus, we attribute the observed variation in protein expression to biological differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed moderate-to-low variation in EpCAM expression for all cells, when compared with other proteins within each cell line (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, EpCAM expression in MCF7 and BT-20 cells had a wider distribution than that observed in the SK-BR-3 cell lines (MCF72=3.00 × 1011; SK-BR-32=1.80 × 1010; BT-202=2.72 × 1011).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For surface proteins known to be minimally or not expressed in each cancer subtype, we observed minimal variability in expression among each population (for example, ER in BT-20 and SK-BR-3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Next, we applied the rare-cell scWB and Spearmans rank-order correlation to study intracellular signalling proteins across all three cell subtypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured appreciable correlation between the proteins ERK and GAPDH (rBT-20=0.759, rMCF7=0.782, rSK-BR-3=0.722, P less_than 0.01), and the protein -tubulin with both ERK (rBT-20=0.611, rMCF7=0.473, rSK-BR-3=0.667, P less_than 0.01) and GAPDH (rBT-20=0.682, rMCF7=0.776, rSK-BR-3=0.825, P less_than 0.01; Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, within each cancer subtype, we identified specific correlations in expression levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, in the MCF7 cell line, we observed considerable correlation between EpCAM and ER (r=0.670, P less_than 0.01), as well as between EpCAM and panCK (r=0.616, P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found panCK correlated with ER (r=0.662, P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, in the SK-BR-3 cells, we observed higher mTOR heterogeneity than the other cell lines (SK-BR-32=3.25 × 1012, as compared with BT-202=5.10 × 1010 and MCF72=7.65 × 1011), with correlation between eIF4E and -tubulin (r=0.728, P less_than 0.01), as well as panCK and eIF4E (r=0.815, P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, BT-20 cell-to-cell expression of ERK was less variable (ERK2=4.51 × 1012) than observed in the MCF7 (ERK2=1.45 × 1014) and SK-BR-3 (ERK2=7.88 × 1013) cell lines (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, within the BT-20 population, EpCAM correlated well with eIF4E (r=0.692, P less_than 0.01), mTOR (r=0.674, P less_than 0.01) and ERK (r=0.663, P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although individual cells may be categorized by the same molecular subtype, differences in downstream signalling were evident within each population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As compared with the  less_than 5-plex protein multiplexing that is typical in immunocytochemistry54, numerous and even unexpected relationships may be identified by deeper profiling, such as that provided by 8- to 12-plex scWB analysis of cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Lysis and electrophoresis optimization for CTC analysis', 'To the patient-derived CTCs, we applied lysis conditions optimized for the three cell lines (Patient 1;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The rare-cell scWB expands the repertoire of available single-cell analysis tools, an area where direct measurement of multiple protein targets in each CTC is hindered by reliance on single-stage immunoassays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expanding the number of proteins profiled in a single CTC may aid identification of CTCs that do not fit contemporary taxonomies in light of the rapidly evolving understanding of CTC biology and individual responses to therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, both existing and emerging precision cancer therapies are targeting proteins35,39; thus, monitoring multiple upregulated proteins in blood-derived CTCs may inform therapeutic selection to maximize the benefit to each specific patient at each specific time point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, we measure eight surface and intracellular proteins with single-CTC resolution using a microfluidic targeted proteomics tool, the rare-cell scWB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complementary single-cell resolution technologies such as flow cytometry and mass cytometry find analyses of such rare cells challenging, owing to sampling losses (that is, mass cytometry samples up to 30% of the initial cell population)61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scWB leverages short distances and timescales to rapidly complete lysis, PAGE and protein blotting of proteins in single CTCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The careful control of sample and analysis affords the unique option to forgo normalization by protein housekeeping proteins and directly assign protein levels on a per CTC basis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To first validate and then optimize the rare-cell scWB tool, we spiked healthy blood with cells from each of three breast cancer cell lines to model three major molecular breast cancer classifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We enriched for the spiked cancer cells and assayed via scWB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Workflow durations of 50110 min are well within the timeframe of other CTC processing and analysis methods62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  scWB classification of each cell line subtype agreed with expected molecular classification, but with heterogeneity in surface and intracellular protein expression detected at the single-cell level within the cells of each cell line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tool validation studies further established the conditions needed for cell lysis, electrophoresis, blotting and probing, as well as established levels of technical variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rapid unit operations (lysis, electrophoresis and immobilization to the gel scaffold) and quick handling minimized dilution and diffusive losses of the cellular contents before assay completion, allowing the assay to maintain high local protein concentrations, even if local protein copy numbers are low (for example, 30,000 molecules per cell)30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Pilot testing of the rare-cell scWB collectionisolationanalysis workflow on blood from ER+ breast cancer patients yielded CTC enumeration data paired with scWB protein analyses (Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scWB revealed a robust physical CTC phenotype resistant to the chemical lysis conditions that were optimized on three breast cancer cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We attribute the hardy CTC phenotype to differences in cell type, handling and microenvironment as compared with breast cancer cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, inclusion of fetal bovine solution (FBS) in the cell line culture medium is known to introduce a high concentration of lipids; thus, the lipid membrane composition of a cell grown in FBS would not necessarily be representative of primary cells63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Observation of the separation quality aided systematic optimization of lysis conditions suitable for a subset of eight protein targets, while minimizing protein losses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments performed with our final lysis protocol suggest patient-to-patient variation in the physical CTC phenotype, thus mirroring observations even in cultured CTCs, where doubling time, point mutations and drug sensitivity vary within a CTC population64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The precision and detection sensitivity of the rare-cell scWB enables direct analysis of individual, patient-derived CTCs, obviating the need for post-isolation cell culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variation in cell state and response is proposed to be a driver of cancer progression and therapy resistance65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rare-cell scWB identified differences between the CTC protein expression profiles, including both wider EpCAM expression ranges in CTCs (as compared with the three cell lines) and sub-populations of CTCs having statistically distinct GAPDH expression levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expansion of our multiplexed protein measurements with label-free CTC isolation to characterize additional subpopulations including cancer stem cell-like CTCs66 and CTCs undergoing EMT67 are of continuing interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Looking forward to longitudinal studies, inclusion of protein levels in CTC phenotype could make CTC taxonomy more precise, as CTCs are thought to navigate away from the primary tumour perhaps diverging at the proteomic level54,68.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Based on our observations on CD45 expression in rare-cell scWB analyses of large, nucleated cells, we see next steps developing in a manner that parallels the development of CTC enrichment tools optimized for CTC cluster analyses, so that future rare-cell western blotting work is focusing on specific assay optimization for CTC clusters, as both the CTC isolation tool32 and the microtransfer protocol42 used here have been shown to be suitable for CTC cluster handling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Important to longitudinal studies, the scWB is archivable30, which allows later-date profiling of new targets of interest with previously analysed single-CTC lysates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CTC lysates are covalently immobilized to the PA gel layer on the scWB device, a stable linkage compatible with long-term storage for retrospective CTC analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although chemical fixation of CTCs also yields biospecimens suitable for long-term storage and retrospective studies, cell fixation is incompatible with stripping procedures and suffers from several pre-analytical variables including the following: epitope disfigurement during fixation especially changes in posttranslational modifications, loss of antigenicity owing to over- and under-fixation, and sample degradation with aging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, analytical variables including target cross-reactivity with moderate specificity antibodies, lab-to-lab variation and qualitative but not quantitative analyses, all have an impact on final outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the rare-cell scWB requires further long-term storage performance characterization and larger-scale patient studies, the targeted proteomics tool introduced here presents a promising approach to multiplexed, archival protein analysis of single CTCs with direct relevance to longitudinal studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even longer term, the microfluidic form factor of the assay may find utility in low-resource settings, especially with further engineering integration of the cell purification and handling fluidics, as is underway.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

technical variation cutoff was defined as 3 s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  above the average CV of protein expression (for a 99.7% confidence interval).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data analysis and processing', 'Quantification of protein PAGE and probing used in-house MATLAB scripts as described in Kang et al.29 Band widths were characterized by Gaussian curve fitting in MATLAB (R2014b, Curve Fitting Toolbox) if the Gaussian had a R2-value greater than 0.7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If R2-value was  less_than 0.7 for a marker, the integrated intensity for the region of interest was calculated.

between the different protein CVs observed, we performed a t-test statistic and used a permutation test to determine the P-values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Levenes test was used to determine non-equivalence of the variance between the markers for each cell line (BT-20, SK-BR-3 and MCF7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To classify a group of CTCs as a sub-population based on GAPDH expression in Patient 5, an F-test for model selection was performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model 1 assumed one population exists and model 2 assumed two sub-populations exist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The F-test compares the two models with the null hypothesis, considering the data follows model 1 instead of model 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the P-value is  less_than 0.05, the null hypothesis can be rejected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To detect correlation in protein expression between proteins, a Spearmans rank correlation was performed, as the correlation of protein expression between two proteins was expected to be monotonic but not necessarily linear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two proteins in the panel were sequentially paired (Supplementary Table 3) to determine possible correlations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only correlations with a P-value
