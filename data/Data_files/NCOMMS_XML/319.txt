The Hippo signalling pathway maintains quiescence in Drosophila neural stem cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Stem cells control their mitotic activity to decide whether to proliferate or to stay in quiescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Drosophila neural stem cells (NSCs) are quiescent at early larval stages, when they are reactivated in response to metabolic changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that cell-contact inhibition of growth through the canonical Hippo signalling pathway maintains NSC quiescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of the core kinases hippo or warts leads to premature nuclear localization of the transcriptional co-activator Yorkie and initiation of growth and proliferation in NSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yorkie is necessary and sufficient for NSC reactivation, growth and proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Hippo pathway activity is modulated via inter-cellular transmembrane proteins Crumbs and Echinoid that are both expressed in a nutrient-dependent way in niche glial cells and NSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of crumbs or echinoid in the niche only is sufficient to reactivate NSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we provide evidence that the Hippo pathway activity discriminates quiescent from non-quiescent NSCs in the Drosophila nervous system.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Stem cells are undifferentiated cells that have the unique ability to produce differentiating daughter cells and retain their identity by a process called self-renewal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stem cells can exhibit a remarkable proliferative capacity, for example, during development or regenerative processes1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deregulation of stem cell proliferation can lead to tumour formation or to a premature depletion of the progenitor pool3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, stem cell proliferation has to be tightly regulated according to the cellular or organismal context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When proliferation is not required, stem cells are maintained in a state of quiescence in the G0-phase and need to be activated by systemic or local signals3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Drosophila, neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferate in two phases5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The embryonic phase generates all cells of a functional larval central nervous system (CNS), while in the second proliferative phase cells forming the adult CNS are produced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In late embryonic stages NSCs enter quiescence, which requires intrinsic transcription factors6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Changes in the physiological condition of the animal in response to feeding at early larval stages causes reactivation of NSCs8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amino-acid sensing fat body releases systemic signals in response to the increase in dietary amino acids8,9 and CNS glial cells translate these signals into a local activating signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They produce and secrete insulin-like peptides that activate the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling pathway in NSCs10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An initial step during reactivation is the drastic increase in NSC cell size from 45 m during quiescence to 1015 m depending on the type of NSC5,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, growth in preparation for cell division is one of the initial hallmarks of NSC reactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanisms regulating quiescence are less well understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glial cells secrete a glycoprotein (anachronism) that keeps NSCs in quiescence, but the precise molecular mechanism remains unknown13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One of the major pathways that controls organ growth and cell proliferation in Drosophila and vertebrates is the conserved Salvador/Hippo/Warts signalling pathway (SHW)14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SHW consists of a growth-repressive kinase cascade that modulates the activity of the transcriptional co-activator Yorkie (YAP/TAZ in vertebrates).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Hippo kinase activates the Warts kinase, which in turn directly phosphorylates Yorkie, creating a 14-3-3 binding site that restricts nuclear import and inactivates Yorkie17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If Hippo/Warts are inactive, non-phosphorylated Yorkie enters the nucleus and binds to transcription factors like Scalloped19,20 and activates its transcriptional program promoting cell growth and proliferation21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerous upstream regulators of the SHW have been identified, including cellcell contact, the actin cytoskeleton, G-protein coupled receptors or planar and apico-basal cell polarity23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the vertebrate skin or the liver, de-repression of YAP has been shown to promote stem cell proliferation24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, whether this is true in NSCs and whether changes in Yorkie/YAP activity are causative for altering growth and proliferation during normal CNS development remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Drosophila, the SHW has been implicated in CNS development of the neuroepithelium and of glial cells in the optic lobe, and in cell growth of a specific population of glial cells (subperineural glial cells)25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for central brain NSCs, no function has been attributed to the SHW.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we show that the SHW maintains quiescence of NSCs at the transition from embryo to larval life in Drosophila.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of the core kinases hippo/warts, or upstream regulators kibra/Merlin/expanded, leads to a premature initiation of cell growth and proliferation and thus reactivation from quiescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yorkie is inactive in quiescent NSCs and is necessary and sufficient for the reactivation and proliferation of NSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cellcell contact proteins Crumbs and Echinoid are expressed in both glial cells and NSCs and regulate the activity of Hippo and Warts, possibly via homophilic interactions in trans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression of Crumbs and Echinoid in glial cells and NSCs is nutrition-dependent, and their premature loss in glial cells is sufficient to initiate reactivation of NSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the Yorkie activity discriminates between quiescent and non-quiescent NSCs, placing the SHW as a major regulator of growth in cellular quiescence in Drosophila NSCs.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

less pronounced but still significant increase in NSCs cell diameter (Supplementary Fig 4g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, premature glial growth in wts-RNAi can initiate growth in NSCs but full reactivation

reactivation of NSCs through altering Hippo activity in trans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To test potential homophilic interactions of Crumbs45, we targeted crb simultaneously in both NSCs and glial cells by RNAi (insc-GAL4/ repo-GAL4) and observed an increase in the strength of premature reactivation of NSCs compared with glial knockdown alone (Fig 5c,e and Supplementary Fig 4h,i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the phenotype was similar to the NSC-specific RNAi of crb or ed alone we conclude that crb and ed act both in trans and in cis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown in glial cells removes the interaction in trans (between glial cells and NSCs) but leaves the interaction in cis (on NSCs), which causes a less-pronounced phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, knockdown of crb or ed in NSC or in NSC and glial cells simultaneously interrupts both interactions in cis and in trans and causes stronger phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Simultaneous glial- and NSC-specific knockdown of crb caused Yorkie nuclear localization in reactivated NSCs (Supplementary Fig 4h) connecting crb function to the SHW.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we assessed redundancy and performed double RNAi gene knockdowns of crb and ed simultaneously with the double driver GAL4 line (NSCs and glial cells concurrently), which caused NSC reactivation in the same degree as knockdown of ed alone (Fig 5c,e and Supplementary Fig 4i).

quiescence (Fig 6a,b and Supplementary Fig 5ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since our data so far suggests a cell-contact inhibition of growth by niche glial cells we analysed whether Crumbs::GFP localizes to contact sites of glial cells and NSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we could observe a slight accumulation in NSCs towards the contact site with glial cells (Supplementary Fig 5d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prove that NSC and glial cells indeed form cellcell contacts, we stained for E-Cadherin and could monitor adherens junctions between glial cells and NSCs (Supplementary Fig 5e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crumbs::GFP expression in glial cells and NSCs was lost over time (8 and 24 h ALH, respectively) whereas Echinoid was downregulated mainly in glial cells (24 h, Fig 6a,b and Supplementary Fig 5a,c).

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'NSCs need to tightly control the balance between proliferation and quiescence, since deregulation can lead to tumour formation or premature depletion of the progenitor pool1,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to orchestrate their behaviour according to the status of the organism they need to communicate with their surrounding microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the neurogenic niche in vertebrates49, processes of glial cells in insects enwrap NSCs to form an enclosed chamber known as the trophospongium50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is still debated whether Drosophila NSCs are independent of niche signalling and indeed NSCs in culture undergo asymmetric cell division to self-renew and produce differentiating progeny51,52, exhibiting very similar behaviour as their counterparts in vivo, like progressing through an intrinsically regulated series of transcription factors (temporal transcription factor cascade)53 and generating diverse cell types and lineages in vitro resembling the in vivo lineages in cell number and identity54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, loss of contact to the surrounding epithelium leads to a randomization of the mitotic spindle in isolated embryonic NSCs55 and compromising Drosophila E-Cadherin function in niche glial cells impairs the mitotic activity of NSCs56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During quiescence and reactivation NSCs show a strong dependency on extrinsic signals from glial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glial cells express and secrete quiescence promoting factors13, or in response to nutrition, activating factors10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We now show that niche glial cells express transmembrane proteins Crumbs and Echinoid that act in trans to activate the SHW in NSCs to maintain quiescence and suppress cell growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, like vertebrate adult NSCs, Drosophila NSCs show different degrees of dependency on niche signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During quiescence both NSC populations need extrinsic cues from the niche to maintain quiescence (for example, this work10,11,57,58), whereas during the active-phase lineage progression maybe more cell-intrinsic, pre-programed and to a less degree depending on the niche54,59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The SHW and its effector Yorkie/YAP have been widely implicated in stem cell biology and organ size restriction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the vertebrate liver progenitors, the hepatocytes, the SHW controls quiescence of these stem cells60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined loss of Mst1/2 (homologues of Drosophila Hippo) resulted in loss of YAP phosphorylation, leading to a massive overgrowth and hepatocellular carcinoma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other regenerative tissues, like the skin or the intestine, also harbour stem cells and an involvement of the SHW was likewise shown61,62,63,64,65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data now show that the SHW is also important for the regulation of quiescence in NSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SHW is active during quiescence and suppresses inappropriate growth and proliferation of NSC in the Drosophila larvae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to Drosophila, mouse adult quiescent NSCs (aNSCs) also show a prominent cell growth before the initiation of proliferation59,66.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a similar mechanism of promoting quiescence by growth restriction might exist in adult vertebrate NSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, a recent molecular study on NSC quiescence showed that multiple SHW members like Lats2 (Warts homologue) or WWC2 (Kibra homologue) are upregulated in aNSCs, which after BMP4 exposure enter into a quiescence-like status in cell culture57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, our study demonstrates that a crosstalk between the niche glial cells and the stem cells via Crumbs and Echinoid activates the SHW to repress growth during quiescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might also be conserved in mouse aNSCs since Martynoga et al.57 showed that upon BMP4-induced quiescence expression of crumbs2 (CRB2, Drosophila crumbs homologue) is also upregulated in aNSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether CRB2 is expressed in the vertebrate niche and activates the SHW in NSCs during quiescence still has to be shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, given these similarities it is attractive to speculate that the Hippo pathway might act as a general regulator of NSC quiescence in vertebrates and invertebrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In Drosophila two different populations of NSCs can be discriminated: NSCs that become significantly smaller and enter quiescence at the end of embryonic stages, and NSCs that constantly proliferate and do not go into quiescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How this difference is established is not known up to now.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that the activity of the transcriptional regulator Yorkie seems to be a major difference between these two populations of NSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although quiescent NSCs have active Hippo signalling and thus no active Yorkie, the non-quiescent NSCs show constant nuclear Yorkie and constant expression of the known Yorkie-targets bantam and Four-jointed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not observe failure to enter into quiescence upon wts-RNAi or in trans-heterozygous hpo mutants and thus it seems less likely that SHW activation is needed to initiate quiescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Non-quiescent NSCs increase in size upon larval hatching and like in quiescent NSCs, this growth depends on nutrition and on Yorkie function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This also influences the proliferative capacity, since both populations of NSCs either showed no proliferation or exited proliferation prematurely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar function of YAP was described during vertebrate neurogenesis in the developing chick neural tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  YAP is highly expressed in NSCs and co-localizes with Sox2 a neural progenitor marker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of YAP leads to premature differentiation, whereas overexpression leads to an increase in the progenitor pool and accelerated cell cycle progression67.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently YAP expression was also found in the mouse ventricular zone in Sox2-positive progenitors68 and, importantly, simultaneous depletion of YAP and FAT4 or Dachs1 rescued a prolonged neuroprogenitor cell proliferation phenotype in a mouse model for Van Maldergem syndrome69.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, Yorkie/YAP emerges as an important regulator of NSC biology and it is therefore of great importance to identify the precise molecular mechanisms and target genes by which Yorkie/YAP promote growth, proliferation and stem cell identity in NSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, in Drosophila we could uncover an essential difference between NSCs in the brain and the VNC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both populations of stem cells Yorkie activates its well-established target bantam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, loss of bantam severely impaired growth and proliferation of the VNC NSCs, whereas the effects were milder in brain NSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, to fully understand the function of Yorkie in NSCs it will be important in the future to unravel the stem cell-specific target genes that are regulated by Yorkie in NSCs.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
