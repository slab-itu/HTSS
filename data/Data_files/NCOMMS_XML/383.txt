Size quantization of Dirac fermions in graphene constrictions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Quantum point contacts are cornerstones of mesoscopic physics and central building blocks for quantum electronics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the Fermi wavelength in high-quality bulk graphene can be tuned up to hundreds of nanometres, the observation of quantum confinement of Dirac electrons in nanostructured graphene has proven surprisingly challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show ballistic transport and quantized conductance of size-confined Dirac fermions in lithographically defined graphene constrictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At high carrier densities, the observed conductance agrees excellently with the Landauer theory of ballistic transport without any adjustable parameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental data and simulations for the evolution of the conductance with magnetic field unambiguously confirm the identification of size quantization in the constriction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Close to the charge neutrality point, bias voltage spectroscopy reveals a renormalized Fermi velocity of 1.5 × 106 m s1 in our constrictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, at low carrier density transport measurements allow probing the density of localized states at edges, thus offering a unique handle on edge physics in graphene devices.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The observation of unique transport phenomena in graphene, such as Klein tunnelling1, evanescent wave transport2, or the half-integer3,4 and fractional5,6 quantum Hall effect are directly related to the material quality, as well as the relativistic dispersion of the charge carriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the quality of bulk graphene has been impressively improved in the last years7,8, the understanding of the role and limitations of edges on transport properties of graphene is becoming increasingly important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is particularly true for nanoscale graphene systems where edges can dominate device properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the rough edges of graphene nanodevices are most probably responsible for the difficulties in observing clear confinement-induced quantization effects such as quantized conductance9 and shell filling10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far signatures of quantized conductance have only been observed in suspended graphene, however with limited control and information on geometry and constriction width11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More generally, with further progress in fabrication technology, graphene nanoribbons and constrictions are expected to evolve from a disorder-dominated12,13,14,15 transport behaviour to a quasi-ballistic regime where boundary effects, crystal alignment and edge defects16,17 govern the transport characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This will open the door to investigate interesting phenomena arising from edge states, including magnetic order at zig-zag edges18, an unusual Josephson effect19, unconventional edge states20, magnetic edge-state excitons21 or topologically protected quantum spin Hall states22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this work we report on the observation of size quantization and localized trap states in ballistic transport through graphene constrictions approximating quantum point contacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Away from the Dirac point, the current features evenly spaced, reproducible kinks superposed on a linear background, in agreement with transport simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scattering at the rough constriction edges reduces quantization steps to kinks in both experiment and theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The kink spacing, and their evolution with magnetic field, allows us to unambiguously identify them as signatures of size quantization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Close to the Dirac point, deviations from ballistic behaviour allow for probing the density of localized trap states.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Ballistic transport', 'We prepared four-probe devices based on high-mobility graphenehexagonal boron nitride (hBN) sandwiches on SiO2/Si substrates and use reactive ion etching to pattern narrow constrictions (see Methods) with widths ranging from W230 to 850 nm, connecting wide leads (Fig 1ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The graphene leads are side-contacted8 by 80-nm-thick chrome/gold electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A back-gate voltage is applied on the highly doped Si substrate to tune the carrier density in the graphene layer, , where  is the so-called lever arm and  is the gate voltage of the minimum conductance, that is, the charge neutrality point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To demonstrate the high electronic quality of our graphenehBN sandwich structures we show the gate characteristic of a reference Hall bar device (Fig 1d and Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this data we extract a carrier mobility in the range of around 150.000 cm2 V1 s1 (Supplementary Note 1), resulting in a mean free path exceeding 1 m at around Vg=4.6 V.

presence of edge roughness, c0 is reduced to a value below 1 due to limited average transmission, and the higher Fourier components are expected to decay in magnitude and acquire random scattering phases j0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the sharp quantization steps turn into periodic modulations as will be shown below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Averaged over these modulations only the zeroth-order term in the expansion (equation (2)) survives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mean conductance G(0) of a constriction of width W thus features a linear dependenc on kF, or, equivalently, a square-root dependence as a function of back-gate voltage assuming an energy-independent transmission c0 of all modes, in accord with Fig 1d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By measuring the carrier-density-dependent quantum Hall effect at high magnetic fields4,24, we can independently determine the gate coupling  for each device (Supplementary Fig 2, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can thus unfold the dependence on Vg and study both the electron and hole conductance as function of kF (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the linear slopes of G(kF), the product c0W can be extracted for each device and compared with its width W (Fig 1f) determined from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (see, for example, Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The estimates for c0W extracted from G(0) lie only slightly below the width W, where c0 decreases for decreasing width.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that for the narrower devices reflections, most likely due to device geometry and edge roughness, are playing a more important role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the data in Fig 1f we can extract c00.56 for our smallest constriction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below we will show that, indeed, reflections at the rough edges of the constriction and not a reduction in active channel width is responsible for the deviation of the experimentally extracted c0W from the SEM width W.', 'Localized states', 'For small kF50 × 106 m1 (that is, low carrier concentrations) the measured conductances systematically deviate from the expected linear behaviour (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This deviation from the square-root relation between

slightly shifted relative to another on the carrier density axis n (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that the square-root relation between the Fermi wave vector kF and the gate voltage Vg, that is, n needs to be modified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the quantum capacitance of ideal graphene can be neglected25,26,27, a small additional contribution nT(Vg) from, for

point.Full size image', '', 'Far away from the Dirac point (), we recover the expected square-root relation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Close to the Dirac point, however, Vg will be strongly modified by deviations nT from the linear density of states of ideal Dirac fermions and approaches nT(Vg) near the CNP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trap states do not contribute to transport, yet they contribute to the charging characteristics28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such trap states can for instance be found at the rough edges of patterned graphene devices, which feature a significant number of localized states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A tight-binding simulation of the local density of states of the experimental geometry yields a strong clustering of localized states at the device edges (Fig 2c), which energetically lie close to the CNP (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deviation of G from the  scaling also opens up the opportunity to extract nT from experimental conductance data (for example, Fig 2d), and thus a new pathway for device characterization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inspired by the tight-binding simulation, we approximate the distribution of trap states as function of Fermi wave vector by a Gaussian distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We fit the position, height and width of the Gaussian by minimizing the difference between the measured G(kF) and the corresponding linear extrapolation to very low values of kF (Fig 2b, Supplementary Fig 3 and Supplementary Note 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find good qualitative agreement between simulation and experiment (compare Fig 2d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative correspondence would require a detailed, microscopic model for the trap state density nT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the only difference between different traces in Fig 2a,b,d is the exposition of the device to air for several days leading to a wider carrier density region of substantial deviations (green trace).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of trap states (that is, the deviations around the CNP) is significantly enhanced (compare also green and black trace in Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the active graphene layer is completely sandwiched in hBN, only the graphene edges are exposed to air and, very likely, experience chemical modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with our numerical results, we thus conjecture that localized states at the edges substantially contribute to nT, leading to the strong cool-down dependence we observe in our measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this interpretation seems plausible and is consistent with our data, alternative explanations such as electronhole puddles29 or charged impurities13 cannot be ruled out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Away from the CNP our data agrees remarkably well with ballistic transport simulations through the device geometry using a modular Greens function approach30 (see blue trace in Fig 2b): we simulate the four-probe constriction geometry taken from a SEM image, scaled down by a factor of four to obtain a numerically feasible problem size31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To account for the etched edges in the devices, we include an edge roughness amplitude of W=0.2W for the constriction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This comparatively large edge roughness (which is consistent with the systematic reduction of transmission through the constriction when using the average conductance) is probably due to microcracks at the edges of the device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Quantized conductance', 'Superimposed on the overall linear behaviour of G(kF), we find reproducible modulations (kinks) in the conductance (Fig 3ac and Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The kinks are well reproduced for several cool-downs (see arrows in Fig 2a, Supplementary Figs 5 and 6 and Supplementary Note 4), as well as for different devices (Supplementary Fig 7), generally showing a spacing G varying in the range of (24)e2/h (see arrows in Fig 3b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The step height and its sharpness depend on the carrier density (that is, kF), as well as on the constriction width and is strongly influenced by the overall transmission c0 (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, we observe a spacing G of the steps close to 4e2/h for one of our wide samples (W310 nm) at elevated conductance values on both the electron and hole sides (see arrows and horizontal lines in Fig 3c and Supplementary Fig 4b)', 'Figure 3: Size quantization

experimental data from the smallest constriction show similar smoothed, irregular modulations (Fig 3a), instead of sharp size quantization steps32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The replacement of sharp quantization steps by kinks reflects the strong scattering at the rough edges of the device33,34, resulting in the accumulation of random phases in the Fourier components of G (equation (2)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that calculations with smaller edge disorder show a larger average conductance, yet very similar kink structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the present calculation includes only edge-disorder-induced scattering while neglecting other scattering channels such as electronelectron or electronphonon scattering, the good agreement with the data suggests edge scattering to be the dominant contribution to the formation of the kinks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, both experimental and theoretical investigations of, for example, semiconducting GaAs heterostructures show very clear, pronounced quantization plateaus35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these heterostructures, the electron wavelength near the  point is very long, and cannot resolve edge disorder on the nanometre scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, KK scattering in graphene allows conduction electrons to probe disorder on a much shorter length scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, edge roughness substantially impacts transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparison between experimental and theoretical data (Fig 3a) unambiguously establishes the observed modulations to be consistent with the smoothed size quantization effects predicted by theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By subtracting the zeroth-order Fourier componentkF (or ), the superimposed modulations of the conductance G(kF)=GG(0) provide direct information on the quantized conductance through the constriction (equation (2)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One key observation is that the Fourier transform of G(kF) offers an alternative route towards the determination of the constriction width complementary to that from the mean conductance G(0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the pronounced peak of the first harmonic at 230 nm (red arrows in Fig 3d,e) is consistent with the constriction width W derived from the SEM image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our simulation also correctly reproduces the experimental observation that the peak in the Fourier spectrum of G(kF) is more pronounced on the electron side (Fig 3d) than on the hole side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This results from the slightly asymmetric energy distribution of the trap states relative to the CNP, which is accounted for in our tight-binding calculation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Performing such a Fourier analysis for several devices (Supplementary Fig 9 and Supplementary Note 5) yields much closer agreement with the geometric width W (Fig 3f and horizontal axis of Fig 1f) than an estimate based only on the zeroth-order Fourier component c0W (first term in equation (2); see vertical axis of Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourier spectroscopy of conductance modulations thus allows to disentangle reduced transmission due to scattering at the edges (c0W) from the effective width of the constriction, and proves the relation between the observed Fourier periodicity and the device geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Bias voltage spectroscopy measurements yield an estimate for the energy scale of the size quantization steps11,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, by analysing finite bias measurements from our smallest constriction device we extract a sub-band energy spacing of E=13.5±2 meV near the CNP (Fig 4a,b, Supplementary Figs 1012 and Supplementary Note 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the geometric width of 230 nm also confirmed by the Fourier spectroscopy (Fig 3c) we can estimate the Fermi velocity near the CNP as vF=2WE/h=(1.5±0.2) × 106 m s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a clear signature of a substantially renormalized Fermi velocity in nanostructured graphene, possibly enhanced by electronelectron interaction37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the extracted energy scales are consistent with the weak temperature dependence of the quantized conductance (Fig 4c, Supplementary Figs 13 and 14 and Supplementary Note 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Finite bias and temperature dependence of the quantized conductance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Zero B-field differential conductance g as a function of
