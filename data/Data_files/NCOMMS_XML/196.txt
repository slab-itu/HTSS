Membrane potential shapes regulation of dopamine transporter trafficking at the plasma membrane  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The dopaminergic system is essential for cognitive processes, including reward, attention and motor control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to DA release and availability of synaptic DA receptors, timing and magnitude of DA neurotransmission depend on extracellular DA-level regulation by the dopamine transporter (DAT), the membrane expression and trafficking of which are highly dynamic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data presented here from real-time TIRF (TIRFM) and confocal microscopy coupled with surface biotinylation and electrophysiology suggest that changes in the membrane potential alone, a universal yet dynamic cellular property, rapidly alter trafficking of DAT to and from the surface membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Broadly, these findings suggest that cell-surface DAT levels are sensitive to membrane potential changes, which can rapidly drive DAT internalization from and insertion into the cell membrane, thus having an impact on the capacity for DAT to regulate extracellular DA levels.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Central nervous system dopaminergic (DAergic) neurotransmission is essential in multiple neurological functions, including cognition, extrapyramidal motor control, the reward pathway and attention1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the timing of vesicular release of dopamine (DA) and the expression profiles of G-protein-coupled DA receptors5,6, one major regulator of DA signalling magnitude and timing is the DA transporter (DAT), which rapidly transports extracellular DA into the intracellular space for vesicular re-packaging or effluxes DA through reversal of DAT-mediated transport7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Commonly abused psychotropic drugs, amphetamine (AMPH), methamphetamine and cocaine achieve their effects either by inducing DA efflux through DAT and/or blocking DA uptake9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The physiological function of DAT to remove DA is coupled to the translocation of one Cl and two Na+ ions8,12,13, and can even function in the absence of substrate, conducting an uncoupled, cocaine-sensitive, depolarizing current under physiological conditions13,14, which is increased in hyperpolarized states10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to direct modulation of transport function, DAT density at the cell membrane, and therefore its functional capacity, is also dynamic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regulated trafficking mechanisms control surface-membrane DAT levels under physiological conditions15,16 and in response to DAT substrates15,16, thus having an impact on DA homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell signalling molecules involved in the regulation of DAT trafficking range from protein kinase C (PKC)17,18, mitogen-activated protein kinase19 to Akt (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20) among others15,16 and determine the presence of DAT in regulated or constitutive pools segregated to specific membrane microdomains21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many DAT substrates also influence DAT trafficking15,24,25, including DA and AMPH, which decrease DAT surface density26,27,28, and cocaine, which increases DAT surface expression29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interestingly, AMPHs effects are twofold, as it causes DAT internalization26,27,28 and a DAT-dependent membrane depolarization13,14, which suggests an influence on DAT trafficking via a voltage-dependent mechanism in addition to DAT phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, previous studies using striatal synaptosomes have revealed a reduction in DA uptake in depolarized (elevated KCl) conditions30,31, while in vitro preparations have suggested elevated DAT function at hyperpolarized states13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is not known whether these changes in functional capacity arise from changes in ionic driving forces, essential for DA transport, changes in DAT protein presence at the membrane or both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While changes in the cell membrane voltage state are only typically considered in terms of neurotransmitter release, action potential generation and timing or in the activity of voltage-sensitive transmembrane proteins, it is possible that changes in membrane potential (MP) alone may rapidly and reversibly affect DAT trafficking to and from the cell surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use confocal and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), biochemistry, electrophysiology and optogenetics to demonstrate the degree to which surface-membrane DAT levels are shaped by and sensitive to MP changes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'MP depolarization reduces membrane DAT levels', 'AMPH-mediated activation of DAT induces a depolarizing DAT-mediated Na+ current and simultaneously causes internalization of cell-surface-membrane DAT14,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether AMPH-induced DAT internalization was the result of a psychostimulant-specific action or may be, in part, due to activation of voltage-sensitive mechanisms, we performed live cell TIRFM of yellow fluorescent protein-tagged DAT (YPF-DAT) in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) cells when perfused with only extracellular solution (vehicle), 10 M AMPH or 100 mM KCl (Fig 1), which depolarized cells by 13.5 and 35.7 mV, respectively (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of YFP (yellow fluorescent protein)-DAT at the cell membrane (TIRFM footprint) was unchanged throughout perfusion of vehicle, whereas 10 M AMPH noticeably altered the YFP signal in the TIRFM footprint within the first 60 s, causing a reduction in surface-membrane high-intensity regions and puncta that did not recover in washout (Fig 1a,b and Supplementary Fig 1a), in line with previous reports at longer AMPH treatment durations32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, depolarizing 100-mM KCl-based external solution significantly altered the YFP-DAT distribution in TIRFM footprint; however, the effects occurred rapidly, obvious within 30 s, and typically all YFP puncta and high-intensity regions were absent from the surface membrane after 3 min (Fig 1a,b,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to AMPH, treatment with KCl resulted in the return of YFP signal profile and the reappearance of YFP puncta immediately on washout (Fig 1a and Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the relative specificity of this effect of depolarization for DAT, we identically depolarized HEK cells transfected with an eYFP-tagged version of an unrelated naturally occurring membrane protein, GPR40 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33), which had a membrane distribution similar to DAT, but its trafficking appeared insensitive to depolarization (Supplementary Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Depolarization causes CaMK-dependent reduction of membrane YFP-DAT levels in HEK cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Representative live cell sequential TIRF microscopy images of YFP-DAT HEK cells 60 s before and throughout 5-min perfusion with vehicle (standard external solution, top row), 10 M amphetamine (middle row; N=5, n=14) or depolarizing 100 mM KCl-based external solution (bottom row) followed by a 5-min washout period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 20 m.

Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the KCl depolarization-induced loss of YFP-DAT surface puncta was significantly reduced in the presence of the CaMK inhibitor KN93 (10 M) relative to the same treatment in the presence of the inactive homologue, KN92 (10 M; Fig 1c,d), which produced results similar to KCl treatment alone (Fig 1ad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because of the KN93-induced attenuation of the depolarization-triggered Ca2+ influx (Supplementary Fig 3), we chose to biochemically inhibit CaMKII specifically and assess membrane DAT using TIRFM by co-expressing a kinase-inactive version of CaMKII, a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged K42R mutant and RFP (red fluorescent protein)-DAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In response to KCl-induced depolarization, RFP-DAT alone behaved similarly to YFP-DAT; however, when GFP-CaMKII(K42R) was co-expressed, KCl treatment was unable to alter the membrane distribution of RFP-DAT (Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes in membrane DAT in response to depolarization (100 mM KCl application) and repolarization (washout) suggest that the MP state is capable of bidirectionally shaping the cell-surface distribution of DAT through activation of CaMKII.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Membrane DAT reduction is CaMKII and dynamin dependent', 'To determine the degree to which real-time changes in the YFP-DAT TIRFM footprint were indicative of changes in DAT protein density at the cell membrane, a cell-surface biotinylation assay was used to quantify differences in membrane DAT protein levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In YFP-DAT HEK cells, compared with vehicle treatment (100%, n=17), surface DAT (Fig 2; see Supplementary Fig 4 for antibody validation and total protein blots) was significantly reduced following a similar 5-min treatment as above with both 50 mM (62±6%, n=14) and 100 mM (70±5%, n=17) KCl-based external solution as well as the positive control treatments with AMPH (10 M; 59±7%, n=13) and the PKC agonist phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 2.5 M; 53±5%, n=13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CaMKII dependency of this effect observed in TIRFM studies was also supported by biotinylation experiments (Fig 2), wherein 100 mM KCl had little effect on membrane DAT protein when YFP-DAT HEK cells were transfected with the kinase-inactive, dominant-negative GFP-CaMKII(K42R) (105±11%, n=6) or in the presence of the CaMK inhibitor KN93 (10 M; 98±9%, n=9), whereas the inactive homologue KN92 did not significantly block the KCl-dependent reduction in surface DAT (10 M; 63±6%, n=12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether the reduction in membrane DAT distribution observed using TIRFM and confirmed using biotinylation was a trafficking event, we evaluated the capacity for depolarization to induce a loss in surface DAT in the presence of Dynasore, a dynamin inhibitor34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, inhibition of dynamin by Dynasore blocked depolarization- (115±6%, n=6), AMPH- (101±11%, n=6) and PMA-dependent (108±8%, n=6) internalization of DAT in HEK cells, whereas expression of CaMKII(K42R) only blocked depolarization- and PMA-dependent (117±13%, n=6) but not AMPH-dependent (66±9%, n=6) internalization (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, treatment with 100 mM KCl did not alter surface levels of the native or overexpressed, membrane-resident transferrin receptor in comparison with vehicle control, providing further support for the specificity of depolarization-induced downregulation of membrane DAT (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data suggest that CaMKII- and dynamin-dependent pathways are involved in depolarization-dependent DAT trafficking at the cell membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Depolarization-induced reduction in surface-membrane-biotinylated DAT is due to CaMKII-dependent endocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Representative western blots show the surface DAT present under each indicated condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Mean±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DAT band density from YFP-DAT HEK cells (control, black bars) or YFP-DAT HEK cells transfected with GFP-C1-CAMKII-K42R (grey bars) or YFP-DAT HEK pre-treated (30 min) with external solution (vehicle) or 80 M Dynasore (white bars), followed by 30-min treatment with vehicle, vehicle+10 M KN92 or vehicle+10 M KN93.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells normalized to vehicle treatment from at least five independent experiments indicate that AMPH, PMA and depolarization-induced reduction in surface DAT are endocytosis-dependent (Dynasore-sensitive), and both PMA- and depolarization-induced internalization are CaMKII-dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depolarization-induced internalization is sensitive to both pharmacological and molecular inhibition of CaMKII activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni post hoc test was performed to identify significant differences from control (*P0.05;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The presence of DAT at the cell membrane is crucial in the regulation of DAergic signalling, timing and magnitude throughout the brain, and thus any alteration in the functional capacity of the transporter may significantly have an impact on neurological functions in which DA is involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have demonstrated that KCl-induced depolarization reduces DA uptake30,31, and that membrane hyperpolarization increases DAT-mediated inward current and DA uptake13, albeit with an unknown mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we asked whether changes in MP alone may rapidly and reversibly regulate DAT trafficking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One aspect regulating transporter function is that the trafficking of mature DAT to and from the cell membrane is a highly regulated process, which is affected in various disease states and by the activity of DAT-targeting psychostimulants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using live cell TIRFM and biotinylation on identically treated HEK cells expressing YFP-DAT, we determined that membrane depolarization alone could induce a CaMKII- and dynamin-dependent (Figs 1 and 2) rapid reversible (increase in hyperpolarization recovery) reduction in membrane DAT (Fig 1 and Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This depolarization-induced effect on DAT distribution in the TIRFM footprint was distinctly different when compared with the effects of AMPH, which did not recover as quickly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another difference between AMPH- and depolarization-induced DAT internalization is the insensitivity of AMPH-induced internalization to the loss of CaMKII activity through the coexpression of a dominant-negative, kinase-inactive CaMKII (Fig 2), which, along with the sensitivity of both versions to KN93, may suggest that different isoforms of the kinase may have distinctly different roles in regard to regulating DAT function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, similar fast changes in membrane DAT levels have been reported using this approach with acute AMPH exposure41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the direction of the AMPH effect on human DAT using the multifaceted approach reported here contrasts with this previous finding and could be due to intrinsic differences between rat and human DAT, AMPH concentrations and/or cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To determine the degree of DAT internalization, with the DAT-specific fluorescent cocaine analogue, JHC 1-064 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36), we followed the distribution of JHC 1-064 fluorescence (JHC 1-064/DAT complexes; Fig 3) when cells were left at rest or depolarized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggested that indeed membrane-resident DAT was being more rapidly brought into the intracellular space when depolarized as compared with constitutive internalization (Fig 3c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While biotinylation and confocal imaging inherently lack the temporal resolution of TIRFM, together, results indicate that in contrast to the effects of AMPH on DAT, depolarization resulted in DAT being segregated specifically into early endosome compartments (EEA1), but not recycling endosomes (Rab11; Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This divergence in the destination of internalized DAT in cells treated with AMPH versus those simply depolarized again suggests the involvement of differing mechanisms, which may leave initially internalized DAT residing in early endosomes free to transition into rapid recycling endosomes, distinct from recycling endosomes42, putatively underlying the faster recovery to the membrane surface during hyperpolarization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although few studies have examined DAT activity immediately after depolarization or following the return to the resting hyperpolarized state, our data provide a potential mechanism for the decreased DA uptake in striatal synaptosomes during the fast phase of depolarization-induced DA release31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, to determine any bidirectionality of the KCl effect on DAT trafficking, we used whole-cell voltage-clamp techniques to clamp the MP of YFP-DAT HEK cells while performing TIRFM simultaneously (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once cells were clamped near their endogenous resting potential (40 mV), the YFP-DAT TIRFM footprint was relatively similar over time (Fig 5ce).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when stepping the membrane-holding potential from 40 mV to a hyperpolarized potential, an increase in YFP-DAT intensity and puncta number in the TIRFM footprint began immediately (Fig 5b) and plateaued after 3 min (Fig 5fh).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, when cells were depolarized the opposite effect occurred with a loss of YFP-DAT signal, which paralleled the effects seen in the presence of depolarizing KCl (Fig 5ik).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the 10% change in YFP-DAT intensity directly corresponded to reductions in DAT-mediated (GBR12935-sensitive) current when cells were clamped at depolarized or hyperpolarized potentials (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of these data and the known electrogenic nature of DAT-mediated DA uptake and efflux, we hypothesize that at depolarized conditions, where efflux is more likely to occur10, the cell may actively attenuate this efflux by downregulating DAT at the membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, membrane hyperpolarization, known to facilitate DA uptake13, may be doing so through interactions with ionic driving forces and increases in membrane DAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'With two tools that induced reversible and reliable depolarization (focal KCl application) or hyperpolarization (Arch activation) of magnitudes, similar to those used in previous experiments (Fig 7ae), we used TIRFM to monitor fluorescent-tagged DAT expressed in midbrain primary cultures during MP manipulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of these manipulations on membrane DAT levels were larger than in HEK cells using methods that induced similar voltage differences, implying that these effects are indeed applicable to neuronal populations and results obtained using HEK cells are relevant to shaping conclusions about MP-dependent trafficking of DAT in the nervous system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data indicate that, while the magnitude of change in membrane DAT levels due to MP changes varies depending on the assay, all changes observed are in a physiologically relevant range and the direction of the effect (increase or decrease) is in agreement across all examinations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This effect of the MP on DAT trafficking sheds light on an additional mechanism by which the activation of hyperpolarizing D2Rs may be altering DA transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activation of D2Rs has long been understood to enhance DAT function43, and previous studies have suggested that a D2R activation initiates a signalling cascade to upregulate cell-surface DAT19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although others have examined how changes in the neuronal MP similarly to those initiated by D2R activation may alter DAT function and found no impact on 3H-DA uptake44, those experiments were performed at room temperature, which likely attenuates trafficking rates as opposed to the studies here conducted at near-physiological temperatures (37 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this methodological difference may explain the discrepancies between that 3H-DA uptake study44 relative to the data presented here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, collectively this study and previous studies support the involvement of multifaceted regulatory mechanisms for DAT trafficking that are substrate-, kinase- and activity-dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of multiple regulatory mechanisms supports the notion that the DAT proteins at the membrane are responsive to diverse regulatory mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overriding mechanism for activation of a given trafficking pathway will be determined by the nature of the stimulation and the availability of specific regulatory constituents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'DA signalling is crucial in many neurological functions, as aberrations in DA neurotransmission contribute to multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, including addiction3,45, Parkinsons disease and movement disorders46,47,48, schizophrenia49,50 and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)2, all of which have been linked to how extracellular DA may be mishandled by altered DAT expression and function23,50,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, disease-related deviations from physiological states and variations in neuronal MPs may be altering the functional capacity of DAT by affecting its trafficking to and from the membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This dynamic balance of electrophysiological and biochemical processes to regulate subtle but essential aspects of neurotransmission opens a range of possibilities for exploring related aberrations in disease states and in pharmacotherapy targeting this interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Broadly, the regulation of protein (DAT) trafficking by the MP may provide additional means by which plasticity (for example, activity-dependent changes) in DAergic and possibly non-DAergic systems is maintained and controlled.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
