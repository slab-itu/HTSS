Exploiting endogenous fibrocartilage stem cells to regenerate cartilage and repair joint injury  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Tissue regeneration using stem cell-based transplantation faces many hurdles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, therapeutically exploiting endogenous stem cells to regenerate injured or diseased tissue may circumvent these challenges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show resident fibrocartilage stem cells (FCSCs) can be used to regenerate and repair cartilage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify FCSCs residing within the superficial zone niche in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) condyle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single FCSC spontaneously generates a cartilage anlage, remodels into bone and organizes a haematopoietic microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wnt signals deplete the reservoir of FCSCs and cause cartilage degeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show that intra-articular treatment with the Wnt inhibitor sclerostin sustains the FCSC pool and regenerates cartilage in a TMJ injury model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate the promise of exploiting resident FCSCs as a regenerative therapeutic strategy to substitute cell transplantation that could be beneficial for patients suffering from fibrocartilage injury and disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data prompt the examination of utilizing this strategy for other musculoskeletal tissues.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Fibrocartilage tissues include the knee meniscus, tendon-bone junction, intervertebral disc and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) condylar cartilage (CC) and disc1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike hyaline cartilage, fibrocartilage consists of various proportions of both fibrous and cartilaginous tissue pending tissue-specific biomechanical functional demands and provides both tensile and compressive strength, respectively2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the restricted number of cells and lack of vascular supply, cartilage has relatively poor regenerative properties5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus fibrocartilage trauma and diseases, including knee meniscus injury6 and TMJ7 or intervertebral disc8 degenerative disease, can cause permanent tissue loss and disability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinical treatment modalities for fibrocartilage trauma or disease are limited and involve either palliative care9 or invasive surgical interventions that often fail or cause further tissue damage10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Minimally invasive cell-based therapies that prevent fibrocartilage degeneration or promote repair are not available clinically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Increasing efforts have been made to develop stem cell-based therapies for musculoskeletal tissue regeneration that involve stem cell expansion and transplantation12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the success of this approach is dependent upon overcoming multiple obstacles, including immune rejection, pathogen transmission, potential tumorigenesis and host tissue engraftment5,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternative approach involves tissue regeneration achieved by the recruitment and stimulation of stem/progenitor cells16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, therapeutic strategies that harness resident stem cells19 to repair and maintain adult musculoskeletal tissue homoeostasis could be a minimally invasive cell-based treatment option that circumvents critical barriers to stem cell transplantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The TMJ condyle is a fibrocartilage tissue with well-organized cellular zones of maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These zones include a distinct fibrous superficial zone (SZ) followed by proliferative/polymorphic, chondrocyte and hypertrophic chondrocyte zones of maturation20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the cellular origin of the TMJ is unclear, studies suggest that neural crest cells and mandibular bone periosteum cells contribute to TMJ formation23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TMJ cellular condensation forms a cartilage anlage that is resorbed by osteoclasts and is replaced by mineralized bone21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike long bone growth plate, at skeletal maturation the TMJ cartilage is not completely resorbed and is maintained like an articular joint cartilage20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In adults, the TMJ condyle is lined with a fibrous, SZ tissue enriched in type I collagen and lubricin, while the deeper cell layers are comprised of cartilaginous matrix consisting of type II collagen and aggrecan22,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the precise function of the fibrous SZ tissue is unknown, we speculate that the SZ tissue stores a reservoir of stem cells that give rise to mature chondrocytes and osteoblasts critical for TMJ development and homoeostasis25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the cell signalling pathways regulating cell fate determination during TMJ development is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that inhibited canonical Wnt signalling is critical for skeletal stem cell fate specification toward cartilage lineage26,27,28, we surmise that Wnt signals may be involved in TMJ stem cell fate specification toward chondrocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Wnt signals are also critical for cartilage homoeostasis, and induce chondrocyte terminal differentiation29,30,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we show for the first time that the fibrous SZ tissue in the TMJ condyle is indeed a niche that harbours fibrocartilage stem cells (FCSCs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discover a single FCSC is capable of not only generating cartilage and bone but also organizing a haematopoietic microenvironment (HME)33,34 when transplanted in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To harness the cartilage regenerative capability of FCSCs, we show that suppression of canonical Wnt signals promote FCSCs to differentiate into chondrocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results further reveal that overactive Wnt signals disrupt fibrocartilage homoeostasis and cause degeneration by depleting the FCSC pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We take advantage of endogenous FCSCs and present a scaffold free, non-surgical therapeutic approach to exploit their ability to regenerate cartilage and repair joint injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discover that therapeutic application of exogenous canonical Wnt inhibitor sclerostin (SOST) maintains FCSC pool and repairs cartilage using a rabbit TMJ injury model35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results reveal that careful regulation of the canonical Wnt pathway promotes FCSC to repair and regenerate injured or diseased cartilage for therapeutic applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings demonstrate for the first time a minimally invasive stem cell-based approach to repair and regenerate fibrocartilage tissue.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The cartilage of the mandibular condyle is considered fibrocartilage due to the presence of a fibrous, SZ tissue lining the condyle surface critical for providing tensile biomechanical properties3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we define a novel function for this fibrous tissue as a specialized niche harbouring a reservoir of FCSCs through several lines of evidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we show that the SZ tissue harbours slow-cycling LRCs and SMA+ cells38 that differentiate into mature chondrocyte progeny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FCSCs isolated from the SZ tissue are clonogenic and multipotent in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most strikingly, a single FCSC can spontaneously differentiate into chondrocytes and osteocytes in vivo (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike tissue-specific stem/progenitor cells from other musculoskeletal tissues, such as tendon42 or tooth54, FCSCs generate bone with a haematopoietic microenvironment without the assistance of osteogenic reagents such as hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate (HA/TCP) ceramic, Matrigel or BMP-2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike BMSCs33,55, FCSCs spontaneously form cartilage anlagen and can generate bone through both intramembranous and endochondral ossification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus we identify FCSCs that are inherently programmed to generate cartilage and bone tissues and spontaneously recapitulate bone developmental processes in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "Premature stem/progenitor cell depletion is implicated in intervertebral disc degeneration56 and other disease pathologies including craniosynostosis57, cardiovascular disease58 and lupus59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results reveal a novel paradigm for TMJ degenerative pathology, where the maintenance of FCSC pool in the SZ niche is critical for TMJ fibrocartilage homoeostasis and integrity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In healthy adult cartilage, chondrocytes exist under normal conditions of hypoxia and relatively low metabolic turnover60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During OA, enhanced biosynthesis and cellular loss are evidence of failed reparative mechanisms, whereby the chondrocyte's reparative capabilities are overridden by the tissues functional demands61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this idea, in two TMJ degeneration animal models29,35 we show that increased proteoglycan deposition and OA histopathology50,51 are also coupled with depletion of FCSCs localized within the SZ niche.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This degenerative mechanism is in contrast to knee hyaline articular cartilage, where OA pathology has been attributed to the limited regenerative capabilities of migratory chondrogenic progenitor cells potentially derived from the bone marrow17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings signify that TMJ fibrocartilage therapies could target preserving and harnessing the regenerative capabilities of endogenous FCSCs within the SZ niche.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ", 'The maintenance of stem/progenitor cell pool relies on intrinsic, local and systemic signalling cues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have identified canonical Wnt as a signalling system critical for maintaining FCSC pool and fibrocartilage tissue homoeostasis (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A body of evidence supports a role for the fine-tuning of canonical Wnt in mediating cartilage homoeostasis at different stages of chondrogenesis; canonical Wnt inhibits early chondrocyte commitment and promotes terminal differentiation26,27,28,44,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data supports a model where inhibited canonical Wnt signalling promotes FCSC differentiation into mature chondrocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further show that FCSCs treated with canonical Wnt inhibitor sclerostin can generate cartilage that is sustained for a longer period in our transplantation model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overactive Wnt signalling has been shown to disrupt cartilage homoeostasis and contribute to OA pathological progression in several mouse models29,62,63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we show that -catenin expression is upregulated and proteoglycan content is abnormal in both animal and human diseased TMJ fibrocartilage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide evidence to support a model where overactive Wnt signals cause depletion of FCSCs and contribute to degeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: Therapeutic strategy to harness endogenous FCSCs to regenerate and repair cartilage.Healthy adult TMJ fibrocartilage exists under low metabolic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A reservoir of FCSCs resides in SZ niche, canonical Wnt signalling is controlled and -catenin is restricted to mature chondrocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During TMJ degeneration overactive Wnt signalling enhances chondrocyte maturation, depletes FCSC pool in SZ niche, and contributes to the pathological progression of degeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therapeutic application of exogenous canonical Wnt inhibitor maintains FCSC pool and repairs cartilage.Full size image', 'To further corroborate our findings, we show that treatment with exogenous canonical Wnt inhibitor SOST sustains FCSC pool and repairs cartilage using a rabbit TMJ injury model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the experimental rabbits exhibited little change in dietary intake and overall body mass, the biomechanical properties and bone phenotype of SOST-treated condyles were not evaluated in these present studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before the application of this regenerative strategy in humans, future studies using pre-clinical animal models are required to include long-term cartilage and bone phenotypic recovery and extensive biomechanical analyses to confirm that functional joint recovery is achieved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, we show for the first time the promise of Wnt modulation in endogenous FCSCs as a non-invasive therapeutic strategy that could be used to treat fibrocartilage disease or injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small molecule Wnt inhibition has also been used therapeutically to treat myocardial infarction64 and colon cancer47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The application of local small molecule Wnt inhibitors into fibrocartilage joint spaces offers a minimally invasive therapy following fibrocartilage injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strategy of injecting small molecules to manipulate endogenous FSCSs offers the advantages of bypassing invasive surgical interventions and minimizing the toxicity and side effects associated with the use of systemic drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although fibrocartilage tissues are inclusive of the TMJ condyle and disc, knee meniscus and intervertebral disc, the development, function, biomechanical properties and cellular and molecular phenotypes are quite different among each type of fibrocartilage tissue1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, it is likely that the stem/progenitor cell constituents making up these fibrocartilaginous tissues also vary in terms of behaviour, microenvironment niche and fate determination mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a one size fits all therapeutic template for exploiting resident FCSCs may not apply and therapies should be adjusted and optimized for each fibrocartilage tissue type accordingly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in the intervertebral disc the survival and maintenance of Tie2+GD2+ nucleus pulposus progenitor cells are dependent on angiopoietin-1 ligand56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in knee meniscus fibrocartilage, both CTGF and TGF3 are critical for meniscus regeneration16,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences in fibrocartilage tissue properties and cells bring to light the necessity of extensive characterization and analyses of tissue-specific fibrocartilage stem/progenitor cells to facilitate the development of effective and tailored regenerative approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our present study focusing on exploiting FCSCs in the TMJ raises the possibility of applying this therapeutic strategy to hyaline articular cartilage in other joints, such as the knee and hip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, unlike the TMJ, both knee and hip joints are load bearing and are not lined with fibrocartilaginous tissue3,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus it is likely that endogenous stem/progenitor cells would have to be recruited from other sites to repair hyaline articular cartilage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In corroboration of this idea, studies have shown that migratory chondro-progenitor cells (CPCs) are recruited to osteoarthritic cartilage via capillary ingrowth through tidemark breaks into the cartilage; however CPCs are only found in late-stage osteoarthritic cartilage after significant cartilage destruction has occurred17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, other studies have identified articular cartilage progenitor cells on the surface of knee articular cartilage65, but their cartilage regenerative capabilities have yet to undergo rigorous testing for translational applications66.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No studies to date have identified a population of stem cells in hyaline joint cartilage capable of spontaneously generating cartilage and bone with an organized HME when transplanted in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking into consideration the difficulty of identifying effective resident stem/progenitor cells for hyaline articular cartilage repair, it may be advantageous to test the ability of FCSC transplantation to repair hyaline cartilage defects in knee and hip joints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Taken together, we discover that resident stem cells in fibrocartilage localized within SZ niche in the TMJ condyle that possess potent chondrogenic and osteogenic potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also present a potential targeted therapeutic strategy for fibrocartilage degenerative disease, whereby regulation of canonical Wnt signals can sustain FCSC pool and maintain tissue homoeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies shed new light on the development of potential fibrocartilage therapies that exploit endogenous stem cells regenerative capabilities.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
