Structure sensitivity in the nonscalable regime explored via catalysed ethylene hydrogenation on supported platinum nanoclusters  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The sensitivity, or insensitivity, of catalysed reactions to catalyst structure is a commonly employed fundamental concept.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report on the nature of nano-catalysed ethylene hydrogenation, investigated through experiments on size-selected Ptn (n=815) clusters soft-landed on magnesia and first-principles simulations, yielding benchmark information about the validity of structure sensitivity/insensitivity at the bottom of the catalyst size range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both ethylene-hydrogenation-to-ethane and the parallel hydrogenationdehydrogenation ethylidyne-producing route are considered, uncovering that at the  less_than 1 nm size-scale the reaction exhibits characteristics consistent with structure sensitivity, in contrast to structure insensitivity found for larger particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The onset of catalysed hydrogenation occurs for Ptn (n10) clusters at T greater than 150 K, with maximum room temperature reactivity observed for Pt13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structure insensitivity, inherent for specific cluster sizes, is induced in the more active Pt13 by a temperature increase up to 400 K leading to ethylidyne formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control of sub-nanometre particle size may be used for tuning catalysed hydrogenation activity and selectivity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The classification and systematization1,2,3 of heterogeneously catalysed reactions as demanding or facile, with the former term describing dependence on catalyst particle size and the latter associated with reactions that are size invariant, has been a central guiding theme of research in heterogeneous catalysis for over half a century4,5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The early focus on particle size came from the realization that the fraction of atoms situated at a metal particles surface to the total number of metal atoms, sometimes termed the fraction of exposed atoms6 or degree of dispersion1, varies with particle size, approaching unity for very small particles (diameter 1 nm) and taking small values for large particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was recognized early, based on simple geometric (polyhedral) models (tetrahedral, octahedral, cuboctahedral and so on), that the above-mentioned size-related classification may be related to the size-dependent abundance of atomic configurations characterized by surface atoms with low coordination numbers (for example, edges or corners).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These under-coordinated atoms were expected to express varying proclivities for engaging in chemical reactions depending on the nature of the reactants and the ambient conditions1,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The advent and proliferation of atomic and molecular scale surface science preparation and characterization techniques in the 1970s focused on reactions catalysed on well-defined single-crystal model systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It then became customary (extending up to date) to classify heterogeneously catalysed reactions as structure sensitive or structure insensitive, corresponding to the aforementioned classifications of demanding and facile, in order to better describe the primary difference between these single-crystal model systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An example of a structure-sensitive reaction is ammonia synthesis through the reaction of nitrogen and hydrogen on iron single-crystal surfaces where the Fe(111) surface exhibits a higher turnover frequency (TOF) than Fe(100) or Fe(110)8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ethylene hydrogenation catalysed by platinum serves as an example of a structure-insensitive reaction, that is, no change in the TOF has been observed on different single-crystal planes9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter fundamental and technological important reaction stands out as the first reaction for which a catalytic mechanistic pathway has been formulated (the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, HP), and it forms the focus of our investigation in this paper10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The classification of the ethylene hydrogenation as structure insensitive is supported by decades of experimental work employing mostly surface science techniques for reactions taking place on well-characterized extended transition metal surface planes (see Supplementary Note 1 for details), or investigations on samples made of surface-supported distributions of relatively large metal particles with sizes ranging from 1.5 to 10 nm diameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although full understanding pertaining to the microscopic origins of the observed structure insensitivity is still lacking5,7,11,12, a commonly cited view holds that formation of carbonaceous species (in particular ethylidyne) in the course of the hydrogenation reaction, leads to saturation coverage (poisoning) of the metal surface that results in masking of structural features that could have otherwise brought about different reactivities, and/or alternative reactive outcomes, for surfaces showing different crystallography; that is, if not for the formation of poisonous carbonaceous species, metal surfaces with different crystallography (that is, different Miller indices) would have exhibited structure sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Metal particles with sizes reduced to the  less_than 1 nm in diameter range (containing 1020 atoms) may be viewed as quasi-zero-dimensional (0D) quantum dots, characterized by electronic quantum size effects13,14 and specific atomic organization motifs, that lead to the emergence of unique size-dependent physical and chemical properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regime, extrapolations from larger sizes using arguments relying on surface-to-volume ratios and scaling relations based on the enumeration of special sites (for example, corner and edge atoms) as a function of the size are not operative15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this size scalethat is, in the limit of ultimate dispersionwhere almost all of the atoms of the metal cluster are essentially surface atoms and where almost all the cluster atoms can be classified as under-coordinated (compared with the bulk), a new materials size regime is entered13,14,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Explorations of materials properties in this limiting reduced-size scale requires experiments and first-principles theoretical treatments with atom-by-atom resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is indeed the approach that we have taken in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "In quest of appraising the applicability of the fundamental concept of structure sensitivity/insensitivity to nanoscale catalysts, founded on the basis of observations made at larger size scales, we focus here on the hydrogenation of ethylene catalysed by size-selected platinum nanoclusters containing between 7 and 40 Pt atoms supported on an MgO(100)/Mo(100) surface, which is inactive for ethylene hydrogenation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As previously mentioned, ethylene hydrogenation serves often as a generic example of a structure insensitive reaction, obeying the parallel reactions selectivity criterion (PRSC)1, with the full-hydrogenation-to-ethane channel and the alternative half-hydrogenation-to-ethyl/dehydrogenation-to-ethylidyne pathway serving as the operative two parallel reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PRSC stipulates that: The best way to proceed is to choose a molecule reacting along two parallel paths and measure the selectivity defined as the rate of the two parallel reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the two products come from different adsorbed states requiring different surface structures, a change of selectivity with dispersion or mode of preparation of the metal may be found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most unequivocal case is when the specific activity for one of the parallel reactions changes from one catalyst to the next, whereas the specific activity for the other remains unchanged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our present experimental and theoretical studies of the ethylene hydrogenation reaction catalysed by nanoscale platinum clusters with atom-by-atom size-controlled resolution, joined with the first adaptation of the PRSC to nanoscale catalysts, provides, as elaborated below, benchmark results pertaining to the reaction's structure sensitivity/insensitivity at the bottom of the catalyst particle size range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in the case of larger catalyst particles, both the ethylene-hydrogenation-to-ethane channel and the parallel ethylidyne-producing, poisoning, route must be considered, culminating in the fundamental uncovering that at the ultimate  less_than 1 nm size scale, the ethylene hydrogenation reaction catalysed by supported platinum particles exhibits characteristics consistent with being a structure-sensitive reaction, in contrast to the accepted structure insensitivity of the reaction found for particles with a lower dispersion."  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Research plan', 'We begin with temperature programmed reaction (TPR) experiments, starting from the low temperature adsorption of the two reactants (H2 and C2H4) where all reaction pathways are quenched (except H2 dissociation which may occur spontaneously even at low temperatures, see Methods for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent measurement of the thermally desorbed species (reaction products and/or unreacted molecules), made at increased temperature, yields an effective hierarchical scan of the spectrum of activation energies operative in the catalysed reaction under study; for technical detail see Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that the MgO(100) thin film used in this study has been determined to be defect poor19,20,21 by a combined metastable impact electron spectroscopy (MIES) and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) study (see Methods and Supplementary Figs 24 for the spectroscopic and chemical characterization of the thin film).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the results of the above-mentioned characterizations lead us to conclude that the films prepared for the investigations described herein are essentially free of surface defects such as F-centres or other under-coordinated electron trapping sites, and that effects because of roughness, disorder effects, island formation and grain boundaries/corners/steps, are of no consequence (or below the detection limit) for the interpretation of the measurements and analysis presented in this paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The information obtained from these measurements is directly amenable to analysis and comparison with ab initio, first-principles, theoretical calculations (see Methods for details) that provide microscopic insights about the reaction mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To go beyond the above one-catalytic-cycle experiments, the reactivity of the size-selected Pt clusters is subsequently studied under isothermal, quasi-steady-state, conditions with the use of a pulsed molecular beam of ethylene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under such circumstances, all the reaction channels that open at temperatures up to the selected temperature of the experiment are operative, including parallel reaction paths that are potentially detrimental to the full hydrogenation of ethylene to ethane, namely the aforementioned coking reactions such as the one resulting in the formation of ethylidyne.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One-catalytic-cycle experiments', 'Representative cluster-TPR spectra depicted in Fig 1a and compared with one measured for a Pt(111) surface show negligible reactivity of the Pt9 cluster and ethane production for Pt10 and Pt13 peaking at 150 K, that is 100 K below the temperature measured for the extended Pt(111) surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates similar activation energies for clusters in this size range that are considerably lower than the one found for the reaction catalysed on the Pt(111) surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The integrated areas under the measured TPR curves, normalized to the number of atoms per cluster (Fig 1b) illustrate that the supported platinum clusters catalyse the formation of more ethane per Pt atom than the corresponding amount generated from the Pt(111) surface, with a maximum found for Pt13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, the temperature-dependent variation of the ethylene hydrogenation reactivity of the Ptn (n=9, 10 and 13) clusters as a function of their size and, in particular, the appearance of a threshold size (n=10) for onset of the catalytic activity, suggest that ethylene hydrogenation catalysed by Pt nanoclusters in the 1 nm size range falls under the classification of a size (structure)-sensitive reaction, in contrast to the commonly accepted structure insensitivity when catalysed by larger particles and extended surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As demonstrated below, this conjectured new classification in the sub-nanometre size range is indeed supported by measurement of TOFs manifesting size (structure) sensitivity under steady-state conditions at room temperature (300 K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: TPR of ethylene hydrogenation on Ptn clusters and Pt(111).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The

was determined from multiple measurements on a single cluster size.Full size image', 'Structures and reaction mechanisms from ab-initio calculations', 'In light of the above-observed size dependencies, it is evident that uncovering the atomic-arrangement motifs of the sub-nanometre-size supported Pt cluster catalysts is imperative to advancing our understanding of the physical principles underlying the above-noted apparent structural sensitivity of the catalysed reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The development and implementation of efficient and practical optimization strategies (global optimization in particular22) is a vexing problem of great importance in diverse fields, including the physical sciences, where we mention continuing efforts in the areas of protein folding, and the atomic arrangements in biomolecules, clusters and crystals23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A main difficulty in this area originates from the fact that the global extremum of a real multivariate function (for example, the total potential energy of an atomic cluster as a function of the locations of the atoms) is actually a local property, thus requiring an exhaustive search.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, a large number of diverse methods for global structure optimizations have been proposed (see, for example, refs 22, 24 and citations therein).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although significant progress has been achieved, proving that the global extremum has indeed been found seems to be a rather unattainable task for most systems of interest22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The optimal (lowest-energy) structures of the surface-supported Pt9, Pt10 and Pt13 clusters determined through first-principles calculations (based on extensive searches, guided by cluster structural motifs gathered for other systems and by previously proposed search methodologies24) are displayed in Fig 2 as well as in Supplementary Figs 715.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is evident that these clusters prefer a three-dimensional (3D) prismatic two-layer structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we observe that these adsorbed clusters possess a large number of higher-energy isomeric structures (with the preferred ones having 3D geometries), reflecting the complex nature of their potential energy surface; see in particular the extensive rich spectra of structural isomers in Supplementary Figs 713.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we focus in the following on the lowest-energy clusters, it is possible that some higher-energy isomers are also present on the supporting surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure

image', 'It is pertinent to remark here that the optimal (minimum total energy) configurations, as well as those of the higher-energy isomers, were determined through unconstrained relaxation of the atomic positions in conjunction with density functional calculations of the total energy (see Methods for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bare clusters were positioned on the MgO(100) surface, and their configurations, together with the positions of the atoms of the underlying Mg(100) substrate, were optimized via unconstrained relaxations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once the optimal cluster structures have been determined, the binding (adsorption) energies and atomic positions of the reactants (that is, the individual H2 and C2H4 molecules, as well as multiply adsorbed, and co-adsorbed, systems) were determined through total energy minimization; similarly, in determination of the reaction path, the degrees of freedom of all atoms of the system (substrate, cluster and reactants) have been relaxed except for the very few describing the chosen reaction coordinate (for example, the distance, or combination of distances, between atoms of the reactants), which is varied in a stepwise manner (recording the total energy change along the change in the reaction coordinate yields the reaction energy profile and the activation barrier for the reaction (see Methods for details)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The relaxation procedure described above allows for adsorbate/reactant-induced structural relaxations of the underlying metal cluster and metal-oxide (MgO(100)) substrate; this form of adsorbate-induced cluster-catalyst relaxation (Supplementary Fig 16 where inter-isomer structural crossover is shown) is a manifestation of a more general class of cluster relaxation processes termed fluxionality14,18, which includes also cluster relaxation in the course of a chemical reaction, named dynamical reaction-induced cluster fluxionality18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By considering systematically only relaxed configurations, the size-dependent fluxional propensity of clusters in the size regime studied here becomes one of the characteristics that determine the response of the clusters to the presence of reactants and intermediates (for example, ethylidyne) and the consequent size-dependent reactivities and the course of reactions catalysed by these clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, in addition to being of physical significance in the description of the mechanisms of cluster-catalysed reactions, the inter-isomer structural conversion shown in Supplementary Fig 16 illustrates the use of the dynamical reaction-induced cluster fluxionality as a method for uncovering structural isomers; in fact, it has been used by us to discover the ground-state structure of the metal cluster in Pt13/MgO (see Fig 2e,f and Supplementary Figs 11 and 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The spin state of the bare-adsorbed Pt clusters is N-N=2 (where Ns is the number of electrons with spin s= or ), and they are found, through total charge differences (calculated before and after adsorption and shown in Fig 2a,c,e and Bader charge analysis (BCA, see Fig 2b,d,f and Supplementary Figs 14 and 15)), to be negatively charged with the total excess Bader electronic charges on the adsorbed cluster being: BPtn/MgO=1.68 e, 1.78 e and 1.92 e for n=9, 10 and 13, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that whereas the total excess electronic charges on the n=9 and 10 clusters are quite similar, close to a third (0.51e) of BPt10/MgO is located for the Pt10 cluster on the capping atom (the 10th atom in Fig 2d); similarly, a large contribution to BPt13/MgO is also found on the capping atom (the first atom (marked 1) of Pt13, shown in Fig 2f, which is found to have an excess local charge of 0.34 e out of a total of 1.92 e, with the atoms marked 7 having also a large excess charge of 0.36 (Supplementary Fig 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the Pt10 cluster, this excess charge distribution leaves a smaller amount of excess charge (1.78 e 0.51 e=1.27 e) to be distributed over the remaining nine atoms of the Pt10 cluster in comparison with the total excess charge (1.68 e) available for distribution over the compact (no capping atom) Pt9 triangular prism cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This smaller amount of negative excess charge on most of the atoms of the Pt10 cluster compared with the Pt9 case, are found to influence binding sites, adsorption energies and consequent reaction pathways on the adsorbed clusters as well as demonstrating that, in this size-range, even the addition of a single atom, while not changing the basic geometric structure, can drastically alter the electronic properties of a cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous investigations (see review in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7) identified two adsorption modes of ethylene on the (111) surface of platinum, the  and di- modes, where in the former the ethylene is thought to coordinate to a single Pt atom through a  bond, with the ethylene maintaining (at least to a large extent) sp2 hybridization, and in the latter the adsorbed molecule is attached to two adjacent Pt atoms (in a 2 manner) through two  bonds showing a significant extent of sp3 hybridization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the extended Pt(111) surface, the -bonded ethylene was found to be the preferred adsorption configuration only at very low temperatures, whereas for T=100240 K di- ethylene is preferred under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, with ethylidyne forming at higher temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All the theoretical computational studies25 corroborated the experimentally observed preference for di- over the  ethylene absorption mode, whereas the weakly adsorbed -bonded species is experimentally believed to be the main reactant during hydrogenation of ethylene9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Contrary to extended surfaces, for the magnesia-supported Ptn (n9) clusters, we find essentially the same propensity for adsorption in the  or di- mode, with the corresponding vertical desorption energies (VDEs) of the C2H4 molecules (co-adsorbed with a dissociated H2 molecule in neighbouring sites) calculated to be VDE=1.13 eV and 0.93 eV for the  and di- modes, respectively (see Figs 2g,h and 3a,b for details); note, in particular, the much higher value of the desorption energy for the -bonded molecule compared with the corresponding calculated (0.87 eV (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25) and measured (0.41±0.10 eV (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26) values on the Pt(111) surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the -bonded molecule (see Figs 2g and 3a for adsorption on Pt10/MgO)) has a CC bond length d(CC)=1.425 Å, which is close to the experimental value of 1.41 Å (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27) this value is somewhat larger than d(CC)=1.334 Å value found in the isolated C2H4 molecule, indicating a certain degree of sp3 rehybridization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the di- adsorbed ethylene molecule, we find evidence for a larger degree of sp3 hybridization, with d(CC)=1.469 Å, which is closer to the value found in the isolated C2H6 molecule (d(CC)=1.528 Å).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were found by us for the two adsorption modes of ethylene on the supported Pt13 cluster (see the -bonded adsorption configuration, marked 0, with VDE=1.54 eV in Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The charge redistributions for both ethylene adsorption modes reflect the frontier orbital interactions leading to ethylene chemisorption, described by the DewarChattDuncanson model28,29 (see also Supplementary Note 2), involving electron donation from the highest occupied () ethylene orbital into an empty d orbital of the metal, and back-donation from the filled Pt d-orbitals into the ethylene lowest unoccupied (antibonding) * orbital.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting electron charge isosurfaces (see right panels in Fig 2g,h) portray the resulting redistribution of the electron density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the above bonding processes as well as the repulsive interactions between the filled frontier orbitals of ethylene and occupied d-states of the metal catalyst particle (termed as Pauli30,31 or four-electron repulsion32) depend on: (i) coordination of atoms making up the Pt particle, with reduced coordination, such as at edge and corner atoms, resulting in decreased repulsion, and (ii) occupation of metal d-states (with the Pauli repulsive interaction between filled orbitals of the metal cluster and the adsorbate increasing at cluster sites having larger excess electron charge); site-coordination and charging patterns can be ascertained from the calculated information given in Fig 2af, and similar considerations apply also to the catalysed ethylene hydrogenation mechanism discussed below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, it is pertinent to recall here our systematic study33 of the effect of charging by clustersubstrate interactions on the adsorption and low-temperature combustion reaction of carbon monoxide and dioxygen, catalysed by MgO-supported gold clusters of sizes similar to those considered in the current investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Calculated first-principles steered reaction pathways

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The investigations discussed in this paper demonstrate that classification of a reaction as structure sensitive, or insensitive, must be reassessed for materials with sizes in the non-scalable sub-nanometre size regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This size range has been shown to exhibit surface chemical properties, which can be modulated by a single atom, and where each particle size displays its own mode of behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The previously reported structure insensitivity of ethylene hydrogenation on Pt is shown here to be untenable in the cluster size range of Pt7Pt40, where we find structure sensitivity of ethylene hydrogenation to emerge, with maximum reactivity for Pt13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structure-insensitive behaviour was observed to be inherent for specific cluster sizes at ambient temperatures and can be induced in the more active sizes (for example, Pt13) by an increase in reaction temperature, which opens dehydrogenation reaction channels leading to the formation of carbonaceous species evidenced in the infrared spectra and predicted by first-principles calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aside from addressing the applicability, at this size range, of common catalyst classification as structure sensitive or insensitive, our findings point to the possibility of controlling the activity and selectivity of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions catalysed by clusters of these sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We remark that rather than treating an industrial hydrogenation catalyst under industrial conditions, we focus here, with the use of model catalysts of nanoscale dimensions, on a basic science question of great interest in the field of heterogeneous catalysis pertaining to the concept of structure sensitivity/insensitivity at the bottom of the catalyst size scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the catalyst cluster sizes considered here, the reaction is investigated in a temperature range lying mostly below, and up to, room temperature (with certain thermal treatment involving temporal heating to 400 K), which is lower than the temperatures used in typical industrial catalytic hydrogenation applications; the finding that nanocluster catalysts (particularly made of noble metals) catalyse reactions at temperatures significantly lower than larger clusters and extended surfaces made of these metals is rather common now (see, for example, refs 13, 14, 19, 20, 44, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correspondingly, the temperature-window selectivity and thermal-tuning that we discuss and demonstrate are operative, and are kinetically relevant, for these nanocatalysts under the above-specified temperature conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This also suggests that in conjunction with future employment of nanocatalysts in industrial-type processes, the concept of temperature selectivity/tuning windows, discussed in this work from a basic science perspective, may emerge also as one of practical relevance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the non-scalable size regime, the above findings make element-specific generalizations of catalytic properties, based on single crystals and nanoparticles, rather questionable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first-principles simulations show that even similar atomic geometric arrangements can lead to widely differing physical and chemical properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, each reaction must be individually tested in an atom-by-atom, size-selective, manner, in order to disentangle and reveal the catalytic properties of such systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of structure (in)sensitivity has been a most useful concept for the description and systematization of catalytic processes on single crystals and particles possessing well-defined single-crystal facets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, with decreasing particle sizes (that is, for higher dispersion), and in particular in the sub-nanometre size regime, extrapolations from systems of larger size are likely to become inadequate, requiring instead an atom-by-atom reassessment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In closing, the results that we reported here demonstrate that hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions can be controlled and tuned by controlling the precise atomic size of the catalyst particle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has implications for a broad range of chemical processes46 ranging from chemical synthesis, to food chemistry, and energy applications, where the insight garnered here, as well as future investigations along these lines, could facilitate a deeper understanding of applied reaction systems, and may offer design strategies for catalysts with enhanced activity and/or selectivity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

see also predicted thickness-dependent reactivities, where the catalytic activity of deposited metal clusters was predicted to depend on the thickness of the underlying metal-oxide film adsorbed on a metal substrate58,59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has been verified experimentally in later reactivity studies of gold nanoclusters supported on MgO films of variable thicknesses20 and most convincingly through work function measurements60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The above-mentioned prediction and experimental verifications justify the procedure used in our calculations, where no effect of the underlying Mo substrate on the charging behaviour at the MgO/Pt nanocluster interface is considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The optimal (minimum total energy) configurations were determined (through unconstrained relaxation of the atomic positions, using a conjugate gradient search) when the calculated energy converged within 0.001 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bare clusters were positioned on the MgO(100) surface, and their configuration, together with the positions of the atoms of the underlying substrate, was optimized via unconstrained relaxations as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculational supercell, which included the MgO(100) slab and a 24-Å-thick vacuum region, was periodically replicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once the optimal cluster structures have been determined the binding (adsorption) energies and atomic positions of the reactants (that is, the individual H2 and C2H4 molecules, as well as multiply adsorbed, and co-adsorbed, systems) were determined through total energy minimization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This relaxation procedure allows for adsorbate/reactant-induced structural relaxations of the underlying metal cluster and metal-oxide (MgO(100) substrate; this form of adsorbate-induced cluster-catalyst relaxation (illustrated in Supplementary Fig 16) is a manifestation of a more general class of cluster relaxation processes termed fluxionality18, which includes also dynamical reaction-induced cluster fluxionality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the first-principles calculations of the reaction profiles (pathways), a reaction coordinate was judiciously chosen; typically, the reaction coordinate consists of the distance between two atoms of the reactant molecules (for example, an adsorbed H atom of a dissociated hydrogen molecule and the C atom of a reacting ethylene molecule); the reaction coordinate can in general be a combination of geometrical parameters (interatomic distances and/or angles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each value of the reaction coordinate, the total energy of the system, calculated with density functional theory (DFT) was optimized through unconstrained relaxation of all of the other degrees of freedom of the system (reactants, other adsorbents, Pt cluster atoms and MgO slab atoms atoms).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction profiles (reaction paths) were obtained via repeating such calculations for a sequence of values of the chosen reaction coordinate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These calculations yield results that are the same as, or very close to, those obtained by other methods, for example, the nudged elastic band and variants thereof; see the ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is pertinent to note here that the structural relaxation following reactant adsorption and subsequent to each reaction step (using a conjugate gradient method) allows for distortions of the combined system (underlying support surface, adsorbed cluster and reactants) and leads to certain adsorption and reactioninduced structural rearrangements; for example, in some cases it can bring about transformation of the cluster geometry to a different structural isomeric form, as in the aforementioned example of dynamical reaction-induced cluster fluxionality (Supplementary Fig 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Global modifications of the structural motif of the adsorbed cluster/adsorbate system involve prohibitive activation energy barriers and are unlikely to occur as these transformations would be kinetically non-viable, particularly for the adsorption and reaction conditions considered in our studies that involve relatively low temperatures, ranging from below room temperature up to 400 K. Consequently, for kinetic reasons, it appears that relaxations involving local minima of the free-energy landscape of the combined catalytic system (rather than the global ones) are more effective here in steering the reaction pathway and determining the catalysed reaction barriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'All the aforementioned first-principles electronic structure calculations employed the DFT method as implemented in the VASP-DFT package, using a plane-wave basis with a kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV, projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials61 and the Perdew, Burke & Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation for the exchange-correlation potential62,63,64,65,66.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  - point sampling of the Brillouin zone was used.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
