Transient auditory nerve demyelination as a new mechanism for hidden hearing loss  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Hidden hearing loss (HHL) is a recently described auditory neuropathy believed to contribute to speech discrimination and intelligibility deficits in people with normal audiological tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals and humans with HHL have normal auditory thresholds but defective cochlear neurotransmission, that is, reduced suprathreshold amplitude of the sound-evoked auditory nerve compound action potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, the only cellular mechanism known for HHL is loss of inner hair cell synapses (synaptopathy).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that transient loss of cochlear Schwann cells results in permanent auditory deficits characteristic of HHL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This auditory neuropathy is not associated with synaptic loss, but rather with disruption of the first heminodes at the auditory nerve peripheral terminal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this study identifies a new mechanism for HHL, highlights the long-term consequences of transient Schwann cell loss on hearing and might provide insights into the causes of the auditory deficits reported in patients that recover from acute demyelinating diseases such as GuillainBarré syndrome.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In the mammalian cochlea, acoustic stimuli are detected by inner hair cells (IHCs), which transduce and transform them into synaptic signals to the primary auditory sensory neurons, the spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These neurons then relay the acoustic information to the central auditory circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, proper function of both sensory cells and neurons is essential for normal hearing and auditory communication, and degeneration of either component causes sensorineural hearing loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This type of hearing loss, which affects 320 million people worldwide1, is characterized by permanent elevation of auditory thresholds, that is, the minimal sound pressure levels (SPLs) that evoke an auditory or neural response at specific sound frequencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Until recently, it was believed that auditory processing is normal in subjects with normal thresholds, even after recovery from a temporary threshold shift (TTS) due to noise exposure, and that hearing deficits in those cases were due to central problems2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recent animal and human studies indicate that moderate noise exposures or ageing can result in a new form of peripheral hearing loss called hidden hearing loss (HHL)3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HHL can be detected physiologically and is characterized by normal auditory thresholds but reduced suprathreshold amplitude of the sound-evoked SGN compound action potential (AP) (the first peak of the auditory brainstem response (ABR) waveform)3,5,6,7,8, and by the alteration in the ratio between the peak of the ABR waveform generated by hair cells (summating potential (SP)) and the peak I of the ABR waveform (AP)9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduced neuronal activation seen in HHL has been proposed to result in degradation of the temporal coding of suprathreshold sounds and deficits in speech discrimination and intelligibility, particularly in a noisy environment10,11; however, the latter are not diagnostic of HHL, as they could be also caused by central processing deficits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HHL has been proposed to lead to hyperactivation of central auditory synapses, thus possibly contributing to tinnitus3,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Until now, loss or dysfunction of IHC synapses has been the only proposed mechanism of HHL13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report an additional cellular mechanism for HHL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the cochlea, sensory hair cells and neurons are in close association with several types of glial and glia-like cells14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hair cells are surrounded by supporting cells, SGN axons are myelinated by Schwann cells and spiral ganglion cell bodies are wrapped by satellite cells (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In prior studies we explored the roles of supporting cells in IHC synapse formation and regeneration15 and in the preservation of hair cells16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As part of our ongoing efforts to define the roles the different populations of cochlear glia play in hearing and deafness15,16,17, we investigated the consequences of Schwann cell ablation in the mature cochlea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that acute Schwann cell loss causes rapid auditory nerve demyelination, which is followed by robust Schwann cell regeneration and axonal remyelination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, this transient Schwann cell loss results in a permanent auditory impairment characteristic of HHL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this HHL differs from that seen after noise exposure or ageing in that it occurs without alterations in synaptic density but rather correlates with a specific and permanent disruptions of the first heminodes at the auditory nerve axon close to the IHCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the two types of HHL occur independently (noise exposures that cause HHL do not disrupt heminodes) and they are additive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results uncover a new mechanism for the pathogenesis of HHL and a new consequence of myelin defects on the normal function of the nervous system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1:

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Ablation and regeneration of Schwann cells in mature cochlea', 'To test the consequence of Schwann and satellite cell ablation on the cochlea, we used conditional expression of diphtheria toxin fragment A (DTA) in proteolipid protein 1 (Plp1)-expressing cells at P21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strategy was based on the pattern of Plp1 promoter activity in the postnatal cochlea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1, in the neonatal mouse cochlea (P1P15) Plp1 is expressed by Schwann cells, satellite cells, as well as inner phalangeal and inner border cells (IPhC/IBCs), the supporting cells surrounding IHCs18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, by P21 Plp1 promoter activity in IPhC/IBCs is undetectable (Fig 1ae), while is maintained in Schwann cells along the auditory nerve fibres (ANFs) located at the osseous spiral lamina (OSL) (Fig 1a,fi) and satellite cells surrounding the cell bodies of SGNs in Rosenthals canal (Fig 1a,jm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As anticipated from prior studies of mice with DTA-induced ablation of Plp1-expressing cells19, tamoxifen intraperitoneal (i.p.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection to mice carrying Plp1/CreERT transgene and Rosa26DTA alleles DTA(+/):Plp1/Cre(+/) from P21 to 23 resulted in uncoordinated gait and hind-limb paralysis between 1 and 2 weeks post DTA expression followed by complete recovery of normal gait by 34 weeks post DTA expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the robust regenerative capacity of Plp1-expressing glia cells19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, although DTA induction at P35 results in significant mortality 3 weeks later (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19 and our unpublished data), we found that ablation of Plp1-expressing cells at P21 does not result in lethality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that the health effects of loss of Plp1+ cells increase with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Based on the findings described in Fig 1, we anticipated that tamoxifen treatment of DTA(+/)/PlpCre1(+/) mice from P21 to P23 would ablate Schwann and satellite cells without affecting the supporting cells in the organ of Corti.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, immunostaining of cochlear whole mounts with the Schwann cell marker Sox10 or myelin basic protein (MBP) showed that DTA transgene activation at P21 results in robust ablation of Schwann cells along the ANFs within 1 week after tamoxifen injection (Supplementary Fig 1ad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, IPhC/IBCs, which are labelled by Sox2 or GLAST, are spared from DTA-mediated ablation at this age (Supplementary Fig 1e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this model in hand, we analysed the effects of the Schwann cell loss on cochlear structure and function at different intervals, from 1 week to 1 year after induction of Schwann cell ablation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Studies of other peripheral nerves have demonstrated that demyelination and Schwann cell loss is usually followed by extensive proliferation of undifferentiated Schwann cells, which repopulate and remyelinate the nerves20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, analysis of 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation showed that 1 week after DTA transgene activation, the auditory nerves of mice with Schwann cell ablation display a dramatic increase in the number of EdU+ cells (Fig 2c,d) compared with controls (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, lineage tracing with an inducible tdTomato reporter in DTA(+/):tdTomato(+/):Plp1/Cre(+/) mice revealed that these EdU-positive cells are generated by Plp1-expressing cells that most probably escaped DTA-mediated ablation (Fig 2eh), that is, Schwann cells in which recombination occurred in the Rosa26tdTomato allele but not in the Rosa26DTA allele.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further analysis showed that the surviving tdTomato+ cells 1 week post induction (Fig 2i,j) repopulate the OSL to levels similar to that of controls by 1 month post induction (Fig 2k,l).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Schwann cells in the auditory nerve regenerate within weeks after DTA

image', 'Similar robust regeneration was observed for satellite cells (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although satellite cells are clearly lost 1 week post induction (Supplementary Fig 2a,b), they repopulate within 2 weeks post induction in DTA(+/):Plp1/eGFP(+/):Plp1/Cre(+/) cochlea (Supplementary Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plastic sections of Rosenthals canal 16 weeks post induction show that both the SGN cell body density (Supplementary Fig 2eg) and the percentage of SGN cell bodies wrapped by satellite cells (Supplementary Fig 2e,f,h) are similar in DTA(+/):Plp1/Cre(+/) and control cochlea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results indicate that cochlear Schwann and satellite cells spontaneously and robustly repopulate after DTA-mediated ablation in the mature cochlea, and that Schwann cell regeneration is at least partly mediated by proliferation of the surviving Schwann cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Schwann cell regeneration and remyelination of SGN axons', 'In models of axon injury or demyelinating neuropathy, damaged Schwann cells regenerate and re-myelinate axons20,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore examined the consequence of DTA-induced Schwann cell ablation on ANF myelin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DTA expression resulted in acute demyelination of the ANFs within 1 week post induction (Fig 3a,b), consistent with loss of Schwann cell markers at this time point (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 4 weeks post induction, when Schwann cells have repopulated (Fig 2i,j), we observed significant yet incomplete remyelination (Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By 16 weeks post induction, myelinated axon density completely recovered in DTA(+/):Plp1/Cre(+/) cochleas (Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, at 16 weeks post induction, axons from DTA(+/):Plp1/Cre(+/) cochleas had normal axon diameters (Fig 3c,e,g) and myelin thickness (Fig 3d,f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that acute Schwann cell ablation results in rapid cell regeneration followed by remarkable remyelination, leading to fibres with normal axon caliber and myelin thickness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Transient Schwann cell ablation causes acute demyelination followed by

demyelinating neuropathies such as acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, given the dramatic demyelination we observed in ANFs on activation of the DTA transgene, we anticipated that mice would display significant hearing abnormalities soon after induction, and that these defects would resolve within 4 months as the nerve remyelinated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, thresholds for the ABR and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE), which reflect the function of IHCs and outer hair cells, respectively, were not affected by the lack of myelin in ANFs (Supplementary Fig 3a,b), indicating that these mice were audiologically normal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the suprathreshold amplitudes of the ABR peak 1 (P1 amplitudes), which represent the summed activity of the SGNs, were significantly reduced (Fig 4a and Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the suprathreshold latencies and widths of the ABR peak 1, which reflect in part the conduction velocity of the auditory nerve, were both severely affected (Fig 4b,c and Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, mice with DTA-induced Schwann cell ablation have increased P1 latencies (Fig 4b and Supplementary Fig 5) and P1 widths (Fig 4c) at all cochlear frequencies examined (5.632 kHz).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, the effects of Schwann cell ablation on P1 amplitudes, latencies and widths do not reverse even 16 weeks post induction, when Schwann cells and myelin have regenerated (Figs 2 and 3 and Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further support to the conclusion that the transient demyelination results in HHL was provided by analysis of the SP/AP ratios (amplitudes of SP/amplitudes of AP) (Fig 5a), which can be used as a differential diagnosis for HHL in both mice and humans5,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transient Schwann cell ablation did not affect SP at all time points (Fig 5b), further demonstrating that Schwann cell loss did not alter hair cell function (Supplementary Figs 1 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, peak 1 AP amplitudes in

without affecting heminodes', 'Exposure of rodents to noise levels higher than those that induce TTSs and HHL (110 versus 98 dB SPL) results in permanent hearing loss (permanent threshold shifts) and central auditory demyelination32, raising the possibility that exposure to noise that induce TTS and HHL could also affect auditory nerve nodal structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we generated HHL in wild-type mice by exposing them to an octave-band noise (816 kHz, 98 dB SPL for 2 h)4,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two weeks after noise exposure, both ABR and DPOAE thresholds had recovered (Supplementary

significantly affected by noise exposure (Supplementary Fig 8d), whereas ribbon synapse loss was evident at 32 kHz but not 11.3 kHz, consistent with a high-frequency HHL due to synaptopathy (Supplementary Fig 8ei).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the heminodes at the HP appeared normal (Supplementary Fig 8jm), suggesting that exposure to synaptopathic noise does not alter nodal organization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Noise- and demyelination-induced HHL are additive', 'The results described above indicate that two different types of HHL exist: one caused by noise and involving synaptopathy, and the other caused by transient Schwann cell loss and involving nodal disruption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether these two forms of HHL interact, we subjected mice that had undergone demyelination (DTA(+/):Plp1/Cre(+/)) at 3 weeks of age and their control counterparts (DTA(+/) mice) to noise exposure that causes synaptopathy at 8 weeks of age, and analysed their auditory function 2 weeks later (Fig 9a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown above, 4 weeks after DTA-mediated Schwann cell ablation mice displayed HHL involving alterations in ABR Peak 1 amplitude and latency (Fig 9bd), which persisted even after noise exposure (Fig 9eg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, noise exposure induced further decrease in ABR Peak 1 amplitudes beyond the one produced by demyelination (Fig 9hj) and the magnitudes of the shift in amplitudes were the same as in mice that had no demyelination (Fig 9kp).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, ABR P1 latencies remained unaffected after noise exposure in both demyelinated and control mice, indicating that the noise produced the same type of pathology independent of the prior demyelination (Fig 9j,m,p).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicate that exposure to synaptopathic noise causes additional degradation of neural output from the cochlea even when mice already suffer from HHL caused by transient Schwann cell loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, HHL caused by

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Myelination of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is important for normal conduction of APs and synchronized transmission of neural impulses35,36, and damage to peripheral axons and their myelin sheaths causes many forms of peripheral neuropathy, such as CMT disease and GuillainBarré syndrome (GBS)37,38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we uncover a new consequence of myelin pathology; that is, that transient Schwann cell loss results in permanent disruption of the cochlear heminodal structure and organization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also discover that such disruption causes auditory neuropathy and HHL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Both cochlear type I afferents (SGNs) and medial olivocochlear efferents are myelinated32; however, it is unlikely that the auditory deficits we found after transient Schwann cell ablation are caused by damage to cochlear efferent nerves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, sound-evoked medial olivocochlear activity is greatly depressed by anaesthesia during physiological recordings, thus should contribute little to our measurements of ABR amplitudes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, complete lesion of cochlear efferent nerves fails to impair ABR peak 1 latencies (Maison et al.40 and Liberman M.C., personal communications), further arguing against possible contribution of efferent nerves towards the auditory deficits observed in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The bipolar SGNs form point-to-point connections between the sensory hair cells and neurons in the cochlear nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the SGN peripheral processes, the unmyelinated afferent terminals are tightly coupled to the ribbon synapses, whereas the myelinated axons extend from the HP to the SGN somata (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once the central SGN process enters the central nervous system (CNS), it becomes myelinated by oligodendrocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a mouse model of demyelination that results in loss of both Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system and oligodendrocytes in the CNS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our physiological techniques allow us to study cochlear function without confounding issues from CNS demyelination by specifically analysing ABR peak 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown both experimentally and computationally that ABR peak 1 is solely contributed by the IHCs and SGNs41,42, which are myelinated by Schwann cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the first heminode at the HP formed by Schwann cells is believed to be the initial spike generator of the SGNs28,29,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, it has been shown that in this mouse model CNS neurons remyelinate robustly and recover function after DTA-mediated oligodendrocyte ablation19, further excluding the involvement of central auditory components in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the physiological changes we observed after Schwann cell ablation are most likely due to alterations in the peripheral auditory components, that is, SGN synaptic terminal, axon or somata myelination or neuronal survival (refer to Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Synaptic dysfunction is known to result in defects in SGN neural amplitudes and latencies6,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, synaptic density was not affected by Schwann cell ablation and demyelination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we did not examine whether synapses were transiently disrupted, it is unlikely to be that transient synaptopathy, if it occurred, could contribute to the persistent pathophysiology, as we have shown that when synapses regenerate after acute loss the auditory deficits recover as well15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with the nerve terminals, the SGN cell bodies were also unaffected after transient loss of Schwann and satellite cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Satellite cells express glutamine synthetase for converting ammonia and glutamate to glutamine45, which is important for metabolizing excess glutamate and preventing excitotoxicity46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Satellite cells are also important for neuronal survival as knockout of sapB from these cells resulted in progressive neuronal death47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complete regeneration of the spiral ganglion satellite cells in our study is consistent with the remarkable spontaneous proliferation and regeneration of satellite cells in other sensory ganglia48,49,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Timely regeneration of the satellite cells and wrapping on SGN cell bodies may be important to preserve the survival and function of the SGNs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In animal models of central and peripheral demyelinating diseases, many axons remyelinate but with significantly thinner myelin sheaths and shorter internodal lengths51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, after transient Schwann cell loss and massive axonal demyelination in response to DTA expression, we observed complete remyelination of ANFs at the OSL featuring normal myelin thickness and nodal density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth noting that DTA induction results in damage to the myelinating glial cells without directly injuring their associated neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in other animal models of demyelinating disorders axons may also be injured, for example, by nerve crush or inflammation53,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that intact axons, but not injured ones, are capable of providing both physical and chemical cues sufficient for normal remyelination55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings are consistent with a previous report in which complete remyelination was observed in sciatic nerve after selective ablation of myelinating glial cells56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent report shows that in the CNS, remyelination and normal nodal length can be completely restored on small caliber axons, suggesting that complete myelin recovery may be dependent on axon caliber57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, an alternative scenario is that complete remyelination of the ANFs can be attributed to their smaller axon caliber (1.5 m diameter) compared with other peripheral nervous system axons, such as ventral roots and quadriceps nerves ( greater than 3 m diameter)58,59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Analysis of node of Ranvier markers indicated specific and persistent disruption of the heminodes at the HP, but with complete recovery of nodes along the axonal tracts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emerging evidence indicates that AP generation in the auditory nerve occurs at the heminode28,29,43 and the clustering of mature heminodes may be important for tight coupling of IHC synaptic transmission and ANF spike generation29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peak 1 of the ABR waveform, which reflects the gross ANF discharge, relies on concerted nerve conduction from the unmyelinated nerve terminals (inner spiral plexus), the heminodes (the spike generator) and the nodes of Ranvier29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inner spiral plexus is unlikely to be involved in the observed pathophysiology, because the precisely timed short-latency nerve conduction is ensured by multiple mechanisms43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complete recovery of nodes of Ranvier also precludes their contributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the highly clustered heminodes allow generation of synchronized AP spikes in multiple unisynaptic ANFs28,29,43, we propose that AP dyssynchronization resulting from heminodal disruption is the main contributor to the loss of temporal resolution in the waveform and therefore to the deterioration of peak 1 amplitude, latency and width.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The postsynaptic heminodes are typically clustered about 20 m away from the IHC synaptic zone and are enriched in ion channels28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies indicate that these structural and molecular features of auditory nerve nodes and heminodes mature after the onset of hearing in rats29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, during the early postnatal ages ( less_than P17), the immature heminodes lack Kv1.1 channels and are irregularly positioned along individual axons with about 60 m spread from the HP29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the pathological heminodes observed in this study closely resembled those seen before hearing onset29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it appears that during the process of Schwann cell regeneration, remyelination of ANFs follows a path similar to the one taking place during early postnatal development, but remyelination and heminode maturation at the HP fail to proceed, possibly due to either the presence of inhibitory signals in the mature cochlea or lack of promoting factors that are present during development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As heminodes and nodes share similar molecular microdomain structure28,29 and nodes of Ranvier recovere completely, the observed nodal pathology is likely to be due to the physicalchemical micro-environments at the HP, rather than a generic axoglial signal guiding the nodal assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'HHL has emerged as a major health concern13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HHL is defined and diagnosed by abnormal ABR amplitudes and latencies but normal thresholds9,10,11, thus undetectable by standard audiometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subjects with this type of hearing loss may have difficulties in speech discrimination and temporal processing, particularly in a noisy environment13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Until now, synaptic loss or cochlear synaptopathy resulting from either noise exposure or ageing was the only known cause of HHL5,6 and exploration of therapeutic approaches for HHL has been focused on repairing synapses15,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings indicate that HHL can also arise from pathologies of cochlear Schwann cell (schwannopathy) or nodal structures (nodopathy), rather than synaptopathy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, some patients with demyelinating disorders such as CMT disease and GBS have auditory deficits, associated with reduced ABR amplitudes and increased latencies60,61,62,63,64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our animal model shares mechanistic similarities with GBS, where Schwann cells are specifically and transiently damaged52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings that Schwann cell ablation does not affect ABR or DPOAE thresholds are consistent with rare reports of hearing threshold elevations in GBS patients63,64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, in those patients who suffered acute hearing loss, although hearing threshold gradually recovered, their ABR waveforms showed persistent increase in latency62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, an even greater proportion of GBS patients may have HHL that has not been diagnosed clinically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the growing prevalence of Zika infections, which has been shown to correlate with an increase in GBS patients worldwide65,66, the prevalence of HHL related to acute peripheral demyelinating disorders is likely to increase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the cochlear neuropathy revealed in our animal model may have clinical implications in diagnosis and eventual treatment of the different types of HHL.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
