Stabilization of p21 by mTORC1/4E-BP1 predicts clinical outcome of head and neck cancers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The levels, regulation and prognostic value of p21 in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) has been puzzling for years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report a new mechanism of regulation of p21 by the mTORC1/4E-BP1 pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that non-phosphorylated 4E-BP1 interacts with p21 and induces its degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, hyper-activation of mTORC1 results in phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and stabilization of p21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In HNSCC, p21 levels strongly correlate with mTORC1 activity but not with p53 status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, clinical data indicate that HNSCC patients with p21 and phospho-S6-double-positive tumours present a better disease-specific survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that over-activation of the mTORC1/4E-BP1/p21 pathway is a frequent and clinically relevant alteration in HNSCC.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Progression through the cell cycle in eukaryotic cells is governed by a suite of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and CDK inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein CDKN1A (also known as p21), encoded by the CDKN1A gene, is a member of the CIP/KIP family of CDK inhibitors, together with CDKN1B (p27) and CDKN1C (p57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A main mechanism governing p21 levels is through CDKN1A transcriptional activation by the tumour-suppressor TP53 (p53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In response to DNA damage and many other cellular stressors, p21 levels increase in a p53-dependent manner and contribute to arrest cell proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P21 also regulates multiple cellular processes, including apoptosis, differentiation and stem cell quiescence1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to transcriptional upregulation by p53, other mechanisms have been described that regulate p21 levels2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under normal growth conditions, p21 is an unstable protein with a relatively short half-life and several proteins involved in p21 degradation have been identified2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The serine/threonine kinase MTOR (mTOR) promotes anabolic processes and cell growth in response to environmental cues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is achieved through two distinct multiprotein complexes containing mTOR and known as mTORC1 and mTORC2 (refs 4, 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The kinase activity of mTORC1 is positively regulated by two families of small GTPases, namely, RHEB and RRAGs (also known as RAGs)6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of relevance for our current work, RHEB is negatively regulated by the GTPase-activating protein TSC2 (refs 6, 7, 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mTORC1 complex integrates inputs from at least four major signals: growth factors, energy status, oxygen and amino acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When activated, mTORC1 promotes protein synthesis mainly by phosphorylating the kinases RPS6KB (also known as S6K) and the translational regulators EIF4EBP (also known as 4E-BP)9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon phosphorylation, 4E-BP releases the translation factor EIF4E (eIF4E) allowing it to promote the translation of a subset of mRNAs characterized by the presence of a terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) track in the 5-untranslated region (TOP mRNAs)9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth leading cancer by incidence worldwide and is one of the most morbid, mortal and genetically diverse malignancies11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite improvements in treatment protocols, the survival rates remain disappointingly low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insight in the molecular processes causing HNSCC may reveal the knowledge to improve and personalize treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The above-described molecular pathways involving p21 and mTORC1 are frequently deregulated in HNSCCs, but little is known about the possible connections between these two pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P21 is aberrantly expressed in the majority of HNSCC and its expression appears to be unrelated to p53 status12,13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, alterations in the major components of the mTORC1 pathway are consistently observed in a large fraction of HNSCC cases17,18,19,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we have focused on the mechanistic connection between p21 and mTORC1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We dissect a mechanism that regulates p21 stability through the mTORC1/4E-BP1 pathway and independently of p53, and we show supportive evidence indicating that this mechanism is highly prevalent in HNSCC.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Hyperactivation of mTORC1 elevates p21 independently of p53', 'We were initially motivated by the idea of studying mTOR-induced senescence in primary cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous investigations had found that primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) from knockout mice lacking the mTORC1 inhibitor TSC2 enter senescence prematurely in association with a remarkable upregulation of p21 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cellular senescence is a tumour-suppressor mechanisms activated in response to multiple cellular stresses, prominently including oncogenic stimuli24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, cellular senescence can be considered a read-out of oncogenic stress in primary cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the senescence response is generally absent or impaired in cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In agreement with a previous report23, we confirmed that TSC2 depletion in primary MEFs, by infection with TSC2 short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-encoding lentiviruses, induced a robust senescence response (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, TSC2 depletion resulted in constitutive activation of mTORC1, as indicated by hyper-phosphorylation of ribosomal protein RPS6 (S6; Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, and similar to other examples of oncogenic stimuli-induced senescence24, TSC2 depletion resulted in increased levels of the cell cycle inhibitors p21 and p16 (encoded by CDKN2A; Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained with a different TSC2-targeting shRNA (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, TSC2-depleted senescent MEFs did not display increased levels of alternative reading frame (ARF) (also encoded by CDKN2A) or p53 (Fig 1b), which are critical mediators of oncogenic H-Ras (H-RasV12)-induced senescence25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, shTSC2-treated cells did not show evidence of DNA damage, as indicated by the absence of phosphorylated histone H2AFX (H2AX) and lack of Ser15-phosphorylated p53 (Supplementary Fig 1b, c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations are in agreement with a previous study showing that mTORC1 hyper-activation via PTEN knockout results in cellular senescence independently of replicative damage and ARF27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: mTORC1 activation promotes senescence in MEFs concomitant with p53-independent induction of p21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Representative images illustrating -galactosidase activity in MEFs infected with scramble or TSC2 shRNAs (top left panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 100 m.

and, independently of p53, shTSC2 upregulates p21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to remark that the upregulation of p21 by mTORC1 is not secondary to senescence, as exemplified in p53KO MEFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that there is a direct mechanistic link between mTORC1 and p21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'mTORC1 stabilizes p21 protein', 'Next, we aimed to uncover the mechanisms responsible for mTORC1-mediated induction of p21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TSC2 depletion did not significantly upregulate the levels of p21 mRNA in wild-type (WT) and p53KO MEFs (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, although we cannot exclude a partial contribution of transcriptional regulation by p53 or by other factors, post-transcriptional mechanisms must be involved in the elevation of p21 protein levels upon mTORC1 hyperactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is well known that mTORC1 preferentially promotes the translation of a subset of mRNAs characterized by TOP motifs at the 5-untranslated region (5UTR)10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We could not identify any obvious TOP motifs in the human or mouse p21 5UTR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, to unequivocally address the role of translation initiation, we ectopically expressed mouse p21 in p21KO MEFs using a plasmid that contained the p21 open reading frame preceded by a heterologous 5UTR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the levels of ectopically expressed mouse p21 increased upon activation of mTORC1 by shTSC2 (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations indicate that the 5UTR of p21 mRNA is not required for the effects of mTORC1 on p21 protein levels, and suggest that mTORC1 may regulate the stability of p21 protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this possibility, we analysed the kinetics of p21 degradation in the presence of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that TSC2 silencing significantly extended p21 half-life in WT MEFs (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 stabilized the levels of ectopic mouse p21 (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, under conditions in which p21 protein does not undergo proteasomal degradation (that is, in the presence of MG132), p21 levels increased only modestly upon TSC2 knockdown (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, although we cannot exclude the participation of other mechanisms, such as transcription or translation, we conclude that protein stabilization accounts for most of the upregulation of p21 upon mTORC1 hyperactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: TSC2 depletion upregulates exogenous p21 levels and increases p21 half-life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Representative western blot showing p21 levels in MEFs co-infected with pBabe-p21 retrovirus and either control or TSC2 shRNAs retroviruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Western blot analysis of p21 levels in scramble or TSC2 shRNA-expressing MEFs following incubation with 10 M cyclohexamide (CHX) for the indicated times (top).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Densitometric quantification of p21 levels corrected by loading control (bottom).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Western blot showing exogenous mouse p21 levels in the presence or absence of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) WT and p53KO MEFs were infected with either scramble or TSC2 shRNAs lentiviruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following selection, the cells were incubated for 8 h in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The p21 immunoblot of p53KO MEFs (right panel) is overexposed compared with WT MEFs (left panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each panel, all the western blots correspond to samples from the same experiment;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this paper, we describe a p53-independent mechanism of regulation of p21 via the mTORC1 kinase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that the mTORC1 substrate 4E-BP1 interacts with p21 in its non-phosphorylated state and promotes p21 destabilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 abrogates its binding to p21 resulting in p21 stabilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have reported that p21 levels are affected by mTORC1 through increased general mRNA translation33 and specific increased translation of p53 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27) and p21 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34) mRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, activation of mTORC1 inhibits MDM2 through S6K1-mediated phosphorylation35 and nucleolar sequestration36, leading to p53 activation and p21 upregulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we identify another layer of regulation by showing that mTORC1 can regulate p21 protein levels independently of p53, eIF4E and the 5UTR sequence of p21 mRNA, via phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 which disables the destabilization of p21 by unphosphorylated 4E-BP1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In primary cells, the upregulation of p21 by mTORC1 results in senescence only in cells with active p53, but not in cells lacking p53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The induction of p21-dependent senescence could function as a barrier to prevent malignant progression of cells with a hyperactive mTORC1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This protective function, however, is abrogated in HNSCC probably because they carry multiple alterations that bypass or cancel senescence, such as inactivation of p53, overexpression of cyclin D1 or CCNE1 (cyclin E), or loss of p16, which are all common events in HNSCC11,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, p21 is known to regulate a variety of cellular processes beyond the cell cycle1,2, and these other processes could be of clinical relevance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In agreement with previous studies on HNSCC12,13,14,15, using a large series of 274 HNSCC tissue specimens, we found that a considerable proportion of tumours (67%) showed p21 expression irrespective of p53 status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, there was a strong significant correlation between p21 and P-S6 protein expression, thereby supporting a causal connection between mTORC1 activity and p21 levels in HNSCC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, when correlated with clinical data, we found that p21, P-S6 or the combination of both proteins significantly associated with disease-specific survival in our cohort of patients with orolaryngeal, laryngeal and hypopharyngeal HNSCC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This association was particularly strong in the case of HNSCC patients with no lymph node affectation at the time of diagnosis, which could be of clinical value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with our observations, other types of cancers, such as non-small cell lung cancer37,38 and luminal breast cancer39, also show a positive association between hyperactivation of mTOR and good clinical prognosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, a negative association has been reported in other tumour types, such as oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma40 and nasopharyngeal carcinoma41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, our results demonstrate that the mTORC1/4E-BP1/p21 regulatory axis is relevant in HNSCC, and more importantly, it favourably affects clinical outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations are not in conflict with the oncogenic role of mTORC1 in these cancers, or with the potential therapeutic value of mTOR inhibitors for HNSCC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies should uncover why HNSCC with a hyperactive mTORC1/4E-BP1/p21 pathway have a better prognosis than tumours with less active mTORC1.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
