Quantitative real-time imaging of glutathione  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Glutathione plays many important roles in biological processes; however, the dynamic changes of glutathione concentrations in living cells remain largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report a reversible reaction-based fluorescent probedesignated as RealThiol (RT)that can quantitatively monitor the real-time glutathione dynamics in living cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using RT, we observe enhanced antioxidant capability of activated neurons and dynamic glutathione changes during ferroptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RT is thus a versatile tool that can be used for both confocal microscopy and flow cytometry based high-throughput quantification of glutathione levels in single cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We envision that this new glutathione probe will enable opportunities to study glutathione dynamics and transportation and expand our understanding of the physiological and pathological roles of glutathione in living cells.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant non-protein thiol in eukaryotic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with its oxidized partner (GSSG), GSH maintains cellular redox homeostasis1, regulates protein functions through S-glutathionylation2, contributes to iron-sulfur cluster maturation3, and acts as a signalling molecule to directly activate gene expression4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These important functions are dynamically regulated by the intracellular concentration and distribution of GSH6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, the concentration of intracellular GSH is derived from either cell lysates or GSH-S-transferase (GST) dependent probes7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These approaches, however, cannot provide information about the real-time dynamics of GSH concentration changes9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Redox-sensitive fluorescent proteins (roFPs) have been widely used to study GSH-related redox biology10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, roFPs only measure the changes in redox potential (EGSH) in cells, which can be due to shifts in the GSH:GSSG ratio, changes in total GSH concentration, or a combination of both scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many intracellular biochemical reactions, especially enzymes that use GSH as their substrate, rely on the local GSH concentration instead of EGSH (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides, roFPs under physiological conditions are only sensitive to oxidative stress but not to any reductive stress because they completely transition to a fully reduced state once in the cytosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, we developed a fluorescent probedesignated as RealThiol (RT)that can quantitatively monitor the real-time GSH dynamics in living cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Small-molecule fluorescent probes have gained increasing attention since the emergence of calcium and zinc probes13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reported the first reversible reaction-based small-molecule fluorescent GSH probe (ThiolQuant Green) that can perform single-point quantification of GSH levels in living cells15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The major obstacles to developing probes that can monitor GSH dynamics include the reaction reversibility and kinetics of the sensing reaction, as well as the high abundance of GSH (110 mM) inside cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus designed RT (Fig 1a) taking into account of all these challenges16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction between RT and GSH is based on a Michael addition reaction that is inherently reversible, has an appropriate dissociation equilibrium constant Kd in the mM range and rapid reaction kinetics, and provides ratiometric readouts, thus allowing GSH quantification independent of the probe concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the RT structure, the cyano group at the  position of the Michael acceptor enables fast reaction kinetics, the four-membered azetidine ring improves quantum yield and photostability17, and the two carboxylic acid groups ensure aqueous solubility and reduce probe binding to hydrophobic cellular structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To enhance the cell permeability of RT, we converted the carboxylic acid groups to acetoxymethyl (AM) esters, which are readily hydrolysed by esterases to regenerate RT inside cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using RT, we were able to monitor the dynamic changes of GSH in living cells, which subsequently led to the observation of enhanced antioxidant capability of activated neurons and time-dependent changes of GSH during the ferroptosis process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Characterization of reversible reaction-based glutathione probe RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The reversible Michael addition reaction between RT and GSH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The function of each moiety in RT is highlighted (QY: quantum yield).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Ultravioletvisible (unshaded) and fluorescence (shaded) spectra of RT (green) and RT-GSH (blue), the GSH adduct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Linear relationship between F405/F488 and GSH concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  F405 and F488 are the fluorescence intensities for RT-GSH and RT, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Dynamic ranges of Grx1-roGFP2 and RT probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence ratio changes on treatment with different concentrations of H2O2 in HeLa cells is measured, R60s/R0s is calculated as the ratio R value 60 s after H2O2 treatment divided by the R value before treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each point is the mean value of  greater than 8 cells analysed from 2 independent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars represent s.e.m.Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Spectroscopic and physical characterizations of RealThiol', 'RT shows ratiometric fluorescence responses with a wide dynamic range when reacting with GSH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RT and its GSH adduct (RT-GSH) shows fluorescence maxima at 487 and 562 nm with excitation wavelengths at 405 and 488 nm, respectively (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plotting the fluorescence intensity ratios with excitation wavelengths at 405 and 488 nm (F405/F488) as a function of GSH concentrations confers a superb linear relationship (R2=0.998) covering the physiological GSH concentration range 110 mM (Fig 1c, Supplementary Figs 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Kd for the reaction between RT and GSH is 3.7 mM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing to ThiolQuant Green, RT and RT-GSH has much improved quantum yields and photostability (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although roFPs are highly sensitive to oxidative stress, their responses can be easily saturated (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the wide dynamic range of RT allows for monitoring of the GSH level changes within 110 mM in both directions in living cells (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Quantum yields of GSH probes.Full size table', 'Selectivity of RealThiol under physiological conditions', 'RT preferentially reacts with GSH under physiological conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to both the high abundance of GSH and the millimolar Kd value, we observed F405/F488 changes only when RT reacted with GSH but not other thiols, reactive oxygen or nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) at their corresponding physiological concentrations (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratiometric readout of RT only responds to GSH (10 mM), but not to glycine (10 mM), cysteine (100 M) or a series of ROS/RNS (100 M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that cysteine and GSH have similar chemical reactivities towards RT (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because intracellular cysteine level is usually below 100 M under the physiological conditions18,19, the interference of RT signals from cysteine is minimal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess whether RT probe binds to any proteins or reacts with free cysteine residues in some proteins that may interfere with the final ratio readouts, we incubated RT with cell lysate, which was dialyzed using a 3 K cut-off membrane to remove all small molecules including GSH, and observed no significant changes in fluorescent signal ratios even at the highest lysate concentration shown (protein concentration is 36 mg ml1 based on a BCA assay), suggesting that there is no non-specific interactions or reactions between cellular proteins and RT which could significantly change the ratio readouts (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, F405/F488 is insensitive to other environmental factors, including potential non-specific interactions or reactions with intracellular proteins (Fig 2a), pH and viscosity (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, to determine the percentage distribution of reacted RT between GSH and protein thiols, we treated HeLa cells with RT and lysed the cells using trichloroacetic acid to separate proteins from small molecules (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis showed that 10% of RT reacts with thiolated proteins while 90% of RT reacts with GSH (Fig 2e and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we conclude that RT is able to reliably measure the intracellular GSH levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Reaction selectivity of RT towards GSH under different conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Fluorescence ratio after RT probe equilibrated in vitro with physiological relevant concentrations of different compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, small-molecule thiols are removed in lysate for testing RT reactivity towards proteins in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Refer to method for details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Relative ratio of RT and RT-GSH adduct under different pH and viscosity conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blue symbols are intentionally lowered by 0.2 units for clarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Responses of RT with GSH and cysteine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence spectra of RT reaction with increasing concentrations of GSH and cysteine (0.150 mM) at ex=488 nm and ex=405 nm;

Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second-order reaction rate constant between RT and GSH is 7.5 M1 s1, while the same rate constant for our previously reported ThiolQuant Green probe and GSH is 0.15 M1 s1, which is 50 times slower than RT (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To measure the reverse reaction rates, we mixed a pre-equilibrated mixture of RT (20 M) and GSH (10 or 5 mM) with an equal volume of PBS and followed the disappearance of RT-GSH fluorescence (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first-order dissociation reaction rate constant for RT-GSH is 20.3 × 103 s1, which is more than 500 times faster than that for ThiolQuant Green-GSH (35.7 × 106 s1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, it should be noted that GST has little catalytic effect on the reaction rate between RT and GSH (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Kinetics of RT reaction with GSH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) RT reacts rapidly with GSH in both forward and reverse reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All data were recorded at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The kinetic traces for reverse reactions were shifted on x axis for clarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Catalytic effect of GST on the reaction rate between GSH and RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data points represent the fluorescence signal from newly generated RT-GSH conjugate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant differences can be observed with or without GST.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One representative set of data out of three independent experiments are shown.Full size image', 'Table 2 Forward reaction rate constants between GSH probes and GSH.Full size table', 'Applications of RealThiol in living cells', 'RT quantitatively and reversibly responds to the fluctuations of intracellular GSH levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For cells treated with the AM form of RT, real-time ratiometric images of the rapid changes of intracellular GSH concentrations in single cells can be generated by dividing the fluorescence intensity values for the 405 nm channel by the 488 nm channel at each corresponding pixel (Fig 4a, Supplementary Fig 4, Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On treatment with a bolus of H2O2 (500 M) to induce oxidative stress, the ratiometric imaging of HeLa cells revealed a decrease in the GSH level from 5.0 to 4.1 mM within 90 s (Fig 4b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, GSH ester (100 M) was added to replenish the intracellular GSH loss, which led to recovery of GSH to the basal level in the next 3 min, as recorded by RT (Fig 4b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GSH-ester concentration refers to the concentration in the culture medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that GSH ester tends to be enriched inside cells due to its hydrophobic nature and esterase-catalyzed hydrolysis of GSH ester to GSH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the intracellular GSH level changes measured using RT were confirmed by cell lysate-based liquid chromatographymass spectrometry (LCMS) measurements (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments demonstrate that RT reversibly reacts with GSH inside cells and can reflect intracellular GSH dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: RT-based imaging and quantification of glutathione in living cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Confocal and ratiometric images of HeLa cells stained with RT (refer to Supplementary Fig 4 for details on generating ratiometric images).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 20 m.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Michael addition reaction has been widely applied in organic synthesis and bioconjugation to build carboncarbon and carbonheteroatom bonds based on its forward reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the reverse reaction of Michael addition is underutilized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking advantage of the reversibility of Michael addition reaction, we developed the first reversible reaction-based fluorescent probe ThiolQuant Green to perform single-point quantification of GSH in living cells15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, based on density functional theory, we developed a computational model to predict the Kd values and the trend of reaction kinetics of Michael addition reactions30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our extensive understanding of the physical organic chemistry of Michael addition reactions leads to the second generation RT GSH probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Introducing an electron-withdrawing cyano group at the  position of the Michael acceptor of ThiolQuant Green can accelerate reaction kinetics but simultaneously shift the Kd value into the M range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we replaced the ketone in ThiolQuant Green with a less reactive amide in RT to balance the Kd back into the mM range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The -cyano amide-based Michael acceptors have also been elegantly used by the Taunton group as warheads in small-molecule inhibitors to react with active site cysteines while being minimally affected by the high concentration of intracellular GSH due to the fast reaction kinetics and the mM of Kd (refs 31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, dialkylamino-coumarin is a class of dye known for their low quantum yields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, relatively high laser power is required for confocal imaging, which can consequently cause phototoxicity to live cells, especially with excitation at 405 nm (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Lavis group made a seminal discovery that substituting the dialkylamino group with an azetidine group is a general method to significantly improve quantum yields of fluorophores17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following Laviss work, we found that introducing an azetidine group to RT can boost its quantum yield to 2.9%, which is threefolds of that of ThiolQuant Green.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantum yield of RT-GSH is as high as 86%, which is 146-fold of that of ThiolQuant Green (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the two carboxylic acid groups in RT are very important to achieve homogenous probe distribution in cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RT prototypes without the carboxylic acid groups, such as RT-NH2 and TQG-CN, are fairly hydrophobic and cannot distribute in the nucleus, which is a hallmark of protein binding for fluorescent probes (Fig 8a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same inhomogeneous cellular distribution was also observed for ThiolQuant Green15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, introduction of carboxylic acid groups to RT slows down its reaction kinetics towards GSH comparing to RT-NH2 and TQG-CN (Table 2), presumably due to the charge repulsion between the carboxylic acid groups and the anionic GSH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because inhomogeneous cellular distribution of reacted and unreacted probes may bias the ratiometric calculations, especially at the subcellular resolution, we opted for RT instead of RT-NH2 to achieve high-quality quantitative results in living cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are currently exploring cationic or neutral water solubilizing groups to replace the carboxylic acids in RT to achieve higher temporal resolution while maintaining homogeneous cellular distribution, which will be reported in the due course.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 8: GSH probe prototypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Chemical structures of TQG-CN and TQG-CN-GSH and its confocal images in HeLa cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Chemical structures of RT-NH2 and RT-NH2-GSH and its confocal images in HeLa cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar 10 m.
