Local self-uniformity in photonic networks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The interaction of a material with light is intimately related to its wavelength-scale structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simple connections between structure and optical response empower us with essential intuition to engineer complex optical functionalities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we develop local self-uniformity (LSU) as a measure of a random networks internal structural similarity, ranking networks on a continuous scale from crystalline, through glassy intermediate states, to chaotic configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that complete photonic bandgap structures possess substantial LSU and validate LSUs importance in gap formation through design of amorphous gyroid structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amorphous gyroid samples are fabricated via three-dimensional ceramic printing and the bandgaps experimentally verified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We explore also the wing-scale structuring in the butterfly Pseudolycaena marsyas and show that it possesses substantial amorphous gyroid character, demonstrating the subtle order achieved by evolutionary optimization and the possibility of an amorphous gyroids self-assembly.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A complete photonic bandgap (PBG) is frequency window within which a material, by virtue of its structure, supports no propagating electromagnetic modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically, structures which possess complete PBGs are periodic arrays of dielectric material; such arrays are called photonic crystals (PhCs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PhCs have the potential to play a key role in the development of next-generation photonic integrated circuits1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, although the complexity of PhC-based technologies continues to grow, questions regarding the fundamental mechanisms of PBG formation remain unresolved4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The formation of PBGs is conventionally interpreted as a result of coherent scattering by a PhCs lattice planes7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this picture, a plane wave may be scattered onto its counter-propagating equivalent when the wavevector of the initial state lies on the edge of the PhCs Brillouin zone (BZ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When this condition is met, a pair of orthogonal standing wave modes, each possessing a distinct electromagnetic field profile, is formed5,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Energetic interaction between the electric field and the underlying dielectric distribution then breaks the degeneracy of the standing wave states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the specific propagation direction under consideration, the resulting forbidden spectral range defines a photonic stop gap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To engineer a complete PBG, photonic stop gaps must open along all propagation directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, these stops gaps must be spectrally aligned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both these considerations can be addressed by designing PhCs to possess maximally spherical BZs11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The search for the first complete PBG thus focussed on face-centred cubic crystalsthe most isotropic of the three-dimensional (3D) Bravais latticesand discovered a large complete gap in a diamond-like network of dielectric material12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In spite of the many PhC designs that have since been discovered, those based on the diamond network remain the champion, possessing the largest complete PBGs13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'There is, however, much evidence to suggest that PBG formation is governed by more than just coherent scattering processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PhCs derived from the body-centred cubic single-network gyroid (SNG) structure (triamond) and low-symmetry diamond embeddings all possess near-champion PBGs in spite of their less spherical BZs13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although based on a face-centred cubic lattice, the inverse opal network exhibits a complete PBG only one quarter the size of the champion diamond gap1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most tellingly, a glassy 3D networkdubbed photonic amorphous diamond (PAD)exhibits a sizeable complete PBG4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gap exists despite PADs diffuse primary diffraction maximum which spreads the structures coherent scattering power of a range of wavevectors5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Similar evidence is found in two-dimensional structures that possess PBGs for light with a transverse electric (TE) polarization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amongst these structures, the champion PhC design is a honeycomb network of dielectric material15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many glassy networks that can be broadly styled as hyperuniform disordered honeycombs have been found to possess sizeable TE PBGs6,16,17,18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with PAD, these gaps exist despite the diminished coherent scattering power of each structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we address the mechanisms governing PBG formation by re-formulating the ideal structural properties of a PBG-forming network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To achieve this, we introduce the concept of local self-uniformity (LSU).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LSU measures the geometrical and topological similarities of the local environments in a connected network of uniform valency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that existing sizeable PBG networks possess significant LSU.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate the connection between LSU and PBG forming ability by designing novel amorphous gyroid (amorphous triamond) connected networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, amorphous gyroids can possess sizeable PBGs and an amorphous gyroids LSU is strongly correlated with its PBG width.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This correlation is explained by recognizing the contribution of spatially localized resonant scattering processes to PBG formation in connected networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Locally self-uniform ceramic 3D-printed amorphous gyroids are characterized through microwave transmission experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We explore also the possibility that amorphous gyroid exists within the wing scales of butterflies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we reveal that the microstructure in the scales of Pseudolycaena marsyas possesses substantial amorphous gyroid character and demonstrate that the butterflys reflectance spectrum can be effectively reproduced by amorphous gyroid microstructures.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Local self-uniformity', 'The exact structure of glasses has long been debated21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent research has demonstrated the complex interplay of ordered and disordered phases in the vitreous state22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The disparate variety of bulk metallic glasses in particular has challenged researchers to develop predictive theories of an alloys glass-forming ability25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of sizeable PBGs in glassy networks exposes an analogous deficiency in current understanding of a structures PBG forming ability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike silicate and metallic glasses, the structures of glassy PBG materials are designed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the structural characteristics that render these glasses amenable to PBG formation remain mysterious.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the aim of clarifying these PBG forming characteristics, here we develop LSU a general measure of structural order in connected networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A typical PhC consists of a connected distribution of dielectric material surrounded by air.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an example, Fig 1a,b show the champion PhC diamond;
