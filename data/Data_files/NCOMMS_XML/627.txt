5-Hydroxymethylcytosine localizes to enhancer elements and is associated with survival in glioblastoma patients  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Glioblastomas exhibit widespread molecular alterations including a highly distorted epigenome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we resolve genome-wide 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in glioblastoma through parallel processing of DNA with bisulfite and oxidative bisulfite treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We apply a statistical algorithm to estimate 5-methylcytosine, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and unmethylated proportions from methylation array data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that 5-hydroxymethylcytosine is depleted in glioblastoma compared with prefrontal cortex tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the genomic localization of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in glioblastoma is associated with features of dynamic cell-identity regulation such as tissue-specific transcription and super-enhancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Annotation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine genomic distribution reveal significant associations with RNA regulatory processes, immune function, stem cell maintenance and binding sites of transcription factors that drive cellular proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, model-based clustering results indicate that patients with low-5-hydroxymethylcytosine patterns have significantly poorer overall survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate that 5-hydroxymethylcytosine patterns are strongly related with transcription, localizes to disease-critical genes and are associated with patient prognosis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Glioblastoma is the most common and malignant primary intracranial tumour accounting for 60% of gliomas in adults1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glioblastomas are high-grade gliomas (World Health Organization grade IV) that invade surrounding brain tissue, quickly develop resistance to therapy and have a median survival of 1619 months after treatment with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Systematic molecular analyses have advanced our understanding of glioblastoma pathobiology through the identification of common mutations, structural-based genetic alterations and dysregulated epigenomes3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these molecular alterations, severe disturbance of the glioblastoma epigenome has been observed, especially perturbations to global DNA 5-methylcytosine (5 mC) patterns6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, DNA methylation alterations have been recognized to have a functional impact on glioblastomagenesis, tumour growth, response to therapy and prognosis3,7,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to other tumour types, glioblastomas exhibit patterns of genome-wide 5 mC loss and genomic context-specific DNA hypermethylation when compared with healthy nervous tissues12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Epigenomic patterns in cancer are often heterogeneous and can be substantially influenced by the presence of genetic alterations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, gliomas that carry mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) genes have been shown to harbour a pattern of DNA hypermethylation at certain promoter regions which results in a glioma CpG island methylator phenotype (G-CIMP)8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The epigenomic phenotype of G-CIMP tumours has been associated with distinct copy number alterations, molecular subgroups and a survival advantage in patients with glioblastoma7,8,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While the glioblastoma DNA methylome has begun to be described, additional modifications to DNA that modulate normal gene function have been implicated in disease development14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the teneleven translocation (TET) family of proteins have been shown to function as enzymes capable of altering the methylation status of DNA by converting 5 mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5 hmC)14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emerging evidence has suggested that 5 hmC: localizes to sites of DNA damage, may act as a transient intermediate in the process of 5 mC demethylation, and may serve as a functional epigenetic mark for regulating transcription15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cell lines, 5 hmC has been shown to recruit DNA-binding proteins and 5 hmC production has been reported to be essential for glioblastomagenesis17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the aetiologic, distribution and prognostic significance of 5 hmC levels in glioblastoma remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, a portrait of both 5 mC and 5 hmC patterns at a nucleotide resolution is necessary for a more complete understanding of the cytosine modifications in glioblastoma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Use of sodium bisulfite (BS) treatment followed by hybridization to the Infinium DNA methylation arrays (that is, 450 K array) is a common method for interrogating DNA methylation at the single base level5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, sample treatment with sodium BS does not allow disambiguation of 5 mC from 5 hmC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxidation of 5 hmC to 5-formylcytosine (5 fC) is achievable with potassium perruthenate treatment, and subsequent sodium BS treatment (oxBS) converts 5 fC and cytosine to uracil and ultimately thymine while only 5 mC remains unconverted by the coupled oxBS treatment18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the selective oxidation step enables disambiguation of 5 hmC from 5 mC measurements19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, it has been demonstrated that use of paired BS and oxBS treatment on the same samples followed by hybridization to the Infinium DNA methylation array reliably permits accurate quantification of 5 hmC and 5 mC19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we present the characterization of 5 mC and 5 hmC levels from paired BS and oxBS 450 K assays in thirty glioblastomas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To effectively analyze and interpret this data, we develop and apply a novel algorithm, OxyBS21, and produce the first epigenome-wide characterization of 5 hmC in glioblastoma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that the glioblastoma genome is globally depleted of 5 hmC and its distribution is dependent on genomic context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observe an enrichment of 5 hmC at glioblastoma-specific enhancer elements, alternative mRNA splicing events, and localization of 5 hmC to several genes significantly mutated in glioblastoma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the more commonly described repressive nature of 5 mC, 5 hmC levels in our cohort are primarily positively associated with gene expression and open chromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we find that pattern-specific loss of 5 hmC is associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with glioblastoma.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Estimation of 5 mC and 5 hmC', 'We adapted the BSoxBS technology to DNA from 30 glioblastomas and applied a novel algorithm, OxyBS, to obtain genome-wide 5 hmC and 5 mC estimates21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All samples were primary tumours, fresh frozen and IDH1 and IDH2 wild type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patient demographic, tumour characteristics and survival data are presented in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we focused on the identification of 5 hmC distribution and abundance to better understand the role of 5 hmC in glioblastoma pathobiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach to investigate potential functions of 5 hmC included assessment of five aims (Supplementary Fig 1): (1) to characterize genomic abundance and distribution of 5 hmC and 5 mC, (2) to delineate high 5 hmC CpGs in glioblastoma, (3) to determine functional annotation of regions with high 5 hmC, (4) to assess the impact of 5 hmC on gene expression (5) and to apply a machine learning algorithm to cluster patients by 5 hmC profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Patient demographics and tumour characteristics.Full size table', 'Global content and genomic distribution of 5 hmC and 5 mC', 'First, to qualitatively assess the extent of deregulation in the glioblastoma epigenome we compared the total genomic content of 5 hmC among glioblastoma samples with levels of 5 hmC in the prefrontal cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we were unable to obtain matched disease-free cortex samples in our own cohort, we accessed publicly available prefrontal cortex data using the same BSoxBS protocol in an independent population of individuals that presented with no evidence of neurological impairment (GSE74368, n=5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid limitations due to the presence of multiple cell types (that is, glial and neuronal) in the prefrontal cortex samples we did not compare CpG-specific differences in 5 hmC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to provide a global perspective on 5 hmC differences we examined the overall proportion of 5 hmC in total cytosine content (that is, summed 5 hmC beta-values across all CpGs within each sample divided by total number of CpGs profiled) between the two tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed an average 3.5 fold reduction (P=6.2E-06, Wilcoxon rank sum test) in the total 5 hmC content in glioblastoma samples when compared with cortex samples (Supplementary Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While all glioblastoma samples exhibited a decreased level of total 5 hmC there was high variability in total 5 hmC loss across tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Potential biological explanations that may account for the variability of total 5 hmC include sample differences in cellular proportions and differences in the expression of the TET enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we estimated putative cellular proportions from DNA methylation data (Methods section) using a non-negative matrix factorization approach (RefFreeEWAS) and found that there were stable estimates of tumour purity across samples (Supplementary Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, differences in 5 hmC levels across tumours may be more strongly associated with the molecular alterations across tumours rather than tumour purity (Supplementary Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next tested whether the overall proportions of 5 hmC in total cytosine content were associated with the expression of TET enzymes and additional epigenetic enzymes (that is, TET1, TET2, DNMT3A, IDH1, etc).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, we did not observe any significant relationships (P greater than 0.05, Spearmans rho test, Supplementary Table 1) consistent with prior studies22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we note that the levels of 5 hmC were not significantly associated with total 5 mC content (Supplementary Fig 2B, P=0.18, linear regression).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5 hmC has been implicated in the DNA demethylation pathway and may suggest functionality of 5 hmC outside simply removal of 5 mC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'At the nucleotide level, the dynamic range of 5 hmC detection was between 0.00 and 0.99 on the beta-value scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Empirical cumulative density plots for both mean 5 hmC and 5 mC across all subjects revealed near zero 5 hmC levels in a majority of CpGs and revealed the well-established bimodal distribution for 5 mC (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the site-specific relationship between 5 hmC and 5 mC levels we computed Spearman correlation coefficients for each CpG and observed that moderate negative correlations exist for a large majority of CpGs, and that  less_than 20% of CpGs demonstrated weak positive correlations between 5 hmC and 5 mC (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are known differences in the distribution of DNA methylation based upon by genomic context23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dependency of 5 mC levels upon CpG density was observed in glioblastoma and the CpG islands and CpG island shores exhibited demonstrably lower levels of 5 mC (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether potential CpG density specific patterns also exist for 5 hmC we next computed the proportions of CpG-specific mean 5 hmC across the four strata of CpG Island, Shores, Shelves and Ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1d displays the distributions of mean 5 mC and 5 hmC as well as statistical assessment over each of the CpG strata.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generally, the patterns of 5 hmC levels were similar to 5 mC and the lowest levels of 5 hmC were found across CpG islands and CpG Island shores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to observations in 5 mC, CpG Island shelves and Ocean regions also harboured the highest levels of 5 hmC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of 5 mC in regulating gene expression has best been described for promoter regions and it is known that TET1, which catalyzes the oxidation of 5 mC to 5 hmC, is enriched for binding to DNA at CpG island promoters24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the overall distribution of mean 5 mC and 5 hmC across the promoter regions for both cortex tissue and glioblastomas we averaged the cytosine modifications over a four kilobase pair window near transcriptional start sites23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We noted the occurrence of hypermethylation (5 mC) across glioblastoma promoter regions and a consistently lower level of glioblastoma 5 hmC proximal to promoter regions when compared with healthy tissue (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: 5hmC is

for each CpG across all thirty tumours to identify CpG sites with the highest proportion of 5 hmC alleles (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In glioblastoma, a large number of CpGs demonstrated mean 5 hmC values near zero while signals  greater than 5% 5 hmC were found in 35,000 CpGs (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to be confident in distinguishing signal from background we then defined CpGs as high 5 hmC CpGs if they were in the highest 1% of mean 5 hmC level; resulting in 3,876 CpGs with a mean value of at least 9.0% 5 hmC that we described here as high 5 hmC CpGs and are used in subsequent analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among high 5 hmC CpGs, 60% were recurrent across a majority of the thirty glioblastomas (2,347/3,876 CpGs with at least 15 tumours displaying 9% 5 hmC

observed that the highest levels of 5 hmC track to sites with intermediate levels of 5 mC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with the notion that 5 hmC may function as an intermediate in the DNA demethylation process at dynamically regulated regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, the observed loss of 5 hmC that occurs in glioblastoma may also reflect disruption of regulated genomic DNA

#@NEW_LINE#@#  The genomic distribution of high 5 hmC CpGs relative to canonical transcriptional start sites (TSS) is presented in Fig 3b and reveals that 75% of high 5 hmC were found beyond the 5 kb region upstream of the TSS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether elevated levels of 5 hmC were associated with genomic features, we used a CochranMantelHaenszel test with binary outcomes (for example, genomic region of interest versus other) to provide a measure of enrichment that permitted stratification by CpG density (that is, CpG islands, shores, shelves and ocean).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that high 5 hmC CpGs were more likely to be found in intronic regions (2.12 odds ratio (OR), P=1.7E-112, CochranMantelHaenszel test, Fig 3c) as well as depleted in promoter regions (OR=0.69,

substantial enrichment for enhancer regions among the high 5 hmC CpGs for all three tumours (median OR=3.1, P=1.9E-211, CochranMantelHaenszel test, Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we also found a significant enrichment of high 5 hmC CpGs at glioblastoma cell line (U87) defined enhancers (OR=2.2, P=1.7E-46, CochranMantelHaenszel test, Fig 3c) and super-enhancers (OR=3.00, P=9.7E-63,

sample was excluded from our survival analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the relation of 5 hmC patterns (that is, not total 5 hmC) with survival we used a model-based clustering method, Recursively Partitioned Mixture Model (RPMM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RPMM has been extensively used for clustering DNA methylation data to identify classes of tumours based upon 5 mC values, including TCGA38,39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we applied RPMM to the 3,876 high 5 hmC CpGs and the resulting clustering solution contained two distinct clusters, defining a low and a high 5 hmC cluster (Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Separate clustering analyses were performed for the 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 and 4,000 highest 5 hmC CpGs to examine classification sensitivity and we observed complete stability of cluster membership (that is, samples remained in either low or high 5 hmC clusters regardless of CpG number selected).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cluster membership was associated with total 5 hmC amount (P=2.0E-04, KruskalWallis rank sum test), and patient age (P=0.03, KruskalWallis rank sum test), but not copy number alterations (P greater than 0.05, Fishers exact test, Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cluster of patients with low-5 hmC tumours had an older age at diagnosis (median age=74.3 years) compared with the high 5 hmC cluster (median age=65.2 years) and had a shorter median survival (median overall survival=2.2 months) when compared with the high 5 hmC cluster (median overall survival=14.5 months).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for age at diagnosis and patient sex resulted in a significantly increased hazard of death related with membership in the low-5 hmC cluster independent of age (Hazard Ratio=3.3, CI 95% 1.38.2, P=0.03, Cox proportional hazards regression, Fig 6b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare with prior work that has measured total 5 hmC, we also constructed an index of total 5 hmC by taking the mean across all CpGs considered in the present analysis (n=387,617) and segregated subjects into low and high-total 5 hmC groups based on whether total 5 hmC levels were above or below the median.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for age at diagnosis and sex, the low total 5 hmC group was not significantly associated with survival (HR=0.94 CI 95% (0.432.03), P=0.88, Cox proportional hazards regression) suggesting that the genomic location of 5 hmC is an important consideration in associations with disease progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Glioblastoma 5hmC

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this study, we leveraged paired oxBS and BS 450 K arrays to delineate the genomic location and abundance of 5 hmC at nucleotide resolution in thirty primary glioblastomas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To the best of our knowledge, the investigation of 5 hmC genomic distribution in glioblastoma is novel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Use of 5 hmC and 5 mC profiling has permitted us to observe that the glioblastoma genome is relatively depleted of 5 hmC when compared with healthy cortex tissue, a finding consistent with studies that used less sensitive techniques37,41,42,43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We move beyond previous studies to report that despite global 5 hmC reduction45, the genomic regions with elevated 5 hmC are strongly associated with active transcription and may be important for malignant cellular processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, our study provides evidence that a perturbed hydroxymethylome in glioblastoma may reflect progressive disruption of genomic stability and that loss of 5 hmC regulation is a potential indicator of disease progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous efforts to characterize genome-wide DNA methylation in glioblastomas using the 450 K DNA methylation arrays have demonstrated an association between an altered epigenetic state and glioblastoma tumour biology5,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, traditional BS treatment of DNA profiled on 450 K arrays alone is unable to disambiguate 5 hmC from 5 mC abundance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Existing methods to quantify the abundance of 5 hmC range from immunohistochemistry (IHC) to liquid chromatographymass spectrometry (LCMS) to sequence-based approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both immunohistochemistry and LCMS approaches have demonstrated that there is a depletion of 5 hmC in glioblastomas, but these techniques are unable to discern the genomic location of the 5 hmC conservation or loss37,42,43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, sequencing-based approaches have the ability to detect 5 hmC at the single base resolution genome-wide, but suffer from high costs that limit applicability in larger studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, we are not aware of any genome-wide sequencing data for 5 hmC in glioblastoma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, reduction in the complexity of the genome sequence consequent to BS modification results in increased sequencing costs46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The application of the oxBS and BS protocol for 450 K arrays represents an opportunity to strike a balance between genomic resolution of 5 hmC and sample throughput.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the use of paired oxBS and BS 450 K arrays has consistently been shown to distinguish 5 hmC from both 5 mC and 5 C (refs 19, 20, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Genome-wide loss of 5 hmC in cancer has been a widely observed, yet poorly characterized biological phenomenon16,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The depletion of 5 hmC across several tumour types, including glioma, suggests that loss of 5 hmC regulation is one of the many defining features of tumorigenesis41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, several studies have noted that loss of 5 hmC is associated with increased expression of proliferation markers and with increasing tumour grade suggesting that loss of epigenetic regulation via 5 hmC may contribute to disease progression37,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The link between decreasing 5 hmC with increasing tumour aggressiveness has been explained, in part, by the delayed generation of 5 hmC on newly synthesized DNA and the high proliferative rates of aggressive tumours15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent reports have also revealed that 5 hmC may have roles beyond transcriptional regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, 5 hmC has previously been shown to localize to DNA damage in experimental conditions and its role as an epigenetic marker of DNA damage has been shown to promote genome stability48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we found that several of the most frequently mutated genes in glioblastoma including: EGFR, PTEN, NF1, PIK3R1, RB1, PDGFRA and QKI possessed high 5 hmC levels across intronic regions and further loss of 5 hmC in tumours may reflect a loss of genome integrity13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast with prior studies, we did not observe a significant association between total 5 hmC levels and patient survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While our method for total 5 hmC measurement was distinct from previous estimations, a lack of association between survival and global 5 hmC levels suggests that this relationship is more nuanced than previously thought.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we found that subject clusters determined by the application of RPMM to 5 hmC profiles demonstrated differences in patient survival time with the low-5 hmC tumours having a significantly worst prognosis independent of subject age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our analysis provides a more complete understanding of dynamic cytosine modifications that may contribute to disease phenotypes and genomic instability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Not considered by previous studies is the possibility that cancer cell conservation of 5 hmC may also be critical for glioblastomagenesis and tumour growth as suggested by Takai et al.17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the highest levels of 5 hmC found in this cohort of glioblastomas were in regions of low CpG-content, a phenomenon also present in acute myeloid leukaemia and non-diseased tissue22,26,49,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes with high 5 hmC were noted to be located within actively transcribed genes in glioblastoma highlighting the role of 5 hmC as a potential facilitator of transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5 hmC was also preferentially found in glioblastoma-specific enhancers and super-enhancers suggesting that deposition of 5 hmC at these gene regulatory regions may indicate epigenetic states permissive to cancer cell survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior work has demonstrated that 5 hmC modulates enhancer activity and regulates gene expression programs during cellular differentiation suggesting that 5 hmC deregulation may impact the dedifferentiation observed in glioblastoma50,51,52,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enrichment of cellular identity pathways in our GREAT analysis and the binding sites of transcription factors that drive cellular proliferation further supported the link between 5 hmC and disease-critical gene expression programs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the enrichment of immune response and somatic stem cell maintenance may reflect cellular subpopulations (that is, glioblastoma stem cells and infiltrating immune cells) necessary for continued tumour growth54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Across this cohort, the consistent genomic localization of 5 hmC suggests a role for 5 hmC in genomic regulation of glioblastoma cells that merits future investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we have generated nucleotide resolution maps of 5 hmC in thirty glioblastomas and linked 5 hmC with gene regulatory regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate that the glioblastoma genome exhibits a global loss of 5 hmC compared with healthy prefrontal cortex tissues, but observed regions of conserved 5 hmC implying novel associations between 5 hmC and critical tumour transcriptional programs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study also highlights that 5 hmC may, in a manner similar to 5 mC, serve as marker of cellular identity and that genomic patterns reflect cellular states in tissue samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, methods presented here that defined associations between 5 hmC distribution and genomic features may be more broadly applicable to other diseases as well as characterization of 5 hmC function in non-diseased tissue.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
