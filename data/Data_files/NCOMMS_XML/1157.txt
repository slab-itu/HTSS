Crustal rheology controls on the Tibetan plateau formation during India-Asia convergence  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The formation of the Tibetan plateau during the India-Asia collision remains an outstanding issue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proposed models mostly focus on the different styles of Tibetan crustal deformation, yet these do not readily explain the observed variation of deformation and deep structures along the collisional zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use three-dimensional numerical models to evaluate the effects of crustal rheology on the formation of the Himalayan-Tibetan orogenic system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During convergence, a weaker Asian crust allows strain far north within the upper plate, where a wide continental plateau forms behind the orogeny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, a stronger Asian crust suppresses the plateau formation, while the orogeny accommodates most of the shortening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stronger Asian lithosphere is also forced beneath the Indian lithosphere, forming a reversed-polarity underthrusting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate that the observed variations in lithosphere deformation and structures along the India-Asia collision zone are primarily controlled by the strength heterogeneity of the Asian continental crust.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The Tibetan plateau is one of the most striking features of continental tectonics, developed following the Indian continental subduction and collision with Asian continent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The convergence of the two plates, since 50 Ma, is continuously accommodated by Indian lithosphere subduction with its crust accreted into the Himalayan orogen, and by the indentation onto the Asian plate1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process has presumably driven the northward thickening of the Tibetan crust (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But how the Tibetan plateau formed and grew farther north from the Himalayan chain remains an outstanding question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Surface topography and lithospheric structure within and around the Tibetan plateau.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Topographic map

to explain the growth of Tibet, including plateau formation as the consequence of the Indian crust underplating3, distributed north-south shortening of Asian crust4, lateral extrusion of crustal blocks along strike-slip faults5, and channelized lower crustal flow6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The debate on the plateau formation mechanisms is further reflected in the complex seismic and magnetotelluric structures found beneath the Tibetan plateau along the whole convergent margin8,9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is well established that the Indian lithosphere underthrusts the entire Himalaya and the southern portion of Tibet8,10,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More to the north, the Indian lithosphere plunges into the mantle with a systematic increase in dip angle from west to east (Fig 1b-d), as revealed by multiple recent seismic studies10,15,16,17, where it subducts into the mantle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The convergent margin architecture becomes more complex towards the west, where the subduction polarity reverses beneath Pamir, with the Asian lithosphere becoming the down-going plate16,17 (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar vergence is found beneath the northern Tibetan plateau, where seismic imaging shows that the underthrusting Asian lithosphere under central Tibet15 (Fig 1c) becomes southward subducting further east18,19 (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The seismic studies clearly suggest strong heterogeneities of the lithospheric structure along the entire collision zone, which likely inherited from the tectonic history of the Asian margin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proto-southern margin of Asia was a collage of compositionally variable materials accreted onto the stable North Asian Siberian-Mongolian craton in the course of pre-Cenozoic orogenic events1,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the net lithospheric strength must have varied largely along this margin22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of these heterogeneities might be preserved in the present-day structure of the lithosphere, such as the Tarim Basin, which is a rigid crustal block compared to the surrounding crust23, and the inferred weaker crust in the southern and central Tibet24,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other lithospheric mantle heterogeneities have been inferred, such as through delamination or convective removal27,28, which were likely achieved during the late stage of the plateau evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crustal heterogeneities are likely representative of the strength of the Asian margin before Cenozoic collision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inferred lateral variation of crustal strength strongly correlates with the present-day deformation, with a narrow plateau adjacent to the Tarim Basin and a broader plateau to the east (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that east-west variations in the strength of the Asian plates might have played a dominant role for the development of the observed heterogeneous structure of the whole Himalayan-Tibetan system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This study uses three-dimensional continental collision models to investigate the role of crustal heterogeneity in forming the orogen-parallel variations in lithosphere deformation and structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that a weaker upper plate favors the formation of a wide continental plateau and two-sided subduction, while a stronger upper plate favors the development of a narrow orogeny and reversed-polarity underthrusting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our models suggest that the lateral variations observed in the lithosphere deformation and structures along the India-Asia collision zone are controlled by the strength heterogeneity of the Asian continental crust.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'These models offer relevant insights in the complexities found along the India-Asian margin and the formation of the coupled orogen and plateau as the result of varying crustal rheologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Himalayan orogen is bounded by a deep-seated thrust fault, the Main Himalayan Thrust, revealed by seismic investigations in the southern Tibet32,33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fault functions as a crustmantle decollement, and controls the growth of the crustal-stacking wedge35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exposure of the two plates crustal interface at the surface, corresponding to the Indus-Yarlong suture (IYS) (Fig 1a), is found 100 km south of the northern limit of the Indian plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of such an offset is consistent with the seismically imaged northern limit of the Indian lithosphere underplating further north of the IYS33,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Models with a weak Asian crust, or portions of it, reproduce structures compatible with the observations beneath the Himalaya-Tibet system, where similarly weak crust has been inferred37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These models reproduce the observed main features such as the basal décollement, the down-going lithosphere underplating and the location of the suture above the subducting plate, as well as a wide plateau in the upper plate interior (Figs 2a and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Along the western Tibet, the rigid Tarim Basin lithosphere might have acted as a rigid block resisting northward expansion of the plateau38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Observed lithospheric structures are mostly explained by the collision onto a stiffer crust, which enhances the back-thrusting and inhibits plateau growth, while forcing deep reversed-polarity underthrusting and subduction (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moho depth estimates in this area indicate a wide area with thicknesses in excess of 80 km beneath the southernmost portion of the Tibetan plateau, whereas similar thicknesses are found in a narrow belt beneath the western Tibet2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crustal thicknesses and distribution beneath these two domains are compatible with the outcomes of the model where the two crustal rheologies are embedded (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Furthermore, rheological heterogeneities in the crustal blocks in the Tibetan plateau interiors have possibly played a major role during the northward Cenozoic deformation propagation21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crustal back-thrusting and southwards lithospheric underthrusting beneath the northern Tibet and Qaidam Basin15 developed along block boundaries where the nature and geological history, and hence rheology, differ largely1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  South-verging underthrusting of the Asian lithosphere is seismically imaged beneath Pamir16,17 (Fig1b), with the lithosphere reaching mantle depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A relatively stronger lower crust is inferred in the area stretching from northern Tibet to Pamir-Tien Shan16, where the crust was likely thickened before collision39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our models potentially explain the tectonic regime inversion along the northern Tibetan to Pamir margin during its northward expansion, as the consequence of encountering a stronger Asian crustal block.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Further insight into the relation between the Tibetan plateau formation and the lower crustal rheology comes from the analyses of observed and modelled surface velocity and strain rates (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Global positioning system measurements show that the northward component of the velocity relative to Asia decreases steadily across the Tibetan plateau and almost vanishes at the northern margin40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To the east, the decrease in the convergence-parallel component is accompanied by an increase in the convergence-perpendicular component, exhibiting a clockwise rotation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To the west, the measurements indicate a reduction of the northward component across the relatively narrow plateau, which vanishes in the Tarim interior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The weaker crust model predicts a steady northward decay of the surface velocities across the broad plateau (Fig 5a), in agreement with the global positioning system pattern of the eastern Tibet, whereas the stiffer crust model predicts no substantial reduction in the surface velocities across the narrow wedge but abruptly vanishing in the stiffer crust block north of the indenter (Fig 5b), resembling the observations in the western Tibet adjacent to the Tarim Basin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, our models provide insights in the ongoing deformation in the area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high strain rates predicted by the third model, embedding a stiffer and a weaker crust, localize along the frontal thrusts of the orogen, the southern and northern margin of the plateau, although smaller and more diffuse in the north, while a relatively low strain rate zone is found in between (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This spatial distribution is consistent with the mapping of the current strain rates within the Tibetan plateau, where inferred high strain rates on the southern and northern margins bound a relative low strain rate zone in the central plateau41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strain rate pattern of the third model shows that the stiffer crust favors stress focusing and strain localization in the weaker domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the weaker crust portion, shearing along narrow belts, likely thrusts, is promoted beneath the wide plateau, as opposed to the diffuse deformation in the weaker crust-only model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might allow inferences on the deep lithospheric structure of the Tibetan Plateau, where similar narrow thrusts have been proposed21, and the localization along narrow strain belt such as the Kunlun Fault42, although this might be speculative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Modelled spatial distribution of the second strain rate invariant at the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a)
