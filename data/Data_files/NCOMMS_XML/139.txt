Tank binding kinase 1 is a centrosome-associated kinase necessary for microtubule dynamics and mitosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'TANK Binding Kinase 1 (TBK1) is a non-canonical IB kinase that contributes to KRAS-driven lung cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that TBK1 plays essential roles in mammalian cell division.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, levels of active phospho-TBK1 increase during mitosis and localize to centrosomes, mitotic spindles and midbody, and selective inhibition or silencing of TBK1 triggers defects in spindle assembly and prevents mitotic progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TBK1 binds to the centrosomal protein CEP170 and to the mitotic apparatus protein NuMA, and both CEP170 and NuMA are TBK1 substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, TBK1 is necessary for CEP170 centrosomal localization and binding to the microtubule depolymerase Kif2b, and for NuMA binding to dynein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, selective disruption of the TBK1CEP170 complex augments microtubule stability and triggers defects in mitosis, suggesting that TBK1 functions as a mitotic kinase necessary for microtubule dynamics and mitosis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'TBK1 is an IKK (IB Kinase)-related kinase that is activated by phosphorylation of Serine-172 by TLR and RIG1 signalling, and this circuit triggers phosphorylation of IRF3 and IRF7, activation of NFB and the expression of proinflammatory genes and interferons1,2,3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the crucial role TBK1 plays in regulating innate immunity, recent studies suggest that TBK1 participates in pathways leading to survival and cellular transformation7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RalB-mediated activation of TBK1 promotes TBK1 assembly with the exocyst complex through its interaction with Sec5 leading to inflammatory responses and prosurvival signalling by directly phosphorylating multiple sites on Akt8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TBK1 is essential for the survival of non-small cell lung cancers driven by oncogenic KRAS9,10,11; this synthetic lethal interaction of TBK1 with mutant K-Ras was governed by its ability to activate NFB anti-apoptotic signalling through c-Rel and BCL-XL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TBK1 also contributes to prostate cancer dormancy and drug resistance by inhibiting mTOR12, and to tamoxifen resistance of breast cancer cells by enhancing transcriptional activity of ER7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'TBK1 has been reported to phosphorylate the mitotic kinase PLK1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13), but roles for TBK1 in mitosis have not been investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate direct roles for TBK1 in regulating mitosis, where it binds to and phosphorylates CEP170, a forkhead domain and centrosome- and spindle microtubule-associated protein14, as well as NuMA, which associates with the pericentrosomal domains of the spindle apparatus and is necessary for cytokinesis15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate that TBK1 regulates microtubule dynamics and also mitotic progression by modulating CEP170 and NuMA functions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The successful partition of replicated genomes requires chromosome attachment to opposite poles of mitotic spindles or centrosomes during cell division34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any defects in this assembly result in increased frequency of chromosome segregation errors and chromosomal instability, which may accelerate tumour initiation and progression35,36,37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kinases direct several of the complex steps of mitosis, including the serine/threonine kinases CDK1, PLK1, NEK2 and the Aurora Kinases39,40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, microtubule dynamics is controlled by the kinesin 13 family of depolymerases (Kif2a, Kif2b and Kif2c/MCAK) and Kif2b stably associates with the microtubule-binding protein CEP170 that recruits Kif2b to the mitotic spindle20,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our studies now show that TBK1-directed phosphorylation of CEP170 is required for its interaction with Kif2b and with centrosomes, and that inhibition or knockdown of TBK1 augments microtubule stability to inhibit mitosis by disabling the TBK1CEP170 complex and reducing the interactions of CEP170 with centrosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we show that TBK1 phosphorylates and controls the association of NuMA with dynein, and its localization to the spindle poles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NuMA is phosphorylated during the initial stages of mitosis by p34/cdc2 and NuMA phosphorylation regulates its interaction with dynein, which deposits NuMA at spindle poles where it tethers microtubules15,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our studies now reveal TBK1 as another kinase that phosphorylates NuMA and that is required for its association with dynein and for localization of NuMA to the centrosomes in mitotic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although our study demonstrates that TBK1 is activated before the onset of mitosis and is required for successful cell division, it is not clear what upstream signalling events or kinases initiate mitosis-specific activation of TBK1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies indicate that clustering of TBK1 molecules allow inter-dimer interactions leading to trans-autophosphorylation43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, TBK1 can be activated by IKK in immune cells on innate immune signalling44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During viral infection, GSK3 is known to associate with TBK1 and promote self-association and autophosphorylation at S172; however, the effect of GSK3 on TBK1 is independent of its kinase activity45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar mode of mitotic kinase activation is observed in case of Aurora A: LIM protein ajuba interacts with Aurora A in mitotic cells and induces autophosphorylation and consequent activation of Aurora A46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is tempting to speculate that other interacting proteins might be triggering trans-autophosphorylation of TBK1 for mitotic commitment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further investigations are needed to assess whether canonical IKKs or mitotic kinases such as CDK1 or a non-kinase interacting partner activate TBK1 during mitosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'TBK1 has been shown to be necessary for the survival of mutant K-Ras-expressing tumour cells, where TBK1 signalling induces c-Rel and BCL-XL10 and activates Akt7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent genome wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen to identify synthetic lethal interactions of mutant K-Ras demonstrated an enrichment for genes the encode proteins having mitotic functions including PLK-1 and anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding that TBK1 functions are necessary for mitosis suggests that the dependency of mutant K-Ras tumour cells on TBK1 for cellular transformation also reflects its roles in directing progression through mitosis, by targeting PLK1 as well as other targets like CEP170 and NuMA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mitotic roles of TBK1 also has implications for the innate immune response, where TBK1 mediates signalling events downstream of TLRs and plays a pivotal role in the activation of innate immunity in response to viral and bacterial infections3,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, recent studies suggest that TLRs are also expressed in several cancer types and that TLR signalling contributes to tumorigenesis by promoting cell survival, chemoresistance, immune evasion and metastasis43,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, mitotic functions of TBK1 are likely to play an essential role in such oncogenic processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, this new role of TBK1 also opens new avenues for targeting TBK1 in cancer, to induce mitotic catastrophe and cell death.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
