Iron limitation of microbial phosphorus acquisition in the tropical North Atlantic  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In certain regions of the predominantly nitrogen limited ocean, microbes can become co-limited by phosphorus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within such regions, a proportion of the dissolved organic phosphorus pool can be accessed by microbes employing a variety of alkaline phosphatase (APase) enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the PhoA family of APases that utilize zinc as a cofactor, the recent discovery of iron as a cofactor in the more widespread PhoX and PhoD implies the potential for a biochemically dependant interplay between oceanic zinc, iron and phosphorus cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate enhanced natural community APase activity following iron amendment within the low zinc and moderately low iron Western North Atlantic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast we find no evidence for trace metal limitation of APase activity beneath the Saharan dust plume in the Eastern Atlantic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such intermittent iron limitation of microbial phosphorus acquisition provides an additional facet in the argument for iron controlling the coupling between oceanic nitrogen and phosphorus cycles.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In the (sub)tropical North Atlantic, supply of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) through diazotrophic N2 fixation1,2,3 results in drawdown of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP), to the extent that growth of phytoplankton1,3,4,5 and heterotrophic bacteria6 can be enhanced by the simultaneous addition of both nutrients relative to supply of N alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microbial communities experiencing such a shortage of P upregulate production of phosphatase enzymes that hydrolyse P-esters, a large constituent of the oceanic dissolved organic P (DOP) pool, thereby supplying additional DIP for cell growth7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the DOP pool can be orders of magnitude larger than that of DIP in surface ocean waters2,8, the factors regulating access to this pool are likely important for controlling marine primary production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the identity and prevalence of eukaryotic alkaline phosphatases (APases) remain poorly resolved9,10,11,12, analyses of ocean metagenomic data sets have suggested that the phosphate monoesterases comprising the PhoA, PhoX and PhoD families constitute the dominant bacterial phosphatases in the ocean13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative availability of obligate metal cofactors activating these phosphatases have subsequently been suggested as an important environmental regulator of expression15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Until recently, cofactor requirements were understood to be two zinc (Zn) and one magnesium (Mg) ions for PhoA (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18), three calcium (Ca) ions for PhoX (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19) and an unknown number of Ca ions for PhoD (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is now known that PhoX and PhoD, which collectively dominate bacterial alkaline phosphatases in the ocean13,14, have additional requirements of two and one iron (Fe) ions per enzyme, respectively21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These discoveries present the possibility that the availability of Fe, which is often depleted to biologically significant low levels in the surface ocean23, could influence microbial P acquisition21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Eight factorial-style nutrient treatment bioassay experiments were conducted in the tropical North Atlantic in May 2015 to investigate regulation of APase by Fe and Zn supply within the context of N and P availability (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four experiments in two pairs (Experiments 1 and 2 in the West Atlantic, and Experiments 4 and 5 in the East Atlantic) collectively covered the entire NPFeZn nutrient treatment factorial on each side of the Atlantic, with the remaining four individual experiments having a reduced NPFe(+NZn) design (89 treatment combinations in triplicate).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surface seawater collection and treatment was conducted using strict trace-metal-clean procedures and incubated water was assessed after 48 h for changes in chlorophyll a concentrations, flow cytometric cell counts, and APase activities (APA) measured via a fluorometric assay24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment responses were interpreted relative to triplicate unaltered control bottles, and the phytoplankton community composition, nutrient and trace metal concentrations of initial seawater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that Fe can become limiting to whole microbial community APase activity distal to the Saharan dust plume in the tropical Western North Atlantic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a role for Fe in P acquisition, alongside requirements for both photosynthesis and N2 fixation2,3,4, further underscores the critical role of this element in regulating the productivity of past and future (sub)tropical ocean systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Experiment locations in context of cross-Atlantic nutrient trends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Experimental start locations (stars) on a background of surface ocean DIP* calculated from annual average WOA nutrient concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DIP* represents excess available dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) based on a 16:1 N:P requirement of phytoplankton (=DIPDIN/16; DIN is dissolved inorganic nitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thin black line is the cruise transect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) DIP* as for the main panel but at a global scale highlighting DIP deficiency in the North Atlantic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Total soluble aerosol iron (Fe) deposition estimated by a model (relative units, darker shading=higher Fe deposition).Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cross-Atlantic nutrient trends', 'As for previous studies in the (sub)tropical North Atlantic, we encountered waters that were depleted in DIP (mean excess DIP (DIP*)=9.9 nmol l1, s.d.=16.0 nmol l1, n=37) yet host to a relatively large residual DOP pool (mean=322 nmol l1, s.d.=72 nmol l1, n=33;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our findings are relevant for understanding the coupling and evolution of nutrient cycles and their response to anthropogenic drivers (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The essential role of Fe in marine N2 fixation is well known3,4, and for this reason Fe has been suggested to regulate N input to the ocean, thus indirectly exerting a control on oceanic productivity over long timescales28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultimately the oceanic P reservoir sets an upper constraint on productivity over geological timescales, as unlike N, inputs to the surface ocean are not biologically regulated29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the extent to which the upper productivity constraint imposed by the P inventory is approached will be dictated by the overall efficiency of upper ocean P utilization over both short30 and long28 timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any restriction of overall DOP reactivity due to trace metal requirements could thus be hypothesized to represent one mechanism for reducing overall P utilization efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As for the photosynthetic apparatus and N2 fixation, APases likely first evolved in an ancient ocean enriched in Fe and lower in Zn (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A maintained reliance on PhoX and PhoD, for microbes13,14, in the modern well-oxygenated ocean may initially appear paradoxical given the extent of Fe depletion in many surface regions23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is reasonable to assume that broad-scale marine biogeochemical systems where microbial communities had a tendency to experience P stress in the geological past likely resulted from elevated N2 fixation depleting excess DIP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This in turn would require an adequate and sustained Fe supply, as is the case in the modern day (sub)tropical North Atlantic3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Making these assumptions, it thus follows that only under relatively Fe-enriched conditions would a strong dependence on APases existpotentially reducing selective pressure away from the use of Fe-dependant PhoX and PhoD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, on smaller geographic scales, for example across marked nutrient province boundaries3, strong and dynamic micro- and macro-nutrient gradients31 may potentially impose selection pressures conferring advantages to APase enzymes with alternative cofactors (for example, ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In contrast to Fe, enhanced aerosol deposition is not synonymous with elevated Zn (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore Zn appears to be highly depleted both in the surface (Fig 2) and more generally within the upper Atlantic ocean33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is partly due to the depletion of this element within the source waters feeding the thermocline, particularly of the Atlantic, as a result of high removal within the Southern Ocean33,34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both limited aerosol sources and high removal rates from the upper ocean at high latitudes in the Southern Ocean could hence lead to relatively low Zn availability within anticipated regions of DIP depletion within high Fe, low latitude systems, further pointing towards reduced selective advantage for widespread Zn-containing PhoA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recognition of Fe as a common cofactor for both N2 fixation and dominant DOP hydrolysis enzymes may thus help reconcile the high N2 fixation rates measured in regions of the (sub)tropical North Atlantic with DIP deficiency (Fig 1b,c)3,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, alongside previous observations15, our data suggest that the relatively short residence time of Fe in the surface waters of this region37, combined with variable Fe inputs31, may both result in spatiotemporal variability in DOP requirements and hence at least localized incidences where Fe and/or Zn (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15) becomes limiting for APA (for example, Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although the consequences of such intermittent trace metal limitation of APA remain difficult to quantify for the overall use efficiency of P at a system scale, anthropogenic perturbations have the potential to further alter any interactions between the Zn, Fe and P cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anthropogenic N inputs to the oceans continue to increase rapidly38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resultant feedbacks remain poorly constrained, with one possibility being a displacement of N2 fixation that may leave P demand largely unaltered1,40; while alternatively, if anthropogenic N input becomes additive to N2 fixation and coupled with a lower limit in the plasticity of P requirements of phytoplankton communities41,42, a shift to proximal P limitation could be induced39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the latter case, our findings would point towards any coincident alterations to fluxes and bioavailability of Fe, and possibly Zn (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15), becoming increasingly important in regulating DOP utilization and hence potentially the P use efficiency and productivity of (sub)tropical oceanic systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work adding important detail to the role of Fe demonstrated in this study, including the potential specificity of different APases for diverse DOP quality7,14,43 and developing linkages between APase expression, abundance and activity for the most relevant taxonomic groups43,44,45,46, will help in developing the foundation needed to address these questions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
