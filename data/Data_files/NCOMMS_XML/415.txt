Overfishing and nutrient pollution interact with temperature to disrupt coral reefs down to microbial scales  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Losses of corals worldwide emphasize the need to understand what drives reef decline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stressors such as overfishing and nutrient pollution may reduce resilience of coral reefs by increasing coralalgal competition and reducing coral recruitment, growth and survivorship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such effects may themselves develop via several mechanisms, including disruption of coral microbiomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the results of a 3-year field experiment simulating overfishing and nutrient pollution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These stressors increase turf and macroalgal cover, destabilizing microbiomes, elevating putative pathogen loads, increasing disease more than twofold and increasing mortality up to eightfold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Above-average temperatures exacerbate these effects, further disrupting microbiomes of unhealthy corals and concentrating 80% of mortality in the warmest seasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, nutrients also increase bacterial opportunism and mortality in corals bitten by parrotfish, turning normal trophic interactions deadly for corals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, overfishing and nutrient pollution impact reefs down to microbial scales, killing corals by sensitizing them to predation, above-average temperatures and bacterial opportunism.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Tropical reefs continue to lose coral cover worldwide due to a variety of anthropogenic stressors, including warming ocean temperatures, nutrient pollution, sedimentation and overfishing1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thermal stress from sustained periods of high temperature can kill corals by driving widespread coral bleaching events and coral disease outbreaks2,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Localized stressors can also greatly impact corals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, elevated nutrients and overfishing of herbivorous fishes increase algal abundance on reefs6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Competition with these algae can compromise coral recruitment, growth and survivorship9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intersecting impacts of these local stressors may ultimately compromise the resilience of reefs to disturbances, such as hurricanes and thermal anomalies1,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Algal competition and elevated temperatures may also impact reefs by disrupting corals symbiotic microorganisms, which serve functions ranging from nitrogen fixation13 to pathogen inhibition14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decades of coral microbiology research13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26 demonstrate that coral microbiomes are sensitive to multiple stressors, including algal competition, elevated temperatures and disease20,22,23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of this research, several qualitative and quantitative models have been proposed for the effects of algal competition or temperature on the coral microbiome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DDAM hypothesis (dissolved organic carbon, disease, algae and microbes)27 suggests that turf and macroalgae secrete dissolved organic carbon28, which increases growth and oxygen consumption of bacteria29,30 (but see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31), ultimately harming corals through hypoxia17,26,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two additional, non-mutually exclusive hypotheses are that algae produce allelochemicals that directly harm corals, with possible downstream effects on the microbiome20 and that interactions with certain algae lead to transfer of algae-associated microbes to corals19,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Sea-surface temperatures also strongly impact the coral microbiome15,16,24,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While mass coral bleaching caused by high levels of thermal stress has received the greatest attention, even modest increases in temperature appear to make corals more vulnerable to opportunistic bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elevated temperatures increase the release of dimethylsulfoniopropionate from corals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many opportunistic microorganisms chemotax along gradients of dimethylsulfoniopropionate, potentially allowing them to target thermally stressed corals34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elevated temperatures also increase expression of virulence genes in some opportunistic bacteria35, alter innate immune gene expression in corals36 and inhibit the protective role of bacteria in the coral mucus37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations have prompted mathematical models of competition between coral mutualists and pathogens, suggesting that temperature variation mediates changes between pathogen- and mutualist-dominated stable states25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Together, this research strongly suggests that human impacts such as overfishing and nutrient pollution may interact with sea-surface temperatures to cause changes in coral reef benthic communities and their microbiomes that together contribute to coral mortality17,18,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Much of the foundational work on how corals respond to global and local stressors has been done in short-term, small-scale lab and field experiments based at the organismal level (for example, refs 16, 17, 19, 24, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is difficult to extrapolate these prior results to determine how factors that are thought to contribute to coral decline interact to alter coral benthic communities and their microbiomes over ecologically realistic temporal and spatial scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we designed a long-term field experiment to examine how altering herbivory and nutrient pollution impacted coralalgalmicrobe interactions within the context of seasonal temperature variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we sought to test the following main hypotheses over ecologically relevant spatial and temporal scales: (1) exclusion of herbivores and nutrient pollution both increase the abundance, and diversity of turf and macroalgae, leading to intensified coralalgal competition and additive increases in coral tissue loss and mortality; (2) coralalgal competition interacts with above-average temperatures to shift coral microbiomes away from their normal configuration and towards distinct, pathogen-dominated stable states; and (3) alterations to the coral microbiome due to increased algal competition or above-average temperatures positively correlate with increased coral disease, and reduced coral growth and survivorship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To test these hypotheses, we conducted a 3-year field experiment (June 2009August 2012) that simulated overfishing and nutrient pollution on a reef in the Florida Keys, USA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tracked their impacts on the benthic community, coralmicrobe dynamics and coral survivorship across multiple seasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To simulate nutrient pollution, four 9-m2 plots of reef benthos were enriched in nitrogen and phosphorus, while four control plots remained at ambient nutrient levels (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enrichment increased nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations approximately four- eightfold above ambient, similar to reefs impacted by nutrient pollution (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We simulated overfishing of herbivorous fishes (for example, parrotfishes and surgeonfishes) by nesting two 1 m2 herbivore exclosures and two 1 m2 open-topped exclosure controls within each plot (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This created factorial treatments of: (1) control, (2) herbivore exclusion, (3) enriched nutrients and (4) herbivore exclusion plus enriched nutrients (Supplementary Notes; Supplementary Data 1 sheet b).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

see Supplementary Data 3 sheet f for turf algae and cyanobacteria specifically).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, conditions favoring different opportunists overlapped, rendering the specific opportunist that displaced Synechococcales partially stochastic and not predictable from random forest analysis of ecological data (Supplementary Data 3 sheet h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Antibiotic-producing bacteria may play an important role in protecting corals from outbreaks of harmful bacteria14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our data, opportunistic Proteobacteria reached their highest abundance in corals, where Actinobacteria were below 2.5% relative abundance (Supplementary Fig 4), suggesting that antibiotic-secreting Actinobacteria may help to protect corals from opportunists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Actinobacteria, in turn, decreased with increasing algal cover or elevated temperatures, suggesting that these stressors remove an important biotic barrier to potential pathogens (Supplementary Fig 3;

Supplementary Data 4 sheets a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing upright algal cover was also correlated with predicted increases in the abundance of genes for utilization of glycans and pentose sugars in the coral microbiome (Supplementary Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, upright algal cover was associated with decreases in seven categories of metabolic pathways related to amino acid metabolism and four related to lipid and fatty acid metabolism (Supplementary Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data support the idea that increased algal cover promotes growth of microbes on the coral surface that are capable of rapid microbial metabolism of algal sugars17,26,32,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Algae and temperature increase coral microbiome -diversity', 'Stressful conditions may shift coral microbiomes from one stable state to another25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We had originally hypothesized that algal competition would produce such a shift in the structure of coral microbiomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we did not find any evidence for such treatment-induced shifts between alternative stable states (Supplementary Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, we found that algal contact and increased ambient temperatures reduced the overall stability of the microbiome as a whole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This type of microbiome destabilization was manifest as increased sample-to-sample variability and quantified using measures of microbiome -diversity (for example, ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While -diversity was originally used to describe species turnover among habitats43, in microbial ecology host organisms are often treated as the relevant habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allows -diversity measures to be used to compare inter-individual variation in the microbiome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This notion has also been generalized to measure species turnover within individuals over time (intra-individual variation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, few studies (notably ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  42) have emphasized the relationship between the health of animal hosts and the variability of their microbiomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In our experiment, algal contact or elevated temperature drove blooms of microbial opportunists that destabilized coral microbiomes, increasing -diversity between samples taken from corals subject to these stressors (Supplementary Figs 6ad and 7ab).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increased inter-individual and/or temporal variation manifested as increased dispersion of samples from stressed hosts around a centroid of samples from healthy hosts, rather than discrete clusters of samples representing healthy versus diseased hosts (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Algae-driven increases in -diversity were largely consistent, regardless of whether corals were analysed together or separately by genus (although not individually significant for Porites;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We demonstrate that overfishing and nutrient pollution alter benthic communities, causing coral microbiome disruption, blooms of opportunistic coral pathogens and long-term increases in coral disease, tissue loss and mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This experimental framework, which combines classical ecological field experiments with microbial time series, allowed us to test key predictions of how coral reefs respond to human impacts over ecologically important time scales and with much greater microbiological detail than has previously been possible in field experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results changed our view of how coral microbiomes respond to environmental stressors; uncovered new interactions among corallivory, nutrient pollution and bacterial opportunism; and quantified how local stressors interact with seasonal temperature variation to impact coral microbiomes and, ultimately, coral survivorship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results show how altering important trophic interactions can fundamentally reorganize coral reefs down to microbial scales, with multiple negative consequences for reef health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We predicted that simulated overfishing or nutrient pollution would drive distinct benthic community changes and that these benthic changes would additively increase coral mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, we predicted that exclusion of herbivores would lead to large increases in the abundance and diversity of macroalgae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, nutrient pollution would only modestly increase macroalgal cover and diversity, instead driving growth of nutrient-limited but unpalatable members of the benthic community such as Cyanobacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to past work (for example, refs 6, 7, 8), we show that herbivore removal rapidly leads to over sixfold increases in algal abundance and threefold increases in algal diversity, as well as intense coralalgal competition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of the algal genera that increased, such as Sargassum, Dictyota, Amphiroa and Turbinaria, cause coral tissue loss or mortality via shading, abrasion and allelopathy38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nutrient enrichment led to lower overall increases in algal abundance, but facilitated growth of certain taxa such as Cyanobacteria and filamentous turf algae, which can compete intensely with corals10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the consequences of these local stressors for coral mortality deviated greatly from our prior expectations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expected herbivore removal and nutrient pollution to have additive effects on corals, with their combined effects causing much greater coral mortality than either individually.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, while all treatments significantly increased coral tissue loss and coral mortality above controls, levels of mortality and tissue loss were similar under nutrient pollution, herbivore removal or combined treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern likely resulted from different mechanisms of coral tissue loss and mortality operating in the different treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the nutrient pollution treatment, we traced coral decline to an unexpected interaction among corallivory, nutrient pollution, bacterial opportunism and coral death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parrotfishes are key herbivores on reefs, but also prey on corals as part of their diet48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This corallivory is relatively intense in the Florida Keys, USA where populations of parrotfishes are robust49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we found that Porites corals bitten by parrotfish lost tissue and died at much higher rates under nutrient-enriched conditions than in ambient conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, parrotfish corallivory caused no mortality in ambient nutrient conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microbial community shifts towards Proteobacteria on the surface of bitten and nutrient-enriched corals (but not bitten corals in ambient nutrient conditions) suggest that increased bacterial opportunism following wounding may cause this increased tissue loss and mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not clear whether the observed increase in Proteobacteria is due to a proliferation of pathogens vectored by parrotfish (as suggested for butterflyfishes50) or represents a more general nutrient-driven increase in susceptibility to infection following wounding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In either case, this unexpected observation is especially worrisome, as it shows that nutrient pollution turns parrotfishes, which are normally thought of as coral allies, into agents of mortality for some corals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is important given that nutrient pollution is a problem on many reefs and that restoration of parrotfish populations is an important goal as part of coral conservation and management51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that restoration of parrotfishes without efforts to combat water quality issues could have surprisingly negative consequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'When herbivorous fishes were removed, coralalgal competition and disruption of the coral microbiome appeared to be the main drivers of coral mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed that algal contact increases coral microbiome richness, facilitates growth of many conditionally rare taxa and increases overall microbiome destabilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is broadly consistent with previous reports of algal alteration of coral microbiomes through mechanisms such as provision of algal neutral sugars41, secondary effects of alleotoxins on the coral microbiome20 and/or transfer of microbes19,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In keeping with the prediction that local algal competition will increase disease27,33 (for example, through dissolved organic carbon27 or other mechanisms33), we found that the presence of algal competition corresponded to an increased prevalence of DSS52 in Siderastrea corals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These algae-induced changes to coral microbiology and disease prevalence correlate with increased long-term coral tissue loss and mortality in the field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our work shows that microbial interactions that were predicted to be important drivers of coral mortality in laboratory studies can be induced by overfishing and nutrient pollution, with important and ecologically meaningful effects for the long-term health of corals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our long-term results also provide strong contrasts with existing models of coral microbiome dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Qualitative and quantitative models of the coral microbiome have generally assumed that stress would shift coral microbiomes towards stable states dominated by pathogens (for example, ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On this basis, we predicted that coralalgal competition, nutrient enrichment and/or above-average temperatures would shift coral microbiomes to alternative stable states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While we did confirm the general idea that multiple stressors increase the abundance of fast-growing opportunists on the coral surface, our data do not support a model in which overfishing and nutrient pollution, ensuing algal competition, or seasonal temperature variation drive coral microbiomes to specific alternative stable states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we found that above-average temperatures or algal contact destabilized the microbiome, shifting microbial communities from a stable to an unstable configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding mirrors recent reports in disturbed human and primate microbiomes42,53, suggesting an underexplored pattern that may be common to many hostmicrobe systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In other animal systems, increased microbiome variability during stress is thought to reflect decreased ability of the host, or its native microbiota, to regulate microbial community composition42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that algal competition and periods of above-average temperature intersect to influence, which bacteria dominate coral microbiomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both of these factors promote stochastic blooms of opportunistic bacteria that displace typically dominant members of the coral surface mucus layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microbiomes dominated by putatively opportunistic orders, such as Vibrionales, Rhodobacterales, Flavobacterales and Cytophagales were much less stable (as measured by increased -diversity of microbial communities) than those dominated by Synechococcales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is interesting because some coral pathogens, such as Vibrio coralliilyticus have been shown to suppress coral innate immune pathways36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immune suppression may, in turn, affect the ability of a coral to regulate its microbiome, increasing temporal and/or inter-colony variation in microbiome composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Similarly, many reports have quantified the anti-microbial properties of coral mucus14, including the contribution of antibiotic-producing Actinobacteria54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our long-term data set suggests that Actinobacteria are important for suppressing opportunists, as outbreaks of Proteobacteria opportunists were more common when Actinobacteria were in low abundance on the coral surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with this model, corals exposed to above-average temperature or algal contact showed lower predicted abundances of microbial pathways involved in antibiotic production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Algal contact also reduced the abundance of Actinobacteria, suggesting that algal competition following herbivore removal will lower the natural defenses of corals against potential pathogens, including genera such as Vibrio that are especially problematic at high temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, we find that local overfishing and nutrient pollution interact with seasonal temperature variation to render corals more vulnerable to blooms of harmful bacteria and increased mortality during the warmest months.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, mild, sub-bleaching thermal stress during summer months did not increase coral mortality under control conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Connections between local stressors and temperature variation are often discussed in the field in the context of climate change, and have been incorporated into models of reef vulnerability or resilience55,56, as well as coral disease susceptibility15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, experimental evidence connecting laboratory studies of microbial dynamics to coral mortality in the field has been lacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our data, bacterial opportunism increased at temperatures around the local MMM, consistent with past predictions of a threshold at which bacterial pathogenesis becomes especially problematic based on laboratory studies15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also in agreement with previous coral microbiome field studies16, we observe blooms of Vibrio during periods of above-average temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Motility genes were enriched in these microbiomes, supporting the idea that chemotaxis towards thermally stressed corals, previously shown in microfluidic experiments, may play an important role in coral microbiome dynamics at above-average temperatures34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We extend these observations both by documenting how various combinations of algal competition and temperature favour different bacterial opportunists, and linking these blooms to losses of protective symbionts such as Actinobacteria caused by local stressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, our data connects microbiome destabilization caused by these blooms to coral tissue loss in the experiment overall, and especially in periods of high temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, multiple lines of evidence collected in this study support an ecologically relevant role for coral microbiomes in mediating coral mortality driven by the intersection of local stressors and seasonal temperature variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Together, our results provide experimental data linking prevailing models of how human impacts alter reef ecology6 with models of how coral microbiomes respond to algal competition and temperature15,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They show that overfishing and nutrient pollution increase the vulnerability of corals to blooms of opportunistic microorganisms and that the impacts of these local stressors are exacerbated by above-average temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the coral species that suffered high mortality rates in our experiments are now some of the most abundant on Caribbean reefs57,58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, some coral species that have withstood the recent decline of more vulnerable relatives may nonetheless be susceptible to increasing local stressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, sufficiently extreme thermal anomalies and mass bleaching events will kill corals regardless of local factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our work suggests that conserving natural trophic interactions by protecting herbivorous fishes and reducing nutrient pollution may help stabilize coral microbiomes and shield corals against temperature-driven bacterial opportunism and mortality, at least in the near term15.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Experimental design', 'To simulate the effects of overfishing, nutrient loading or the combination of these stressors, we conducted a 3-year field experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four pairs of 9-m2 plots were established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One member of each of these pairs was enriched with nitrogen and phosphorous, while the other remained at ambient nutrient levels (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These plots were 10 m from each other in all cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each 9-m2 plot was delineated into nine 1-m2 subplots with metal nails driven into the reef at the corners and centre of each plot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The locations of the plots were selected such that initial variation in rugosity and algal cover within each subplot was minimal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within each plot, two randomly selected subplots were enclosed with herbivore exclosures, while two other random subplots were selected as exclosure controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exclosure controls were fitted with open-topped exclosures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These controls allowed access by herbivorous fishes, but acted as controls for other potential artifacts of the cages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'All exclosures were made of plastic-coated wire mesh with 2.5-cm diameter holes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This diameter mesh generally excludes most fishes 10 cm total length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Smaller or juvenile herbivorous fishes are able to enter the exclosures, but these smaller herbivores generally contribute little to overall grazing rates on reefs and have minimal impacts on the algal communities59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, access by smaller herbivores reflects patterns seen under intensive fishing, in which larger fish species are preferentially harvested while leaving smaller size classes of fish60,61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We scrubbed both exclosures and exclosure controls every 46 weeks to remove fouling organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Nutrient pollution was simulated using slow-release fertilizer diffusers applied to each nutrient enrichment plot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each diffuser was a 15-cm diameter PVC tube, perforated with six 1.5 cm holes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The open ends of the PVC tube were wrapped in fine plastic mesh to keep fertilizer pellets inside, but allow diffusion of soluble nutrients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 175 g of Osmocote (19612, NPK) slow-release fertilizer was loaded into each diffuser.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PVC enrichment tubes were attached to each metal nail within the 9-m2 enrichment plots for a total of 25 enrichment tubes per enrichment plot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nutrients were replaced every 3040 days to ensure continued delivery of N and P. Previous studies have shown Osmocote delivery using similar methods to be an effective way of enriching water column nutrients in benthic systems (for example, ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Confirmation of the efficacy of nutrient enrichment', 'Nitrogen and phosphorus levels were assessed in the water column above each enrichment and control plot as in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In July of 2009, 2010 and 2011, divers used 60-ml syringes to slowly draw water from 3 cm above the benthos in either control or enriched plots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were taken 30 days after nutrient diffuser deployment to ensure that enrichment occurred across the duration of diffuser deployment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immediately after collection, samples were filtered (GF/F) into acid-washed bottles, placed on ice, returned to the laboratory and frozen until analysed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN=ammonium and nitrite+nitrate) and soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations were determined via autoanalyser.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also assessed nutrient enrichment efficiency by analysing tissue carbon:nitrogen (C:N) levels in the common alga Dictyota menstrualis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nutrient content of macroalgae such as D. menstrualis reflects ambient nutrient conditions over longer time scales (that is, weeks to months) than ambient water column nutrients (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  63 and references therein).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We collected D. menstrualis from both enriched and control treatments during the same months as water samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissues were dried at 60 °C, ground to a powder and analysed for %C and %N content with a CHN Carlo-Erba elemental analyzer (NA1500).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nutrient data from both water and

counting individuals of the different herbivorous fishes in the genera Sparisoma, Scarus, Acanthurus and Kyphosus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fishes were identified to species and their length was estimated to the nearest centimetre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used published length:weight relationships64 to convert fish densities into herbivore biomass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analysed these data with one-factor ANOVA

week intervals), we visually quantified benthic cover within four, 50 × 50 cm quadrats in each of the 1 m2 treatment areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These quadrats were divided into 49 points, and benthic organisms under each point were identified to species or genus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Algae that are challenging to identify taxonomically under field conditions (for example, crustose coralline algae and filamentous algae) were classified into algal functional groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Filamentous algae were classified into short algal turf (0.5 cm in height) or algal turf (0.5 cm in height) given that taller, thicker algal turf can often be deleterious to coral health and growth10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Benthic cover was quantified in June 2009 1 week before treatments were initiated to provide a baseline from which to assess changes in algal abundance and community structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant differences among treatments in algal abundance could be detected at the beginning of the experiment (see initial time points in Fig 1a,b), as expected given random assignment of subplots to treatment conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, during the summer of each year (20092012) when algal cover was often at its highest, we also surveyed open areas of reef (areas that did not have three-sided exclosure controls) within the 9-m2 plots to assess whether the exclosure controls had any effect on algal abundance or community composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not detect any differences in algal abundance or community composition between the open unmanipulated areas and exclosure

changes in coral colony health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each picture a ruler or object of known size was placed next to the coral to provide scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, we tracked the fate of 226 individual corals spread across each of the treatments for over 3 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most common corals were Porites porites (41.1 % of corals), Agaricia spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (17.7 % of corals), Siderastrea siderea (15.5 % of corals) and P. astreoides (11.5 % of corals).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These corals allowed us to evaluate the impact of the different treatments on coral growth or tissue loss across the time course of the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We scored growth or tissue loss on a 12-point scale, with bins corresponding to amounts of tissue loss that could be readily observed in photographs (for example, 2=1025% tissue loss).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We scored the tissue loss or gain of each coral over the course of the experiment on the following scale: 6=100% tissue loss, 5=7590% loss, 4=5075% loss, 3=2550% loss, 2=1025% loss, 1=010% loss, 0=0% loss/gain, 1=010% gain, 2=1025% gain, 3=2550% gain, 4=5075% gain, 5=7590% gain and 6100% gain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then converted these scores to mean loss/gain by averaging the range corresponding to that score.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, a coral with a 3 score would be converted to a 37% tissue loss value.

interpretation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, at each time point we scored each coral for: (1) algal competition as measured by direct contact with algal competitors (and the identification of that algal competitor), (2) the presence of overlying sediment on the coral, (3) predation scars from parrotfishes and invertebrate corallivores (only the former were observed at appreciable levels), and (4) signs of bleaching or disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primary coral disease observed was DSS (see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  52 for additional discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Statistical analysis of benthic cover and coral health', 'Algal cover was analysed using mixed effects models to determine whether the response variable differed among enrichment treatment, herbivore treatment and seasons, as well as whether there was an enrichment × herbivore × season interaction (Supplementary Data 1 sheet c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nested, split-plot design of the experiment was incorporated into the model by nesting replicates of the exclosures and exclosure controls within ambient or nutrient-enriched plots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analysed cover for important species or functional groups, as well as for overall upright algal cover, which is a proxy for the competitive environment of corals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upright algal cover included all macroalgae and tall filamentous turf, but excluded crustose coralline algae and short filamentous turf as these two functional groups are relatively benign for corals10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we assessed how herbivore exclusion, nutrient pollution and season impacted algal community structure via PCoA of BrayCurtis divergences, as well as permutational MANOVA (PERMANOVA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Per cent coral mortality per treatment and coral tissue loss were analysed using similar mixed models to algal cover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For growth measures, corals were nested within ambient or enriched plots, but we did not incorporate season as we only analysed change in tissue for corals at the end of the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated tissue loss statistics either excluding or including corals that suffered total colony mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Corals that died suffered total colony morality and therefore 100% loss of live tissue area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Including these corals in coral growth analyses resulted in non-normal distributions that could not be corrected via transformations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we analysed coral growth both excluding the corals that died, which satisfied normality requirements for the analyses, and including the corals that died.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both analyses produced relatively consistent results (Supplementary Data 5), with the exception that only the interaction of herbivory × nutrient loading was significant in Porites corals (rather than each factor also being individually significant) when total colony mortality was excluded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a 2-test to determine
