miR-625-3p regulates oxaliplatin resistance by targeting MAP2K6-p38 signalling in human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Oxaliplatin resistance in colorectal cancers (CRC) is a major medical problem, and predictive markers are urgently needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, miR-625-3p was reported as a promising predictive marker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, we show that miR-625-3p functionally induces oxaliplatin resistance in CRC cells, and identify the signalling networks affected by miR-625-3p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the p38 MAPK activator MAP2K6 is a direct target of miR-625-3p, and, accordingly, is downregulated in non-responder patients of oxaliplatin therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  miR-625-3p-mediated resistance is reversed by anti-miR-625-3p treatment and ectopic expression of a miR-625-3p insensitive MAP2K6 variant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, reduction of p38 signalling by using siRNAs, chemical inhibitors or expression of a dominant-negative MAP2K6 protein induces resistance to oxaliplatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcriptome, proteome and phosphoproteome profiles confirm inactivation of MAP2K6-p38 signalling as one likely mechanism of oxaliplatin resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study shows that miR-625-3p induces oxaliplatin resistance by abrogating MAP2K6-p38-regulated apoptosis and cell cycle control networks, and corroborates the predictive power of miR-625-3p.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed malignant disease in the western world1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 25% of the patients present with a disseminated, stage IV disease and in further 1015% of patients with initially localized disease, metastases will develop within 5 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no predictive biomarker for standard chemotherapeutic treatment is available and as many as 50% of the patients do not obtain an objective response to first-line treatment2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the identification of predictive biomarkers for response is of great importance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous, small non-coding RNAs that play essential roles in the regulation of gene expression3, and which have been linked to chemotherapy resistance4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, miR-625-3p was reported to be positively associated with lack of response to first-line oxaliplatin (oxPt)-based treatment in two independent cohorts of patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC)5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While that study suggested high expression of miR-625-3p to be a novel predictive marker for oxPt-resistance in a subset of mCRC patients, a possible functional relationship between miR-625-3p and cellular drug sensitivity was not examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we have constructed a transposon-based doxycycline (DOX) inducible vector to investigate the role of miR-625-3p in modulating oxPt sensitivity in CRC cells in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that on exposure to oxPt ectopic expression of miR-625-3p increases cell viability by decreasing apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we have identified direct and indirect targets of miR-625-3p dysregulation in these cells and in mCRC patients treated with first-line oxPt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that miR-625-3p directly targets and inhibits the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase MAP2K6 (also known as MKK6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, we find that miR-625-3p-induced resistance is associated with reduced MAP kinase signal transduction after genotoxic stress leading to a reduction of p38-mediated apoptosis and an increase in cell cycle progression signals.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

refs 35, 36, 37), and as such conveys p38-mediated cellular stress signalling10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presented results are consistent with a model were miR-625-3p through downregulation of MAP2K6 impairs p38-MAPK stress signalling (Fig 7h and Supplementary Fig 15c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to emphasize, however, that our model only addresses miR-625-3p signalling through MAP2K6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that miR-625-3p additionally could mediate resistance by regulating other unknown target proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On the basis of our results using chemical inhibitors and MAPK14 knockdown, and in agreement with other studies38,39, we are inclined to believe that the MAPK14 isoform of p38 is a mediator of miR-625-3p-induced oxPt resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are aware of the discrepancy in the effect on oxPt sensitity after chemical inhibition in two (SW620 and HCC2998) out of seven cell lines tested, which we attribute to the cell-specific off-targeting effects known to exist for SB203580 and SB202190 (refs 40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our phosphoproteome data in exponentially growing unstressed CRC cells also revealed that MAPK14 was the kinase whose activity (on a substrate level) was mostly affected by miR-625-3p induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, oxPt treatment showed increased activity of the MAPKAPK2 kinase, which is a canonical MAPK14 substrate and binding partner responsible for nuclear translocation of MAPK14 after stress42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that MAPK14MAPKAPK2 activation plays a role during oxPt response in cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such notion is further supported by our observation of reduced activity of MAPKAPK2 in oxPt-resistant HCT116.625 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We observed resistance to oxPt after miR-625-3p induction in all three cell modelswith the strongest phenotype obtained in HCT116 cellsdespite different levels of induction (3 × in HCT116, 25 × in HCC2998 and  greater than 400 × in SW620) and different degrees of MAP2K6 reduction (0.8 × in HCT116, 0.4 × in HCC2998 and 0.2 × in SW620).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the resulting level of MAP2K6 proteinrather than changes in miR-625-3p and MAP2K6 per sedetermines response to oxPt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternative explanations include cell-specific wiring and dependencies of the MAP2K6MAPK14 signalling pathway15, and diversity in a stress mediator downstream of MAPK14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An interesting candidate is TP53, which is mutated in SW620 and HCC2998 cells but wild type in HCT116.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These hypotheses will have to be addressed in future studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Induction of p38 signalling by platinum-based drugs has been ascribed a pro-apoptotic role in multiple types of cancer cells10,17,39,43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, p38 may also induce survival signals after cytotoxic stress45,46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, MAP2K3/6-p38-MAPKAPK2/3 activation has recently emerged as a third signalling axis during DNA damage response, alongside ATM-CHEK2 and ATR-CHEK1 (refs 48, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this setting, p38 signalling functions as a cell cycle checkpoint by deactivating CDC25s, cyclinE and CDK1 to prevent premature mitotic entry48,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the outcome from dysregulated p38 signalling in drug-treated cancer cells appears to be a function of several factors including the extent and nature of the cellular insult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In that respect, we note that increased sensitivity to the topoisomerase I inhibitor irinotecan (another drug used to treat CRC patients) has been shown to correlate with decreased p38 phosphorylation in CRC patients51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following this, CRC patients with high mir-625-3p levels and reduced MAP2K6MAPK14 signalling, and therefore resistance to oxPt, may instead benefit from irinotecan treatment as first-line therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The findings reported suggest that the expression level of miR-625-3p, possibly in combination with the expression level and activity of MAP2K6 and MAPK14, has the potential to serve as a biomarker for predicting response to oxPt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since up to 20% of mCRC patients show high miR-625-3p expression5, the number of patients that potentially could benefit from quantification of the miR-625-3p biomarker is substantial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the observation that anti-miR-625-3p treatment makes cells with high miR-625-3p level responsive to oxPt, indicates that it may be possible to sensitize patients with high miR-625-3p expressing cancers to oxPt by miR-625-3p antagonist treatment before, or simultaneously with, oxPt treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we have shown that overexpression of miR-625-3p in CRC cells can induce resistance to oxPt by directly targeting MAP2K6 and consequently inactivating genotoxic stress signalling conveyed by the MAP2K6MAPK14 pathway.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Proteome data were acquired with a Top12 method and fragment scan resolution 17,500 and 44 ms fill time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isolation width was 2 m/z and normalized collision energy (NCE) 28 for phosphor-enriched samples and 2.2 m/z and 25 NCE for proteome samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All raw LC-MS/MS data were analysed by MaxQuant v1.4.1.4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  59), and searched against the human Uniprot database (April 2012 release).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was specified as fixed modification for both groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the proteome data, variable modifications considered were oxidation of methionine, protein amino (N)-terminal acetylation and pyro-glutamate formation from glutamine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phosphoproteome data were additionally searched with phosphorylation as a variable modification of serine, threonine and tyrosine residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The match between run option was enabled, and the minimum score for both modified and unmodified peptides were set to 25, we used false discovery rate limit of 1% on peptide level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Proteome and phosphoproteome data analyses', 'From the two (HCT116.625 and HCT116.ctrl) triplicate proteome intensity data, we made log2(625/ctrl) ratios, and used only distinct proteins that were detected in all three ratios (n=2,410).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All proteins with an absolute log2(625/ctrl)  greater than 0.58 are listed in Supplementary Data 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SW620 proteome data were generated by separating protein lysates on a denaturing Bis-Tris gel, excise proteins between 20 and 45 kDa, which were then subjected to in-gel digestion followed by nLC-MS60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In HCT116 cells, MAP2K6 were quantified using peptides GAYGVVEK and INPELNQK shared with the MAP2K3 paralogue (since no MAP2K6 specific peptides were detected), whereas we used the MAP2K6 specific peptide DVKPSNVLINALGQVK in SW620 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphopeptide positions were mapped to the Homo sapiens canonical UniProtKB data set61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used HGNC gene names obtained from UniProtKB, which together with the phosphorylation positions acted as unique identifiers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Log2 ratios of normalized phosphopeptide intensities were generated for each triplicate ctrl+OX/ctrl, 625/ctrl, 625+OX/ctrl and 625+OX/ctrl+OX experiment, and the mean log2 ratio calculated for phosphopeptides detected in at least two of three replicates, while singly detected phospopeptides were discarded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a t-test to test the null hypothesis of no difference, that is, H0: log2 ratio=0, and estimated the local false discovery rate to obtain the chance of individual log2 ratios being false positives62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Enrichr tool63 was used to obtain enrichment scores (P-values) to KEGG pathways and GO-terms, using HGNC names as input.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only the top five (lowest P values) for each category were reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To detect changes in kinase activities, we applied the KSEA framework developed by Cassado et al.19 This is based on assigning individual phosphopeptides to one or more substrate groups according to the kinase(s) known or believed to catalyse the phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain such information, we merged and manually curated three collections of kinase phosphorylation mappings obtained from the Human Protein Reference Database20, PhosphoSitePlus21 and PhosphoELM22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this collection, we extracted those phosphorylated substrates detected in our experiments, and used this to make 25 substrate groups with at least 10 substrate members.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fractional delta-count (fcount) was then calculated as the number of substrates with increased (log2 ratio  greater than 0, NI) minus the number of substrates with decreased (log2 ratio  less_than 0, ND) phosphorylation divided by the total number of substrates in the group, that is: fcount=(NIND)/(NI+ND).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A BenjaminHochberg corrected P-value from a hypergeometric test was calculated to indicate the statistical significance of obtaining NI (and ND).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the fcount measure, we also calculated the mean log2 ratio () for all substrate log2 ratios within individual substrate groups, and tested whether this diverged from the population (experimental) mean () using the z statistics (z=()/(s/N0.5), where s is the population standard deviation and N the number of substrates in the group).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Z values were converted into two-sided P values via the standard normal distribution (P=2*(abs(z))), which were corrected for multiple testing with the BenjaminHochberg procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To find altered phosphorylation motifs by KSEA for the ctrl+OX/ctrl and 625+OX/ctrl+OX data, we first extracted 15 amino acids-windows (7+1+7) around the central phosphorylated amino acid for all serine and threonine phosphopeptides (detected in two out of three experimental triplicates).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins with phosphorylations within seven amino acids from the N or carboxy (C) terminus were discarded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphopeptides were then subjected to the motif-x algorithm64 using the following parameters: occurrences=5, significance=0.000001 and background=IPI Human Proteome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This resulted in 84 different motifs based on 7,850 phosphopeptides detected in the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further restricted KSEA to 51 motifs that were detected at least 50 times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To find kinases whose activities were associated with individual substrates and motifs, we obtained the netwoKIN data set of kinase substrate mappings33, but restricted us to entries with a high confidence (arbitrarily chosen as a networkin_score  greater than 3), corresponding to 36,972 out of the total 304,338 distinct kinase substrates in networKIN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To predict kinase activities associated with the differentially phosphorylated motifs (R-pS, pS-D and pS/pTP-R-K) we simplified the 15 amino acid motifs to 11 amino acids (5+1+5) motifs to directly use the 11 amino acids-phosphorylation windows provided for substrates in the networKIN data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that this resulted in the .SP.K.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  motif was removed from the analysis since it is minimally described by a 6+1+6 format.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We counted the enrichment score (ES) for each motif being associated with a given kinase as: ESm,k=(nm,k/Nm)/(Nk/N), where nm,k is the number of times a kinase k is mapped to a motif m, Nm is the total number of motifs m, Nk is the total number kinases k and N is the total number of kinase motif mappings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a BH-corrected P value from a two-sided Fishers exact test as significance for the association, and for each motif selected the top-10 kinases with the smallest P value and with at least 100 observations for a motif (nm,k100).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to overlap between motifs, this resulted in 39 distinct kinases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Statistical analysis', 'If not mentioned otherwise, a two-sided Students t-test was performed to evaluate statistical significance of differences in means, and the Fishers exact test used to test independence of count data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments were performed at least three times and P values 0.05 were considered significant (indicated with * in figures).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'Proteome data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD002172.
