Regulated membrane remodeling by Mic60 controls formation of mitochondrial crista junctions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) is crucial for the formation of crista junctions and mitochondrial inner membrane architecture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MICOS contains two core components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mic10 shows membrane-bending activity, whereas Mic60 (mitofilin) forms contact sites between inner and outer membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that Mic60 deforms liposomes into thin membrane tubules and thus displays membrane-shaping activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify a membrane-binding site in the soluble intermembrane space-exposed part of Mic60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This membrane-binding site is formed by a predicted amphipathic helix between the conserved coiled-coil and mitofilin domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mitofilin domain negatively regulates the membrane-shaping activity of Mic60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding of Mic19 to the mitofilin domain modulates this activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Membrane binding and shaping by the conserved Mic60Mic19 complex is crucial for crista junction formation, mitochondrial membrane architecture and efficient respiratory activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mic60 thus plays a dual role by shaping inner membrane crista junctions and forming contact sites with the outer membrane.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles of endosymbiotic origin that fulfil crucial functions within eukaryotic organisms, including the production of metabolites, the regulation of apoptosis and cellular energy supply1,2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their morphology is characterized by the presence of discrete outer and inner membrane systems6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the outer mitochondrial membrane (OM) separates the mitochondria from the cytosol, the inner membrane (IM) comprises the inner boundary membrane (IBM), which is closely apposed to the OM, and cristae membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cristae are tubular or lamellar membranous invaginations of the IM, which can largely differ in size and shape, depending on the metabolic state and cell type1,7,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They exhibit a specific protein composition with a characteristic accumulation of respiratory chain (super-)complexes and F1F0-ATP synthase oligomers11,12,13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cristae are linked to the IBM via tubular openings of defined diameter termed crista junctions (CJs)7,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been proposed that cristae formation and dynamics may be connected to the mitochondrial fusion and fission machineries17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perturbations of these processes are observed in numerous pathologies including neurodegenerative diseases and cancer1,2,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, remodelling of CJs to facilitate cytochrome c release from mitochondria is a key event in the induction of programmed cell death20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The identity and properties of the protein machineries controlling CJ formation are only slowly emerging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) is an evolutionarily conserved multi-subunit protein assembly of the IM, which localizes to CJs and is crucial for their formation and maintenance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MICOS complex is composed of at least six subunits in yeast that are termed Mic10, Mic12, Mic19, Mic26, Mic27 and Mic60 (refs 21, 22, 23, 24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mammalian MICOS complex contains at least one additional subunit (Mic25) and a number of MICOS-interacting proteins have been reported (summarized in refs 26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies indicate that CJ formation and maintenance in mammals is controlled by an intricate interplay between MICOS and the dynamin-like GTPase OPA1 (refs 17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Ablation of the MICOS core subunits Mic10 and Mic60 induces profound alterations of mitochondrial architecture: The loss of normal CJ structures leads to a detachment of cristae from the IBM and the accumulation of extended lamellar membrane stacks in the mitochondrial matrix21,22,23,28,29,30,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of Mic10 or Mic60 causes strong deformations of cristae membranes and/or CJs29,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recent studies have demonstrated that MICOS is composed of two distinct subcomplexes centred on the two core components Mic10 and Mic60 (previously termed mitofilin).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Mic10 subcomplex includes the IM-integrated proteins Mic12/QIL1, Mic26 and Mic27, whereas the second subcomplex is formed by Mic60 and the peripheral IM protein Mic19 (together with the Mic19 paralogue Mic25 in mammals)33,34,35,36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mic10 is a small integral IM protein with two transmembrane (TM) domains that has recently been shown to oligomerize via conserved glycine motifs, leading to the deformation of membranes in vitro and in vivo33,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, a function of Mic10 in bending the mitochondrial IM has been proposed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mic60 is inserted into the IM via an N-terminal TM domain, yet the major part of the protein is soluble and exposed to the intermembrane space (IMS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A central coiled-coil domain was suggested to act as a proteinprotein interaction platform21,28,29,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conserved C-terminal mitofilin domain of Mic60 is crucial for the integrity of the MICOS complex, but its molecular function has remained unclear40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mic60 was shown to interact with partner protein complexes in the OM, like the general protein translocase (TOM complex) and the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM/TOB complex).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the Mic60Mic19(-Mic25) subcomplex mediates the formation of direct physical contacts between both mitochondrial membrane systems and is thought to anchor CJs to the OM22,23,26,35,39,40,41,42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mic60-dependent IMOM contact sites have recently been implicated in mitochondrial lipid trafficking, a process critical for membrane remodelling44,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Mic60 partner protein Mic19 comprises a central coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil-helix coiled-coil-helix (CHCH) domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter contains two highly conserved cysteine residues that flank a loop region between two predicted helices and can form a disulfide bond in vivo46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecular mechanism through which the Mic60Mic19 subcomplex contributes to the formation of CJs is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we have biochemically characterized the Mic60Mic19 complex and demonstrate that it can deform liposomes into thin tubules in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify a lipid-binding site in the soluble IMS-exposed part of Mic60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The membrane remodelling activity of Mic60 is partially inhibited by its mitofilin domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding of Mic19 to the mitofilin domain releases this inhibition and thus promotes Mic60-mediated membrane remodelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An intact membrane-binding site in Mic60 is crucial for MICOS complex formation, mitochondrial IM ultrastructure and mitochondrial function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings reveal that Mic60Mic19 not only anchors CJ structures to the OM, but is also crucial for cristae formation via remodelling of mitochondrial membranes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Mic60 binds and remodels liposomes', 'To characterize the molecular function of the MICOS core component Mic60, we expressed a Mic60 variant of the thermophilic fungus Chaetomium thermophilum lacking the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence and TM anchor (Mic60sol, residues 208691) and purified it to homogeneity (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The equivalent construct of yeast Mic60 tended to aggregate and could therefore not be tested in functional studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Circular dichroism (CD) measurements of Mic60sol (and all subsequently purified Mic60 and Mic19 variants, see below) indicated a mostly -helical structure (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with earlier reports28,29, Mic60sol was predominantly dimeric in blue native (BN)-PAGE, while a smaller fraction assembled into higher-order oligomers (Fig 1b and Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sedimentation velocity and equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) experiments confirmed that the predominant species of Mic60sol is a stable dimer (measured relative molecular weight (Mr) 109±10 kDa, theoretical Mr of the dimer: 109 kDa) in the concentration range of 0.022 mg ml1 (Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured sedimentation velocity of 2.4 S is very small for a 109 kDa dimeric Mic60sol and indicative of a highly elongated protein structure, consistent with the predicted high coiled-coil content of Mic60sol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a concentration of 1 mg ml-1 and higher, an additional species with an apparent sedimentation velocity of 4 S appeared (Fig 1c), probably reflecting the capability of Mic60sol to form higher oligomeric structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Mic60 forms stable dimers and tubulates liposomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a, top) Domain architecture of Mic60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TM, transmembrane domain;

critical role of the mitofilin domain for the interaction with Mic19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The isolated mitofilin domain of Mic60 aggregated at concentrations 1 mg ml1, precluding its use in ITC studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the isolated coiled-coil domain of Mic19 was soluble, but did not bind to Mic60sol (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the isolated CHCH domain of Mic19 bound to Mic60sol with a KD of 390 nM, that is, with a comparably high affinity as full-length Mic19 (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our binding studies using untagged proteins indicate that the Mic19Mic60 subcomplex of MICOS forms via interaction of the CHCH domain of Mic19 and the mitofilin domain of Mic60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We next asked if Mic19 has a function in modifying Mic60-mediated membrane tubulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially, we analysed membrane binding of Mic19 alone, but found no interaction with Folch liposomes in co-sedimentation assays nor membrane tubulation (Fig 3f, left; 3g and Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when Mic60sol was co-incubated with Mic19, co-sedimentation of the Mic60Mic19 complex with liposomes was observed, suggesting that the two proteins interact when bound to membranes (Fig 3f, right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the Mic60Mic19 complex induced liposome tubulation and branching, as Mic60solMito (Fig 3h and Supplementary Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar phenotype was also observed for the Mic19 C132S/C143S mutant indicating that under the conditions of this assay, the Mic19 mutant can still interact with Mic60 at the membrane (Fig 3i and Supplementary Fig 2hk).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of the isolated CHCH domain to Mic60sol enhanced membrane tubulation compared to Mic60sol alone, but we observed less branches indicating that other parts of Mic19 also contribute to the functional cooperation with Mic60 (Fig 3i,j and Supplementary Fig 2g,ik).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'When closely inspecting EM micrographs of liposomes incubated with the Mic60Mic19 complex, we often observed small particles reminiscent of membrane remnants (Supplementary Fig 2f, right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reasoned that such particles may be generated by fragmentation of membrane tubules caused by enhanced membrane remodelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because a quantitative analysis of such fragmented liposomes in negative-stain EM was difficult to interpret, we looked for an alternative approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we applied an established membrane leakage assay44, in which the release of the fluorescent dye 8-aminonapthalene-1,3,6 trisulfonic acid (ANTS) and its quencher p-xylene-bis-pyridinium bromide (DPX) from the interior of liposomes into solution is observed as a time-dependent fluorescence increase49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As expected, Mic60sol but not Mic19 alone induced liposome leakage (Fig 3k) indicative of a membrane remodelling activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mic19 greatly enhanced membrane leakage when co-incubated with Mic60sol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, addition of the isolated CHCH domain reduced the membrane leakage activity of Mic60sol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results are consistent with a model in which Mic60 membrane remodelling activity is enhanced by Mic19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mitofilinCHCH domain interaction promotes tubulation but is not sufficient to enhance membrane leakage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that effective functional cooperation with Mic60 requires Mic19s coiled-coil domain in addition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'LBS1 plays a critical role in IM ultrastructure and function', 'To examine the physiological role of Mic60-mediated membrane binding for mitochondrial membrane architecture, we used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as model organism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We engineered yeast strains carrying chromosomally integrated MIC60 mutants encoding protein variants with either a deletion of the homologous LBS1 region or an RW433-434DD amino-acid replacement in LBS1, which is equivalent to the RF572-573DD substitution in C. thermophilum Mic60 (see alignments in Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To enable the purification of the MICOS complex from mutant mitochondria and the co-isolation of MICOS-interacting proteins, a Protein A (ProtA) moiety was fused to the C terminus of the Mic60 variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been reported and was confirmed in our study that the lack of Mic60 leads to strongly reduced Mic19 levels (Supplementary Fig 4a)21,22,23,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mic19 levels were also decreased in mitochondria harbouring Mic60 variants with a defective LBS

Co-isolation efficiency of other MICOS components together with lipid-binding-deficient Mic60 variants was strongly reduced compared to the co-isolation efficiency with wild-type Mic60ProtA, whereas

subunit of the TOM complex, was not reduced with the mutant mitochondria (Fig 4a), indicating that LBS1-defective Mic60 variants are still able to form IMOM contact sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement

boundary IM via CJs (Fig 4c, quantified as CJs/mitochondrial section in Fig 4g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of the entire MIC60 gene or removal of only the Mic60 mitofilin domain40 led to a grossly aberrant mitochondrial ultrastructure with increased IM surface and detached lamellar cristae membranes as expected, independently of Mic19 re-expression (Fig 4d,g and Supplementary Fig 5e,j,k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, deletion of MIC19 in the Mic60ProtA-expressing strain had a similar effect on mitochondrial architecture (Supplementary Fig 5d,k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Re-expression of Mic19 from a plasmid in mic19 cells fully rescued this phenotype confirming that plasmid-encoded Mic19 is functional (Supplementary Fig 5f,g,k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of LBS1 in Mic60ProtA cells (Mic60_LBS1ProtA) induced a similar phenotype as the complete absence of Mic60, the IM showing an increased membrane surface and virtually no CJs (Fig 4e,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of cells expressing the Mic60ProtA variant RW433-434DD with an inactivated LBS revealed a similar mitochondrial phenotype (Fig 4f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenotype was also observed on Mic19 re-expression in the mic60 mutant yeast strains (Supplementary Fig 5dk).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our findings indicate a requirement of Mic60 membrane binding via the LBS1 domain for maintenance of the native mitochondrial ultrastructure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, loss of Mic60 lipid binding in mitochondria negatively affected respiratory metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though the steady-state levels of respiratory chain (super-)complexes were similar in wild-type, mic60 and Mic60 LBS1-defective mitochondria as judged by BN-PAGE analysis (Supplementary Fig 4b), we observed a considerable reduction in the enzymatic activities of complex III (cytochrome bc1) and complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) (Fig 4h,i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduction of the respiratory activity was thus comparable to that of mitochondria lacking the MICOS core component Mic10 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that lipid binding of Mic60 is crucial for MICOS integrity, mitochondrial membrane architecture and mitochondrial fitness.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We report an unexpected function of the contact site-forming MICOS core subunit Mic60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By directly binding and remodelling membranes, Mic60 plays a crucial role in CJ formation and shaping IM cristae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An amphipathic helix that is located between the coiled-coil and mitofilin domains of Mic60 is critical for this membrane-shaping activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we show that Mic60s membrane remodelling activity is regulated by Mic19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Earlier cryo EM tomography analyses indicated that the F1F0-ATP synthase in mitochondria of yeast and mammals forms V-shaped dimers, which assemble along the highly curved ridges of lamellar cristae, thereby stabilizing cristae curvature14,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also the mitochondrial dynamin-like OPA1 GTPase has been shown to play a crucial role in cristae remodelling and mitochondrial fusion17,18,20,51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a direct involvement of the MICOS component Mic10 in creating membrane curvature was recently demonstrated33,38 indicating that Mic10 directly participates in mitochondrial membrane remodelling by oligomerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been proposed that the two TM domains of Mic10 adopt a helical hairpin conformation in the IM with an asymmetric wedge shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, several lines of evidence exist that specific phospholipids are also involved in cristae membrane organization and the generation of membrane curvature at CJs in cooperation with MICOS34,35,45,53,54,55,56,57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis now indicates that Mic60 directly contributes to membrane remodelling and mitochondrial IM architecture at CJs, but uses a mechanism different from Mic10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Amphipathic helices are well-characterized mediators for creating and/or sensing positive membrane curvature, known for instance from amphipathic lipid packing sensor domain-containing proteins or small GTPases of the Arf and Sar1 family47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While they display low conservation at the sequence level, their amphipathic character is well conserved throughout evolution (Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such helices enforce membrane curvature by asymmetrically inserting into the lipid bilayer and competing for space with the lipid head groups58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Often, membrane curvature by amphipathic helices is supported by rigid membrane scaffolds that impose their bent shape on the underlying membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in N-Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) proteins such as endophilin59,60, an N-terminal amphipathic helix cooperates with a dimeric or oligomeric curved BAR-domain scaffold to create membrane curvature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to this, the dimeric coiled-coil domain of Mic60 may assist the amphipathic LBS1 in shaping the mitochondrial membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observation that Mic60 can generate positive membrane curvature is in agreement with a role of MICOS at the rim of CJs, where positive membrane curvature needs to be stabilized (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coordination of the membrane remodelling activities of Mic60 and Mic10 likely involves Mic12 since this subunit is crucial for the coupling of both MICOS subcomplexes37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In several BAR-domain proteins, such as PACSINs, membrane binding and remodelling is regulated by intramolecular auto-inhibitory action of the SH3 domain, which is released on binding to interaction partners such as dynamin61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we envisage a similar scenario for the C-terminal mitofilin domain in Mic60, which controls membrane tubulation by intramolecular interactions or binding to the CHCH domain of Mic19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been demonstrated before that the mitofilin domain is of crucial importance for the integrity of the MICOS machinery40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of this domain strongly impaired the co-isolation of all other subunits with Mic60 including Mic19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A possible interpretation is that a precise regulation of Mic60 membrane interaction is critical for MICOS stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mitofilin domain of Mic60 may well have distinct roles for MICOS assembly, functionality and coupling to partner protein complexes40,41 in agreement with the strong conservation of this domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the presence of some residual CJs in Mic60 deletion strains21,22,23,32,34 argues for a second, Mic60-independent pathway for the formation of CJs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our findings suggest that Mic19 augments the membrane-shaping activity of Mic60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may explain the defective cristae morphology in mic19 cells21,22,23 and the observation that Mic19 knockdown in mammalian cells results in a reduced CJ diameter39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CHCH domain of Mic19 mediates the contact to the mitofilin domain of Mic60, but also the coiled-coil domain of Mic19 is required for enhancing the membrane remodelling activity of Mic60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CHCH domain of Mic19 contains conserved cysteine residues (Fig 3a)62 but only oxidized Mic19 carrying an intramolecular disulfide bond was found in the MICOS complex46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our ITC data reveal a strong influence of the Mic19 cysteine residues on the interaction between Mic19 and Mic60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Removal of the two cysteines in Mic19 reduced the affinity for Mic60, suggesting that the intramolecular disulfide bond in the CHCH domain stabilizes the Mic60-bound conformation of Mic19, thereby modulating Mic60 membrane binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Taken together, our work has elucidated a so far unknown conserved function of the Mic19Mic60 subcomplex of MICOS in generating membrane curvature at CJs, which is crucial for proper mitochondrial architecture and function.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
