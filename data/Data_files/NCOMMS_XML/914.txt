Optical gating and streaking of free electrons with sub-optical cycle precision  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The temporal resolution of ultrafast electron diffraction and microscopy experiments is currently limited by the available experimental techniques for the generation and characterization of electron bunches with single femtosecond or attosecond durations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present proof of principle experiments of an optical gating concept for free electrons via direct time-domain visualization of the sub-optical cycle energy and transverse momentum structure imprinted on the electron beam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate a temporal resolution of 1.2±0.3 fs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scheme is based on the synchronous interaction between electrons and the near-field mode of a dielectric nano-grating excited by a femtosecond laser pulse with an optical period duration of 6.5 fs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sub-optical cycle resolution demonstrated here is promising for use in laser-driven streak cameras for attosecond temporal characterization of bunched particle beams as well as time-resolved experiments with free-electron beams.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Contemporary physics and chemistry aim to record phenomena occurring on the time and length scales of electronic dynamics in atomic systems1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent progress in the generation of attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulses5,6,7 allows for direct insight into ultrafast processes in the sub-femtosecond regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Advanced experimental techniques such as attosecond optical spectroscopy5,8,9, high-harmonic orbital tomography1,10 or laser-induced electron self-diffraction11 have enabled the direct observation of electron dynamics in atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultrafast electron diffraction and microscopy2,12,13 further enable atomic spatial resolution by employing free electron bunches at energies of 30200 keV with de-Broglie wavelengths on the order of several picometers, but with temporal resolution so far limited to tens-hundreds of femtoseconds13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temporal resolution of these techniques can be pushed toward the atomic unit of time (24 as) by the experimental technique presented here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A natural way to manipulate free electrons on the attosecond timescale would be by using the electromagnetic field of a laser pulse oscillating with a period of several femtoseconds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to optical streaking and bunching schemes15,16,17,18,19,20,21, attosecond temporal resolution may be obtained by mapping time to electron energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When nonlinear forces can be neglected, however, no net energy gain can be imparted to a charged particle by a light wave in vacuum because of energy and momentum conservation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For efficient energy exchange, the symmetry of the field must be broken via the introduction of a boundary surface as shown in refs 15, 17, 20, 21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metallic thin films15, nanowires21, carbon nanotubes17, metallic nanotips20 and microstructures22 have all been used as spatial boundaries for the laser field (for comparison of advantages/disadvantages of different schemes see Supplementary discussion, Experimental techniques for electron streaking by optical fields).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The laser-driven gating and streaking of electrons presented in this paper is based on the energy and momentum exchange between a laser field and an electron in the proximity of a periodic nanostructure utilizing the inverse SmithPurcell effect23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A silicon nano-grating serves as a phase mask for incoming laser pulses, leading to the excitation of a travelling evanescent mode propagating parallel to the electron beam with a phase velocity equal to the electron velocity ve=c (refs 26, 27, 28, 29, 30), where c is speed of light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amplitude of the synchronous mode decays exponentially with the distance from the grating surface (for details see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The direction and strength of the resulting electromagnetic force depends on the optical phase of the excited mode with respect to the arrival time of electrons30 (see Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spectral filtering of the electrons after interaction with the laser fields yields temporal gating of the electron bunches with sub-optical cycle temporal resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Experimental set-up used for demonstration of electron gating with sub-cycle resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The electric field component Ez (colour scale) of the accelerating mode as a function of the electron arrival position within one grating period p (arrival time) and transverse distance from the silicon grating (grey structure) surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arrows indicate the direction and magnitude of the final momentum change of the travelling electron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b,c) Sketch of the experimental setup: a continuous electron beam (electrons indicated by spheres) interacts with two subsequent laser pulses (red curves) focused down to radii of w=7±1 m in the vicinity of a Si grating (indicated by grey background pattern).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modulation of electron energy Ek=Ek-Ek0 during the interaction with the first laser pulse (visualized by the colour scale of the spheres representing the electrons) is further enhanced (t=nT, a) or cancelled (t=(n+1/2)T, b) by interaction with the second laser pulse depending on the relative phase difference between the laser pulses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slow electrons are filtered out by an energy high-pass filter so that only accelerated electrons (red) are detected by a micro-channel plate detector.Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Temporal gating of electron beam by optical fields', 'The experimental set-up for demonstration of laser-driven gating in the time domain is shown in Fig 1b,c (for details see section Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A sub-relativistic continuous electron beam with an initial energy of Ek0=28.1 keV (=0.32) is focused close to the surface of the grating, parallel to the grating vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two infrared femtosecond laser pulses (central wavelength of =1.93 m, pulse length of =600±50 fs and maximum incident field of E0=1.3±0.1 GV m1) with an adjustable relative time delay are focused onto the grating surface at different locations along the electron beam path.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After interaction with the grating near fields, the electrons reach an energy high-pass filter transmitting only those with energies EkeUs, where e is the electron charge and Us is the applied retarding voltage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Depending on their arrival time at the grating with respect to the phase of the accelerating field, electrons are either accelerated, decelerated or deflected (see the electric field and the final momentum change of the travelling electron in Fig 1a)30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our experiment, we first imprint a periodic energy modulation to the electron beam via interaction with the first laser pulse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By adjusting the time delay t of the second laser pulse, this electron energy modulation can be enhanced for t=nT or suppressed for t=(n+1/2)T, where T=/c is the period of the driving laser field and .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When only accelerated electrons are detected, this leads to a current that oscillates as a function of t. This experiment is similar in nature to a Ramsey-type control of coherent energy exchange between electrons and two spatially separated optical near-fields demonstrated recently in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sub-cycle energy modulation of the electron beam is maintained due to the short propagation distance l=18±1 m between the laser spots (corresponding to a travel time of

3.2±0.1 fs (FWHM) at a minimum energy gain of (eUsEk0)=30 eV to 2.0±0.3 fs for (eUsEk0)=1 keV (Fig 2b, detail in Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a consequence of the smaller phase-space

#@NEW_LINE#@#  It reflects both the carrier frequency  (phase oscillations) and the envelope function of the laser pulse field exp(2ln2t2/2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To observe the effect of laser pulse envelope on the accelerated population of electrons, we monitor the amplitude of the sub-cycle current oscillations (c.f.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2a) as a function of the time delay between the laser

attosecond XUV pulses via spectral filtering of the high-energy part of the high harmonics generated from ultrashort laser pulses6,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that our scheme does not rely on the ballistic velocity bunching taking place during free propagation of the electrons after their interaction with the laser pulse, as discussed in refs 18, 20 (for a detailed discussion see Supplementary

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have thus shown that by utilizing the interaction of electrons with the laser-induced near fields of a nano-grating, we can control the energy and deflected spatial profile of the electron beam with sub-optical cycle precision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results will lead to interesting developments in ultrafast electron diffraction and microscopy2,4,8,13,33 experiments, an example set-up of which we show in Fig 5a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here an electron bunch first interacts with the accelerating field excited by a few-cycle laser pulse leading to modulation of its kinetic energy Ek.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gated electrons are then transmitted and/or diffracted by a sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here the dynamics excited by, for example, a foregoing attosecond XUV pulse (generated via high-harmonic generation from a split off fraction of the accelerating laser pulse) can be probed as a function of time delay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the detection of electrons with the highest energy gain filtered by an imaging spectrometer, single femtosecond temporal resolution will be achieved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detection of high-energy electrons will also maintain the spatial mode of the electron beam after the gating interaction as they undergo minimal deflection27,30 (for details see Supplementary discussion, Electron beam emittance after interaction with optical near-fields).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When combined with attosecond XUV pulses generated by the same laser, the optical gating of an electron beam allows for all-optical timing control of the experiment, avoiding the electronic timing jitter usually present in state-of-the-art experiments employing microwave electron bunch compression34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Single-cycle optical gating and streaking experiments with electron beams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Electrons (spheres) coming from the left obtain an energy modulation Ek by the interaction with an ultrashort laser pulse (red) with optical period T in the vicinity of a single ridge nanostructure (grey).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Afterwards they interact with the sample and probe electron dynamics excited by an attosecond XUV pulse (violet).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electrons with the highest energy gain (red) accelerated within one optical cycle are filtered by the spectrometer and detected by a micro-channel plate detector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With nowadays available parameters, a time resolution below 1 fs is possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) An electron bunch (spheres) is transversely streaked by the phase-dependent deflecting fields generated by an ultrashort laser pulse (red) and its transverse spatial distribution is detected by a spatially resolved electron detector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas in (a) timing information is mapped onto energy, here it is mapped to the spatial domain like in a classical streak camera, offering a temporal resolution down to 10 as (see section Simulations).Full size image', 'Additionally, the angular phase-dependent streaking of electrons demonstrated here can have direct application as a laser-driven analogy of a classical streak camera (Fig 5b) in which the temporal profile of an electron bunch is translated into a transverse spatial distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, a temporal resolution of 10 as could be directly accessible with available laser and electron beam technology (for details see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we have experimentally demonstrated laser-driven temporal gating as well as transverse streaking of free electrons at dielectric nanostructures with single femtosecond temporal resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This technique can be directly applied to ultrafast electron diffraction and microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the presented physics is not limited to sub-relativistic electrons26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also enables precise bunch length measurements of relativistic charged particle beams (not only electrons) such as those generated in modern free-electron-laser-based light sources.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
