Light-assisted delithiation of lithium iron phosphate nanocrystals towards photo-rechargeable lithium ion batteries  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Recently, intensive efforts are dedicated to convert and store the solar energy in a single device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, dye-synthesized solar cell technology is combined with lithium-ion materials to investigate light-assisted battery charging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular we report the direct photo-oxidation of lithium iron phosphate nanocrystals in the presence of a dye as a hybrid photo-cathode in a two-electrode system, with lithium metal as anode and lithium hexafluorophosphate in carbonate-based electrolyte; a configuration corresponding to lithium ion battery charging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dye-sensitization generates electronhole pairs with the holes aiding the delithiation of lithium iron phosphate at the cathode and electrons utilized in the formation of a solid electrolyte interface at the anode via oxygen reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lithium iron phosphate acts effectively as a reversible redox agent for the regeneration of the dye.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings provide possibilities in advancing the design principles for photo-rechargeable lithium ion batteries.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The design of a device that is simultaneously a solar energy convertor and a battery represents a paradigm-shifting energy storage concept that allows to charge a battery without any external power supply1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first photo-rechargeable battery was proposed in 1976 by Hodes et al.3 using a three-electrode system composed of cadmium selenide/sulfur/silver sulfide (CdSe/S/Ag2S), followed in 1977 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4) by the ternary system n-cadmium selenide telluride/caesium sulfide/tin sulfide (CdSe0.65Te0.35/Cs2Sx/SnS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 1990, Kanbara et al.5 investigated a photo-reaction on a semiconductor silicon/silicon oxide (P-I aSi/SiOx) electrode using silver iodide tungstanate (Ag6I4WO4) and observed a photo-sensitizing effect on the surface of SiOx.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, a solar rechargeable battery consisting of a hybrid titania (TiO2)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene, PEDOT) photo-anode and a perchlorate (ClO4)-doped polypyrrole counter electrode was proposed by Liu et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in 2012 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2014, Yu et al.7 reported charging of a lithiumoxygen (LiO2) battery with the assistance of a redox-coupled dye photo-electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the meantime, in 2015 Li et al.8 integrated a TiO2-based electrode in a three-electrode system comprising a lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4; LFP)/lithium metal cell using triodide/iodide (I3/I) as a redox agent in a separate electrolyte compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All these devices are basically three-electrode systems that have two linked sections, namely: one dedicated to solar energy conversion and the other dedicated to energy storage as discussed recently by Li et al.9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along the same lines, Xu et al.10 connected a perovskite methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3)-based solar cell in series with a Li-based cell (LFP cathode and a Li4Ti5O12 anode) and observed good cycling stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also in 2015, Thimmappa et al.11 proposed a chemically rechargeable photo-battery device utilizing potassium iron hexacyanoferrate prussian blue analogue (KFeFe(CN)6 and titanium nitride (TiN) in which: the photo-electrons generated on the TiN electrode assist in battery discharging while sodium disulphate Na2S2O8 participate in charging as is consumed and continuously regenerated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In another development, Li et al.12 proposed a very innovative device, integrating a CdSe@Pt photocatalyst into LiS batteries via which direct solar energy storage takes place in the form of H2 production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2015, Yu et al.13 designed a photo-rechargeable Li-iodide flow battery, using a TiO2-dye photoelectrode via linkage of an I3/I based catholyte for the conversion and storage of solar energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared to the previous concepts, the devices described by Li and Wu are single systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Lis device, the electrons are consumed by the reduction of hydrogen (2H++2eH2) while in Wus device, a constant flow of a reversible I3/I redox agent is required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the two-electrode system, Liu et al.14 suggested in 2015 the use of a graphitic carbon nitride (C3N4) photocatalyst to reduce the charging voltage in a LiO2 battery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this paper, we report a two-electrode system involving direct photo-oxidation of LFP nanocrystals by light irradiation in the presence of the N719 dye as hybrid photo-cathode, Li metal as anode, and LiPF6 organic carbonate solvent (EC/DEC/VC) as electrolyte that corresponds to Li-ion battery charging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We utilize LFP as the cathode material because of its stability and safety as well as its favourable redox potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter, 3.4 V versus Li+/Li (refs 15, 16), is very close to that of the classic I3/I redox couple (3.1 V versus Li+/Li) used in the dye-sensitized solar cell invented by ORegan and Grätzel in 1991 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dye-sensitization generates electronhole pairs with the holes aiding the chemical conversion of LFP (triphylite) nanoplatelets to FePO4 (heterosite) at the cathode and the electrons utilized via oxygen reduction in the formation of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) at the anode made-up of lithium-carbonate-based species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The photo-assisted delithiation of LFP is reversible upon galvanostatic discharge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings open possibilities in designing photo-rechargeable Li-ion batteries based on a two-electrode device configuration.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Observation of LFP delithiation', 'The original photocathode investigated consists of a film of colloidal LFP nanoplateletes18 deposited on conducting glass/F:SnO2(FTO), annealed and sensitized with the N719 dye as represented in Fig 1a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details of the film preparation are given in the Methods section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: LiFePO4/Dye photocathode and response to light exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic representation of the FTO/LFP NPs/DYE electrode; (b) open circuit voltage (OCV) under Neon light exposure (red line): the voltage after a plateau at 3.40 V increased to 3.75 V and in the dark using a black box (blue line), the voltage, as expected, slightly decreases from 3.44 to 3.41 V in 500 h. The inset shows the change in OCV upon illumination with a solar simulator (green line).Full size image', 'Subsequently, the ternary FTOLFPdye film was tested (Supplementary Figs 1 and 2) as the working electrode (WE), with lithium as the counter electrode (CE) and reference electrode in a solution of 1 M LiPF6 in EC/DEC (30/70 v/v+2% VC) as the electrolyte.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiments were performed in a dry room under Neon ambient light (two Philips T8 32 W neon tubes, see the spectrum in Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The open circuit voltage (OCV) started at a plateau at 3.45 V and after 500 h increased to 3.75 V (red curve in Fig 1b); upon replacing the Neon lamps with a solar simulator illumination (see Methods section) the same rise of OCV of LFP was much faster (30 h, see inset in Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then performed the same OCV experiments in a black box where the voltage slowly dropped to 3.41 V (blue curve in Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The films, before and after OCV, were then analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of triphylite (LFP) in the pristine film was unambiguously highlighted by grazing incidence angle X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurement (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After light exposure, the XRD pattern (Fig 2b) shows the presence of heterosite (FePO4) only, suggesting the complete delithiation of the pristine triphylite phase by apparent photo-oxidation (no residual LFP was detected).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some extra peaks, assigned to cassiterite (SnO2), are present in both patterns due to the FTO layer in the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Characterization of LiFePO4 nanoplatelets before and after light exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) XRD pattern of pristine film of LFP, (b) XRD pattern of the film after light exposure, (c) HRTEM of pristine LFP (scale bars, 10 nm) and (d) HRTEM of LFP after light exposure (scale bars, 10 nm).Full size image', 'In contrast, the LFP phase is still preserved on the film after 500 h of OCV in the dark (Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The film exposed to solar simulator light shows heterosite FePO4 while the film in the dark is LFP (Supplementary Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LFP nanocrystals, before and after OCV, were also analysed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The images of Fig 2c,d were acquired from 010 oriented crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The arrows mark the direction of the Li channels in the structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A small difference of the lattice constant b is measured in the FFT transforms, in good agreement with the XRD patterns, and confirms the reduced volume of the delithiated structure (FePO4) with respect to the starting structure (LFP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on the LFP sample before and after exposure to light, and the results obtained for the Fe 2p peaks are shown in Fig 3a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectra collected on the sample before light exposure (black profile) resemble those obtained on the LFP nanoplatelets, as reported by Paolella et al.19, thus confirming that Fe is present as Fe(II) in the pristine material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the Fe 2p peaks are evident by their peculiar profile owing to multiplet splitting, also reported by Dedryvere et al.20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After light exposure (red profile), the low binding energy component centred at 709.7 eV decreased in intensity while the maximum of the Fe 2p3/2 peak shifted to a slightly higher binding energy (from 711.1 to 711.8 eV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar trend was already reported by Dedryvere et al.20 on cycled LFP electrodes and assigned to Fe2+ partial oxidation to Fe3+ during battery charging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words similar to standard battery charging, we have here photo-assisted oxidation of LFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantitative analysis of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) ratio is complicated by the peculiar profile of both Fe(II) and Fe(III) components20, but we were able to assign the observed spectral changes to the delithiation of LFP nanoplatelets as a result of the photo-oxidation process.

light exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data are shown after normalization and (b) EELS spectra of oxygen K edge and iron L2,3 edge before (black) and after (red) light exposure.Full size image', 'Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) showed the ionization edges of oxygen (O-K) and iron (Fe-L2,3) and verified the oxidation of Fe from Fe(II) to Fe(III) when delithiation occurs (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A typical feature of oxidation with the formation of FePO4 is the pre-peak of the O-K edge21 as visible in the photo-oxidized sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the Fe-L2,3 should change correspondingly due to the different occupation of the Fe 3d bands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the L3/L2 ratio (relative intensity of the two white-lines) increases in the photo-oxidized sample due to the higher amount of Fe(III) as expected22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oxidation of Fe in this case does not involve the addition of oxygen atoms, as confirmed by the very similar integral intensity of the O-K spectra in the post-edge region (that is, same oxygen amount of atoms in the structure).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Multiple LFP photo-oxidations', 'The OCV was observed during exposure using a solar simulator (200 W lamp, see inset in Fig 1 and Supplementary Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, the full charge occurred faster (1.5 days versus 20 days) compared to the charge under neon light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, light is essential for the oxidation reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the XRD measurements showed clearly the conversion of triphylite LFP into heterosite FePO4 after illumination by the solar simulator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell was subsequently subjected to OCV charging and discharging cycling (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As it can be seen after 70 h at OCV and charge, the battery reached 3.62 V and then discharged at C/24 (see Methods section for more details) to a capacity of 104 mAh g1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell was held at OCV and charged a second time which required 100 h at OCV to reach 3.43 V and another 100 h to reach 3.62 V (increasing the voltage from 3.43 to 3.62 V needed 40 h more compared to the first OCV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After light-assisted charging, the cell was discharged a second time at C/24 where a comparable capacity of 99.3 mAh g1 was obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second experiment at OCV required more time probably due to partial dissolution of the dye in the electrolyte, but the reaction is still reversible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using only LFP (Supplementary Fig 5) we observed a capacity fading that is attributed to the absence of a binder in the LFP film, causing as result partial film delamination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Open circuit voltage and discharge curves of LiFePO4on FTO glass.OCV charge (red lines) performed under solar simulator lighting and galvanostatic discharge (blue lines) at C/24.Full size image', 'Subsequently an aliquot of the electrolyte was analysed by 1H and 19F NMR spectroscopy after cycling to verify its chemical stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the NMR analysis (Supplementary Figs 6 and 7), the EC/DEC molar ratio slightly increases from 0.80 to 0.86 due to evaporation of DEC during the cell operation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, no new products are detected by 1H NMR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, the concentration of the N719 dye was too low to be detected if any part of it solubilized in the electrolyte.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19F NMR indicated that LiPF6 is the major component along with traces ( less_than 0.3%) of degradation products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of these degradation product was POF(OH)2, similar to that identified by Wilken et al.23 and Campion et al.24 in Li-ion battery common electrolytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, no traces of POF3, HF or LiF were observed with this sample, which are usually associated with the degradation reactions of LiPF6 resulting in the formation of POF(OH)2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our NMR results therefore did not suggest any major changes taking place in electrolyte composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as we discuss later in the mechanism section where we propose EC/DEC to react at the LFP/electrolyte interface that apparently went undetected by the NMR analysis (Supplementary Figs 2427) due to the low concentrations involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The stability of the film was improved by changing the composition of the film and its preparation (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The changes made were the use of PET/Sn:In2O3 (PET/ITO) instead of glass/FTO (Supplementary Fig 1) as substrate, the use of carbon nanotubes to improve conductivity (Supplementary Fig 8), and the use of PVDF binder to improve film integrity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed XRD on the new film and obtained the same results as for glass/FTO: the conversion of triphylite into heterosite after OCV is shown in Supplementary Fig 9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During galvanostatic chargedischarge performed in the dark (Supplementary Fig 10), we observed a relatively low battery capacity/stability (below 40 mAh g1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, Fig 5 shows a relatively fast photo-assisted OCV ( less_than 24 h) and a discharge current for 48 h at C/24 corresponding to a capacity at least two times the theoretical one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same capacity was observed after 15 discharges (and 15 OCVs photo-assisted charges) As mentioned earlier the photocathode tends to undergo partial charge during galvanostatic discharge because of its exposure to light that induces LFP to delithiate, hence creating vacancies for extra charge storage beyond the theoretical capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 5, the 15th OCV is lower than the first OCV and probably due to a loss of dye in the electrolyte-although this could not be confirmed, but the photo-oxidation of LFP is still much faster with respect to the glass/FTO electrode (respectively 24 h after 15 cycles for ITO versus 160 h after the 2nd cycle for FTO).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering these results we can reasonably assume that the combined use of PET/ITO, carbon nanotubes and PVDF as binder improved the performance of the device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another critical factor in the observed photo-oxidation of LFP is the nanosize effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was determined by comparing the photo-response of differently prepared LFP samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus no photo-oxidation was observed when we replaced the colloidal nanocrystals with hydrothermally synthesized crystals (13 m sized crystals); but after ball-milling (crystals of 80 nm) photo-oxidation did take place as evidenced by the increase of OCV to 3.65 V after 24 h (for more details see Supplementary Fig 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BET analysis showed the pristine hydrothermal LFP sample has a specific surface area of 5 m2 g1, while the ball milled sample has 24 m2 g1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparison, the etched colloidal LFP sample (nanoplatelets 710 nm thick) with a surface area of 70 m2 g1 underwent the fastest photo-oxidation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the surface area of LFP nanocrystals is a key property that facilitates photo-oxidation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our hybrid photocathode featuring colloidal LFP nanoplatelets and N719 dye can undergo a photo-oxidation for 15 cycles in a cell with Li metal as anode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides the cyclability, it is interesting to note that we observed (Supplementary Fig 11), when the light was switched off, the voltage experienced a drop of 150 mV but when the light was switched on again, the voltage profile was restored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The voltage drop observed after 15 cycles (from 3.4 V to 3 V) is attributed to a number of factors as evidenced by supplementary characterization work, such as the formation of resistive LiF deposit on the surface of the film (Supplementary Fig 13) and dye segregation at the surface of the cathode or its partial dissolution in the electrolyte (N719 was still detected in its active form by Raman analysis, see Supplementary Fig 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Open circuit voltage and discharge curves of LiFePO4 film on

calculate the photo-conversion and storage efficiency (refer to Supplementary Fig 15 and details in Supplementary Methods), which was found to be in the range 0.060.08%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though these values are low we should bear that these are early performance data corresponding to electrodes made of LFP nanoparticles deposited on (transparent conductive oxide) TCO along C and a binder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover hybrid devices made of solar cells and energy storage cells in tandem typically yield efficiencies  less_than 1% (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present system featuring a hybrid photo-cathode (LFP/dye) is unlike the previous in-series concept9 or three-electrode systems25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this early stage we attribute such low current efficiency to large charge recombination losses at the LFP/dye/electrolyte interface, and this will require further interfacial engineering of electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Charge transfer process', 'Since LFP is converted to FePO4, there must be a charge transfer process involving electrons and/or holes that makes the LFP nanoparticles positively charged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, when the cathode is exposed to visible light, the only material that absorbs the photons is the dye, which has a HOMOLUMO gap of 2.33 eV (green light), the charge transfer process must take place between the dye and the LFP particles as shown in Fig 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Energy band alignment of the photo-cathode components.The arrows illustrate the desired process: the absorption of photons excites the dye, that leads to hole injection into LiFePO4 particles; the injection of holes into the charged phase of FePO4 is forbidden.The work functions of LiFePO4 and FePO4 are calculated as reported in this work; the energy band of N719 is adapted from the work of Zhang et al.66.Full size image', 'To investigate this hypothesis, we performed first-principles calculations on bands position in LFP and FePO4, and aligned the energy bands of the relevant materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This calculation is performed by determining the difference between the effective electronic potential in vacuum (Vvac) and the valence band maximum (EVBM) of the material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The band offset relative to the vacuum level is Eoff=VvacEVBM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 010 surface of LFP exposed to vacuum was used in the calculation because this surface has the lowest surface energy, and consequently the highest equilibrium surface area26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We utilized the VASP package28 with the projector-augmented wavefunction scheme29,30 using the PerdewBurkeErnzerhof exchange correlation function31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The surface structure of LFP that is aligned perpendicular to the 010 direction plus 25, 30 and 35 Å-thick vacuum layers was relaxed until the forces on the atoms were  less_than 0.01 eV Å1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values reported here were obtained with the 35 Å vacuum layer, which converged the band positions very well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thickness of LFP was five times greater than the dimension of the 010 direction of the lattice parameter in the calculation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our test also shows that further increase in the LFP thickness does not significantly change the final result.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The band offset of the maximum in the LFP valence band is 5.2 eV, as shown in Fig 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A calculation of the band offset of FePO4 by the same procedure yielded 8.3 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These aligned energy bands convinced us that the desired processes are as illustrated in Fig 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is to say, the incident photon excites electrons in the dye molecule, pumping them to the excited LUMO, leaving a hole in the HOMO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the LFP particles are positively charged by the holes, the electrochemical potential for Li+ increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The equilibrium between the Li+ in the electrolyte and LFP particles shifts towards more Li+ in the electrolyte as the cathode is charged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when most of the LFP is transformed to FePO4, as illustrated in Fig 6, the absorption of photons does not lead to hole transfer to FePO4, therefore the reaction stops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The undesired processes, such as charge carrier recombination, electrons hopping to FePO4 do exist and adversely affect energy conversion efficiency as already alluded earlier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proper selection of cell components and interfacial electrode engineering should be pursued for improving the efficiency of the device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As for the electrons, it appears that they do not hop into FTO or ITO to any significant extent if consider that during OCV illumination no current was flowing between the two electrodes, lithium reduction is energetically unfavourable (see next paragraph) and the FTO/ITO collectors remained totally transparent, without showing any lithium intercalation product (that is, the TCO did not become brownish).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The next section discusses the fate of photo-generated electrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Fate of photogenerated electrons', 'Although the open circuit potential of the photo-cathode (WE versus Liref) increases to 3.63.9 V, lithium ions cannot be reduced to lithium metal (an additional 1.5 eV is needed to complete the process).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore carried out a systematic analysis as to the fate of photo-excited electrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The photo-generated electrons did not reduce any crystalline component of the film as evident by XRD (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LiF was observed at the surface of the film (Supplementary Fig 13), but this is linked to electrolyte hydrolysis32 (as evidenced by the presence of hydrolysed electrolyte product POF(OH)2 and HF in the electrolyte, see NMR data in Supplementary Figs 2427).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the dye could not have been reduced considering that its tiny amount (1:1,000) was able to oxidize the whole LFP for at least 15 times as confirmed by Raman analysis (Supplementary Fig 14) that revealed the presence of N719 (refs 33, 34) in photo-oxidized sample with FePO4 (refs 35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition no new impurities such as Li2O, Li2CO3 or LiOH were observed in the analysis of the film as confirmed by EELS analysis (Supplementary Fig 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Having ruled out the reduction of Li+ ions at the anode or the reduction of any component of the TCO/LFP/dye photocathode we propose that the photo-generated electrons react with some component(s) of the electrolyte used (LiPF6 in EC/DEC+VC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify this scenario, we tested different electrolytes: 1 M LiPF6 in EC/DEC+2% VC, 1 M LiPF6 in THF (in THF polymerization reactions are slower than in DME/DOL37), 1 M LiPF6 in TEGDME38, 1 M LiTFSI in EC/DEC +2% VC and 1 M LiTFSI in DME/DOL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed photo-oxidation of LFP to take place (after 24 h illumination) only when LiPF6 in ECDEC+2% VC is used as electrolyte (Supplementary Fig 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This series of tests confirms that the photo-oxidation is facilitated by certain electrolyte components as are, for example, EC and DEC that are known to be prone to reaction39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed further that the reaction in LiPF6 in EC/DEC+2% VC involved oxygen as only in the presence of oxygen gas (dry room environment) and not in the presence of argon, did photo-oxidation take place (Supplementary Fig 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose the following reaction sequence to account for these observations: the photo-generated electrons reduce oxygen and the new reduced oxygen species (for example, peroxide and/or superoxide40) being unstable react with the carbonate-based electrolyte to form SEI as also has been observed in LiO2 battery studies by Zhu41 and Read42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The formation of insoluble Li carbonate SEI species was confirmed indirectly by the data of Supplementary Fig 21 that revealed the formation of cubic and polyhedral shaped organic Li carbonate crystals on the Li metal surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However NMR could not detect any reduced electrolyte species (Supplementary Figs 2427).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low reactivity of LiTFSI in EC/DEC+2% VC should be due to differences in viscosity and lithium ion solvation properties43,44 that hinder lithium release by LFP photo-oxidation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We also found that when the LFP film was immersed in the LiPF6 in EC/DEC+2%VC electrolyte under light illumination without any lithium metal present, then no photo-oxidation was observed in 48 h. But photo-oxidation did take place after 7 days (Supplementary Fig 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the presence of lithium metal as CE accelerates the LFP photo-oxidation reaction via catalytic reduction reaction of the coupled oxygen/electrolyte.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify the role of the lithium metal CE and the presumed reduction of the electrolyte (EC/DEC solvent components) via the reduced oxygen species formed by the photo-generated electrons, we performed a new OCV test under illumination using the two-electrode (LFP versus Li) cell configuration the results of which are given in Supplementary Fig 20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As it can be seen the OCV of LFP increased with illumination time again and LFP converted to FePO4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the presence of lithium, even without passage of electrons via the external circuit, is confirmed to facilitate this photo-oxidation reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We procedeed afterwards to examine the reaction products formed on the lithium metal (CE) surface after completion of the photo-oxidation test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis revealed the formation of crystals (cubic and polyhedral; see Supplementary Fig 21a,b) that contain lithium, carbon and oxygen as confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS)45 (Supplementary Fig 21c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no cubic or polyhedral crystals were observed to form after simple immersion of lithium metal for 48 h in 1 M LiPF6 EC/DEC +2% VC (Supplementary Figs 22 and 23) pointining to the link between photo-oxidation and SEI formation on Li anode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have further performed EDS analysis on the Li metal anode after 48 h of discharge and we observed no more micron-sized cubic crystals that constituted the major part of the SEI but only rings composed of Li, C and O (Supplementary Figs 2931).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, we observed just remnants of the SEI after discharge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Global mechanism of LFP photo-oxidation', 'Considering that no external current between the electrodes is possible during OCV illumination, that lithium is not deposited on the anode but rather consumed during the discharge, the composition of the electrolyte has an influence on the photo-oxidation reaction, that the presence of lithium metal facilitates the photo-oxidation of LFP, and that the SEI crystals formed on the lithium anode surface at least partially dissolves during discharge, we propose the following mechanism (as depicted in Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The photo-assisted charging of LFP in the LFP(dye)/electrolyte/Li cell involves in addition to the oxidation of LFP via the injection of holes from the photo-excited dye, a two-step reaction sequence in which firstly the photo-generated electrons promote reduction of oxygen followed by the reaction with carbonate-based electrolyte (probably the ethylene carbonate39) and secondly lithium metal surface appear to provide favourable nucleation sites enabling the deposition of the new Li-carbonate-based electrolyte derivative components as Li compound crystal-containing SEI thanks to accumulated Li+ ions at the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SEI film crystals mostly dissolve during discharging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SEI does not appear to hinder the transfer of Li+ ions from the anode to the cathode during discharge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the lithium metal facilitates the photo-oxidation reaction that mimics the charge process of a Li-ion battery under light irradiation, although no traceable Li reduction takes place at the anode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case the photo-generated electrons can be thought to be chemically stored as SEI at the lithium metal side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: Global photo-assisted charging mechanism.LFP photo-oxidation by holes injected by the excited dye and formation of SEI via reduction of oxygen by photoelectrons in the LFP(dye)/electrolyte/Li cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Organic carbonate-based electrolyte is decomposed by reaction with peroxide/superoxide generated by the photogenerated electrons and oxygen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scale bar of TEM image is 200 nm.Full size image', 'In the present cell configuration, for energetic reasons mentioned earlier no new lithium metal is deposited at the anode during photo-assisted charging; this means that during the discharge lithium metal is consumed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In future work an alternative anode will have to be developed within an operating voltage of 0.71 V. In the meantime the high (double of the theoretical one) discharge capacities shown in Fig 5 are due to continuing LFP photo-oxidation by N719 dye that keeps creating Li vacancies accommodating higher Li-ion storage than the stoichiometric formula suggests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This view is supported with the data presented in Supplementary Fig 28 where LFP and FePO4 are seen to co-exist after 48 h of discharge under illumination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To clarify the enabling role of oxygen we performed discharge tests of films using with and without LFP in either inert (argon) atmosphere or oxygen (dry room) atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The film tested were the standard LFP/CNTs/N19 film plus films of carbon nanotubes alone, or carbon nanotubes+N719 dye.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are shown in Fig 8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two films of CNTs (with and without dye) tested in dry room showed a sloping voltage plateau starting at 2.9 V independent of the presence of the dye (with or without light exposure); by contrast no such plateau was observed in the case of the film tested in O2-free Ar-glove box46 indicating that the voltage plateau was associated with the reduction of O2 (refs 47, 48, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carbon nanotubes are known to activate the reduction of O2 as suggested by Zhang50, Lim51 and Zelang52, but ruthenium53 in the diluted N719 dye plays a role only when LFP is present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the light of these results, we can explain why the LFP/CNTs/N719 film shows high discharged (as mentioned above) capacities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus while FePO4 can be converted to LFP by the externally applied current during discharge, the formed LFP reconverts into FePO4 again by the photo-excited N719 dye that injects holes to LFP and electrons to oxygen, with the latter leading to formation of peroxide or superoxide species40,54,55,56 that subsequently react with carbonates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 8: Discharge curves of films in different gas atmosphere at fixed C/24 discharge rate.Discharge curves of CNTs+N719 dye film under Argon gas (black line), CNTs+ N719 dye film in dry room (blue line), film of CNTs in dry room (red line) and LiFePO4+CNTs+dye film in dry room (green line).Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In summary, we described the direct (open circuit) photo-oxidation of LFP nanocrystals by light irradiation in the presence of a N719-Ruthenium-dye as hybrid photo-cathode in a two-electrode system with Li metal anode and LiPF6-EC/DEC/VC electrolyte that corresponds to standard Li-ion battery charging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dye-sensitization generates electronhole pairs with the holes aiding the chemical conversion of high surface area LFP (triphylite) nanoplatelets to FePO4 (heterosite) at the cathode and electrons utilized in the formation of SEI at the anode via oxygen reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LFP (3.4 V versus Li+/Li), in analogy with the I3/I couple (3.1 V versus Li+/Li) in DSSCs, acts effectively as a reversible redox agent for the regeneration of the dye N719.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photo-oxidation of LFP is pronounced with colloidal nanoplatelets but less so with hydrothermally synthesized crystals reflecting the strong nanosize/surface area effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SEI consists of organic lithium carbonate deposits-their formation of which is driven by the reduction of oxygen gas into per-/super-oxide species followed by the reaction of the latter with carbonate electrolyte components and accumulated of Li ions at the surface of the Li metal anode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon discharge most of the SEI dissolves and is reconstituted partially with repeated photo-charging and galvanostatic discharging cycling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The generated discharge current corresponds to a capacity at least two times the theoretical value of LFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same capacity was observed after 15 discharges (and 15 OCV photo-assisted charges).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The excess capacity is attributed to the fact that the photocathode continues undergoing partial charge during galvanostatic discharge because of its exposure to light that induces LFP to delithiate, hence creating vacancies for extra charge storage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The combined photo-conversion and storage efficiency of the prototype two-electrode cell with LFP/CNTs/N719 as photo-cathode and Li metal as CE was calculated to be in the range 0.060.08%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though these values are low we should keep in mind that these are early performance data corresponding to electrodes made of LFP nanoparticles deposited on (transparent conductive oxide) TCO along carbon and a binder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To put this into perspective hybrid devices made of tandems of solar cells and energy storage cells yield till very recently efficiencies  less_than 1% (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the present system featuring a hybrid photo-cathode (LFP/dye) is unlike the previous in-series concept9 or three-electrode systems25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this early stage, we attribute such low current efficiency to large charge recombination losses at the LFP/dye/electrolyte interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings open new possibilities in designing photo-rechargeable Li-ion batteries based on a two-electrode device configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the critical issues that need to be tackled before such an exciting nanotechnology device becomes a reality include interfacial engineering of the LFP/dye photo-cathode to reduce charge recombination losses and use of a reversible redox mediator that can accept the photo-generated electrons thus suppressing undesirable electrolyte reduction reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also it is important to select an anode that can provide an operating voltage of 0.71 V as suggested by redox flow battery systems57,58,59,60,61,62 and iodine based systems13,63,64.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
