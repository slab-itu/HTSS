Tumour resistance in induced pluripotent stem cells derived from naked mole-rats  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The naked mole-rat (NMR, Heterocephalus glaber), which is the longest-lived rodent species, exhibits extraordinary resistance to cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that NMR somatic cells exhibit a unique tumour-suppressor response to reprogramming induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we generate NMR-induced pluripotent stem cells (NMR-iPSCs) and find that NMR-iPSCs do not exhibit teratoma-forming tumorigenicity due to the species-specific activation of tumour-suppressor alternative reading frame (ARF) and a disruption mutation of the oncogene ES cell-expressed Ras (ERAS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The forced expression of Arf in mouse iPSCs markedly reduces tumorigenicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we identify an NMR-specific tumour-suppression phenotypeARF suppression-induced senescence (ASIS)that may protect iPSCs and somatic cells from ARF suppression and, as a consequence, tumorigenicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, NMR-specific ARF regulation and the disruption of ERAS regulate tumour resistance in NMR-iPSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings obtained from studies of NMR-iPSCs provide new insight into the mechanisms of tumorigenicity in iPSCs and cancer resistance in the NMR.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Generation of NMR-iPSCs', 'To induce reprogramming in NMR, we transduced adult skin fibroblasts (NMR-fibroblasts) using retroviral vectors expressing Ms OSKM8 (Fig 1b, Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within 23 weeks, ESC-like colonies appeared in standard human-ESC medium containing basic fibroblast growth factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The alkaline-phosphatase (AP)-positive colony-formation efficiency of these cells was 0.0029±0.00028% (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ESC-like colonies were expanded and designated NMR-iPSCs (Fig 1c and Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These colonies did not form under hypoxic conditions or without the introduction of c-Myc (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although small AP-positive colonies appeared in Ms-ESC medium containing either leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or LIF/2i (GSK3 and MEK inhibitors)17, the colonies did not expand after picking up (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'NMR-iPSCs exhibit pluripotency but not tumorigenicity', 'Two NMR-iPSC clones were normal karyotype (58XY;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cells suffer from stressors such as reprogramming, oncogene activation, and replication stress are known to derepress INK4a and ARF expression30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stressed cells become senescent; this is the first safeguard against oncogenic transformation30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the results of the present study, we suggest that NMR-specific ASIS may act as a second safeguard, inducing cellular senescence when ARF is suppressed in cells, in which ARF has been derepressed by exposure to stressors (Fig 4k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An ARF-activated cell population may thus be selected during the generation of NMR-iPSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, NMRs encode truncated forms of INK4a and ARF20,32, suggesting that unique cancer-resistance mechanisms mediated by INK4a and ARF evolved in NMRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We conclude that the tumour resistance in NMR-iPSCs is based on NMR-specific ARF regulation and disruption of ERAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further research into the detailed mechanisms underlying ASIS in NMRs may contribute to the generation of non-tumorigenic human-iPSCs enabling safer cell-based therapeutics and shed new light on cancer resistance in the naked mole-rat.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
