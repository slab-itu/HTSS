Targeting LOXL2 for cardiac interstitial fibrosis and heart failure treatment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Interstitial fibrosis plays a key role in the development and progression of heart failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that an enzyme that crosslinks collagenLysyl oxidase-like 2 (Loxl2)is essential for interstitial fibrosis and mechanical dysfunction of pathologically stressed hearts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mice, cardiac stress activates fibroblasts to express and secrete Loxl2 into the interstitium, triggering fibrosis, systolic and diastolic dysfunction of stressed hearts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibody-mediated inhibition or genetic disruption of Loxl2 greatly reduces stress-induced cardiac fibrosis and chamber dilatation, improving systolic and diastolic functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loxl2 stimulates cardiac fibroblasts through PI3K/AKT to produce TGF-2, promoting fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transformation; Loxl2 also acts downstream of TGF-2 to stimulate myofibroblast migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In diseased human hearts, LOXL2 is upregulated in cardiac interstitium; its levels correlate with collagen crosslinking and cardiac dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LOXL2 is also elevated in the serum of heart failure (HF) patients, correlating with other HF biomarkers, suggesting a conserved LOXL2-mediated mechanism of human HF.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of death, with a mortality rate of 50% within five years of diagnosis1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This high mortality rate reflects inadequacy of modern therapy and calls for a new mechanistic paradigm for treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A major cause of cardiac dysfunction is the adverse tissue remodelling with interstitial fibrosis2,3,4,5,6, caused by various pathological insults that include hypertension and myocardial infarction, with the extent of interstitial fibrosis prognosticating clinical outcomes of the diseased heart6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current therapies that improve HF survival primarily target the pathogenic mechanisms that occur within cardiomyocytes but not those mechanisms that take place outside cardiomyocytes in the interstitial space that houses collagen and fibroblasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This lack of direct therapy against interstitial mechanism of HF may contribute to the persistently high morbidity and mortality of HF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The major causes of death in HF are ventricular arrhythmias and pump failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the arrhythmic death can be effectively prevented by implantable cardiac defibrillators, death from pump failure has become an even more pressing issue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cardiac systolic and diastolic pump functions are both compromised in patients suffering from HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, current therapies only have moderate efficacy in systolic dysfunction and are ineffective for diastolic pump failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For patients having HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), who have primarily diastolic dysfunction, there is no proven therapy that can improve diastolic function and long-term outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, an urgent need remains for novel, complementary medical therapies, which target maladaptive left ventricular tissue remodelling/fibrosis to improve systolic and diastolic functions of failing hearts2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interstitial fibrosis plays a key role in the development and progression of HF by causing adverse mechanical and electrical disturbances in the diseased hearts2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interstitial fibrosis impairs the electromechanical coordination between cardiomyocytes to compromise systolic contractility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fibrosis also increases ventricular stiffness and impairs diastolic relaxation and filling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We found that Lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) is upregulated in the interstitium of diseased mouse and human hearts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased LOXL2 expression leads to increased TGF-2 production, triggering the formation and migration of myofibroblasts with enhanced collagen deposition and crosslinking in the hypertrophic regions of stressed hearts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These effects result in interstitial fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concept of targeting LOXL2 in HF is supported by our preclinical data from cell-based assays, pharmacological studies and mouse genetic models, as well as by the clinical evidence of elevated cardiac tissue and serum LOXL2 in HF patients and correlation of tissue LOXL2 level with fibrosis and cardiac physiological changes in HF patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The efficacy of anti-LOXL2 antibody and genetic LOXL2 disruption in relieving cardiac interstitial fibrosis and diastolic abnormalities is particularly salient, given the lack of direct therapy against cardiac fibrosis, and the increasing emphasis on diastolic dysfunction as an integral part of the heart failure syndrome.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cardiac interstitial fibrosis is a major cause of systolic and diastolic abnormalities2,3,4,5,6 and a strong predictor of the clinical outcomes of patients with HF across a wide spectrum of disease severity6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the fibrotic process has not been a direct therapeutic target for HF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In patients with HF, LOXL2 levels are elevated in heart tissues and serum, its levels correlating with cardiac dysfunction and HF biomarker levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mice, LOXL2 activation is essential for cardiac fibrosis and HF development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genetic or pharmacological inhibition of LOXL2 greatly reduces cardiac fibrosis and halts HF progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The human sample and animal efficacy studies, in combination, suggest a pathogenic role of LOXL2 in cardiac fibrosis and human HF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our studies therefore delineate a novel LOXL2-mediated HF mechanism and provide new insights into HF therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In mechanically stressed hearts, LOXL2 expression is activated in the fibroblasts, which then release LOXL2 proteins into the interstitial space, particularly in the hypertrophic area where the mechanical stress is highest (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that LOXL2 activation is a response of cardiac fibroblasts to enhanced mechanical stress to maintain structural integrity of the heart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, LOXL2 elevation has multiple biological effects that promote interstitial collagen formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LOXL2 not only triggers myofibroblast transformation to enhance collagen production (through PI3K-AKT-mTOR and TGF-), but also augments collagen strength (by crosslinking collagen fibres).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LOXL2 also stimulates myofibroblasts migration to large areas of the heart, where these cells produce collagen fibres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collagen fibres, once released into the interstitial space, are crosslinked by LOXL2 to form bundles of collagen that are much stiffer than isolated collagen fibres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, activated fibroblasts secrete more LOXL2 and collagen, creating a positive feedback loop to sustain the fibrotic process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All these factors, in combination, trigger diffuse interstitial fibrosis of pathologically stressed hearts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The LOXL2-mediated stress reaction, although capable of reinforcing tissue strength in the face of increased mechanical stress, is ultimately maladaptive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excessive amount of collagen fibres in cardiac interstitial space impede coronary vasodilation, oxygen diffusion and electromechanical coordination between cardiomyocytes, causing contractile abnormalities (systolic pump dysfunction)34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, the increase of collagen and its crosslinking stiffens the left ventricle, impairing ventricular relaxation and filling (diastolic pump dysfunction)35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the LOXL2-mediated interstitial reaction leads to both systolic and diastolic abnormalities, revealing a novel therapeutic avenue for HF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diastolic aspect of LOXL2 effects is particularly important, given the recognition and increasing prevalence of diastolic dysfunction as part of HF syndrome and the lack of approved therapy for HFpEF with primarily diastolic failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although LOXL2 can interact with TGF- in models of cancer and bone remodelling14,37, the roles of LOXL2 gene in HF have not been demonstrated in mouse genetic models in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By generating a new LOXL2 genetic model with fibroblast-specific LOXL2 knockout, we showed crucial roles of LOXL2 in cardiac fibroblasts for stress-induced interstitial fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What remains unanswered is how LOXL2-mediated changes of extracellular collagen composition affect TGF- processing and signalling and guide the cellular process of myofibroblast migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that LOXL2 is transcriptionally activated in the stressed hearts, it will be essential to know what factors control the expression of LOXL2 gene in the hearts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene expression regulation can occur at the chromatin, transcription or posttranscriptional level, mediated respectively by epigenetic factors (chromatin-regulating factors, long noncoding RNAs), transcription factors and microRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding LOXL2 regulation will provide an opportunity to integrate cardiac fibrosis with epigenetics and RNA mechanisms of HF and to identify additional new targets for HF therapy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
