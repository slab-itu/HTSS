Early programming of the oocyte epigenome temporally controls late prophase I transcription and chromatin remodelling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Oocytes are arrested for long periods of time in the prophase of the first meiotic division (prophase I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As chromosome condensation poses significant constraints to gene expression, the mechanisms regulating transcriptional activity in the prophase I-arrested oocyte are still not entirely understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that gene expression during the prophase I arrest is primarily epigenetically regulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we comprehensively define the Drosophila female germ line epigenome throughout oogenesis and show that the oocyte has a unique, dynamic and remarkably diversified epigenome characterized by the presence of both euchromatic and heterochromatic marks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that the perturbation of the oocytes epigenome in early oogenesis, through depletion of the dKDM5 histone demethylase, results in the temporal deregulation of meiotic transcription and affects female fertility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our results indicate that the early programming of the oocyte epigenome primes meiotic chromatin for subsequent functions in late prophase I.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Oocytes remain arrested for a significant amount of time during prophase of the first meiotic division (prophase I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This prophase I arrest is remarkably conserved across Metazoans and is essential for oocyte differentiation1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prophase I chromosomes are organized as bivalentspairs of homologous chromosomes connected by chiasmata and sister chromatid cohesion2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The formation of bivalents requires chromosome condensation and compaction, both of which pose significant constraints to gene expression3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such constraints are particularly problematic in the context of female meiosis, because during the prolonged prophase I arrest the oocyte needs to accumulate maternal components that are essential for oogenesis and early embryogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Oocytes have developed distinct strategies to ensure gene expression while maintaining chromosome condensation5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of insects that undergo meroistic oogenesis, such as Drosophila, germ line transcriptional activity is ensured by the nurse cellsnon-meiotic germ cells in cytoplasmic continuity with the oocyte6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nurse cells sustain oocyte development via the synthesis and transport of maternal factors into the developing female gamete.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the differentiation of nurse cells allows the Drosophila oocyte to shutdown transcription throughout most of oogenesis8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This oocyte transcriptional quiescence is associated with the reorganization of the oocytes chromatin into a highly compact cluster of meiotic chromosomes referred to as the karyosome9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, despite being transcriptionally inactive throughout most of the prophase I arrest, cytological findings from the early 1970s indicate that the Drosophila oocyte reactivates transcription prior to the resumption of meiosis11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This often-overlooked observation poses two fundamental questions: how is transcription possible in such highly compacted chromatin and what is the functional relevance of oocyte transcription for meiotic progression?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results indicate that the programming of the Drosophila oocyte epigenome during early oogenesis controls, several hours later, the transcriptional reactivation of meiotic chromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, we find that the oocyte epigenome is unique, being remarkably diversified and dynamic in terms of euchromatic and heterochromatic marks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the disruption of the oocyte epigenome, mainly through increased levels of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), a euchromatic mark associated with the transcription start site of active genes12,13, leads to significant defects in three main biological programs: (i) temporal control of gene expression; (ii) regulation of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) levels in oocyte chromatin; and (iii) remodelling of the meiotic chromosomes in late prophase I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nature of these defects has a critical impact on meiotic completion and female fertility.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Drosophila oocytes reactivate transcription during meiosis', 'Consistent with previous reports11, we observed using a ethynyl uridine (EU) incorporation assay that the Drosophila oocyte is transcriptionally inactive throughout most of the prophase I arrest (from oogenesis stage 5 until the end of stage 8; Fig 1A, Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This transcriptional quiescence starts from the onset of the prophase I arrest, lasts for 25 h, and is associated with the reorganization of oocyte chromatin into a highly compact cluster of meiotic chromosomes referred to as the karyosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the prolonged transcriptional inactivity, we observed that Drosophila oocytes reactivate gene expression 13 h before meiotic resumption (at oogenesis stage 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This precisely-timed oocyte transcriptional reactivation is intriguing, as the polyploid nurse cells ensure essentially all transcriptional activity in the Drosophila female germ line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such observation raises the possibility that successful meiotic progression requires oocyte-specific transcription during the prophase I arrest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Drosophila oocytes have a unique, dynamic and diversified epigenome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Schematic of Drosophila oogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The functional unit of the Drosophila ovary is the ovarian follicle or egg chamber, which consists of the cyst defined by the oocyte and its supporting nurse cells surrounded by a monolayer of somatic cells (follicle cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The morphological features of the ovarian follicles define 14 distinct developmental stages (S).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oocyte progresses through the initial phases of prophase I until it arrests at diplotene at oogenesis stage 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The onset of this arrest is preceded by the clustering of oocyte chromosomes into a highly compact and transcriptionally quiescent structurethe karyosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As oogenesis progresses the oocyte grows in size mainly through cytoplasmic transfer from the nurse cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At stage 9 the oocyte reactivates transcription, which lasts until the start of stage 11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prophase I arrest is lifted at stage 13 and results in the formation of a metaphase I-arrested gamete.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Distinct patterns of histone post-translation modifications (PTMs) in the Drosophila ovarian follicle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three main patterns were identified: (i) oocyte-specific expression (histone H2B lysine 16 acetylationH2BK16ac; aa), (ii) oocyte+somatic (follicle) cell expression (histone H4 lysine 12 acetylationH4K12ac; bb), and generalized distribution (oocyte (albeit sometimes at lower levels)+nurse cells+somatic cells; histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylationH3K4me3;

Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to mammals17, Drosophila oocytes had both euchromatic and heterochromatic marks (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we identified in the Drosophila oocyte both H3K4me3 (a euchromatic mark) and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3; Fig 2A), a heterochromatic mark associated with Polycomb-mediated gene repression18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that oocyte H3K27me3 levels were dynamically regulated throughout prophase I: the high levels maintained during transcriptional quiescence were decreased as the oocyte reacquired transcriptional activity (at stage 9;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Here we describe the unique diversity and dynamism of the Drosophila oocyte epigenome and provide evidence on how this epigenome can control chromosome activity during the prophase I arrest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to our model (Fig 8), dKDM5 sets the correct levels of H3K4me3 (and other epigenetic modifications such as H3K9ac) during early oogenesis, prior to the compaction of the meiotic chromosomes into the karyosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once specified, the dKDM5-dependent oocyte epigenome regulates, several hours later in late prophase I, two interconnected processes: transcription and chromosome remodelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the causal relationship between these two processes is still open to speculation, the developmentally regulated reactivation of transcription during the prophase I arrest is clearly dependent on the levels of RNAPII in oocyte chromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though the contribution of other epigenetic modifications to the phenotypes observed following dKDM5 depletion should be taken into consideration27,39, our data suggest that the oocyte epigenome is able to control RNAPII activity through an H3K4me3-mediated process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we propose a temporally differentiated epigenetic mechanism where the removal of H3K4me3 marks in the open chromatin of early oogenesis regulates, several hours later, the onset of transcription in condensed chromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 8: Proposed model for the epigenetic regulation of prophase I chromosome activity.The histone demethylase dKDM5 programs the oocyte chromatin state during early oogenesis, through its actions on H3K4me3 and other epigenetic modifications such as H3K9ac.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once programmed, the dKDM5-dependent oocyte epigenome temporally controls, several hours afterwards in late prophase I, the onset of transcription and meiotic chromosome remodeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultimately, the germ line-specific activity of dKDM5 is required for successful completion of meiosis and female fertility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Development time in relation to the start of oogenesis is expressed in hours post-germ line stem cell division (h.p.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ).Full size image', 'Is transcriptional reactivation during the prophase I arrest functionally relevant, or is it merely a by-product of oocyte chromatin remodelling?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the identity of the karyosome-expressed genes is unknown, this question will remain unanswered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the possibility of late prophase I gene expression being required for meiotic progression is tantalizing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, recent studies have shown that transcription in budding yeast shapes the meiotic chromosome axis40; while in human cells the late mitotic expression of a long non-coding RNA is required for the recruitment of centromeric proteins to the chromosomes41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that oocyte transcriptional reactivation coincides with a significant remodelling of the karyosome-clustered chromosomes prior to meiotic resumption, and that such remodelling is abnormally long and structurally different in dKDM5-depleted conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This remodelling of chromosomes in late prophase I is an evolutionarily conserved process required for the acquisition of meiotic maturation competence43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the severely compromised meiotic completion observed following dKDM5 knockdown most likely results from the aforementioned defects in late prophase I chromosome remodelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To what extent can our findings be extended to mammalian oogenesis?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to Drosophila, mammalian oocytes have a diversified epigenome with a simultaneous enrichment of euchromatic and heterochromatic marks17,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, mammalian oocytes also change their transcriptional activity during the prophase I arrest46,47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In light of this, we propose that the significantly reduced female fertility of mouse mutants for KDM5B (one of the mammalian homologues of dKDM5 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  49) is attributable to defects equivalent to those we report here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition, the importance of this histone demethylase in fertility may even extend to humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For several decades we and others have observed that deletions of the AZFb (AZoospermia Factor b) region of the human Y chromosome are causative agents of male infertility due to a complete block of sperm meiotic maturation50,51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 6.2 Mb-long AZFb deletions can affect up to 10 different genes and, therefore, the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for the infertility phenotype remain(s) unknown53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the genes removed in AZFb deletions is KDM5D, the Y-chromosome-specific homologue of dKDM5 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the meiotic maturation defects seen in dKDM5-depleted oocytes, we speculate that KDM5D may be the long sought-after gene responsible for the AZFb deletion phenotype in humans.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

timed egg-lay (30 min) was conducted using apple juice agar plates as substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total number of eggs harvested per plate was determined and plates were incubated for 48 h at 25 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of hatched eggs was then recorded and the fertility rate determined as the number of hatched eggs divided by the number of harvested eggs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four independent experiments were conducted for each experimental condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Statistical analysis', 'Relative fluorescence signals and chromatin perimeter measurements were compared between control and experimental groups using nonparametric tests (MannWhitney U-test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frequencies of egg hatching and mitotic entry were compared between control and experimental groups using Students t-test for two samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the screen for oocyte chromatin remodelling enzymes, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 levels were compared using Students t-test for paired samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of the different configurations of the MI arrest was compared between control and experimental groups using two-way analysis of variance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reported P values correspond to two-tailed tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All analyses were performed using Prism 5 software (GraphPad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'All relevant data and reagents
