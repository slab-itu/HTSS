Potent social synchronization can override photic entrainment of circadian rhythms  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Circadian rhythms in behaviour and physiology are important for animal health and survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies with individually isolated animals in the laboratory have consistently emphasized the dominant role of light for the entrainment of circadian rhythms to relevant environmental cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although in nature interactions with conspecifics are functionally significant, social signals are typically not considered important time-givers for the animal circadian clock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results challenge this view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By studying honeybees in an ecologically relevant context and using a massive data set, we demonstrate that social entrainment can be potent, may act without direct contact with other individuals and does not rely on gating the exposure to light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show for the first time that social time cues stably entrain the clock, even in animals experiencing conflicting photic and social environmental cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings add to the growing appreciation for the importance of studying circadian rhythms in ecologically relevant contexts.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Circadian clocks driving rhythms in behaviour and physiology are ubiquitous in metazoans, including animals living in constant environments1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fitness benefit of these internal clocks is thought to lay in the temporal organization and coordination of internal molecular, biochemical and physiological processes4,5,6, and in aligning these processes with regular and predictable daynight cycles in the environment7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Light and temperature are considered the dominant time-givers (zeitgebers) entraining circadian clocks in diverse organisms including cyanobacteria, fungi, plants and animals9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Progress in molecular genetics and the development of methods allowing high resolution and precise monitoring of circadian rhythms in locomotor activity for isolated individuals in a constant laboratory environment has enabled remarkable progress in deciphering the mechanisms underlying the generation of circadian rhythms and their photic entrainment (for example, mammals10 and flies11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the wild, animals live in complex environments in which their ability to adjust their behaviour to respond to conspecifics has profound fitness consequences12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even in modern human societies in which individuals have unprecedented control on their environment, there is evidence that the discrepancy between biological (circadian) and societal timing (such as school or work schedules) results in social jetlag that can be expressed in reduced performance and increased illness14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is reasonable to assume that social influences on the circadian clock may be important in many, if not all animals, but currently there is only little support for this premise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'If social entrainment is indeed important, then there should be pathways connecting the perception of social signals to the endogenous clock system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, however, no neuronal pathways transmitting visual, auditory, olfactory or tactile social stimuli to the clock have been described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, it has been suggested that social influences on the mammalian clock are mediated by neuronal and/or endocrine correlates of nonspecific arousal or increased activity17, by sleep18, or by learning processes that associate circadian time with specific actions19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the lightdark (LD) cycle is the dominant environmental factor influencing circadian rhythms, it was further proposed that social stimuli can affect circadian functions by modulating the time and pattern of exposure to potent photic time-givers17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This notion has also been applied to humans, in which the early view that social cues have a necessary and sufficient role as circadian time-givers independent of light has reversed and light is now viewed as the primary, if not exclusive, circadian time-giver17,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An additional difficulty with social entrainment is the lack of a clear conceptual framework.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is sensible to assume that social entrainment is more important for group living than for solitary animals, but this hypothesis has received little support.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is indeed profound species-specific variation in studies testing social entrainment, but there is no simple relationship between the degree of sociality and the sensitivity of the circadian system to social influences21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although some of this variability can be attributed to differences in experimental design, it is notable that social interactions failed to entrain circadian rhythms in social mammals such as the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus), Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) and sugar gliders (Petaurus breviceps)22,23,24, as well as in the gregarious cockroach Leucophaea maderae25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, convincing social influences on circadian rhythms have been found in species that are not considered social, such as the fruit fly26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even time-specific interactions with a sexual partner, which are expected to have clear fitness benefits, have produced variable results, including studies in which they failed to have even small influences on circadian phase27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The best evidence for social entrainment is found in dark cavity-dwelling social animals such as bees and bats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These species may be especially responsive to social entrainment, because individuals may not experience ambient conditions directly, but rather rely on information received from group mates that forage outside their domicile12,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We studied the highly social honeybee Apis mellifera as a model for testing the hypothesis that social cues provide robust entraining signals, even capable of overriding strong photic signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Social insects are ecologically important and offer attractive model systems for studies on the interplay between social behaviour and circadian rhythms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temporal coordination of their activities is thought to be imperative for efficient colony functioning and for colony fitness (reviewed in refs 21, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During their pre-adult development and the first 23 weeks as adults, honeybee workers typically reside inside the constantly dark and tightly thermoregulated cavity of the nest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Young adult workers typically tend (nurse) the developing eggs, larvae and pupae (collectively termed brood) around the clock with no circadian rhythms in activity and in whole-brain clock-gene mRNA levels31,32,33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, these around-the-clock active bees do have a functional and entrained circadian clock; nurse bees that are removed from the hive and isolated individually in a constant laboratory environment almost instantly show circadian rhythms with high locomotor activity during the subjective day and relative quiescence during the subjective night31,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We used field-foraging honeybee colonies, allowing us to study social entrainment in an ecologically relevant context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first show that nest bees as young as 2 days of age are strongly entrained by the colony phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then show that this potent social entrainment does not depend on physical contact with other bees in the colony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we show that young nest bees that experience conflicting social and LD cycles maintain the phase of the social cycle when removed from the hive and monitored individually in constant laboratory conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study demonstrates a remarkably potent social entrainment and, to the best of our knowledge, provides the first evidence that social entrainment can override photic entrainment.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Young nest bees are entrained to ambient daynight cycles', 'Do young nest bees that are typically active around-the-clock in a constantly dark hive nevertheless have clocks that are entrained with the ambient daynight cycle?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first experiment we found that nurses in a dark hive show strong circadian rhythms in locomotor activity shortly after transfer to the laboratory in both trials (with bees from colonies H7 and S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They showed a coherent phase when using the onset, median or offset as an index for phase (Rayleigh test, length of vector: 0.9390.673;

WatsonWilliams F-test, n=11 and 17 for Forager and Nurse, respectively, P less_than 0.001; colony S8, n=31, 13 and 18, P=0.22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The offset of activity was earlier in nurses in the trial with bees from colony H7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar differences between the onset and offset were also found in previous studies in which the nurses were collected from LD-illuminated hives31,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The median between the onset and offset was similar for foragers and nurses in both trials (WatsonWilliams F-test, colony H7, n=11 and 15 for Forager and Nurse, respectively, P=0.86; colony S8, n=13 and 17, P=0.62; Fig 1 and Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that although nurses are typically active around the clock in the dark and homeostatically regulated nest, they nevertheless have functional pacemakers that are synchronized with ambient daynight cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Nurses removed from field-foraging colonies are synchronized to the daynight cycle outside.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Experimental procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nurses and foragers were collected from a field-foraging observation hive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hive was constantly dark but foragers exited the hive and are assumed to have experienced 12 h light (natural light)/12 h dark (LD) cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the eighth day, we collected foragers and nurses, placed each individually in a cage and monitored their locomotor activity for 5 days in constant conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Representative double-plot actograms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each panel shows locomotor activity for an individual bee monitored in constant laboratory environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The y axis depicts days in the monitoring cage;

'By studying a massive data set obtained from experiments with  greater than 1,000 individuals, we demonstrate that social entrainment in honeybees is potent, can act without direct contact and is not mediated by gating photic input to the circadian clock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Entrainment by the social environment of the colony was robust and stable for several days even for 2-day-old bees, which are typically active around the clock with no overt circadian rhythms and show relatively weak entrainment by light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, young bees that experienced conflicting photic and social environmental cycles showed a phase that was more similar to the social cycle, indicating that in honeybees social entrainment can override potent photic entrainment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings are not limited to certain genotypes or laboratory lines, because we repeated each experiment two to four times, each with bees from a different source colony (which were genetically different).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experimental protocol was specifically designed to clearly distinguish entrainment from masking, because we determined the circadian phase for bees transferred to individual cages in the constant laboratory environment and not while experiencing possible social and environmental cycles in the hive that could mask the influence of the internal clock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study provides the strongest available evidence for the power of social entrainment and emphasizes the importance of studying circadian rhythms in a species-specific ecologically relevant context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Nurse bees (that is, bees that typically care for the brood around the clock) in self-sustained, field-foraging colonies showed strong circadian rhythms in locomotor activity and a coherent phase when removed from constantly dark hives to individual cages in the laboratory (Fig 1 and Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments complement earlier studies showing strong synchronization for nurses that experienced LD cycles in observation hives31,34 and suggest that nurse bees in the hive are entrained by time-givers other than light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quite surprisingly, similarly strong synchronization was also found for callow bees that were monitored after experiencing the colony environment for only the first 2 days of their life as adults (Fig 2 and Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this age, worker honeybees typically show low levels of activity and are mostly engaged in cleaning honeycomb cells35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Callow bees that were monitored individually at the same age, but experienced the hive environment for only 24 h, did not show similar strong phase coherence, suggesting that their clock is not yet fully developed, that more than 24 h are needed for effective entrainment by the colony environment or a combination of these two factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eban-Rothschild et al.36 have indeed shown that the colony environment is necessary for the development of circadian rhythms in callows, and that 24 h inside the colony are not sufficient for them to develop a rhythm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional studies in which bees at various ages are introduced to the hive for 24 or 48 h could clarify this ambiguity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strong phase coherence was not compromised in 48-h-old bees that were caged in mesh enclosures in the centre of the brood area (Fig 4 and Supplementary Fig 4), indicating that entrainment in the hive does not require exposure to light at the hive entrance or to other microenvironmental cycles in peripheral parts of the hive that are less well regulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the hive cavity is constantly dark, and that the microenvironment in the brood area is tightly regulated37, we conclude that the synchronization of young nest bees in a colony is mediated by social factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous studies showed that honeybees that are confined in groups outside the colony can synchronize to a similar phase38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Are similar social interactions inside a hive sufficient to account for the strong entraining power of the colony?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We addressed this question by comparing the synchronization of bees in the colony and in small groups in cages outside the hive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The laboratory caged bees showed weak phase coherence and their phase commonly differed from the ambient daynight cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the phase coherence for the group-caged bees was typically stronger than in individually isolated bees from the same colony (Fig 3 and Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings support and extend the earlier evidence for social entrainment in groups of honeybees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phase coherence of bees in small groups was nonetheless weaker than for bees caged in similar groups inside the hive (Fig 4a and Supplementary Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the colony environment is a stronger synchronizer than the sum of mutual interactions between 30 bees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional studies in which larger groups of bees are caged outside the hive are necessary, to fully understand the influence of worker number on social synchronization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Light is considered the dominant time-giver responsible for the entrainment of circadian rhythms and the only one for which detailed characterization of the molecular and neuronal input pathways is available for both insects and vertebrates40,41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Honeybees, similar to other insects, are strongly entrained by light43,44,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, photic entrainment was shown in this study for young bees that were caged in small groups (for example, see Fig 5 and Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individually isolated newly emerged bees can be also entrained by LD43,46, but in comparison with the strong and stable entrainment of young bees in the current study, the photic entrainment in the earlier studies appears weaker, because many newly emerged bees that experienced LD illumination regimes for 3 or 6 days in isolation lost circadian rhythms when relaeased to constant darkness (DD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Is it possible that social entrainment is stronger than photic entrainment?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We explicitly addressed this question by subjecting nurse-age bees in freely foraging colonies to conflicting social and LD cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Young nest bees that experienced conflicing cycles of LD illumination and colony foraging activity cycles showed a phase that is more similar to foragers than to bees of a similar age that experienced the LD but not the social cycles (Fig 5 and Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The entrainment by forager activity cycles rather than by the LD illumination regime was also seen for nurse-age bees that were caged in the inner parts of the hive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings rule out the possibility that the young nest bees are entrained by exposure to environmental time givers, for example, when flying out for orientation flights47, or when approaching the hive entrance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, for the first time we show that social entrainment can override potent photic entrainment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our findings on the importance of social synchronization in honeybees set the stage for addressing a set of follow-up questions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, what are the social signals that mediate social synchronization?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that direct contact (for example, via contact pheromones or tactile communication) is not necessary for social entrainment in the hive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temperature also seems unlikely, because the brood area is tightly thermoregulated; however, previous studies have shown that temperature cycles with an amplitude of 610 °C are needed for stably entraining circadian rhythms in honeybees48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Volatile pheromones, hive odours, vibrations or changes in the microenvironment (for example, CO2 concentration and humidity) seem to be more promising.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional important lines for future inquiry include research on the sensory modalities perceiving the signals of social entrainment and the neuronal pathways transmitting the signal from sensory systems to the circadian clock system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Another question raised by our findings is why do young nest bees that typically care for brood around the clock in a constant laboratory environment need to be entrained to the daynight cycles outside?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nest bees may need entrained circadian clocks to organize behaviours such as orientation flights47 and for timing interactions with bees performing outside tasks (for example, pollen and nectar flow into the hive during the day).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A ticking circadian clock in around-the-clock active bees is perhaps also important for the coordination of internal metabolic processes (that is, intrinsic adaptive value5,6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The notion that circadian coordination of internal processes is important is supported by evidence that in diverse organisms disturbances to circadian functions compromise biochemical and metabolic processes, and are associated with a variety of diseases50,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hypothesis that some internal processes are circadianly regulated in around-the-clock active nest bees is also supported by evidence that many brain transcripts show circadian oscillations in nurse bees in the hive52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Social entrainment thus provides a powerful and efficient means to allow bees dwelling in the dark and constant environment of the nest to precisely adjust their behaviour and physiology to environmental cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The potent social synchronization we show here for honeybees suggests that social signals may also be important time-givers for the clocks of other animals and should be taken into account in studies on animal ecology and chronobiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our field study suggesting the supremacy of social over photic entrainment for honeybees in a colony adds to recent studies with both mice and Drosophila showing the complexity of clock regulation in the real world.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under ecologically relevant conditions, photic entrainment may be less important than expected based on laboratory studies53,54,55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these studies indicate that to understand how the circadian clock organizes behaviour and its functional significance, it is imperative to study animals in their species-specific natural context.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'General design', 'Honeybee colonies were kept according to standard beekeeping techniques in the Bee Research Facility at the Edmond J. Safra campus of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Givat-Ram, Jerusalem, Israel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified foragers as bees returning to the hive with pollen loads on their hind legs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain newly emerged bees, we removed honeycomb frames with sealed brood from field colonies, brushed off all adult bees and immediately placed the frame inside a lightproof box.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We brought the box with the frame to the laboratory and placed it in an incubator (33±1 °C, 60% relative humidity (RH)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We collected adult bees emerging from the honeycomb within 30 min (Experiments 25) or 24 h (Experiments 1 and 6) of comb brushing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then paint marked the callow bees on their thorax under dim red light and assigned the painted bees randomly to one of the experimental conditions as detailed for each experiment below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Experiments 25 the bees that were introduced to field colonies were exposed to daylight twice (during the introduction and the collection from the hive); thus, we also exposed the bees from the other treatments to a similar daylight experience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The light exposure lasted less than a minute during the introduction to the field colony and 510 min during collection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The findings that the phase of bees isolated individually from these experiments was not synchronized to the subjective day (see Results) indicate that these two exposures to daylight, as well as the handling procedures, did not entrain the circadian clock of the bees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Experiments 1 and 6, which were performed in indoor observation hives, the young bees were not exposed to light during the collection from the hive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Callow bees were randomly assigned to the different treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After being subjected to the different experimental conditions, the focal bees in all experiments were transferred to individual cages in a tightly regulated environmental chamber (constant dim red light, 29±1 °C, 60% RH) and their locomotor activity was monitored for 47 days (for example, see Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The locomotor activity data were analysed to determine various parameters related to circadian rhythms and social synchronization (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Observation hives', 'In Experiments 1 and 6, we established triple-cohort colonies with newly emerged bees (024 h of age), nurses, foragers (each cohort consisted of  greater than 1,500 bees) and their mother queen, all collected from the same source field colony (so all individuals were genetically related).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To collect the cohort of foragers we blocked the entrance to the source field colony using a metal 8-hole per inch mesh and caught  greater than 1,500 foragers returning to the hive with pollen loads on their hind legs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We collected a similar number of nurse bees that were observed inserting their head into brood-containing cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Newly emerged bees were collected as described above over a period of 24 successive days until reaching the desired number of  greater than 1,500 bees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 500 of the newly emerged bees were marked with a paint dot on their thorax under dim red light in all trials for Experiment 1 and trials 3 and 4 for Experiment 6, or under fluorescent light in trials 1 and 2 for Experiment 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each colony was housed in a two-frame observation hive (with transparent plexiglas walls, such that light could reach inside the hive) in an environmental chamber (29±1 °C;
