Probing cytoskeletal modulation of passive and active intracellular dynamics using nanobody-functionalized quantum dots  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The cytoplasm is a highly complex and heterogeneous medium that is structured by the cytoskeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How local transport depends on the heterogeneous organization and dynamics of F-actin and microtubules is poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use a novel delivery and functionalization strategy to utilize quantum dots (QDs) as probes for active and passive intracellular transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rapid imaging of non-functionalized QDs reveals two populations with a 100-fold difference in diffusion constant, with the faster fraction increasing upon actin depolymerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When nanobody-functionalized QDs are targeted to different kinesin motor proteins, their trajectories do not display strong actin-induced transverse displacements, as suggested previously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only kinesin-1 displays subtle directional fluctuations, because the subset of microtubules used by this motor undergoes prominent undulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using actin-targeting agents reveals that F-actin suppresses most microtubule shape remodelling, rather than promoting it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate how the spatial heterogeneity of the cytoskeleton imposes large variations in non-equilibrium intracellular dynamics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cells have a highly structured internal organization that depends on the cytoskeleton, a network of biopolymers, including F-actin and microtubules, that shapes the cell and enables active intracellular transport driven by a variety of motor proteins that can walk along F-actin (that is, myosins) or microtubules (that is, kinesins and dyneins).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intracellular transport processes can be categorized as either active or passive, depending on whether they are driven by chemical energy or by thermal excitation, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While linear motion driven by molecular motors is clearly active, recent studies have argued that the apparent passive dynamics of intracellular particles is largely driven by the active contractile dynamics of the actomyosin network, rather than by thermal excitation1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although one study suggested that even the apparent diffusion of individual proteins depends on this non-thermal mixing2, it has remained unclear for which particle sizes fluctuations of the viscoelastic actomyosin network would dominate over thermal diffusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, given that actin is enriched near the cortex, non-thermal contributions are likely to depend on the position within the cell, but how the highly heterogeneous intracellular organization of F-actin affects passive particle dynamics has remained largely unexplored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The heterogeneous composition of the cytoplasm should also affect active point-to-point transport inside cells4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, the intracellular behaviour of custom-synthesized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) was probed over several orders of magnitude in time and space3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was reported that their dynamics was strongly affected by the presence of an active viscoelastic cytoskeleton and that an active stirring mechanism induced large sideways fluctuations of SWNTs that were transported over microtubules by kinesin-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SWNTs are non-isotropic rods and have a disperse length distribution that spans at least one order of magnitude (1001,000 nm), which will result in disperse hydrodynamic properties that could hamper proper analysis and interpretations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although they are only 1 nm in diameter, their stiffness is comparable to that of actin filaments3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given these lengths and stiffness, their dynamics are expected to be governed by the actin network, which has a characteristic mesh size of 100 nm7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, earlier work reported that kinesin-1 moves on a specific subset of microtubules and, therefore, the generality of these observations has remained unclear8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we use quantum dots (QDs) to examine how the actin cytoskeleton modulates active and passive transport in different subcellular zones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  QDs are an attractive alternative for SWNTs and plastic beads, because they are widely available, can be tuned to emit in the visible range and have a monodisperse size distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although QDs have been used previously to study intracellular dynamics, their widespread use in intracellular applications has so far been hampered by challenges in intracellular delivery and functionalization9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We combine adherent cell electroporation and nanobody-based functionalization to deliver QDs to the cytoplasm, and analyse the dynamics of both non-functionalized QDs and QDs that are targeted to different subsets of microtubules by binding to different kinesin family members.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report that the diffusion of non-functionalized QDs is highly heterogeneous and dependent on the presence of F-actin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most microtubule-associated QDs propelled by different types of kinesin do not experience strong (actin-induced) transverse fluctuations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kinesin-1 bound QDs, however, display directional fluctuations, because the subset of modified microtubules used by this motor undergoes more prominent undulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this shape remodelling is not caused by active contractility of actomyosin network, but instead suppressed by it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate how the heterogeneity of the mammalian cytoskeleton imposes a large spatial variation in non-equilibrium cellular dynamics, which precludes straightforward application of physical approaches that model the cytoplasm as a viscoelastic homogeneous and isotropic medium.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Rapid and slow diffusion of cytoplasmic QDs', 'As small size intracellular probes we used commercially available QD625streptavidin conjugates with a measured Stokes radius of 14.4 nm (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore the passive dynamics of QDs inside the cytoplasm, we used adherent cell electroporation for intracellular delivery of particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After optimization of electroporation parameters (Supplementary Table 1), we observed that most cells routinely enclosed 10100 QDs (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon internalization, we observed a strong suppression of QDs blinking, manifested in the increase of the average duration of the on-state (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is likely the result of the mildly reducing environment of the cytoplasm, which is known to reduce QD blinking10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Non-isotropic diffusion of intracellular QDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) COS-7 cell fixed 30 min after electroporation with QDs and stained with phalloidin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maximum projection of a z-stack acquired with the spinning disk microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 10 m.

intervals of QDs located within the cells lamella, followed by single-particle tracking and mean square displacement (MSD) analysis, revealed fast and slow diffusing subpopulations of QDs (Fig 1ce and Supplementary Movie 1), which appeared as two separate peaks in the distribution of the mean squared frame-by-frame displacement (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For some QD we also observed transitions from slow to fast mobility regimes and back (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fraction of slowly diffusing QDs was strongly reduced after treatment with latrunculin A, an inhibitor of actin polymerization (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average MSD curves for the fast and slow fractions yielded diffusion coefficients of Dfast=10.1 m2 s1 and Dslow=0.06 m2 s1, respectively (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, rapid intracellular tracking of QDs revealed two classes of QD diffusion, the faster of which could be promoted by actin destabilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The increased diffusion constant upon actin depolymerization suggests that slowly diffusing QDs are trapped within the F-actin-rich cellular cortex at the inner face of the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optical cross sections of cells labelled for F-actin show that F-actin density is high close to the cell membrane, but strongly decreases at 1 m depth into the cell (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore also measured the density of fast and slow moving particles at 1 m above the cells bottom cortex and compared it with the area close to a coverslip (Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the density of rapidly diffusing QD increased from 0.055 to 0.11 m2 when moving 1 m deeper into the cell and the density of slowly diffusing QDs remained almost unchanged (0.027 to 0.024 m2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that upon electroporation of adherent cells, most QDs are freely moving in the internal cytoplasm and suggest that slow diffusive QDs are trapped within the F-actin-rich cellular cortex at the inner face of the plasma membrane (Fig 1h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In standard recordings with 100 ms intervals, rapid QD diffusion will not be detectable and observations will be biased towards slower diffusing QDs embedded in actin meshwork (Supplementary Movie 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Probing kinesin motor proteins using nanobody-conjugated QDs', 'Previous work using SWNT reported that cargoes propelled by kinesin-1 experience significant sideways fluctuations (0.51 m), which were ascribed to myosin-driven fluctuations of the actin cytoskeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The generality of these observations has remained unclear, because not all microtubules are embedded within F-actin and because kinesin-1 has been reported to move over a specific subset of stabilized microtubules8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To perform the same assay using probes of smaller size, we labelled QDs with biotinylated nanobodies (VHHGFP) against green fluorescent protein (GFP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nanobodies are promising candidates for QD functionalization because they are small, very stable and easily produced11 (Supplementary Fig 1dh, Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We delivered these nanobody-functionalized QDs into cells transfected with different constitutively active GFP-tagged motor proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  COS-7 cells expressing kinesin-1 showed a peripheral accumulation of QDsVHHGFP (Fig 2ac), and live-imaging revealed numerous QDs running processively over the kinesin-1 decorated microtubules (Fig 2c,d and Supplementary Movie 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained for kinesin-2 (KIF17-GFP-FRB), kinesin-3 (KIF1A-GFP-FRB) and kinesin-4 (KIF21B-GFP-FRB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bright fluorescence of QDs allowed us to reach a localization precision of 35 nm (Supplementary Table 3), while recording the fast motion using continuous stream acquisition with 50 ms exposure without any noticeable photobleaching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All motor proteins tested in our QDs transport assay showed dynamic binding to the microtubules, that is, processive movement interspersed with dissociation and cytosolic diffusion (Fig 2dh), and moved unidirectionally, suggesting that QDs are bound exclusively to the respective GFP-labelled kinesins12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Probing specific motor proteins using nanobody-conjugated QDs reveals limited transverse

developed a set of directional filtering techniques that was validated on artificial data (Supplementary Fig 2af and Supplementary Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The filtering was able to detect both strictly directional movements of motors with a smooth change of velocitys angle and those containing abrupt stochastic displacements of underlying microtubules (Supplementary Fig 2e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To characterize the transverse and longitudinal dynamics of directionally moving QDs relative to the microtubule axis, we estimated the position of the microtubule by fitting continuous non-periodic cubic B-splines to the QD coordinates (Supplementary Fig 2d) and projecting the coordinates onto these curves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flexibility of the spline curve is defined by the number of internal knots and control points placed along its arc length, and the distance between such control points sets the length scale at which microtubules are considered straight (Supplementary Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the behaviour of the transverse component was heavily dependent on the degree of spline approximation (Supplementary Fig 2gj).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When B-spline control points were positioned with 1 m interval, the amplitude of transversal displacement diminished in comparison to 6 m, and the transverse MSD curve changed its behaviour from diffusional to highly confined (Supplementary Fig 2hj).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For all further analyses, we chose the distance between control points equal to 1 m to account for the highly bent microtubule shapes observed in live cells, which are relatively stable on the timescale of kinesin movement (1 s, Fig 2k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MSD analysis of trajectories of different kinesin family members revealed the same highly confined transverse behaviour (Fig 2h), whereas the longitudinal MSD increased quadratically with time delay , as expected for directional movement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all directional movement episodes, we determined the average speed run length and run duration for the different kinesin family members (Fig 2ik).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The speeds ranged from 1 m s1 for kinesin-1 to 2.5 m s1 for kinesin-2, similar to results obtained for non-cargo bound motors8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, reported kinesin-1 speeds measured using SWNT were threefold lower, presumably due to the non-selective interactions with other cellular components3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that, unlike reported previously3, most motor-driven particles do not undergo large sideways fluctuations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Kinesin-1-targeted microtubules display undulations', 'As shown above, the underfitting of trajectories will affect the MSD analysis of the transverse dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, overfitting could result in trajectories segments with unrealistically high curvatures that no longer reflect the underlying microtubule shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify the consistency of our analysis, we built the distribution of trajectory curvatures for all four motors tested and found that the curvature of about 90% of arc length of runs is below 2 m1 (that is, radius of  greater than 0.5 m, Fig 3a,b), meaning that the fraction of highly curved segments is low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, there was a clear difference between the curvature distributions of kinesin-1 and other kinesins (Fig 3b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The processive runs of kinesin-1 were more curved, suggesting that this motor runs on a subset of microtubules that are more bent.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Based on the very slow diffusion of beads and SWNTs observed in earlier works2,3, the cytoplasm has recently been proposed to be a dense elastic network in which most particles are trapped in the actin meshwork.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this situation most diffusion-like behaviour would be established by active contractions and remodelling of the actin network and can, therefore, emerge only at longer timescales2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By fast tracking of non-functionalized QDs, we instead revealed two populations of diffusive QDs that differed in diffusion constant by almost two orders of magnitude and the faster fraction could be increased by F-actin depolymerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fast population has a diffusion constant that is surprisingly close to the diffusion constant expected for these QDs in water (Dfast10 versus Dwater16 m2 s1, Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that this fraction has been overlooked in many earlier experiments, because slower acquisitions will not detect this population and be biased towards the slower diffusing QDs embedded in actin meshwork.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detecting this subpopulation is also challenging using bulk average methods such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and FCS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results are in agreement with recent reports of two diffusive regimes in the cytoplasm of live cells, detected using GFP as a probe in combination with novel correlation analysis techniques18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured diffusion coefficient values allow us to estimate the viscosity of the aqueous phase of cytoplasm being 1.6 times higher than that of water, which is in agreement with previous estimates using bulk average techniques with small fluorescent molecules20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results support a unifying model in which the slow diffusion observed here and in earlier work reflects the dynamics in specific actin-rich cellular subdomains, such as the actin cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simultaneous co-presence of fast diffusion is attributed to a different, central subcellular compartment containing a less dense filament network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, our results highlight the influence of probe size and geometry in probing cell environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From super-resolution studies it is known that actin in the lamella of COS-7 cells forms two dense horizontal layers of 3050 nm mesh size separated vertically by 100 nm7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particles of 100300 nm in size will be trapped between these layers and their dynamics will reflect the fluctuations or remodelling of the network itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For probe dimensions smaller than the mesh size, the assumption of a continuous viscoelastic cytoplasm is no longer valid and actin filaments will appear as discrete mechanical obstacles forming void compartments (pores) accessible for diffusion18,19 (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio of Dslow/Dfast0.006 allows us to estimate the average pore size to be 36 nm (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21 and Supplementary Note 1), that is, compatible with the size of the particle itself (28 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such probes will diffuse freely and rapidly inside the actin pores on timescales below (dmeshdprobe)2/6D(0.0360.028)2/105 s, but will jump from one cell of the mesh to another at much longer timescales, resulting in a much slower effective diffusion constant at higher timescales (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'What implications does this finding have for the intracellular transport of cargoes driven by different kinesin motors?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To study this, we probed the active linear motion of QDs labelled with different types of kinesin motors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We developed a robust method to separate transient periods of directional movement from the random movement that interspersed these episodes and also carefully examined how longitudinal motility and transverse fluctuations should be extracted from the xy-trajectories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that large apparent transverse fluctuations emerge if the microtubule curvature is underestimated, but are absent if the microtubule curvature is closely followed by smooth fitted B-spline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This latter approach is preferable, because motors typically travel along a curve within 13 s, which is faster than the typical curvature remodelling time that we observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study we, therefore, did not observe the large transverse displacements (0.51 m) reported earlier for kinesin-1 fused to nanorods of 3001,000 nm long3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we did detect that the trajectories of this motor were both less smooth and more curved compared to other kinesins, which originated from its preferential binding to a subset of microtubules that underwent continuous bending and shaking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preferential binding of kinesin-1 to modified microtubules has been previously observed, but the precise molecular origin of this selectivity has remained elusive8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we found that these preferred microtubules also undergo more active shape remodelling, again reflecting the ability of these microtubules to attract specific force generators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our experiments with actin-altering drugs provide evidence that the undulations of microtubules are not caused by contraction of the actomyosin network as suggested earlier3, but instead are strongly suppressed by it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations are in line with previous studies, showing that bending of microtubules is caused by microtubule specific force generators14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To illustrate our findings and aid future studies of intracellular transport and cytosol compartmentalization, we built a hypothetical phase diagram of the heterogeneous cell environment (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diagram maps the boundaries of applicable physical models of the cytoplasm as a function of probe sizes and timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, for proteins of 26 nm in size the cytoplasm can be considered as a liquid on almost any timescale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The behaviour of bigger objects (20100 nm) would depend on the timescale, but also on the position within the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Areas of overlapping hatching highlight metastable conditions where two compartments with different properties coexist simultaneously, as shown here for our QDs probes (timescale: 1 ms, size: 30 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Objects of 300500 nm in size would be mostly stuck inside the filament network and move together with it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further development of scalable tracers should allow precise mapping of those boundaries and a thorough description of the non-equilibrium mechanical environment of the cell22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, apart from the actin meshwork, other intracellular structures, such as intermediate filaments14,23 and membrane organelles21,24 are also likely to affect transport processes inside cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, using novel functionalization, delivery and analysis tools, we found that the heterogeneity of the mammalian cytoskeleton imposes a large spatial variation in non-equilibrium cellular dynamics, which precludes straightforward application of physical approaches that model the cytoplasm as a viscoelastic homogeneous and isotropic medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results increase our understanding of the material properties of the cytoplasm, can guide future modelling approaches and could aid studies of passive delivery of nanoparticles or therapeutic agents.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
