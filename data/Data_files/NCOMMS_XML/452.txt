An integrated genomic and transcriptomic survey of mucormycosis-causing fungi  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mucormycosis is a life-threatening infection caused by Mucorales fungi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we sequence 30 fungal genomes, and perform transcriptomics with three representative Rhizopus and Mucor strains and with human airway epithelial cells during fungal invasion, to reveal key host and fungal determinants contributing to pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the host transcriptional response to Mucorales reveals platelet-derived growth factor receptor B (PDGFRB) signaling as part of a core response to divergent pathogenic fungi; inhibition of PDGFRB reduces Mucorales-induced damage to host cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unique presence of CotH invasins in all invasive Mucorales, and the correlation between CotH gene copy number and clinical prevalence, are consistent with an important role for these proteins in mucormycosis pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work provides insight into the evolution of this medically and economically important group of fungi, and identifies several molecular pathways that might be exploited as potential therapeutic targets.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mucormycoses are deadly human infections caused by fungi belonging to the subphylum Mucoromycotina, order Mucorales1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rhizopus spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  are the most common organisms isolated from patients with mucormycosis and are responsible for 70% of all cases of this disease1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mucor spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and Lichtheimia spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  are also a significant cause of fungal infections in Europe with each causing 20% of the cases4, while Apophysomyces spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  are common clinical isolates in India5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fungal species currently belonging to both the Mucormycotina and Entomophthoromycotina subphyla were formerly considered to be members of the zygomycota taxon based on morphological similarities, sexual reproductive structures, life cycle and ecology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, following reanalysis of their evolutionary relationship using molecular phylogenetic techniques, these two taxa have been separated6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While mucormycoses are often invasive infections, entomophthoramycoses, caused by members of the subphylum Entomophthoromycotina, order Entomophthorales, are only known to be superficial infections7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The major risk factors for mucormycosis include uncontrolled diabetes mellitus in ketoacidosis, other forms of metabolic acidosis, treatment with corticosteroids, solid organ or bone marrow transplantation, neutropenia, trauma and burns (for example, wounded soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan), malignant haematological disorders and deferoxamine therapy in patients receiving haemodialysis2,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cutaneous necrotizing soft tissue mucormycosis outbreaks in otherwise healthy individuals have also been known to follow natural disasters, as evidenced by the Apophysomyces infections, usually associated with trauma, following the tsunami that devastated Indonesia in 2004 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10) and the tornadoes that occurred in Joplin, Missouri, USA in June 2011 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The standard therapy for mucormycosis includes reversal of the underlying predisposing factors (if possible), wide-spread surgical debridement of the infected area8 and antifungal therapy2,9,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of surgical removal of the infected focus (such as excision of the eye in patients with rhinocerebral mucormycosis), antifungal therapy alone is rarely curative9,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even when surgical debridement is combined with high-dose amphotericin B, the mortality associated with mucormycosis is  greater than 50% (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In patients with prolonged neutropenia, disseminated disease or central nervous system infection mortality is 90100% (refs 13, 14, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The unacceptably high mortality rate, limited options for therapy and the extreme morbidity of highly disfiguring surgical therapy make it imperative to look for alternative strategies to treat and prevent these infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the genomes of some Mucorales isolates have been sequenced, there remains a paucity of genome data and comparative analyses for this group of fungal pathogens11,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, we utilize an integrated genomics approach to understand the population genetics, evolution and phylogeny of this understudied group of fungi, and identify potential therapeutic targets in the pathogen and the host.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Genome sequence and annotation of Mucorales', 'To identify both common and taxa-specific genetic elements that contribute to pathogenesis, we sequenced, assembled and annotated the genomes of 27 isolates from the order Mucorales, including representative isolates of 15 different species from nine different genera: Apophysomyces, Cokeromyces, Cunninghamella, Mucor, Rhizomucor, Rhizopus, Saksenaea, Syncephalastrum and Umbelopsis (Table 1; Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed the same on the genomes of three strains from the order Entomophthorales: Basidiobolus heterosporus, Basidiobolus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  meristosporus and Conidiobolus incongruus (C. incongruus).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since, these species are not known to cause invasive infections in humans, a comparative analysis of these strains with Mucorales strains will help to understand the genetic requirements for invasive disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of the strains sequenced in this study are clinical isolates with the exception of the Apophysomyces elegans, Rhizopus stolonifer and B. heterosporus strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specific source of each strain is listed in (Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All strains were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform and each assembly was created de novo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 List of isolates sequenced in this study.Full size table', 'We performed structural and functional annotation of each newly sequenced genome and used these annotations to perform downstream comparative genomic analyses (Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 41 genomes were included in our comparative analysis: the 30 presented here plus 11 previously published genomes: two Lichtheimia corymbifera16, two Lichtheimia ramosa16, one Mortierella alpina (M. alpina)26, one Rhizopus chinensis25, one Mucor velutinosus22, one Mucor circinelloides (M. circinelloides)22, one Mucor racemosus (M. racemosus)22, one Mucor indicus (M. indicus)22 and the original Rhizopus delemar 99-880 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these 11 additional strains, 8 are clinical isolates while 3 (L. corymbifera CDC-B2541, M. racemosus CDC-B9645 and Rhizopus microsporus var.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  chinensis) are environmental isolates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prevent our analyses from being limited by varying approaches to genome annotation, we used our annotation pipeline to annotate (or re-annotate in the case of R. delemar 99-880) the 11 previously published genomes (Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Phylogenetic analysis of Mucorales', 'To explore the phylogenetic relationship among the 41 isolates, we identified 76 single-copy core genes present in all 41 genomes and estimated the phylogeny of these organisms using PhyML v3.0 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27; Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the three Entomopthorales genomes formed a distinct grouping separate from the other 38 genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M. alpina appears to be in a group by itself near the base of the tree, as does Umbelopsis isabellina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remainder of the isolates, all of which are Mucorales, formed five distinct clades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One such clade was made up completely of Rhizopus isolates, while another clade included Mucor, Rhizomucor and Cokeromyces isolates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A third clade contained only Cunninghamella.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isolates of Saksenaea and Apophysomyces clustered together into a fourth clade, and the Lichtheimia and Syncephalastrum isolates formed the final clade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, our results largely agree with the phylogenetic analysis performed by Hoffmann et al.28 using four molecular markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Phylogenetic relationships among 38 Mucorales fungi with three Entomopthorales as outgroups.A phylogenetic tree was constructed using concatenated trimmed multiple alignments of 76 orthologous proteins shared among all 41

#@NEW_LINE#@#  All strains are clinical isolates unless otherwise indicated by a black circle to be environmental.Full size image', 'Unexpectedly, Mucor racemosus strain 97-1192 grouped with the Rhizopus oryzae and R. delemar strains, consistent with the idea that strain 97-1192 was originally misclassified as a Mucor and actually belongs to the genus Rhizopus as either oryzae or delemar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this point forward, we will refer to strain 97-1192 as a Rhizopus strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strain was included in a more specific phylogenetic analysis as discussed below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We were also surprised that R. microsporus strain CDC-B9738 grouped together with the Mucor and Rhizomucor isolates and, based on our analysis, is most closely related to M. racemosus CDC-B9645 (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe that CDC-B9738 was also misclassified and from this point forward we will refer to strain CDC-B9738 as M.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  racemosus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Expansion of chitin deacetylases in Mucorales', 'We used an unbiased approach to identify recurring protein motifs that were present in our predicted proteomes using MEME, a program that finds novel, ungapped motifs (recurring, fixed-length patterns) in protein or nucleotide sequences29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Searching the predicted R. delemar 99-880 proteome with MEME revealed a number of conserved motifs, which were present throughout dozens of proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequence logos for 20 most significant motifs are depicted in Supplementary Fig 1 and listed in Supplementary Data 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most significant motif discovered was annotated by our pipeline as a member of the chitin deacetylase (CDA) family of proteins (Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A hidden Markov model (HMM) built from a multiple sequence alignment of these proteins (Supplementary Fig 2a) was searched against 92 widely divergent fungal genomes, and all except Schizosaccharomyces or Enterocytozoon had at least one peptide that was similar (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results are consistent with previous reports showing the expansion of this gene family in a single strain, R. delemar strain 99-880 (refs 20, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this chitin deacetylase family also appears expanded in the other Mucoralean fungi in the present study, although it does appear restricted to the early diverging fungal lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The functional consequences of the CDA expansion are unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Expansion of invasin-encoding genes', 'We have previously described the identification of three surface proteins encoded by R. delemar 99-880, CotH1, CotH2 and CotH3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter two function as invasins to promote infection31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used our genomic data set to probe for the presence of CotH-like proteins in all 41 annotated genomes presented here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An HMM was built using the BLASTP hits from each genome against the CotH motif MGQTNDGAYRDPTDNN (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This motif is a surface-exposed region against which a therapeutic antibody has been raised31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then identified proteins encoded in each genome that both contained the HMM sequence and had a BLAST e value of  less_than 1e20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most commonly isolated species from mucormycosis infections, Rhizopus spp., each contained 67 CotH gene copies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Mucor, Rhizomucor, Cokeromyces and Lichtheimia isolates, which are also commonly isolated as the cause of mucormycosis, contained 37 copies depending on the isolates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Apophysomyces, Cunninghamella, Saksenaea, Syncephalastrum, Mortierella and Umbelopsis isolates, which are rarely isolated from mucormycosis patients, contained only 12 copies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, the Entomopthorales isolates, which do not cause invasive disease in humans, do not contain any homologues of the CotH-like genes (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results suggest that, when considering the genome content of Mucoralean fungi, the presence and number of CotH-like genes correlates with clinical prevalence and the ability to cause invasive disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies will evaluate the relationship between the number of CotH genes in the genomes and the ability to invade and damage host cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Presence of CotH invasins across Mucorales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) HMM logo depicting conserved invasin domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

identified three additional CotH paralogues in the R. oryzae and R. delemar isolates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These paralogs are named CotH6 (IGS-990-880_03186)20, CotH7 (IGS-990-880_09445)20 and CotH8 (IGS-990-880_11474)20 because we previously identified CotH4 and CotH5 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CotH4 and CotH5 were identified by their relative low identity to the entire CotH3 sequence (2024% identity at the amino-acid level), but they lack the sequence motif MGQTNDGAYRDPTDNN used in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of CotH1-3 and CotH6-8 genes in R. delemar 99-880 and R. oryzae 99-892 were examined using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from these strains grown in the presence or absence of host airway epithelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While none of the six genes are specifically induced by the presence of host cells, three of the six CotH-like genes (CotH2, CotH3 and CotH7) are among the most highly expressed genes in the genome in all four conditions, and a fourth (CotH8) seems to increase in expression with extended time in tissue culture media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, during the 6 to16-h assay period, the R. delemar CotH8 gene is induced 3.2-fold and 2.3-fold in the absence and presence of host cells, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained for R. oryzae CotH8 gene with induction of 2.1-fold and 2-fold in the same comparisons (Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high expression of these unique CotH genes attests to their importance in Mucorales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Population structure of Rhizopus strains', 'R.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  oryzae (syn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rhizopus arrhizus) was reclassified into R. oryzae and R. delemar based on the ability to produce lactic acid and fumaricmalic acids, respectively32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in the small organic acid production between these groups lies in the fact that R. oryzae strains contain a copy of LdhA, encoding lactate dehydrogenase, while R. delemar strains lack a copy of LdhA32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it has been argued that these differences are insufficient to support separate species and that varieties R. arrhizus var.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  arrhizus and var.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  delemar should instead be used33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the sake of clarity, we use the previous nomenclature proposed by Abe et al.32 Our phylogeny presented in Fig 1, based on a limited number of proteins provided poor resolution of the R. oryzae and R. delemar strains as evidence by the low bootstrap values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To better resolve the population structure, we performed whole-genome phylogeny for all of our R. delemar and R. oryzae genome sequences, including reclassified strain 97-1192.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, 2,492,513 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected among all 13 isolates, of which 1,620,389 filtered SNPs present in all genomes were retained for tree building.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3a depicts the SNP-based whole-genome phylogeny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the isolates formed three clades instead of two clades as previous phylogenies have suggested32,35 (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, one clade contained only R. oryzae, while another clade contained only R. delemar isolates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new third clade contained one strain that has been classified as R. oryzae, one strain classified as R. delemar and strain 97-1192 (formerly M. racemosus).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Henceforth, we will refer to strains 99-133, NRRL 18148 and 97-1192 as R. oryzae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The possibility of two cryptic species within the R. oryzae group was previously recognized with phylogenic analysis of ITS, EF-1 and AFLP, but not act1; however, the lack of phenotypic differences prevented them from placing species limits within this group32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SNP-based whole-genome phylogeny more clearly defines these clades than phylogenetic analysis with single and combined gene fragments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Population structure of R. oryzae and R. delemar strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) SNP-based whole-genome maximum-likelihood phylogeny

are the products of mating between R. oryzae and R. delemar strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this, we performed admixture analysis on all 13 oryzae/delemar strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The K=2 model, which has the lowest cross-validation error, indicates that the clade 3 individuals are admixed mosaics with some ancestry from each of R. oryzae and R. delemar, and that R. oryzae strain HUMC 02 also has some ancestry from the clade containing the R. delemar strains (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While zygospore formation with in vitro mating has been demonstrated between R. oryzae and R. delemar35, it is unclear if zygospores germinate to produce viable progeny or if recombination has actually occurred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The small sample size warrants consideration of the K=3 model that only has a slightly higher cross-validation error (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model indicates a third clade, consistent with our whole-genome phylogeny, but indicates that one strain (NRRL 18148) has ancestry from both clades 1 and 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While both models show evidence of mixed ancestry, more information is needed to fully test these competing hypotheses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To determine if the strains in each of the three clades vary in their virulence potential, we tested each of the strains for the ability to damage epithelial and endothelial cells during in vitro infection of monolayers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the strains tested, including representatives from each of the three clades, induced equivalent amounts of damage to both cell types (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also tested representatives from each of the three clades in a neutropenic mouse model of mucormycosis and observed no significant difference in the survival curves (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results suggest that there are no clade-associated differences in the ability of these strains to cause disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Identification of Rhizopus-specific genes', 'Since R. oryzae is most commonly isolated from patients with mucormycosis, we hypothesized that its high clinical prevalence can be explained by differences in genomic content as compared with other Mucorales species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To accomplish this, we built a comparative database and searched for Jaccard orthologous clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our database included the genome annotations from 13R.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  oryzae/delemar strains, two R. microsporus strains, one R. stolonifer strain, one M. racemosus, one L. corymbifera strain and one Cunninghamella bertholletiae strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified 2,658 core clusters that are present in all the 19 the genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify putative virulence genes, we took a conservative approach and searched for clusters that are present only in the 13 oryzae/delemar strains and absent from each of the other six genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since, we were unable to identify any differences in pathogenic potential in vitro, we reasoned that such virulence genes should be present in all the 13R.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  oryzae/delemar strains reported here (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified 174 clusters of putative virulence genes that meet our criteria (Supplementary Data 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose to further focus our list of putative virulence genes using two criteria, the presence of secretion signal and high mRNA expression, those genes whose average number of reads per kilobase of exon per million mapped reads (RPKM) ranked in the top 25% of all genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reasoned that genes encoding proteins with putative secretion signals might be surface exposed and directly involved in the interaction between the fungus and the host cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, in our analyses, CotH3 has a predicted secretion signal and is known to govern pathogenesis31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in vivo infection studies with Candida albicans have suggested a correlation between gene expression and involvement in virulence without consideration for whether a genes expression is induced by interaction with the host cell36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We acknowledge that other criteria can also be used to identify putative virulence genes; however, with the general scarcity of molecular pathogenesis data for Mucorales, we decided to
