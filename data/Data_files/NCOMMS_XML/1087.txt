Structural basis for perception of diverse chemical substances by T1r taste receptors  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The taste receptor type 1 (T1r) family perceives palatable tastes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These receptors function as T1r2-T1r3 and T1r1-T1r3 heterodimers to recognize a wide array of sweet and umami (savory) tastes in sugars and amino acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, it is unclear how diverse tastes are recognized by so few receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present crystal structures of the extracellular ligand-binding domains (LBDs), the taste recognition regions of the fish T1r2-T1r3 heterodimer, bound to different amino acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ligand-binding pocket in T1r2LBD is rich in aromatic residues, spacious and accommodates hydrated percepts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biophysical studies show that this binding site is characterized by a broad yet discriminating chemical recognition, contributing for the particular trait of taste perception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the analogous pocket in T1r3LBD is occupied by a rather loosely bound amino acid, suggesting that the T1r3 has an auxiliary role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, we provide a structural basis for understanding the chemical perception of taste receptors.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Taste sensation enables animals to detect certain chemical substances within foods, and evaluate whether they are nutritious or poisonous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The process is evoked by specific interactions between stimulants and taste receptors residing in the plasma membrane of taste cells in the taste buds of the oral cavity1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The taste receptor type 1 (T1r) family discerns palatable tastes in nutrients, such as sugars and L-amino acids3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The family is conserved across in vertebrates, including fishes, birds, and mammals6, and receptors function as constitutive heterodimers of T1r1T1r3 and T1r2T1r3 (refs 3, 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ligand specificity is likely tuned to the diet of the animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In humans and rodents, the T1r2T1r3 heterodimer recognizes sweet substances like sugars, whereas the T1r1T1r3 heterodimer samples umami (savory tastes) of L-amino acids including glutamate3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in birds, a group generally lacking the T1r2 gene, the T1r1T1r3 heterodimer from insect-feeding species responds to L-amino acids, while that from a nectar-feeding species detects sugars7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The physiology of taste perception is embodied in the characteristics of T1r function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many T1r receptors have broad ligand specificity: the human T1r2T1r3 receptor reacts to mono- to oligosaccharides, artificial sweeteners without saccharide groups, some D-amino acids and even proteins5, while the mouse T1r1T1r3 receptor responds to various L-amino acids4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This contrasts with endogenous signalling, which generally recognizes specific chemical substances such as hormones, cytokines, and neurotransmitters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The taste perception through T1r even contrasts with another chemosensation, olfaction sensation, where greater than 1 trillion stimuli are discriminated by combinations of 400 receptors8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another feature of T1r receptors is their low affinity for taste substances present in high concentrations in the oral cavity (EC50 values of human T1r1T1r3 and T1r2T1r3 for glutamate and sucrose are 2.7 mM (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9) and 41 mM (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10), respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Chemical recognition by T1r proteins is mainly achieved by their extracellular ligand-binding domains (LBDs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The T1r family belongs to the class C G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family11, which commonly possess a LBD, consisting of 500 amino acid residues, upstream of the heptahelical transmembrane region, on the extracellular side (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutation and modelling/docking studies point to the LBDs of T1r2 and T1r1 of T1r heterodimers as perceiving most of major sweet and umami taste substances9,12,13,14,15,16,17, except for the artificial sweetener cyclamate that targets the transmembrane (TM) domain of T1r3 (refs 12, 18) and the sweet protein brazzein where there is an additional contribution by a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of T1r3 downstream of the LBD19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A mechanism of signal transduction by T1r has been proposed based mainly on other class C GPCR LBDs20,21: ligand binding induces closure of the cleft between subdomains, LB1 and LB2, possibly accompanying dimer rearrangement22, to effect a conformational change in the downstream transmembrane region and receptor activation and signal transmission to the heterotrimeric G-protein in the cytosol of taste cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, details, especially how diverse chemicals are recognized, still need to be elucidated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Crystal structure of the medaka fish T1r2a3LBD heterodimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic drawing of T1r taste receptor

residues are coloured in yellow, red, blue and white, respectively.Full size image', 'In this study, we have addressed the structural basis of taste perception by T1r by crystallographic analysis of its LBDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural analysis of T1r has so far been hampered by the difficulties in heterologous expression23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there are a couple of studies reporting E. coli expression of a LBD from a single T1r subunit using fusion24 or refolding25 strategies, there have been no reports of the successful preparation of T1rLBDs in the functional unit of heterodimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, we showed that the LBDs of T1r2-subtype a (T1r2a) and T1r3 heterodimer from medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) can be successfully expressed in insect cells, despite failures with those from other sources that we tested, including human genes22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fish possess multiple T1r2 genes, which show an almost equal degree of sequence identity to both T1r1s and T1r2s (3134%), and which trichotomously branched off from mammalian T1r2s at the node close to T1r1s and T1r3s (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, T1r2a of medaka fish, one of three T1r2 subtypes in the species, with heterodimeric partner T1r3, responds to several kinds of L-amino acids27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, medaka fish T1r2aT1r3 may be a good representative member of T1rs and allow exploration of general characteristics, such as polyspecific recognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the crystal structures of the T1r2aT1r3LBD heterodimer, with a variety of bound amino acids, providing a basis for the understanding of the broad chemical recognition of taste receptors.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Overall structure', 'Although attempts to crystallize the T1r2aT1r3LBD heterodimer alone were unsuccessful, co-crystallization with a Fab fragment (Fab16A), prepared from an antibody recognizing T1r2aLBD, yielded crystals, enabling structure determination at 2.22.6 Å resolution (Table 1 and Supplementary Figs 1, 2a,b, 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure showed that T1r2aLBD and T1r3LBD have the architecture of the Venus-flytrap domain (VFTD; Fig 1b), also found in other class C GPCR LBD structures such as metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs)20, GABAB receptor (GABABR)21, and calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR)28 (Supplementary Fig 2ce).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The T1r2aLBDT1r3LBD heterodimer takes a compact dimer arrangement, similar to the A-state observed in the glutamate-bound mGluR1LBD structure20, as expected from our previous study mainly based on small-angle X-ray scattering analysis22 (Supplementary Fig 2c,f, and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Data collection and refinement statistics.Full size table', 'Heterodimerization', 'The structure provides a basis for the heterodimerization of T1r, which is required for normal taste receptor function3,4,5,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, distinctive intermolecular interactions at the loop regions are observed, where loop 1 (Ala46Asp57) and loop 2 (Val116Ala133) in T1r2a and loop 2 (Thr121Asp140) in T1r3 alternately cross and fold over the LB1 domain in the other subunit, forming intermolecular main-chain hydrogen bonds (Fig 1c and Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, Cys132 in T1r3 of loop 2 forms an intermolecular disulfide bridge with Cys344 in T1r2a of loop 3 (Gly336Ser354).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This disulfide bridge was confirmed by mutational analysis: the mutant C132A in T1r3 or C344A in T1r2a displayed markedly decreased dimer formation (Supplementary Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the cases of mGluRs and CaSR, cysteine residues in loop 2, such as Cys140 in mGluR1 and a pair of Cys129 and Cys131 in CaSR, form intermolecular disulfide bond(s) between subunits of the homodimer30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, no intermolecular disulfide bridge was actually expected in T1r heterodimers, since T1r1 and T1r2 have no cysteine residues in loop 2 (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the characteristic configuration of the loop regions is such that intermolecular disulfide bridge formation with loop2 in T1r3 and loop 3 in T1r2a is allowed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interaction between cysteines of loop 2 and 3 in the different subunits means that the disulfide-mediated dimer stabilization is unlikely between T1r1- or T1r2-homodimers, even if such oligomers do exist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the intermolecular interface between the LB1s of T1r2aLBD and T1r3LBD is complementary: both surfaces are hydrophobic, and there are several coupling points that could facilitate heterodimeric interactions, such as between Asp103 in T1r2a and Lys158 in T1r3 (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These non-covalent heterodimeric interactions together with the covalent disulfide bridge described above must shift the equilibrium of T1rLBDs towards heterodimers, rather than homodimers or dissociated states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Ligand recognition by T1r2a subunit', 'The T1r2aT1r3 heterodimer from medaka fish is reported to be a receptor for amino acids27, which are considered to be preferred taste substances for medaka fish32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that a variety of L-amino acids, such as glutamine, alanine, arginine, glycine, and glutamate, but not D-glutamine, induced FRET signal elevation of fluorescence-labelled LBDs, which we had previously found to correlate with LBD ligand binding22 (Fig 2a and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of them, such as glutamine, alanine, and arginine, also induced responses in the full-length receptor according to Ca2+-imaging (Fig 2b and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two amino acids displaying weak affinities to LBD, glycine and glutamate, gave poor or no significant receptor responses up to 10 mM, which is presumed to be below their saturation taking into account the several fold higher concentration ranges for the responses than those for the FRET changes observed on the former three amino acids (Supplementary Table 2), probably due to the assay method differences22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher concentrations up to saturation were not investigated to avoid non-specific reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the results indicate that T1r2a3LBD recognizes a broad spectrum of L-amino acids where the -substituent group differs in size, charge, and hydrophobicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed concentration ranges for the receptor responses fit the typical taste thresholds for L-amino acids exhibited by fishes (0.1100 mM)33, which are much higher than those of specific receptors for endogenous signalling molecules, such as mGluR (EC50 4.622 M for L-glutamate response)34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Amino-acid recognition by T1r2aLBD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Dose-dependent FRET signal changes of the T1r2aLBD-Cerulean and T1r3LBD-Venus heterodimer for amino

residues at LB2 are underlined.Full size image', 'In the crystal structures, these various L-amino acids are bound to T1r2aLBD in the cleft between LB1 and LB2 (Fig 1b and Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The T1r2aLBD structures adopt a closed conformation as judged by structure superposition to LBDs of mGluRs and GABABR20,21 (Supplementary Fig 2c), as well as domain motion analysis, which indicates that LB2 is rotated 28° towards LB1 compared to the open conformation of the mGluR1 structure (PDB ID 1EWK, B chain).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The degree of this rotation compares well with the domain motion between closed and open conformations of other class C GPCR LBDs (2136°, Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not only T1r2aLBD but also the overall heterodimer structures were very similar irrespective of the bound ligand identity (C rmsds of 0.40.7 Å).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The -amino and carboxyl groups and the C and C atoms of the amino acid ligands are located at almost the same positions in the binding site in T1r2a, and form hydrogen bonds with the protein (Fig 2ch, and Supplementary Fig 5), including to the main-chain amide and side-chain hydroxyl groups of Ser142 and Ser165, and the main chain carbonyl group of Gly163, all residues in LB1 (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ser142 and Ser165 are conserved in amino-acid sensing taste receptors T1r1 and most class C GPCRs (Supplementary Fig 1), and they indeed form a similar pattern of hydrogen bonds with the amino and carboxyl groups of L-glutamate and GABA in mGluRs and GABABR, respectively (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutation of Ser165 to isoleucine, an amino acid observed in human T1r2 (Supplementary Fig 1), or alanine resulted in the loss of or a weakened response to L-amino acids, down to the level of the non-specific reaction with D-amino acids (Fig 2i and Supplementary Fig 6), although the cell surface expression of the full-length receptors, as well as secretion and heterodimerization of the LBDs, remain (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are consistent with previous studies showing that the same mutant of human T1r1, S172A, does not respond to L-glutamate and other amino acids9,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results indicate that the -amino and carboxyl groups of the amino acid ligand are key for recognition by T1r2aLBD, primarily by the LB1 region, and for eliciting a receptor response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In contrast, the -substituent groups of the bound amino acids, such as the 2-carbamoylethyl group in L-glutamine, have no direct hydrogen bonds with the receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, numerous water molecules surround these substituent groups, and the ligands are thus in hydrated states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indirect, water-mediated hydrogen bonds are apparent, such as with the carbonyl group of Ala263 or the carboxyl group of Asp288 and Asp289, in the LB2 region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These interactions likely help closing the cleft between LB1 and LB2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, higher affinity ligands, such as L-glutamine and alanine, are surrounded by more ordered water molecules, implying that the binding site recognizes the ligand together with the structured water in the hydration shell (Fig 2ch).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in striking contrast to receptors with a high ligand specificity, such as mGluRs and GABABR, in which direct hydrogen bonds and salt bridges are formed with the residues in the LB2 region of the receptor and the ligand molecules (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The way in which the hydration shell participates in ligand recognition as observed in T1r2aLBD appears suitable for polyspecific ligand perception, since replacement of water molecules, rearrangement of the hydrogen-bond network, and charge screening by the hydration shell allow diverse ligands to be accommodated in the binding pocket without varying the conformation of the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Broad recognition of a hydrated ligand is achieved by several distinct structural characteristics in the ligand-binding pocket in T1r2a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The space that accommodates the ligand is much larger than any of the ligands (Fig 2j), and there is no evidence of significant induced fit on binding (Fig 2ch), which allows accommodation of ligand plus hydration shell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ligand-binding space is not completely occluded from the solvent, existing as a back room with 7 Å height and 16 Å depth, restricted by Ile64, Pro66, and Lys265 at 8 Å distance from the carbamoyl group of the bound glutamine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the space for ligand binding in mGluR is smaller, with 7 Å height and 11.5 Å depth, restricted by Tyr74 and Arg323 at 2.5 Å distance from the -carboxyl group of the glutamate (Fig 2k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The T1r2a pocket is constituted by a number of aromatic residues, such as Phe140, Phe213, Phe262 and Phe365 (Fig 2ch).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These residues may serve as a platform for water-aromatic interactions through OH-, lone pair- and CH-O interactions35,36, as well as helping to keep the large, yet restricted, space for ligand binding due to their structural rigidity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerous aromatic amino acid residues are often observed in the drug-binding sites of multidrug efflux transporters with broad ligand specificity37,38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the surface of the T1r2a pocket is a mosaic of negatively, positively and uncharged regions, in contrast to the uniformly positively charged surface of the mGluR1 pocket (Fig 2j,k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of these features facilitate broad rather than specific substrate recognition, and there is a trade-off between low affinity and high affinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Ligand binding at T1r3 subunit', 'The T1r2a3LBD crystals display an unanticipated additional electron density in the cleft of T1r3, at the site corresponding to the amino acid binding pocket observed in T1r2a (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This confounded the previous assumption that the LBDs of T1r2 and T1r1 are solely responsible for ligand binding12,14, and we came to the conclusion that the LBD of T1r3 binds the same amino acid as that of T1r2a, based on the following observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shape of the omit map in the T1r3 cleft in each crystal resembles the amino acid added for crystallization (Fig 3a and Supplementary Fig 8ad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further confirmed amino-acid binding at T1r3 by crystallographic analysis in the presence of L-selenomethionine, which results in a noticeable anomalous peak derived from the selenium atom (5.5 ) at the T1r3 binding site, as well as at T1r2a (6.0 , Supplementary Fig 8e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies also reported that the recombinant mouse and

open conformation of the mGluR1 structure (PDB ID 1EWK, B chain, Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It contrasts with GABABR, another heterodimeric class C GPCR, in which subunit GBR2 does not bind ligands and adopts an open conformation21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, T1r3 alone exhibits no obvious response to amino acids in the tested concentration ranges (Supplementary Fig 8g), again suggesting the dominance of T1r2a for receptor response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the T1r3-binding site, the -amino and carboxyl groups of the ligand form hydrogen bonds with Ser150 and Thr173 in LB1, similar to those observed in T1r2a and other class C GPCRs structures (Fig 3a and Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the -amino group forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Ser300 in LB2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since there are no other significant interactions with LB2, this single hydrogen bond might induce closure of the cleft between LB1 and LB2, irrespective of the -substituent group of the bound amino acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ligand binding pocket in T1r3 is structurally distinct from that in T1r2a, as well as that in mGluR1; the cavity is 7.6 Å high but with no restriction in depth between the solvent and the -substituent group (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is no obvious interaction of the -substituent with LB2, even through water molecules, thus the binding site cannot serve as a determinant of receptor specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we mutated Ser300 to glutamate, an amino acid observed in human T1r3 (Supplementary Fig 1), receptor responses appeared wild-type like (Fig 3c and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ligand binding to T1r3 seems mute in terms of receptor response, although an interaction of the glutamate at the Ser300 with the -amino group cannot be ruled out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The relevance of the structural characteristics of the ligand binding pockets of the LBDs of T1r2a and T1r3 for ligand binding was evaluated by calculating G values from their crystal structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differences of the estimated G values (G) between the various amino-acid binding and L-glutamine binding to T1r2a are in the 2 kcal mol1 range (Fig 3d), and remarkably, correlate with those derived from experimental binding assays for T1r2a3LBD by FRET (Fig 2a and Supplementary Table 2), except for L-arginine, which exhibits a unique binding configuration of the guanidinopropyl group, forming a salt bridge with Asp211 (Fig 2c,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, binding to T1r3 showed uniform G values in a low range ( less_than 0.3 kcal mol1, Fig 3d) and there is no apparent correlation with the experimental binding results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results corroborate the above conclusions

'This study reveals the structural basis of the broad amino acid recognition by LBDs of the T1r taste receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystal structures displayed that a wide range of amino acids, irrespective of their physicochemical properties, are accommodated to the ligand binding site in hydrated states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The T1r2aLBD takes the primary role in T1r2aT1r3 heterodimer receptor stimulation, both in terms of affinities for agonist binding and resultant receptor responses, as judged by a structural comparison with T1r3LBD as well as mutation analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations are in line with the notion that the unique component of the T1r receptors, T1r1 or T1r2, is responsible for recognition and responses to taste substances, despite the fact that the common component, T1r3, has a similar ligand binding site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the similar characteristics may be conserved in T1rs in other species and explain why sweet and umami taste modalities are versatile yet discriminative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T1r3 likely plays a subsidiary role in the receptor function of T1r, such as inter-subunit conformational coupling and G-protein coupling24, or membrane trafficking of T1r heterodimers40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the ligand binding properties of T1r3 observed in this study may substantiate previous observations that T1r3 alone responds to chemicals in certain situations29,41,42, which may exist in tongue and palate epithelium, as well as in various tissues throughout the body, expressing T1r3 and not T1r1 or T1r2 (refs 3, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The crystal structures of T1r2a3LBD indicate that the various amino acids induce almost the same closed LBD conformation (Supplementary Fig 2b and Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This structural observation is consistent with the fact that various amino acids induce the receptor responses (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27 and Fig 2b), which are considered to correlate with the conformational change of LBD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, this is apparently not in accordance with the observation that they elicit different maximum FRET changes at saturating concentrations (larger changes with glutamate and glycine compared with glutamine, Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, single-molecule FRET studies of mGluRLBDs suggested that there are not only two simple active and relaxed states but multiple conformational states, and the efficacies of agonists are determined by their properties to shift the conformational equilibria of the LBD population, yielding differences in fractional occupancy of each state44,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observed difference in maximum FRET changes in T1rLBD among the amino acids may reflect different occupancies of multiple conformational states, while crystallization apparently traps the single conformational state in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar situation was observed in the crystallographic structures of a class C GPCR, mGluR II LBD, where a variety of agonists with different efficacies, such as full and partial agonists, induce almost the same LBD conformation46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, effects of the ligands on the other regions of the receptor, such as CRD and TM, are obscure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies on the conformational dynamics of T1r in the presence of various ligands and how the movements correlate with receptor response, as well as structural analysis of the full-length receptor, may be revealing in this regard.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
