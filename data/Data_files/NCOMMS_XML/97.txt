New Permian fauna from tropical Gondwana  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Terrestrial vertebrates are first known to colonize high-latitude regions during the middle Permian (Guadalupian) about 270 million years ago, following the Pennsylvanian Gondwanan continental glaciation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, despite over 150 years of study in these areas, the biogeographic origins of these rich communities of land-dwelling vertebrates remain obscure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report on a new early Permian continental tetrapod fauna from South America in tropical Western Gondwana that sheds new light on patterns of tetrapod distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Northeastern Brazil hosted an extensive lacustrine system inhabited by a unique community of temnospondyl amphibians and reptiles that considerably expand the known temporal and geographic ranges of key subgroups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings demonstrate that tetrapod groups common in later Permian and Triassic temperate communities were already present in tropical Gondwana by the early Permian (Cisuralian).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This new fauna constitutes a new biogeographic province with North American affinities and clearly demonstrates that tetrapod dispersal into Gondwana was already underway at the beginning of the Permian.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The Cisuralian (early Permian, ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  298272 million years ago) record of continental tetrapods in Gondwana has long been elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The iconic marine mesosaurs from Africa and South America are the only well-known Cisuralian Gondwanan tetrapods1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, trackways from Argentina3 and fragmentary body fossils from Namibia4 hint at a greater tetrapod diversity at the time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these records indicate that Gondwanan tetrapods had adapted to both salt-water and fully terrestrial environments, and achieved a broad geographic distribution, implying a deep history of tetrapod communities in the southern hemisphere3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The Parnaíba Basin of northeastern Brazil hosts the Pedra de Fogo (PFF) and Motuca (MF) formations, which have produced a wealth of plant and fish fossils, as well as tantalizing remains of the large temnospondyl amphibian Prionosuchus plummeri5 from the uppermost PFF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The age of these units is considered Kungurian (latest Cisuralian) based on biostratigraphic correlations with the Chemnitz Fossil Forest of Germany and the Irati Formation of southern Brazil, which both have radiometric dates of 278 million years ago6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the proven potential, the tetrapod fauna of the PFF has received almost no attention from vertebrate palaeontologists in the past half century.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new vertebrates from the lower PFF lacustrine beds reported herein provide an unparalleled window into tropical wetland faunas of Gondwana during the Cisuralian.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

(b) absence of mesial convergence of the tooth rows (tooth rows are radially oriented and distally branching in Captorhinikos); (c) at least one of the tooth rows is aligned along the main axis of the mandibular ramus in Captorhinikos, a condition not seen in UFPI PV014.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cladistic analysis', 'To elucidate the relationships of the new temnospondyls, a phylogenetic analysis was conducted, resulting in a single most parsimonious cladogram with a length of 289 steps (consistency index=0.635 and retention index=0.513; Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The outgroups, Eryops and Dendrerpeton, fall at the base of the tree as successive sister taxa of the ingroup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ingroup encompasses two subclades, one formed by Rhinesuchidae+Dvinosauria and the second by Archegosaurus+Sclerocephalus, the latter representing the basal radiation of stereospondylomorphs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The position of Rhinesuchidae as more closely related to Dvinosauria than to stereospondylomorphs is probably a result of the limited taxon sampling of the data set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several more inclusive analyses have repeatedly demonstrated that rhinesuchids are stereospondyl temnospondyls12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Support for the most parsimonious cladogram is relatively weak, with most nodes decaying in 13 steps and few nodes receiving  greater than 50% symmetric resampling support.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The results of our analysis (Fig 3) indicate that the clade Dvinosauria consists of two sister-groups, the Trimerorhachidae (consisting of Neldasaurus, Procuhy and Trimerorhachis) and the clade including Timonya, Acroplous, Isodectes, Dvinosaurus, and Tupilakosauridae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, both of the new taxa from Brazil are dvinosaurs, but they fall within distinct subclades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Characters that support their placement in Dvinosauria12 include: reduction of the otic notch; parietals more than two and a half times as long as wide; reduced anterior extension of the prefrontal, which is located around the anteromedial border of the orbit; loss of the posterolateral flange on the palatine ramus of the pterygoid; and increased number of presacral vertebrae ( greater than 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The position of Procuhy within Trimerorhachidae (Neldasaurus+(Trimerhorachis+Procuhy)) is supported by: presence of an intertemporal on the skull table; presence of an elongated postorbital; postparietal bones that do not taper abruptly laterally; prearticular that does not extend anterior to the level of the suture of the middle and posterior coronoids; presence of a hamate process on the anterior margin of the glenoid fossa of the mandible; and, presence of a parasymphysial foramen on both sides of the mandibular symphysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Timonya is reconstructed as an early-diverging dvinosaur based on the presence of postparietals that taper abruptly laterally; reduced tabulars; presence of a dorsal process of the palatine exposed on the skull roof; absence of contact between the palatine ramus of the pterygoid and the vomer; presence of a vaulted palate formed by the downturned quadrate ramus of the pterygoid; and glenoid fossa of the mandible below the level of the dorsal surface of the dentary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we did not recover Timonya as a member of Tupilakosauridae (Slaugenhopia+Thabanchuia+Tupilakosaurus), it is interesting to note that the Brazilian dvinosaur shares several derived character states with that clade, which we interpret as homoplasies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are: presence of a quadrangular or rounded postorbital; anterior border of the squamosal lying approximately at the mid-length of the parietal; broad basicranial suture between the pterygoid and the parasphenoid; and posterior edge of the pterygoid incised close to the suture with the parasphenoid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Sedimentology and palaeoenvironment', 'Most vertebrate specimens were recovered from Pedra de Fogo outcrops near the margins of the Parnaíba Basin, in the adjacent municipalities of Nazária, Monsenhor Gil, and the capital city of Teresina, in the state of Piauí, and equivalent exposures in the municipality of Timon, in the neighbouring state of Maranhão (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, previously described vertebrate fossils from the PFF, as well as some new specimens, were discovered in outcrops 220 km southwest of Teresina (Pastos Bons, Maranhão State), in strata that accumulated closer to the depocenter of the basin5,15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of shared taxa in both fossil-bearing intervals suggests they represent equivalent time spans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rocks exposed at the Timon quarry are massive, tabular strata of red siltstone interbedded with fine-grained sandstone and mudstone intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fossil-bearing strata in this quarry are an 3 m thick succession of fissile dark reddish-brown mudstone overlying a finely laminated light-purple calcareous fine-grained sandstone with greenish grey mottles (36 m on Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wavy-laminated sandstone contains distinctive large oblate calcareous nodules and elongated chert breccia-filled tubes that resemble large rhizoliths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This sandstone grades upwards into very finely laminated dark reddish-brown mudstones with some surfaces covered in bird-foot septarian shrinkage cracks and others with oscillation ripples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The top of this mudrock unit contains lenses of fish scales and a few semi-articulated bony fishes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequence continues with very finely laminated dark red siltstone containing horizons of small oblate calcareous nodules that have been preferentially silicified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fish scales occur scattered throughout this unit, and more complete remains occur around the 6 m level, where articulated temnospondyl skeletons have been recovered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Study area in northeastern Brazil.Location of the collecting sites (represented by white dots) in the Parnaíba Basin, and sedimentological log of the Pedra de Fogo Formation, exposed in a quarry at Timon, type locality of the new dvinosaur temnospondyl Timonya anneae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sst, sandstone.Full size image', 'The fossil-bearing interval (36 m on Fig 4) is interpreted as fluvio-lacustrine in origin, deposited in a range of terrestrial and aquatic sub-environments on the margins and nearshore of large continental lakes, on seasonally wet floodplains and channels, and within small ponds (cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  facies association AF2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the 6 m mark this interval is truncated by the basal erosion surface of a large fluvial channel sandstone structured with trough cross-bedding at the base, and ripple cross-lamination in the interdigitating sandstone stringers at the top.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this level upwards the succession becomes more floodplain-dominated, with vertical rhizocretions reflecting incipient palaeosol development in a sequence of weak red-coloured massive siltstone beds (at 12 m on Fig 4).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The age of the PFF/MF has been the source of continuing debate, with various authors proposing different ages based on data from plant body fossils, fossil pollen, fish remains and temnospondyl amphibians5,6,9,15,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stratigraphical range of the ctenacanth shark Glikmanius constrains the age between the Carboniferous and the Guadalupian21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Palynological studies have suggested a Cisuralian age19 and similarities between the pollen assemblages known from the Pedra de Fogo Formation and the Flowerpot Formation of Texas (CisuralianGuadalupian22,23) have been noted19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is significant overlap between the fossil plant communities of the PFF/MF and the Chemnitz fossil forest of Germany, which has been dated to 278±5 Myr ago (Kungurian6,9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the chondrichthyan Itapyrodus, previously known in the PFF, was recorded in the Irati Formation8 of the Paraná Basin, which was dated to 278.4±5 Myr ago9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Kungurian age for the PFF is further supported by our discovery of Captorhinus aguti, a reptile species whose last appearance is in strata attributed to the mid-Kungurian in North America10,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been proposed15 that the amphibian Prionosuchus indicates a younger GuadalupianLopingian age, but we reject this conclusion because it is based on the apparent evolutionary grade of the taxon instead of a formal biostratigraphic correlation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'During the Permian the Parnaíba Basin was positioned in the southern tropics of western Gondwana (Fig 3), a portion of Pangaea that so far has yielded only scarce tetrapod fossils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nearest well-known Permian tetrapod localities in Gondwana occur further to the east in North Africa (for example, the Moradi Formation of Niger24) and much further south in the South American Paraná Basin20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, both of these sedimentary basins have yielded younger Permian (Lopingian) fossils, which underscores the significance of this new PFF vertebrate fauna.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The PFF tetrapod assemblage includes a trimerorhachid dvinosaur, an early-diverging dvinosaur, and a captorhinid reptile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assemblage of taxa resembles contemporaneous equatorial communities from North America that include the dvinosaurs Trimerorhachis and Slaugenhopia and several captorhinid species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been suggested24 that the unusual composition of the equatorial tetrapod assemblage of the Lopingian Moradi Formation of Niger stemmed from it being a relict of a formerly more widespread tropical biome that is best known from the Permo-Carboniferous of equatorial Euramerica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the PFF tetrapod assemblage is very similar to contemporaneous equatorial communities from North America10,23,25, it shows that the range of these equatorial communities extended into the Gondwanan tropics, providing hard evidence for the presence of an extensive Pangaean tropical biome, at least during early Permian (Cisuralian) times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On the basis of the Texan Slaugenhopia25, tupilakosaurid dvinosaurs were hypothesized to have originated in the tropics with subsequent dispersal into higher latitudes of Pangaea, and our discovery of the new early-diverging dvinosaur Timonya in the PFF fauna is consistent with this claim.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the presence of rhinesuchids here is unprecedented; previously this group was only known from much younger strata in southern Gondwana26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new PFF rhinesuchids are the oldest known members of this clade and also represent its most northerly occurrence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our new finds may indicate that the Cisuralian tropics were an important cradle for high-latitude biodiversity recorded later during the Permian.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Cisuralian continental faunas are practically unknown elsewhere in Gondwana and in high-latitude Laurasia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current absence of fossil tetrapods from these regions hampers the comparisons necessary to test whether this biogeographic pattern is real or simply an artefact of a poorly sampled fossil record.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discovery of the PFF fauna improves our understanding of early tetrapod biogeography but also raises new questions and emphasizes the necessity of further exploration of Cisuralian terrestrial biodiversity, especially in poorly studied successions deposited in the palaeotropics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The newly discovered vertebrate assemblage from the lower PFF beds presents a compelling picture of a continental alkaline lake or wetland community and contrasts with the fauna previously reported for the parts of the basin closer to the depocenter (upper PFF beds), where the water bodies were deeper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter assemblage includes a greater diversity of fish and large chondrichthyans, the large piscivorous temnospondyl Prionosuchus and remains of small-to-medium-sized rhinesuchids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Near Teresina, undescribed primitive actinopterygian fishes and the basal dvinosaur Timonya represent the small faunivores;

'Phylogenetic analysis', 'Several previous phylogenetic analyses and anatomical character state codings for the Dvinosauria and related groups12,13,14,29,30 were utilized to elucidate the relationships of the new Brazilian taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thirteen temnospondyl taxa were selected (Supplementary Table 1), in addition to Timonya and Procuhy from Brazil, for analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among them, Eryops and Dendrerpeton served as outgroups and Sclerocephalus, Archegosaurus and the Rhinesuchidae were chosen as representatives of the basal radiation of stereospondylomorph temnospondyls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The character-taxon matrix was produced with Mesquite version 2.75 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It includes 15 temnospondyl taxa coded for 115 characters (Supplementary Note 1), 108 cranial and 7 postcranial, all considered unordered and unweighted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analysed the final data set (Supplementary Note 2) using the Implicit Enumeration algorithm of TNT version 1.1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32), which resulted in a single most parsimonious tree (298 steps) depicted in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are discussed further in the Supplementary Discussion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Computer tomography and image processing', 'The CT images were acquired with a Varian Medical Systems (Lincolnshire, IL, USA) model BIR-225/500-CT/DR Industrial CT system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The system uses a 10225 kV microfocus X-ray source and an amorphous silicon flat panel detector with a pixel size of 200 microns by 200 microns and a resolution of 2,048 by 2,048 pixels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specimen UFPI PV011 was scanned at 220 kV, 400 mA, with a 0.5 mm brass beam filter obtaining a 0.0635, mm voxel resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CT data were imported into the software Amira 5.3.3, where the segmentation and the initial three-dimensional (3D) surface model were computed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extracted 3D surface models were then imported into the Geomagic Studio 2012 software to repair and edit irregularities in the surface mesh geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All animations and still images of the digital specimen were rendered in the Blender 2.60 software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Institutional abbreviations', 'UFPI, Universidade Federal do Piauí, Teresina, Brazil; FMNH, Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, USA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Nomenclatural acts', 'This published work and the nomenclatural acts it contains have been registered in ZooBank, the proposed online registration system for the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ZooBank LSIDs (Life Science Identifiers) can be resolved and the associated information viewed through any standard web browser by appending the LSID to the prefix http://zoobank.org/.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LSIDs for this publication are: urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:5A7C9C3D-F7B1-43FF-896A-67D0BC3B00C6'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
