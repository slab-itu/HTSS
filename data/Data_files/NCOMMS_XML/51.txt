Multi-level engineering facilitates the production of phenylpropanoid compounds in tomato  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Phenylpropanoids comprise an important class of plant secondary metabolites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of transcription factors have been used to upregulate-specific branches of phenylpropanoid metabolism, but by far the most effective has been the fruit-specific expression of AtMYB12 in tomato, which resulted in as much as 10% of fruit dry weight accumulating as flavonols and hydroxycinnamates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that AtMYB12 not only increases the demand of flavonoid biosynthesis but also increases the supply of carbon from primary metabolism, energy and reducing power, which may fuel the shikimate and phenylalanine biosynthetic pathways to supply more aromatic amino acids for secondary metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AtMYB12 directly binds promoters of genes encoding enzymes of primary metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enhanced supply of precursors, energy and reducing power achieved by AtMYB12 expression can be harnessed to engineer high levels of novel phenylpropanoids in tomato fruit, offering an effective production system for bioactives and other high value ingredients.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The use of transcription factors (TFs) to activate or suppress secondary metabolism has provided effective strategies to engineer plants enriched in valuable secondary metabolites1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the importance of primary metabolism to engineer high levels of plant secondary metabolites has been appreciated only more recently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of AtMYB12, a TF regulating flavonol biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana, under the control of the fruit-specific E8 promoter, activated the expression of genes encoding enzymes of flavonol and hydroxycinnamic ester biosynthesis in tomato resulting in accumulation of exceptionally high levels of both flavonols and caffeoyl qunic acids, amounting to as much as 100 mg g1 dry weight (DW)3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggested that AtMYB12 might be a useful tool for engineering phenylpropanoid metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Flavonoids along with other phenylpropanoids are synthesized from phenylalanine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Erythose-4-phosphate, produced from the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP) and phosphoenolpyruate from glycolysis, are the precursors for the seven-step, shikimate pathway4 which supplies phenylalanine for phenylpropanoid metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enzyme 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAHPS) is a key determinant of the flow of carbon into the shikimate pathway5,6 and phenylalanine along with other aromatic amino acids are the products of this pathway4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  General phenylpropanoid metabolism begins with phenylalanine, and involves the activity of three enzymes (phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H) and 4-coumaroyl CoA ligase (4CL)) to generate p-coumaroyl CoA, the activated intermediate for the various branches of phenylpropanoid metabolism7 (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Schematic representation of the phenylpropanoid pathway in plants and its relationships to primary metabolic pathways.Important primary and secondary metabolic genes are highlighted in red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DAHPS, 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase; ENO, plastidial enolase; PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumaroyl CoA ligase.Full size image', 'We investigated how AtMYB12 induces phenylpropanoid biosynthesis so effectively in tomato fruit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data indicate that AtMYB12 can induce both primary and secondary metabolism and binds directly to the promoters of genes encoding enzymes of primary metabolism, including DAHPS and the gene encoding plastidial enolase (ENO).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through its ability to regulate metabolism at multiple levels, AtMYB12 can be used as a general tool to engineer appreciable levels of novel phenylpropanoids in tomato.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

4a)14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calculations of the relative release from the various positionally labelled glucoses15 were indicative of a co-ordinated upregulation of glycolysis and the OPPP, rather than a

control fruit were incubated with uniformly labelled U-14C Glc for 4 h, there were increases in total uptake, as well as increased label incorporation into organic acids and amino acids in AtMYB12 tomatoes compared with control tomatoes (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Redistribution of 13C label following 13C Glc feeding to pericarp discs also showed that in AtMYB12 tomatoes, there were significantly higher amounts of the products of the shikimate pathway and the TCA cycle, whereas label in sugars, the major substrates for glycolysis and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, were reduced significantly compared with WT tomatoes (Fig 4b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data indicate that there is greater flux through glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway and the TCA cycle in AtMYB12 tomatoes than in control tomatoes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the basic sugar and amino acid contents of AtMYB12 tomatoes were significantly different from WT fruit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a significant reduction in the content of the major sugars in AtMYB12 tomatoes compared with controls (Supplementary Fig 2) and the contents of aromatic amino acids (except phenylalanine) were significantly higher than in WT fruit (Supplementary Figs 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Greater carbon flux through glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway and the TCA cycle in AtMYB12 tomatoes, would provide additional ATP, reducing power and carbon from primary metabolism to drive the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids and secondary metabolic pathways dependent on these precursors (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike other TFs, which have been reported to activate the transcription of only key target genes of secondary metabolism, AtMYB12 appears to reprogram primary metabolism, driving carbon flux towards aromatic amino acid biosynthesis, in addition to activating the genes of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'AtMYB12 enhances flavonoid production induced by other TFs', 'To explore further the potential of AtMYB12 for engineering phenylpropanoid metabolism, we crossed AtMYB12 tomato to the purple, Del/Ros1 tomato line, which accumulates high levels of anthocyanins in fruit2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hybrid tomato showed striking, intense blue-purple colour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The change in hue was the result of co-pigmentation of anthocyanins by high levels of flavonols, throughout the fruit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We termed this phenotype Indigo (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to AtMYB12, which activates genes encoding enzymes of both primary metabolism and general phenylpropanoid metabolism (Fig 5b), Del and Ros1 enhanced anthocyanin biosynthesis principally by activating the expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Del and Ros1 did not appear to activate expression of genes in primary metabolic pathways significantly and, unlike AtMYB12 tomatoes, the content of aromatic amino acids did not increase in purple Del/Ros1 fruit compared with WT fruit (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "Figure 5: Co-expression of AtMYB12 with other transcription factors in tomato fruit enhances

more than AtMYB12 tomatoes) and anthocyanins (almost twofold more than purple Del/Ros1 tomatoes) (Fig 5c and Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with Del and Ros1, we suggest that AtMYB12 has a greater capacity to increase the production of different phenylpropanoids in tomato fruit through its impact on the supply of amino acids, ATP and reducing power in fruit in addition to its ability to activate flavonoid biosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also checked the content of malonyl-CoA, another key substrate of flavonoid biosynthesis16, but despite our method being able to detect this metabolite in Arabidopsis, malonyl-CoA could not be detected in any tomato fruit samples even following solid phase extraction pre-purification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were, however, able to measure the levels of acetyl-CoA, the direct precursor of malonyl-CoA16 and found no significant differences in levels between different lines (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are not consistent with any depletion of the malonyl-CoA pool limiting flavonoid biosynthesis and indicate that AtMYB12 enhances flavonoid biosynthesis in plants, mainly through effects on phenylalanine biosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'AtMYB12 can enhance production of novel phenylpropanoids', "Our data suggested that AtMYB12 could be used to enhance the production of specialty phenylpropanoid compounds in tomato.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resveratrol (3,5,4'-tri-hydroxystilbene) is a natural phytoalexin and has been reported to extend the lifespan of several model organisms17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The therapeutic potential of resveratrol has been established both in vivo and in vitro18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of a gene encoding stilbene synthase (StSy) from grape has been shown to result in accumulation of resveratrol in tomato fruit up to about 0.5 mg g1 DW (all forms of resveratrol) (Fig 6a)19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We crossed the E8:AtMYB12 tomato to an original 35S:VvStSy tomato line to select tomato fruit with different genotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LC-MS data confirmed that the original 35S:VvStSy tomato produces 0.5 mg g1 DW trans-resveratrol in fruit (Fig 6b,c and Supplementary Table 4)19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, after co-expression with AtMYB12, the production of resveratrol and resveratrol derivatives reached between 5 and 6 mg g1 DW, some 100-fold higher than levels found in red grapes (Fig 6b,c and Supplementary Table 5) due primarily to a 45-fold increase in polydatin (monoglycosylated resveratrol).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the high levels of flavonols observed in AtMYB12 tomatoes, were not observed in AtMYB12 StSy tomatoes suggesting that stilbene synthase competes very effectively with chalcone synthase to redirect synthesis towards stilbenes and away from flavonoids (Fig 6b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant amounts (1 mg g1 DW) of a mono-methylated resveratrol were detected in AtMYB12 StSy tomatoes (Fig 6c), which are of interest because

different genotypes in the F2 generation (Fig 6a and Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fruit expressing LjIFS only, the content of genistin, the only isoflavonoid detected, was 0.3 mg g1 DW.

a significant reduction in flavonol production achieved by reducing F3H activity using the are/ mutation (Fig 6a,d and Supplementary Table 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because IFS competes directly with F3H for substrate (naringenin; Fig 6a)27, a reduction in F3H activity significantly increased the production of isoflavones in tomato.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, when are/ was introduced into AtMYB12 StSy tomatoes, the content of resveratrol did not change significantly (Supplementary Table 4), presumably due to the strongly competitive activity of stilbene synthase relative to that of chalcone

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'For both resveratrol and genistin production in tomato, co-expression of AtMYB12 substantially increased the production of these specialty phenylpropanoids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that the impact of AtMYB12 on metabolic engineering depends not only on transcriptional activation of genes encoding enzymes of secondary metabolism but also its ability to reprogram carbon flux towards aromatic amino acid biosynthesis to increase the supply of substrate as well as energy and reducing power for phenylpropanoid metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with induced expression of key biosynthetic genes, reprogramming carbon flux represents a powerful way to enhance the levels of target metabolites in plants28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We propose that the effects of AtMYB12 on flux and primary metabolism are not only because of the strong sink effects of the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead we suggest that they are an effect of increasing the supply of carbon, reducing power and ATP from primary metabolism into the shikimate pathway and that as a result, the content of other aromatic amino acids (Trp and Tyr) increase significantly in AtMYB12 tomatoes, while the content of the major sugars decreases significantly (Supplementary Figs 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, TFs like Delila and Rosea 1 provide only a strong sink for anthocyanin biosynthesis without upregulating primary metabolism29 and the content of other aromatic amino acids does not increase (or even decreases) in Del/Ros1 tomatoes (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that the result of these different effects of AtMYB12 (controlling both supply and demand) and Del/Ros1 (controlling demand only) is the reason why net accumulation of flavonols driven by AtMYB12 is always greater (by at least threefold) than the highest levels of anthocyanins achieved using Del and Ros1 (Fig 5c and Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We cannot formally exclude the possibility that the large effects of AtMYB12 are due solely to the increased sink strength of the phenylpropanoid pathway given that inhibitor studies or RNAi of PAL in developing fruit would be very difficult to interpret.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That said, we firmly believe that the combination of source-sink and upstream activation effects increase the content of aromatic amino acids in AtMYB12 tomato, making it an excellent tool for engineering metabolites derived from tyrosine and tryptophan as well as phenylpropanoids derived from phenylalanine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our data show that AtMYB12 recognizes the same suite of target genes as its functional homologue, SlMYB12, in tomato.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is supported by genome-wide transcriptome analysis of tomato fruit with reduced SlMYB12 activity as a result of the y mutation11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flavonoid accumulation in the peel of tomato is controlled by an SlMYB12-regulated transcriptional network11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The homologous TF to AtMYB12 in maize, P1, has also been reported to modify the expression of a large number of genes including some encoding enzymes of glycolysis30, although it is not clear whether any genes of primary metabolism are direct targets of P1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It may be that some TFs targeting secondary metabolic pathways have additional targets involved in primary metabolism to ensure that the demands of specialised secondary metabolism can be met by adequate supplies of precursors, energy and reducing power.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such regulatory targets do not exist for all TFs in a regulatory network, as shown by comparison of AtMYB12 to the effects of Del and Ros1 on transcript levels in tomato fruit (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such regulatory input is likely only a small component of the networks defining coarse control of primary metabolism, and is unlikely to be observed during the analysis of the effects of mutations affecting activity of specific TFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Effects on target genes in primary metabolism are more likely to be observed following ectopic or overexpression of a TF, but this does not imply that they are an artefact of high-level expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that such targets can be identified only by ectopic or high level expression of TFs, and are more likely to be observed when expression is driven by an inducible promoter, such as the E8 promoter in tomato fruit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When AtMYB12 expression is driven by a constitutive promoter such as the CaMV 35S promoter, its effects on flavonol accumulation are more modest than when driven by the E8 promoter in fruit3,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is likely because of metabolite repression of AtMYB12-induced activation of primary metabolism in actively photosynthesising tissues, to maintain growth and development since we observed reduced growth of tobacco plants expressing AtMYB12 under the control of the 35S promoter3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our characterisation of the targets of AtMYB12 refines our understanding of metabolic control in eukaryotes, where the contribution of transcriptional control of central metabolism (supply) has been considered to be modest compared with transcriptional control of demand28,33,34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most studies that dismiss the contribution of control of central/primary metabolism have been founded on the effects of loss of function of TFs, and perhaps more importance would be attached to the transcriptional control of supply by incorporating studies of the effects of overexpression of regulators as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The health benefits of phenylpropanoids make them important targets for metabolic engineering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For many plant secondary metabolites, use of plants for engineering high level production remains an effective option36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enrichment of bioactives in tomato could be particularly useful for the comparison of the nutritional properties of different bioactives in food.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, while there are many publications reporting beneficial effects of consumption of phytoestrogenic isoflavones in combatting the symptoms of menopause and in protection against breast and prostate cancer, there are others that suggest that dietary isoflavones can be detrimental to health37, especially for some population groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high genistin tomatoes we have engineered could be assessed for their dietary impact on a range of disease models, including models for breast and prostate cancer, to define more precisely the effects of dietary isoflavones on these diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have shown that AtMYB12 can be used as a general tool to engineer appreciable levels of phenylpropanoids in tomato.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By direct activation of plastidial ENO and DAHPS, as well as genes of secondary metabolism, AtMYB12 can reprogram metabolism towards the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-expression of AtMYB12 with other TFs or structural genes results in the highest yields so far reported for anthocyanins, stilbenes and isoflavones in tomato fruit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metabolic engineering that combines multi-level transcriptional regulation and pathway rerouting offers an excellent strategy for biofortification of foods, for the production of plant-derived phytochemicals and ingredients, and for establishing materials for comparative nutrition studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such comparisons should lead to much clearer understanding of the health benefits of foods rich in specific polyphenolic phytonutrients in the diet, and shed light on their mechanisms of action.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
