Mouse model of chromosome mosaicism reveals lineage-specific depletion of aneuploid cells and normal developmental potential  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Most human pre-implantation embryos are mosaics of euploid and aneuploid cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the fate of aneuploid cells and the developmental potential of mosaic embryos, here we generate a mouse model of chromosome mosaicism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By treating embryos with a spindle assembly checkpoint inhibitor during the four- to eight-cell division, we efficiently generate aneuploid cells, resulting in embryo death during peri-implantation development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Live-embryo imaging and single-cell tracking in chimeric embryos, containing aneuploid and euploid cells, reveal that the fate of aneuploid cells depends on lineage: aneuploid cells in the fetal lineage are eliminated by apoptosis, whereas those in the placental lineage show severe proliferative defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the proportion of aneuploid cells is progressively depleted from the blastocyst stage onwards.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we show that mosaic embryos have full developmental potential, provided they contain sufficient euploid cells, a finding of significance for the assessment of embryo vitality in the clinic.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The majority of human pre-implantation embryos display chromosome mosaicism, with the most common pattern being euploidaneuploid mosaicism where the embryo contains a complement of both normal and abnormal cells1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mosaicism arises due to an error in mitosis during the first few cleavage divisions following fertilization and is believed to be directly responsible for the high rates of early human pregnancy failure in both spontaneous conceptions2 and following in vitro fertilization (IVF)3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the high incidence of mosaicism in human pre-implantation embryos, the fate of aneuploid cells in the embryo is not clear and many studies in human embryos rely on morphological features to assess embryo development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chromosome mosaicism is most frequently observed in embryos at the early cleavage stages, declining in prevalence as gestation progresses1,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether this shift results from developmental failure of the whole embryo or alternatively through elimination of abnormal cells remains currently unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Observational findings comparing mosaicism levels with IVF outcomes suggest that some mosaic embryos can develop into viable pregnancies8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If indeed some mosaic embryos have full developmental potential, it is important to understand what confers their viability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By using a mouse model for chromosome mosaicism, it is possible to use methodological strategies that are not possible in human embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the morphological level, mouse pre-implantation development is similar to that in humans, undergoing cleavage divisions, compaction, blastocyst cavity formation and hatching, albeit with slightly different timings10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both mouse and human pre-implantation development culminates in the formation of a blastocyst that is composed of the extra-embryonic trophectoderm (TE) and primitive endoderm (PE), which will form the placenta and yolk sac, respectively, and the embryonic epiblast (EPI), which forms the fetus12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cell lineages are specified in two cell fate decisions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first cell fate decision, cells on the outside of the embryo form the TE, whereas cells on the inside form the pluripotent inner cell mass (ICM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the second cell fate decision, cells of the ICM are segregated into the PE and the EPI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correct specification of these lineages and the formation of a blastocyst able to implant are essential for all subsequent development13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we have generated a mouse model of pre-implantation chromosome mosaicism and have investigated both the developmental fate of aneuploid cells and the consequences of mosaic aneuploidy for successful development of the whole embryo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By determining the development of mosaic embryos at single-cell resolution, we show that aneuploid cells become eliminated from the embryo, starting just before implantation, and that mosaic euploidaneuploid embryos have comparable developmental potential to normal embryos, provided they contain a sufficient proportion of euploid cells.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Induction of aneuploidy in early mouse embryos', 'To induce chromosome segregation errors in early pre-implantation mouse embryos (Fig 1a) we treated embryos with reversine14, a small molecule inhibitor of Monopolar spindle 1-like 1 kinase, to inactivate the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effects of reversine are reversible following removal of the drug14; therefore, the embryos were treated with 0.5 M reversine during the four- to eight-cell division, before being cultured in inhibitor-free medium until the mature blastocyst stage (E4.5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that this treatment had no effect on blastocyst formation, with a comparable percentage of reversine-treated embryos (93%, n=30) and controls (92%, n=36) developing into morphologically normal blastocysts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that the SAC was inactivated by reversine treatment, we co-incubated embryos with 0.33 M nocadazole during the four- to eight-cell stage transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All control embryos underwent prolonged arrest before their blastomeres eventually fragmented, with none dividing to the eight-cell stage (Supplementary Table 1, n=22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, 13 out of 26 embryos (50%) treated with 0.5 M reversine were able to divide to the eight-cell stage and this increased to 17 out of 26 embryos (65%) with 1.0 M reversine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the effects of reversine treatment on chromosome segregation and the length of mitoses, embryos expressing Histone H2B-GFP15 were treated with 0.5 M reversine and their development visualized by live imaging during the 8- to 16-cell division.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Major chromosome segregation errors, such as lagging chromosomes and the formation of micronuclei, were found to occur during mitosis in 48% of reversine-treated blastomeres (n=81), compared with only 9.7% of control blastomeres (n=72, P less_than 0.001, 2-test; Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The length of metaphase was also significantly shorter in reversine-treated blastomeres (32.2 min) compared with controls (44.4 min, P less_than 0.001, MannWhitney U-test; Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, these effects were reversible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following washout of reversine from the medium, the chromosome missegregation rate (3.1%) and length of metaphase (47.2 min) both returned to normal levels (n=32; Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that reversine is an effective and reversible inhibitor of the SAC in pre-implantation embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Reversine treatment induces aneuploidy in mouse embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Uniform aneuploid embryos contain a single identical abnormality in their chromosome status and mosaic aneuploid embryos contain blastomeres with differing chromosome constitutions caused by mitotic error post fertilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Blastomeres treated with reversine during division (n=81) have significantly greater rates of chromosome missegregation during mitosis than controls (n=72; ***P less_than 0.001, 2-test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Blastomeres treated with reversine have a shorter metaphase than controls (***P less_than 0.001, MannWhitney U-test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These effects are reversible on washout of the drug (n=32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Validation of aneuploidy in reversine-treated embryos, by single-cell genome sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each circos plot represents the genomic constitution of an embryo in all its cells, with blastomeres presented as rings and the chromosomes as segments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All results of the single-cell genome sequencing are provided in Supplementary Data 1.Full size image', 'We used two independent methods to confirm that 0.5 M reversine treatment during the four- to eight-cell stage transition generated aneuploid cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we analysed control and reversine-treated embryos for their chromosome constitution at the early blastocyst stage (E3.5) using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)16 for three randomly selected chromosomes: 2, 11 and 16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that reversine-treated blastomeres (n=1,076, 43 embryos) had significantly higher rates of aneuploidy than control blastomeres (n=1,376, 38 embryos), with abnormalities detected in 35% of reversine-treated blastomeres compared with 17% of controls (P less_than 0.001, 2-test; Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain a more comprehensive, genome-wide view of the aneuploidy induced by reversine treatment, we applied low-pass single-cell genome sequencing to blastomeres isolated from eight-cell stage mouse embryos (Fig 1d and Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using genomic bins of 1 Mb for single-cell DNA copy number profiling by focal sequence-read depth analysis, individual cells from control (2 out of 37 cells) and reversine-treated (3 out of 59 cells) embryos had similarly low numbers of segmental rearrangements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, whole chromosome missegregations were dramatically increased in reversine-treated cells (39 out of 59 cells, 66.1%), compared with controls (0 out of 37 cells, P less_than 0.001, Fishers test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both approaches therefore demonstrate high levels of aneuploidy following reversine treatment, supporting the application of this technique for the generation of aneuploid blastomeres for use in a mouse model of chromosome mosaicism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Decreased cell number in aneuploid pre-implantation embryos', 'We next sought to determine the effects of reversine-induced aneuploidy on pre-implantation development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, embryos were treated with 0.5 M reversine during the four- to eight-cell stage transition and cultured to either the early (E3.5) or late (E4.5) blastocyst stage to examine the expression of markers of the TE (Cdx2), EPI (Nanog) and PE (Sox17; Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that at the early blastocyst stage there was no difference in total cell number between reversine-treated (37.6 cells, n=20) and control embryos (40.9 cells, n=24), and no difference in the number of Cdx2 and Nanog-positive cells (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the late blastocyst stage, however, the reversine-treated embryos had significantly fewer cells (72.3 cells, n=26) than controls (95.9 cells, n=31, P less_than 0.001, Students t-test; Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When all individual cell lineages were analysed, a significantly reduced average cell number was seen in the TE (60.0 compared with 78.2 cells, P less_than 0.001, Students t-test), EPI (5.9 cells compared with 9.4 cells, P less_than 0.001, Students t-test) and PE (6.4 cells compared with 8.3 cells, P less_than 0.05, Students t-test) in reversine-treated embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, despite this reduction in cell number, all three lineages were segregated normally (Fig 2b) and embryo morphology appeared unperturbed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate whether the depleted cell number observed in the reversine-treated embryos could be caused by an off-target effect of reversine, we sought to inhibit the SAC by an alternative method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we injected zygotes with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting the SAC protein, Mad2 (refs 17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed Mad2 downregulation and cultured embryos to the late blastocyst stage (Fig 2c and Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that embryos injected with Mad2 siRNA (n=22) had a significantly depleted total cell number, compared with embryos injected with control siRNA (n=20, 70.9 cells compared with 83.0 cells, P less_than 0.05, Students t-test), with a significant decrease in the number of EPI cells (8.6 cells compared with 11.4 cells, P less_than 0.05, Students t-test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, Mad2 siRNA-injected embryos had a similar phenotype to that seen with reversine treatment; however, the effect was less strong, reflecting the inefficiency of RNA interference relative to drug treatment, leading us to use 0.5 M reversine treatment as a means to induce aneuploidy in all subsequent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Preimplantation development of aneuploid embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Embryos were treated with reversine (n=20) and analysed for expression of lineage-associated genes at the early blastocyst stage, compared with controls (n=24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No difference in the number of Cdx2-positive and Nanog-positive cells was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Embryos were treated with reversine (n=26) and analysed for lineage specification at the expanded blastocyst stage, compared with controls (n=31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reversine-treated embryos have a significantly reduced cell number in all lineages (*P less_than 0.05 and ***P less_than 0.001;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Here we generated a mouse model for euploidaneuploid chromosome mosaicism, to investigate both the fate of aneuploid cells and the developmental potential of mosaic embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To induce aneuploidy, we used the drug reversine to inhibit the key SAC protein Monopolar spindle 1-like 1 kinase during the four- to eight-cell stage transition14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reversine treatment successfully achieved bypass of the SAC and induced high rates of chromosome segregation errors in treated blastomeres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the effect of the treatment was transient and SAC function was restored on washout of the drug, enabling the induction of acute chromosome missegregations to be tightly restricted and thus limited to a defined developmental window, similar to that believed to occur during human pre-implantation development1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reversine-treated embryos formed blastocysts by E4.5, but had significantly fewer cells in all lineages, compared with controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also attempted to inhibit SAC function in the mouse embryo using siRNA targeting another SAC component, Mad2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to reversine-treated embryos, Mad2 siRNA-injected embryos had a reduction in cell number at E4.5, although this effect was smaller, most probably reflecting the inefficiency of RNA interference relative to drug treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The similarity of phenotypes suggests that the reduced cell number is not an off-target effect of reversine, but rather represents a true phenotype downstream of SAC inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite morphologically normal development to the blastocyst stage, all reversine-treated embryos died by early postimplantation stages, reminiscent of the early postimplantation lethal phenotype of embryos lacking essential SAC genes or kinetochore proteins17,20,21,22,23,24,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Embryos that lack expression of BubR1, for example, display mosaic aneuploidy, are lethal at early postimplantation stages and exhibit high levels of apoptosis26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These SAC knockout embryos, which are in a state of permanent chromosome instability, have shown that SAC function is essential for embryo development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, by using a reversible inhibitor during only one early division, we have generated aneuploid embryos that have normal SAC function following removal of reversine from culture, and therefore chromosome content should be stable, with the aneuploidies generated by the reversine treatment maintained through subsequent division cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increases the likelihood that the peri-implantation lethality of reversine-treated embryos is due to reversine-induced aneuploidy, rather than other effects of long-term SAC inhibition and chromosome instability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To generate mosaic embryos in which normal and abnormal cells could be identified, we created chimeric mouse embryos containing a 1:1 ratio of control and reversine-treated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of wild-type cells for the normal part of the chimera was considered appropriate as, unlike in human embryos, the prevalence of aneuploidy in mouse embryos is relatively low27,28,29, which we confirmed by our single-cell genome sequencing of control eight-cell stage embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the fate of abnormal cells within developing mosaic chimeras, we used high-resolution time-lapse imaging to follow every single cell within each embryo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although current technology did not enable the direct evaluation of the chromosome status in each blastomere, a comparative approach to analysis was adopted, on the basis that reversine-treated blastomeres with high rates of chromosome segregation errors would be expected to exhibit greater rates of chromosome abnormalities than their control counterparts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we found that between E3.5 and E4.5 the abnormal clone of cells was significantly depleted from the embryo, in agreement with observations in human embryos that identified the proportion of aneuploid cells to be lower in blastocysts than at earlier developmental stages30,31,32,33,34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are consistent with a clonal depletion hypothesis35,36 for the survival of mosaic embryos, rather than the self-correction of chromosomal abnormalities37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The application of time-lapse imaging enabled cell fate to be evaluated directly in mosaic embryos for the first time and revealed no evidence of preferential allocation of abnormal cells to embryonic or extra-embryonic lineages, in agreement with studies on human embryos3,33,34,39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we found that in different lineages different mechanisms are primarily responsible for the depletion of reversine-treated cells, with TE cells exhibiting increased cell cycle length and senescence, and ICM cells having an increased frequency of apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether this apoptotic response in the ICM is downstream of aneuploidy-induced DNA damage or another pathway is not yet clear; however, it is in agreement with previous models of chromosome instability that reported cell death within the ICM lineage, in contrast to reduced but ongoing viability of TE cells17,20,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evidence we provide here against the hypothesis that aneuploid cells are preferentially allocated to the TE does not exclude the possibility that confined placental mosaicism41 may arise as a consequence of pre-implantation defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that abnormal cells within the ICM were significantly more likely to undergo apoptosis than those within the TE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, abnormal TE cells often remained viable, albeit depleted relative to their normal counterparts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If some of these cells continue to proliferate, contributing progeny to the future placenta, this could result in confined placental mosaicism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To our knowledge, this is the first study to directly demonstrate the progressive depletion of aneuploid cells from the pre-implantation embryo, and to establish that this occurs through differential mechanisms according to cell lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is also the first study to provide direct evidence that apoptosis within the ICM can occur as a mechanism to eliminate cells with chromosomal abnormalities, a hypothesis frequently proposed42,43 but until now never directly tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To take this further and determine the postimplantation fate of euploidaneuploid mosaic embryos, we transferred the experimental chimeras into foster mothers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This revealed that when embryos contained 50% non-treated control cells, the early postimplantation lethality that occurred in whole reversine-treated embryos was completely rescued and implantation rates and viability were comparable to those in equivalent controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the proportion of control blastomeres was decreased to one third, there was a partial rescue of embryonic lethality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike in postimplantation embryos lacking key components of the SAC, such as Mad2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17) or BubR1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26), we did not observe widespread apoptosis in the 1:1 reversine chimeras at E6.5E7.5, again most probably because although the chimeras contain a high proportion of abnormal cells, the SAC is functional in these embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'At the early postimplantation stages of development, many 1:1 chimeric embryos still contained a small proportion of reversine-treated progeny, but by E13.5 this was not the case in the majority of fetuses and their placenta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely to be that an ongoing reduction in the abnormal clone relative to the control clone occurs due to poorer proliferative capabilities of the abnormal cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When these 1:1 chimeras were allowed to develop to term, live pups were born with comparable success to early postimplantation and fetal viability rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results lead us to conclude that euploidaneuploid mosaic embryos are likely to be viable, provided there is a sufficient proportion of normal cells within the embryo, and that viability at the early postimplantation stage of development is predictive of survival to fetal stages and live birth (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding may be of clinical significance when viewed in the context of embryo biopsy and pre-implantation genetic screening, and potentially an explanation for why cleavage stage embryo biopsy was found to be detrimental to IVF success rates in couples with a poor prognosis for IVF44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also supports the current move from biopsy at the cleavage stage towards blastocyst biopsy, when removal of cells has less impact on the overall constitution of the embryo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: Effects of pre-implantation chromosome mosaicism on embryo development and survival.Reversine-treated embryos formed blastocysts but failed to develop past implantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing the proportion of control blastomeres in the embryo rescued the lethal phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numbers represent the viability of early postimplantation embryos that had successfully implanted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early postimplantation rescue resulted in complete rescue of developmental potential, with E13.5 and live birth rates equivalent to viability at E6.57.5.Full size image', 'In conclusion, the results presented here show for the first time that blastomeres with a history of chromosome abnormalities become progressively depleted from the embryo as it develops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This depletion becomes first apparent during blastocyst maturation, when abnormal ICM cells have increased apoptosis and abnormal TE cells exhibit limited proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Abnormal embryos are able to implant and elicit a maternal decidual reaction, but undergo early postimplantation resorption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, mosaic embryos that contain sufficient normal euploid cells have full developmental potential.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
