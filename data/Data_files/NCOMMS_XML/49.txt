Ape parasite origins of human malaria virulence genes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Antigens encoded by the var gene family are major virulence factors of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, exhibiting enormous intra- and interstrain diversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use network analysis to show that var architecture and mosaicism are conserved at multiple levels across the Laverania subgenus, based on var-like sequences from eight single-species and three multi-species Plasmodium infections of wild-living or sanctuary African apes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using select whole-genome amplification, we also find evidence of multi-domain var structure and synteny in Plasmodium gaboni, one of the ape Laverania species most distantly related to P. falciparum, as well as a new class of Duffy-binding-like domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicate that the modular genetic architecture and sequence diversity underlying var-mediated host-parasite interactions evolved before the radiation of the Laverania subgenus, long before the emergence of P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  falciparum.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Wild-living apes in Africa are naturally infected by at least six Plasmodium species that form a separate subgenus, termed Laverania1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three of these species, P. reichenowi, P. gaboni and P. billcollinsi, have been found only in chimpanzees, while the other three, P. adleri, P. blacklocki and P. praefalciparum, have been found only in gorillas (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zoonotic transfer has occurred at least once, when a gorilla parasite (P. praefalciparum) gave rise to human P. falciparum, which causes the vast majority of malaria-associated morbidity and mortality in humans1,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Characterization of Laverania var gene sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Phylogeny of Plasmodium species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tree was constructed from mitochondrial sequences (2.4-kb spanning cox1 and cytB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scale bar indicates 0.01 substitutions per site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colours indicate species infecting humans (red), chimpanzees (purple) and gorillas (aqua).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Asterisks indicate successful PCR amplification of var sequences; a cross indicates identification of var-like genes in near-full-length P. gaboni genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Three-level schematic of modular var diversity, structure and architecture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coloured ovals represent classes of DBL or CIDR domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  White boxes represent the N-terminal segment (NTS), transmembrane (TM) and acidic terminal segment (ATS) domains; a wedge between TM and ATS domains indicates the intron that separates the two var exons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternating conserved variable architecture is illustrated using blocksharing (see the Methods section) between one representative DBL domain (DD2var11) and other DBL domains published by Rask et al19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A black bar indicates the location of the PCR amplified DBL tag region, which spans three conserved homology blocks (HB3, HB5 and HB2)19, 72147 amino acids in length.Full size image', 'A key component of P. falciparum virulence is the parasites ability to cause infected erythrocytes to adhere to the vascular endothelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allows the parasite to escape elimination in the spleen but can also lead to vascular obstruction and inflammation, key components of severe pathological complications such as cerebral malaria11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cytoadherence is mediated by members of the P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family, which contain between three and eight different Duffy-binding-like (DBL-) and cysteine-rich interdomain region (CIDR-) domains and are expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes, where they bind to endothelial receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each P. falciparum genome encodes 60 different PfEMP1 proteins, which are expressed from var genes, one at a time, by means of epigenetic regulation13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given their central role in P. falciparum pathogenesis, but absence from all other human Plasmodium species, the origins of var genes are of particular interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Three factors have limited our ability to investigate the evolutionary history of var genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, obtaining blood samples from Laverania-infected wild-living apes is not ethical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, all ape-derived var sequences analysed to date come from a single P. reichenowi parasite, called PrCDC, from a wild-born chimpanzee, who was found to be Plasmodium infected in captivity15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, P. falciparum var genes are highly diverse (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not only is there rapid recombination between genes within and across chromosomes, which shuffles gene content within genome repertoires during infection16,17, but sexual reproduction in the mosquito vector also generates diversity via reassortment of chromosomes and conversion events18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, conventional phylogenetic approaches fail to resolve evolutionary relationships between var genes, requiring new and recombination-tolerant analysis techniques19,20,21,22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the mosaicism and diversity generated by rapid recombination16,17, combined with the fact that most var genes are subtelomeric, render the assembly of full-length var genes from shotgun sequenced parasite genomes extremely difficult25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we overcome these impediments by generating 369 new var sequence fragments from five ape Laverania species, derived by PCR amplification from faecal and blood samples of naturally infected wild-living and sanctuary apes, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use network approaches and other recombination-tolerant methods to analyse these new sequences, together with 353 previously reported var gene sequences from one P. reichenowi and seven P. falciparum isolates15,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we identify and analyse partially assembled var-like sequences from otherwise near-full-length genomes of two P. gaboni parasites (SYpte37 and SYptt75), one of the Laverania species most distantly related to P. falciparum27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of these sequences reveals that several PfEMP1 domains, as well as the genetic structure and multi-domain architecture that are characteristic of P. falciparum var genes, are present across the Laverania subgenus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, many var multi-gene family features predate the most recent common ancestor of extant Laverania species.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Laverania species identification and sequence generation', 'To study var gene architecture in ape Laverania species, we first determined the Plasmodium species composition of 11 blood and faecal samples from sanctuary and wild-living apes using a limiting dilution PCR approach called single-genome sequencing (SGS)29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure amplification of single-parasite templates, blood and faecal DNA was diluted such that  less_than 30% of all PCR reactions yielded an amplification product.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amplicons were sequenced directly without cloning into a plasmid vector and sequences containing ambiguous bases indicative of template mixtures were discarded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach eliminates Taq polymerase-induced recombination (template switching) and nucleotide misincorporations in finished sequences, and also ensures a proportional representation of plasmodial variants as they exist in vivo (see the Methods section for a more detailed description of SGS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeting eight different mitochondrial, apicoplast and nuclear loci and sequencing up to 174 different SGS amplicons per sample (Supplementary Table 1), we identified eight samples with single-species infections of P. reichenowi (C1), P. gaboni (C2), P. billcollinsi (C3) or P. praefalciparum (G1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three additional faecal samples represented mixed-species infections of several gorilla or chimpanzee parasites, including one of unknown, non-Laverania species origin (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given their enormous diversity, var homologs were amplified targeting a conserved region of the DBL domain, termed the var gene tag, using conventional PCR and previously reported primers30,31 (see the Methods section and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amplicons were cloned, and multiple clones per sample were sequenced and grouped into unique haplotypes by phylogenetic analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The var gene tag is commonly analysed because it is sufficiently conserved in two locations to allow reliable amplification, and is located within the DBL domain, which, unlike other DBL domains, is present in almost all var genes20,21,22,30,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DBL tag consists of three conserved homology blocks19 (HBs) interspersed with highly variable regions (HVRs) of diverse length and sequence content (Fig 1b), an architecture that facilitates mosaicism21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Standard sequence analysis techniques cannot adequately analyse these mosaic sequences19,20,21,22,23,24 and we therefore used a network analysis method to characterize the evolutionary relationships between Laverania var fragments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2 illustrates this type of analysis, where each node represents a var DBL sequence tag and a link between two nodes represents a shared identical sequence mosaic element.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to frequent recombination and the possibility that immune selection differs between adjacent HVRs, networks were constructed independently for each of the two HVRs, which in P. falciparum were shown to exhibit different community structures21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each sample, only unique var tag haplotypes were included into the analysis (see the Methods section for a detailed description of network construction and statistical community detection).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Networks of DBL sequences from P. reichenowi and P. falciparum.Each node represents a DBL HVR sequence and each link represents a shared amino-acid substring of significant length21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

P. reichenowi sequences do not cluster by species or sample in either HVR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Link lengths and node placements are determined by a force-directed layout to better reveal structure, if it exists (see the Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional analyses of these networks are shown in Supplementary Fig 1.Full size image', 'Shared var mosaic structure in P. reichenowi and P. falciparum', 'We first examined the 37 new DBL tags from a P. reichenowi monoinfection detected by routine blood analysis in an asymptomatic sanctuary chimpanzee (SYptt15), who was housed in close proximity to the habitat of wild apes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is well established that human P. falciparum and chimpanzee P. reichenowi are closely related sister taxa15, and previous analyses of PrCDC var gene sequences indicated sequence homology with field and lab strains of P. falciparum15,20,22,23,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While early studies investigated shared polymorphisms in preliminary assemblies of a small subset of these genes20, more recent studies analysed the complete set of PrCDC DBL domains, finding conserved gene regions between PrCDC and P. falciparum isolates 3D7 and HB3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23), as well as the presence of P. falciparum HBs in PrCDC DBL sequences33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, we focused specifically on the most polymorphic HVR regions of P. falciparum and P. reichenowi DBL homologs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a network community detection algorithm, a Bayesian k-mer analysis and a pairwise distance approach, we found that var mosaics within the P. falciparumP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  reichenowi network do not cluster by parasite species (Fig 2; Supplementary Fig 1a,b), and that var genes from both species exhibit the same modular HVR architecture, that is, a pattern of alternating regions of conservation and variability (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously hypothesized that this genetic structure may allow for neighbouring HVRs to respond independently to different selection pressures21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our results confirm and extend previous findings that DBL organization and capacity for diversification in response to immune selection were already present in the most recent common ancestor of P. falciparum and P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  reichenowi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'var DBL tag structures predate the Laverania radiation', 'Having analysed var tags from P. falciparum and P. reichenowi, we next examined parasite sequences from across the ape Laverania subgenus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerous identical mosaic elements in otherwise divergent sequences and a shared overall HVR architecture extended to the most divergent species (Fig 3; Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were able to reconstruct highly connected networks for each HVR, indicating the presence of shared mosaic elements among the vast majority of tags from single-species parasite infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Every Laverania var tag contained three conserved sequence motifs separating two HVRs: in 86% of sequences, the three conserved motifs corresponded to three of the five most common P. falciparum var motifs (in the order: HB3, HB5 and HB2)19, while in the remaining 14%, HB5 was intact in the middle of the tag and more divergent forms of HB3 and HB2 were encoded by the 5 and 3 end of the tag, respectively

(Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also included P. falciparum DBL tags to compare tags with var-derived, yet non-DBL, sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3, tags from single-species ape Laverania infections remained separated from both the non-var DBL tags and the P. falciparum DBL tags, with a majority connected to one or both of the large connected components formed by the P. falciparum and known P. reichenowi tags.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This majority included every new P. reichenowi and P. praefalciparum tag, and all but one P. billcollinsi tag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, only 10 P. gaboni tags were connected to one or both large components, with the other 26 connected only to other P. gaboni tags in separate, small components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These smaller P. gaboni components did not share mosaic elements with DBL or non-var DBL sequences, suggesting that they represented divergent, yet var-like, domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Laverania parasites contain ape-specific var-like DBL domains', 'We next investigated the relationships between sequences from all ape Laverania samples by conducting a network analysis that excluded P. falciparum, but included sequences from both mixed-species and single-species infections (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences from P. billcollinsi and P. praefalciparum remained integrated within the large connected component that also included P. reichenowi, indicating conservation of mosaic elements within HVRs across these species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is consistent with mitochondrial DNA (Fig 1a), apicoplast and nuclear phylogenies1,34, which place P. billcollinsi and P. praefalciparum closer to P. reichenowi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, sequences from four single-species infections of P. gaboni, which represent a much more distant Laverania species, exhibited much less shared sequence content in HVR networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, P. gaboni sequences appeared to fall into two subgroups based on tag length: (i) longer P. gaboni sequences (94-135 amino acids), which share mosaic elements with P. reichenowi and P. billcollinsi in 8 of 15 sequences in the left HVR and 2 of 15 sequences in the right HVR, and which we therefore term DBL-like (red, unboxed in Fig 4); and (ii) shorter P. gaboni sequences (72-85 amino acids), which remain disconnected from the P. reichenowiP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  billcollinsi component in 21 of 21 cases and which we therefore termed DBLx-like (red, boxed in Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, within the HVRs, longer P. gaboni DBL-like sequences are partially

standard P. falciparum DBL primers, and they all exhibited the classical DBL architecture with fully intact HB5 motifs in the tag centre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, they were unrelated to other known DBL domain classes (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All four single-species P. gaboni samples, as well as one P. gaboni-containing mixed-species sample, contained DBLx sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of polymorphisms in the HB3-like region, DBLx sequences formed two subgroups, which we refer to as DBLx1 and DBLx2 (Supplementary Fig 3; see the Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DBLx sequences were not limited to chimpanzee parasites, as the mixed-species infection gorilla sample GTggg118, which contained both P. praefalciparum and P. adleri, also featured DBLx2 tags.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GTggg118 DBLx2 tags shared mosaic elements with both DBLx1 and DBLx2 tags from P. gaboni, while the GTggg118 DBL-like tags were well-connected to the P. billcollinsi-P. reichenowi component (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus hypothesize that the GTggg118 DBLx2 tags derive from P. adleri, a closely related sister taxon to P. gaboni (Fig 1a), while the DBL-like tags may be derived from either P. adleri or P. praefalciparum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is likely that DBLx sequences represent new var-like DBL subdomains that are restricted to the C2/G2 branch of the Laverania subgenus (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'var multi-domain structures predate the Laverania radiation', 'To confirm the presence of var-like genes in P. gaboni, we also examined near-full-length parasite genomes and unplaced contigs, which were derived by select whole-genome amplification27,28 from two chimpanzee blood samples (SYpte37 and SYptt75).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three lines of evidence indicated that var-like genes, consisting of multiple DBL domains, were indeed present in this parasite species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we identified 55 var-like DBL domains in 40 different contigs, 14 and 2 of which were further classified using the VarDom server19 as being related to P. falciparum DBL and DBL domains, respectively (Table 1; Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the remaining DBL domains could be similarly subclassified, but four contigs featured exact nucleotide matches for DBL-like tag sequences, providing a cross-validation between methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three contigs featured three, four, and five adjacent and non-identical DBL domains, a configuration unique to vars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional six contigs featured two adjacent DBL domains, but in these cases an eba gene origin could not formally be excluded35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Var gene-like structures in P. gaboni whole-genome contigs.Full size table', 'The finding of only nine contigs with var-like multi-DBL configurations in our P. gaboni genomic data is likely related to difficulties in assembling these sequences from short read data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  De novo assembly is hindered by identical and near-identical motifs present in different DBL domains, which make an accurate determination of the number and order of these domains in a given var gene difficult36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, acidic terminal segment (ATS) domains, which are also a unique feature of var genes, lack these repeat structures, although they share some sequence motifs due to frequent recombination37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus reasoned that ATS regions would more likely assemble into full-length or near-full-length domains and looked for these var signatures in the P. gaboni genomic sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, ATS domains were readily identified in 16 contigs derived from the P. gaboni SYptt75 genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In P. falciparum, the ATS domain encodes the intracellular portion of the PfEMP1 protein, which is expressed from a separate exon (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ATS domains are unique to var genes, except for a single-copy non-var gene with an ATS-like domain on chromosome 1 (PF3D7_0113800)19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the VarDom server to characterize the P. gaboni ATS domains, we identified seven of ten known major HBs (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These were very similar to P. falciparum var ATS HBs, but very different from the non-var ATS-like domains of PF3D7_0113800 and its P. reichenowi, and P. gaboni orthologs (Fig 5; Supplementary Fig 5), thus providing compelling evidence for the presence of bona fide var ATS domains in P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  gaboni.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Conservation of var ATS domain homology block structure in P. gaboni.The

structure, with a DBL and transmembrane domain in exon 1 and an ATS domain in exon 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of these contigs contained an additional open-reading frame (ORF) downstream of the var-like exon 2, which was 88% identical in its nucleotide sequence to genes and intergenic flanking sequences in P. falciparum (PF3D7_0323800) and P. reichenowi (PRCDC_0323100) on the same chromosome, respectively (the latter two shared 94% nucleotide sequence identity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the function of these orthologs is unknown, they are single-copy genes immediately adjacent to a var exon 2 pseudogene on chromosome 3 of both P. falciparum and P. reichenowi (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This synteny implies the existence of ancestral ORFs on chromosome 3, including a var gene that retained both exons in P. gaboni, but represents a single-exon pseudogene in P. falciparum and P. reichenowi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the presence of a two-exon var structure and synteny on chromosome 3

cysteine residues in the tag region30, which map to distinct community structures in network analyses21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two main groups can be further subdivided into a total of six Cys/PoLV (CP) groups based on the presence or absence of key amino acid residues30,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cysteine-based classifications were found to be associated with different upstream promoter regions and clinical outcomes, and var repertoires in individual P. falciparum parasites appear to be stably structured with respect to these categories32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed the same cysteine-based organization, both with respect to cysteine counts and CP groups, in DBL tags from P. billcollinsi, but not from P. gaboni, although in the latter case we identified far fewer DBL-like motifs

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Until recently, the only known close relative of P. falciparum was P. reichenowi, a Laverania parasite infecting chimpanzees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the past 56 years, five additional species within the Laverania subgenus have been described, each infecting either chimpanzees or gorillas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This Laverania species diversity provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the origins of genomic features that previously seemed unique to P. falciparum, such as the var gene family encoding erythrocyte membrane proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that various aspects of the multi-scale modularity of these loci can be recognized in diverse Laverania species, with the implication that a var or var-like gene family already existed in their last common ancestor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, at the var gene repertoire level, we find genes with a characteristic two-exon structure, encoding multiple adjacent domains potentially capable of binding diverse endothelial markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like the constituent domains of the P. falciparum-encoded PfEMP1 proteins, the other Laverania DBL sequences can be subclassified into distinct groups, which may reflect differences in endothelial binding or other specificities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, at the domain architecture level, alternating conserved and hypervariable regions enable combinatorial diversity while presumably maintaining protein structure and binding functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, at the microscale level, some protein motifs within hypervariable regions are shared among even the most divergent Laverania species, despite the evidence of high-frequency recombination within species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, many key elements of the var multi-gene family appear to have originated many (perhaps tens of) millions of years ago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In P. falciparum, the var-encoded PfEMP1 proteins play a key role in pathogenesis by mediating the binding of infected red blood cells to specific host receptors in a wide range of tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particular disease syndromes have been associated with individual DBL domains, two of which were present in P. gaboni.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first, DBL, is found in the var2csa genes of P. falciparum19 and P. reichenowi15, which exist as only one or two var variants per genome and have been identified in every complete var repertoire analysed to date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In P. falciparum, var2csa genes are responsible for placental binding, and the DBL domain has thus been implicated in pregnancy-associated malaria39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, we identified DBL in P. gaboni.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there currently are no host receptors or disease syndromes that have been associated with this individual domain in P. falciparum, triplet combinations of DBL and DBL domains have been linked to IgM-positive rosetting phenotypes40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of recognizable DBL and DBL domains in the most divergent Laverania species suggests that DBL domain differentiation into subtypes represents an ancient host adaptation, and that DBL and DBL may represent functionally constrained domains across the Laverania subgenus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Beyond single var domains, the var repertoires of P. falciparum parasites can be divided into groups that have been associated with different clinical phenotypes, such as severe malarial anaemia and cerebral malaria, using a cysteine-based classification of DBL tags38,41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These groups are represented in similar proportions across P. falciparum and P. reichenowi parasites, and our data suggest that this repertoire structure may also extend to P. billcollinsi (Supplementary Fig 6); an insufficient number of DBL-like tags precludes an extension of this classification to P. gaboni at the present time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given their association with clinical disease in humans, the extent to which these sequence features are also indicative of pathology in apes warrants further study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although we identified var-like features in species spanning the Laverania subgenus, we also found that certain signatures identified in P. falciparum and P. reichenowi var genes are absent from the more divergent parasite species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, we found no evidence of CIDR domains in either of the P. gaboni genomes, despite identifying numerous DBL domains (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, DBL-like P. gaboni sequences were not sufficiently similar to P. falciparum DBL domains to be confidently classified as such.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the vast majority of P. falciparum var genes encode a DBL-CIDR domain pair, the apparent absence of CIDR domains from P. gaboni is puzzling, especially in light of the role that CIDR domains are believed to play in host receptor binding43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will be important to determine whether P. gaboni var-like genes contain other domains with CIDR-like function or whether P. gaboni differs in its biology from other Laverania parasites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the network analysis of PCR tags revealed new DBL domains that we termed DBLx because they are unlike the other six known var DBL domain classes shared by P. falciparum44 and P. reichenowi15 (Fig 4; Supplementary Figs 3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These DBLx tags, which were amplified using P. falciparum DBL primers, are shorter than all other tags, and can be further subdivided into DBLx1 and DBLx2 subgroups based on differences in the highly conserved HB3-like region (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Divergence from the P. falciparum LARSFADIG motif within this HB3-like region has also been reported for another partially characterized P. gaboni genome15, but adjacent sequences were not analysed, thus leaving their relationship with DBLx domains unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we identified multiple copies of P. gaboni ATS domains, which exhibit a var-like HB structure that is very similar, but not identical, to P. falciparum and P. reichenowi ATS domains (Fig 5; Table 1; Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data indicate that, while var-like genes in P. gaboni (and possibly also P. adleri) share important structural similarities with those of P. falciparum and P. reichenowi, they also exhibit important differences, which may reflect differences in function and biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The presence of var-like genes throughout the Laverania subgenus suggests an ancient adaptation for antigenic variation, and potentially cytoadherence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, while links exist between var expression and clinical disease in humans, the disease causing potential of var-like gene products in Laverania parasites infecting wild apes remains unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, there may be important parallels since recent field studies of habituated chimpanzees in the Tai Forest, Côte dIvoire revealed higher faecal parasite burdens in both young45 and pregnant46 individuals, similar to what has been described in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the role of the var-encoded PfEMP1 proteins to mediate endothelial binding in the presence of a vigorous host immune response, it is likely that var genes play a similar role in other Laverania species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the extent of var gene diversity, especially among the more divergent Laverania species that lack certain P. falciparum-specific DBL and CIDR domains, suggests potentially different biological solutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional field studies of habituated ape populations will be necessary to establish the biological consequences of ape Laverania infections and the pathogenic potential of their var-like gene products.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Sample collection', 'Ape faecal samples were collected from wild-living central (Pan troglodytes troglodytes; DGptt540) and eastern (P. t. schweinfurthii; KApts1680) chimpanzees and western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla; GTggg140, GTggg118) for previous molecular epidemiological studies of Laverania parasites1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were collected in RNAlater (1:1 vol/vol), transported at ambient temperatures and stored at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also analysed left-over blood samples from chimpanzees cared for at the Sanaga-Yong Rescue Centre (SYptt5, SYptt15, SYptt20, SYpte37, SYptt75, SYptt79 and SYptt82), which were obtained in the context of routine health examinations or for specific veterinary purposes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were shipped in compliance with Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora regulations and country-specific import and export permits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA was extracted from faecal and blood samples using the QIAamp Stool DNA Mini Kit and QIAamp Blood DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), respectively, described in detail in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Plasmodium species identification', 'The Plasmodium species composition in ape faecal and blood samples was determined by SGS and phylogenetic analysis1,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, faecal and blood DNA was end point diluted in 96-well plates, and the dilution that yielded  less_than 30% wells with positive PCR reactions was used to generate between 2 and 174 different SGS sequences per sample (according to a Poisson distribution, the DNA dilution that yields PCR products in  less_than 30% of wells contains one amplifiable template per positive PCR  greater than 83% of the time).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amplification products were gel purified, and sequenced directly without interim cloning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences that contained double peaks as an indicator of more than one amplified template were discarded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different genomic loci were amplified, including portions of mitochondrial (cytochrome B), nuclear (erythrocyte binding antigens eba165 and eba175, 6-cysteine protein p47 and p48/45, lactate dehydrogenase, reticulocyte-binding protein homolog 5) and apicoplast (caseinolytic protease C) genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All relevant primers are provided in Supplementary Table 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each genomic region, up to 73 single template-derived amplicons were sequenced and their species origin was identified by phylogenetic analysis (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis identified seven blood samples and one faecal sample to represent single-species infections of P. reichenowi (SYptt15, 46 SGS sequences), P. gaboni (SYptt5, 86 SGS sequences; SYpte37, 59 SGS sequences; SYptt75, 122 SGS sequences; SYptt82, 59 SGS sequences), P. billcollinsi (SYptt20, 174 SGS sequences; SYptt79, 16 SGS sequences) and P. praefalciparum (GTggg140; 2 SGS sequences), although many of these specimens contained multiple variants (haplotypes) of the respective species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three other faecal samples (GTggg118, KApts1680 and DGptt540) contained more than one ape Laverania species, and one included an additional non-Laverania species of unknown origin (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'PCR amplification of var genes', 'DBL domains were amplified, cloned and sequenced (see, for example, refs 30, 31) using conventional (rather than limiting dilution) PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different primers sets, listed below, were used to amplify 2.5 l of faecal or blood derived DNA in a 25-l reaction volume, containing 0.5 l dNTPs (10 mM of each dNTP), 10 pmol of each primer, 2.5 l PCR buffer, 0.1 l BSA solution (50 mg ml1) and 0.25 l expand long template enzyme mix (Expand Long Template PCR System, Roche).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most samples were subjected to single-round amplification with previously published primers, including DBL-5 (5-GCACGAAGTTTTGCAGATATWGG-3) and DBL-3 (5-AARTCTTCKGCCCATTCCTCGAACCA-3)31, or DBLAF (5-GCACGMAGTTTYGC-3) and DBLBR (5-GCCCATTCSTCGAACCA-3)30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only three samples were amplified with additional primers, including C1DBLAF (5-GCACGVAGTTTTGC-3) and C1DBLBR (5-GCCCATTCSTSGAACCA-3), and C2DBLAF (5-AARTAHAGTTTTGCTGATTTARG-3) and C2DBLAR (5-TTCGGACCATTCGKCWAWCCA-3), respectively, or by nested PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C2DBLAF and C2DBLAR primers were designed to specifically amplify P. gaboni DBL tags using an alignment of select whole-genome amplification derived contigs of SYpte37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cycling conditions included an initial denaturing step of 2 min at 94 °C, followed by 3560 cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 10 s), annealing (5055 °C, 30 s) and elongation (68 °C, 1 min), followed by a final elongation step of 10 min at 68 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both single-round and nested PCR-derived amplicons were gel purified and subcloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) or PCR4 TOPO (Life Technologies) plasmid vectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positive clones were sequenced, and analysed using SEQUENCHER (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI) or Lasergene (DNASTAR) software.

intact ORF; sequences lacking an intact ORF or identifiable 5 and 3 primer sequences were discarded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To remove Taq polymerase errors in cloned DBL var tag sequences, a neighbour-joining tree was constructed for each sample and sequences differing by less than three nucleotides were condensed into a single-consensus sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, for each sample only unique DBL var tag haplotypes were analysed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Network analysis', 'A short region of var gene sequence within the DBL domain, which we refer to as a tag, comprises three conserved HBs (HB3, HB5 and HB2) separated by two HVRs19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified HVRs using a sequence entropy approach, modifying a previously published procedure21 to accommodate ape Laverania sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To extract highly variable sequence content for further study, we identified and removed the three conserved HBs from the 3-end, middle and 5-end of each tag sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was carried out by first aligning all sequences first to HB3 without inserting any gaps mid-sequence (step 1), that is, we required that all sequences align at and only at HB3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we calculated the Shannon entropy of the aligned sequences at each position (step 2) and scanned from HB3 towards the centre of the tag to find the first position p at which entropy was  greater than 2 bits (step 3) such that each subsequent position also had entropy  greater than 2 bits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we retained all sequences from p towards the centre of the tag (step 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Steps 14 were repeated for HB2, thus removing low-entropy HBs from the ends of each sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we removed conserved central sequence content, splitting the tag into two HVRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We repeated steps 1 and 2 with HB5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then scanned from HB5 towards each end of the tag, finding the first position p in each direction with entropy  greater than 2 bits such that each subsequent position had entropy  greater than 2 bits, and retained everything from p towards the end of the tag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All steps are shown graphically in Supplementary Fig 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high-entropy HVR between HB3 and HB5 is referred to as the left HVR and the high-entropy HVR between HB5 and HB2 is referred to as the right HVR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Two types of networks were created.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, networks of var sequences were generated by assigning each HVR sequence to a node and placing a link between two nodes when their corresponding sequences shared a block of length L or greater at the amino-acid level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  L=7 for left HVR and L=6 for right HVR, based on null model calculations21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figures were produced using force-directed layouts in webweb software v3.1 (http://danlarremore.com/webweb).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, bipartite networks of both var genes and their shared blocks were created by assigning each HVR sequence and each shared block of length L or greater to a node, and placing a link between a sequence node and a shared block node if the block is present in the sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These bipartite networks are related to the other type of network via one-mode projection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Community detection was performed using the biSBM method applied to bipartite networks of sequences and their shared amino-acid substrings48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'k-mer stackup analysis', 'Within an amino-acid sequence, we refer to any contiguous
