Terahertz-driven linear electron acceleration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The cost, size and availability of electron accelerators are dominated by the achievable accelerating gradient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conventional high-brightness radio-frequency accelerating structures operate with 3050 MeV m1 gradients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electron accelerators driven with optical or infrared sources have demonstrated accelerating gradients orders of magnitude above that achievable with conventional radio-frequency structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, laser-driven wakefield accelerators require intense femtosecond sources and direct laser-driven accelerators suffer from low bunch charge, sub-micron tolerances and sub-femtosecond timing requirements due to the short wavelength of operation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate linear acceleration of electrons with keV energy gain using optically generated terahertz pulses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Terahertz-driven accelerating structures enable high-gradient electron/proton accelerators with simple accelerating structures, high repetition rates and significant charge per bunch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These ultra-compact terahertz accelerators with extremely short electron bunches hold great potential to have a transformative impact for free electron lasers, linear colliders, ultrafast electron diffraction, X-ray science and medical therapy with X-rays and electron beams.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'At radio-frequency (RF) frequencies where conventional sources (klystrons and so on) are efficient, surface electric field gradients in accelerating structures are limited by RF-induced plasma breakdown1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Empirically, the breakdown threshold has been found3,4 to scale as Esf1/21/4, where Es is the surface electric field, f is the frequency of operation and  is the pulse length indicating that higher frequencies and shorter pulse durations are clearly beneficial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This empirical scaling is limited by the onset of field emission due to the electric field on material surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For most common accelerating materials, this onset is in the 10s of GV m1 range5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, low frequencies (that is, GHz) inherently require long RF pulses because a single RF cycle is long (on the order of ns) and traditional sources work most efficiently when operating over a very narrow frequency spectrum (that is, long pulse length).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Practically, this results in a significant amount of average power coupled into the structure if a high repetition rate is used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'If high accelerating gradients are desired, presently available ultrafast near infrared (NIR) terawatt and petawatt laser technology based on chirped pulse amplification allows for multi-GeV m1 gradients7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, due to the short wavelength, infrared optical pulses prove to be difficult to use for the direct acceleration of electrons with significant charge per bunch, which is an important parameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the coherent emission in a free electron laser (FEL) from an electron bunch scales with the square of the number of electrons in the bunch1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prevent emittance growth and increased energy spread, the electron bunch needs to occupy a small fraction of the optical cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even for a long-infrared wavelength of 10 m, 1° of phase in the optical wavelength corresponds to only 28 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another practical concern would be the timing precision between the optical cycle and the arrival of the electron bunch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, 1° phase jitter, commonly required for operational accelerators, requires  less_than 100 as timing jitter between the optical pulse and the electron bunch, which is challenging to maintain over extended distances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Difficulties increase further when considering the available options for guiding the optical light to decrease the phase velocity to match the electron beam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A guided mode at a wavelength of 10 m would require sub-micron precision for aligning the electron bunch and the optical waveguide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Alternatively, laser plasma wakefield accelerators have demonstrated GeV m1 accelerating gradients7,9,17 with 100 terawatt to petawatt (TWPW) low repetition rate sources with percent-level energy spread and jitter for the electron bunch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complexity of these plasma wakefield accelerators is significant because the acceleration mechanism relies on plasma bubbles, which are easily subject to instabilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, power scaling of the required high-energy femtosecond pulse sources is challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'THz frequencies provide the best of both worlds18,19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On one hand, the wavelength is long enough that we can fabricate waveguides with conventional machining techniques, provide accurate timing and accommodate a significant amount of charge per bunch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 0.3 THz, the wavelength is 1 mm and 1° of phase precision corresponds to 10-fs timing jitter, which is readily achievable22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the frequency is high enough that the plasma breakdown threshold for surface electric fields increases into the multi-GV m1 range6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, using optical generation techniques, we can have very short THz pulses (100 ps) generated by picosecond lasers readily available at high average power and under rapid development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These short pulses allow for a limited amount of pulsed heating and a limited amount of average power loading at high repetition rates (on the order of kHz and above).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the increase in operational frequency and reduction in pulse length will play a role in increasing the breakdown limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report the experimental demonstration of electron acceleration using the axial component of an optically generated 10 J THz pulse centred at 0.45 THz (see Methods: THz pulse generation) in a waveguide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The THz pulse accelerates electrons in a circular waveguide consisting of a dielectric capillary with a metal outer boundary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dielectric slows the group and phase velocity of the THz wave allowing it to accelerate low-energy electrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We a observe a maximum energy gain of 7 keV in 3 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future, THz accelerators designed for relativistic electron beams and using more intense THz sources will be able to reach GeV m1 accelerating gradients.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Operation of the THz LINAC', 'A schematic view of the THz accelerator is shown in Fig 1a with a photograph of the THz LINAC in Fig 1b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using 60-keV electrons, from a d.c. electron gun, an energy gain of 7 keV is observed in a 3-mm interaction length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The single-cycle THz pulse, see Fig 1ce, is produced via optical rectification of a 1.2 mJ, 1.03 m laser pulse with a 1 kHz repetition rate (see Methods: Pump source).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The THz pulse, whose polarization is converted from linear to radial by a segmented waveplate (see Methods: Radially polarized THz beam), is coupled into a waveguide with 10 MV m1 peak on-axis electric field (see Methods: Structure testing).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 25-fC input electron bunch is produced with a 60-keV d.c. photoemitting cathode excited by a 350-fs ultraviolet pulse (see Methods: Ultraviolet photoemitter).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The accelerating gradient in the THz structures demonstrated in this work can be as high as GeV m1 with a single-cycle THz pulse of 10 mJ (see Methods: THz LINAC), which can be readily produced by a 250-mJ infrared pulse when using optimized THz generation23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Laser systems producing such and even higher energy picosecond pulses with up to kHz repetition rates are on the horizon24,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Terahertz-driven linear accelerator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic of the THz LINAC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Top right: a linearly polarized THz pulse is converted into a radially polarized pulse by a segmented waveplate before being focused into the THz waveguide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The THz pulse is reflected at the end of the waveguide to co-propagate with the electron bunch, which enters the waveguide through a pinhole (lower left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electron bunch is accelerated by the longitudinal electric field of the co-propagating THz pulse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electron bunch exits the THz waveguide and passes through a hole in the focusing mirror (right) for the THz pulse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Photograph of the compact millimetre scale THz LINAC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) The time-domain waveform of the THz pulse determined with electro-optic sampling (see Methods: Electro-optic sampling).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insert: corresponding frequency-domain spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) The time-domain waveform of the THz pulse at the exit of a THz waveguide 5 cm in length, including two tapers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Normalized intensity of the focused THz beam.Full size image', 'In this experiment, the THz waveguide supports a travelling TM01 mode that is phase matched to the velocity of the electron bunch produced by the d.c. photoinjector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is the axial component of the TM01 mode that accelerates the electrons as they co-propagate down the waveguide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A travelling-wave mode is advantageous when considering the available single-cycle THz pulse because it does not require resonant excitation of the structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A dielectric-loaded circular waveguide was selected due to the ease of fabrication in the THz band27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inner diameter of the copper waveguide is 940 m with a dielectric wall thickness of 270 m. This results in a vacuum space with a radius of 200 m. The significant thickness of the dielectric is due to the low energy of the electrons entering the structure, and will decrease significantly at higher energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One critical aspect for THz electron acceleration is proper interaction between the electron beam and the THz pulse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coupling the radially polarized THz pulse into the single-mode dielectric waveguide was achieved with a centrally loaded dielectric horn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The design was optimized to maximize coupling with minimal fabrication complexity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finite element electromagnetic simulations with HFSS28 indicate excellent coupling of the THz pulse over a 200 GHz bandwidth (see Methods: Structure testing), which is compatible with the bandwidth of the radially polarized mode converter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The accelerating waveguide is 10 mm in length, including a single tapered horn for coupling the THz into the waveguide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alignment between the THz waveguide and the d.c. gun is provided by a pin-hole aperture in a metal plate with a diameter of 100 m that abuts the waveguide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The THz pulse is coupled into the waveguide downstream of the accelerator and it propagates along the full length of the waveguide before being reflected by the pin-hole aperture, which acts as a short at THz frequencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After being reflected the THz pulse co-propagates with the electron bunch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low initial energy of the electrons results in the rapid onset of a phase-velocity mismatch between the electron bunch and the THz pulse once the electrons have been accelerated by the THz pulse and this limits the interaction length to 3 mm (see Methods: THz LINAC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Observation of acceleration', 'The electron beam energy is determined via energy-dependent magnetic steering with a dipole located after the accelerator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2a,b shows images of the electron beam produced by the micro-channel plate detector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured energy spectrum from the electron bunch with and without THz is shown in Fig 2c,d for an initial mean energy of 59 keV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The curves are compared with PARMELA29 particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation results used to model the d.c. gun and the THz LINAC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full width of the electron bunch length after the pinhole is 200 m, which is long with respect to the wavelength of the THz pulse in the waveguide, g=315 m. The length of the electron bunch in combination with the phase-velocity mismatch between the electron bunch and the THz pulse results in the observation of both acceleration and deceleration of particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the available THz pulse energy, a peak energy gain of 7 keV was observed by optimizing the electron beam voltage and timing of the THz pulse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modelled curve in Fig 2d concurred with experiments for an on-axis electric field of 8.5 MV m1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this estimated field strength, at the exit of the LINAC, the modelled transverse and longitudinal emittance are 240 and 370 nm rad, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An increase in emittance from a transverse emittance of 25 nm rad and a longitudinal emittance of 5.5 nm rad after a pinhole located at the waveguide entrance is due to the long electron bunch length compared with the THz wavelength and can be easily remedied with a shorter ultraviolet pulse length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

initial energy of the electrons, because the set-up is operated in the non-relativistic limit where the velocity of the electrons varies rapidly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the initial energy is decreased, the particle velocity decreases and the phase-velocity mismatch with the THz pulse increases reducing the interaction length and the acceleration of the particle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 3a, the achieved mean output energy of the electron bunch is shown versus the initial energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher initial energy was experimentally found to be favourable for higher energy gain.

LINAC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 3b, the mean energy of accelerated electrons is shown as a function of the THz pulse delay for 55-keV initial energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large temporal range of observed acceleration results from waveguide dispersion, which broadens the single-cycle pulse temporally as it propagates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accelerated electrons are observed over the full range of

7 keV was achieved over a 3-mm interaction length with good modelled emittance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Performance of these structures improves with an increase in electron energy and gradient making them attractive for compact accelerator applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With upgrades to pump laser energy and technological improvements to THz sources31, laboratory demonstration of GeV m1 gradients in THz LINACs is realistic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multi-GeV m1 gradients and  greater than 10 MeV energy gain are achievable in dielectric-loaded circular waveguides30 with 10-mJ THz pulses and the injection of

and 3% infrared-to-THz conversion efficiencies32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple stages of THz acceleration can be used to achieve higher energy gain with additional infrared pump lasers for subsequent stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Timing jitter will improve on the jitter of conventional accelerators since the accelerating field and photoemitting pulse are produced by the same drive laser.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, one expects the resulting electron bunch to have tighter synchronization than possible in today's RF-based accelerators, where the photoemitting laser pulse is synchronized to the RF drive

'THz pulse generation', 'The THz pulse that is used in the accelerating structure is generated with optical rectification of 700 fs, 1.03 m pulses in cryogenically cooled stoichiometric lithium niobate (LN) doped with 1% MgO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LN was chosen because it exhibits multiple advantages with low THz absorption, large bandgap, a high damage threshold and a high effective nonlinear coefficient, that is, large deff.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a high efficiency of conversion in LN, a tilted-pulse-front pumping scheme23 is required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The THz pulse is centred at 0.45 THz with a broad spectrum ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 THz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A THz pulse energy of 10 J is produced from 1.2 mJ of NIR, which is slightly lower than the peak conversion efficiency of THz generation23 due to a larger spot size in the LN (decreased fluence) for improved transport of the THz beam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The THz beam has excellent Gaussian mode content, which allows for low-loss coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The THz beam was characterized spatially by a pyroelectric detector array (Spiricon Pyrocam IV, Ophir Photonics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Pump source', 'The pump source for THz generation is a Yb:KYW chirped pulse regenerative amplifier (RGA) producing 1.5-mJ pulses with 1 kHz repetition rate at a centre wavelength of 1,030 nm and bandwidth of 2.1 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dielectric grating compressor following the RGA compresses the pulses to a near-transform-limited 700-fs pulse duration (full width at half maximum).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The seed for the RGA was a mode-locked Yb-doped fibre oscillator emitting 70 fs, 0.2 nJ pulses at 80 MHz (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34) amplified to 1.6 nJ by a Yb-doped fibre amplifier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After losses through the optical elements in the pulse front tilting set-up including a diffraction grating, the impinging pump energy into the (LN) crystal was 1.2 mJ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Ultraviolet photoemitter', 'About 2% of the available 1,030 nm NIR pump energy was used to generate the ultraviolet photoemitter pulses by fourth harmonic generation from 1.03 m based on two-stage second harmonic generation in a 10-mm-long type I LBO crystal for infrared to green and in a 0.5-mm-long type-I BBO crystal for the green to ultraviolet, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A BG-39 band-pass filter was used to remove the fundamental NIR component after the first stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ultraviolet pulses have a duration of 350 fs and are focused onto the photocathode with a beam waist of 200 m.
