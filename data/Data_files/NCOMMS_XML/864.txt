Harnessing catalytic pumps for directional delivery of microparticles in microchambers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The directed transport of microparticles in microfluidic devices is vital for efficient bioassays and fabrication of complex microstructures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There remains, however, a need for methods to propel and steer microscopic cargo that do not require modifying these particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using theory and experiments, we show that catalytic surface reactions can be used to deliver microparticle cargo to specified regions in microchambers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here reagents diffuse from a gel reservoir and react with the catalyst-coated surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluid density gradients due to the spatially varying reagent concentration induce a convective flow, which carries the suspended particles until the reagents are consumed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the cargo is deposited around a specific position on the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The velocity and final peak location of the cargo can be tuned independently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By increasing the local particle concentration, highly sensitive assays can be performed efficiently and rapidly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the process can be repeated by introducing fresh reagent into the microchamber.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The targeted transport and delivery of microparticles (for example, cells, bacterial spores and colloids) to specific locations in fluid-filled microchambers is essential for applications ranging from biological assays to bottom-up assembly of complex structures1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Directed transport of analytes is especially vital for performing rapid, sensitive assays since diffusion alone cannot provide timely accumulation of these species at localized sensors5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has been demonstrated for a model system by Sheehan and coworkers: relying purely on diffusive transport, femtomolar concentrations of 20-base single-stranded DNA molecules require a timescale of minutes or longer to encounter a typical microscale sensor5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detecting much larger, micron-scale particles (for example, cells, spores and viruses) by diffusion alone would be orders of magnitude slower and, therefore, impractical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Active transport, where chemicals in the environment can guide particle motion, can alleviate this problem because higher signal/noise ratios can be achieved in a shorter time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, progress has been made in harnessing chemical gradients in fluids to control the movement of molecules and nanoparticles, achieving millimetre-scale transport over several hours6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the size of the particles increases, however, the performance of techniques based on molecular gradients progressively decreases, and hence, there is a vital need for better methods to steer microparticles in solution, for example, by microfluidic flows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In microfluidic systems, actuation forces such as external pressure and thermocapillary effects are typically used to create flows that propel particles up to 100 body lengths per second9; such external inputs could, however, damage sensitive biological analytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electric fields and magnetic fields can also be used to transport and focus analytes, though charged particles or magnetically tagged analytes are required for this application10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, the diffusioosmotic effect was used to deliver micron size particles into dead-end microchannels, where conventional pressure-driven mechanisms are inapplicable12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diffusioosmotic fluid flow is controlled by properties of the channel surface and the magnitude of the chemical gradients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the mechanism is effective at small length scales but is difficult to scale-up and control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other methods utilize motor proteins, such as kinesins, which can transport protein-bound analytes3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The binding of analytes to motor proteins also requires specialized particles or surface modification of desired analytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While self-propelled microparticles can be fabricated14, again, a more general approach is needed that does not involve modifying the particles to be analysed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Herein, we propose a method for microparticle transport that represents a unique advantage over the previously mentioned strategies since convective flow transport does not damage or require modification of the analytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use both theory and experiment to demonstrate that simple chemical reactions will induce unidirectional fluid flows that carry micron-sized particles towards a specific region in space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through these studies, we show that chemically induced fluid pumping enables the repeatable delivery of microparticles to targeted surface sites in microchambers.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Reaction driven microfluidic pumps', 'In designing our system, we take advantage of the recent finding15 that enzyme molecules immobilized on a surface within a fluid can convert chemical energy released by a reaction with dissolved reagents into mechanical motion of the surrounding fluid, and thereby, act as a pump, which generates microscale convective flows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pumping velocity can be increased by increasing the concentration of reagents in the solution and the reaction rate15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A variety of such microscale pumps have recently been developed15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25 by anchoring catalysts to surfaces in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, however, these micropumps have primarily been utilized to generate radial, re-circulating flows, which are not suitable for transporting and localizing particles at specified distances away from the pump.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we introduce a source of the reagent at one end of the microchamber and investigate the systems ability to deliver microparticles to a targeted site on the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we introduce a gel that is soaked with reagent at a distance from the catalyst-decorated region in the chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reagents diffuse out of the gel and into the surrounding fluid, producing a concentration gradient across the underlying catalytic surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we show below, this concentration gradient leads to asymmetric flow patterns that transport cargo and deposit this cargo at specific locations within the chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The above approach provides a number of advantages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, sensors typically require a critical threshold concentration to effectively detect a given compound; our approach enables a relatively large amount of an analyte to be autonomously delivered and concentrated at a sensor at a particular location on the surface, allowing the sensor to readily recognize these species5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluid velocity and the rate of cargo transport can be controlled by tuning the concentration of reagent in the gel (or the porosity of the gel), as well as the rate of reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After all the reagent has been consumed, the pumping stops and particles sediment to the desired location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the fluid motion can be restarted by adding fresh reagent into the gel and hence, the system can be used repeatedly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Below, we describe our model for these catalytic micropumps, discussing the physical mechanism underlying the convective transport of particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then detail the results of numerical simulations and the corresponding experiments that corroborate our findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On a conceptual level, these findings reveal how fluid flow (and the suspended particulates) in a confined chamber can be patterned and manipulated on-demand by varying readily accessible parameters in the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Theoretical model for the convective transport of particles', 'The mechanism of transducing chemical energy into fluid motion demonstrated by Sengupta et al.15 can be utilized for on-demand transportation of micron-sized cargo suspended in the fluid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism is based on the chemical decomposition of a reagent into products by surface-bound catalysts, which generates a local density variation, which in turn gives rise to fluid flows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density variation of an aqueous solution, comprised of solvent of density 0 with NC chemical solutes characterized by corresponding concentrations Cj, can be approximated as', '', 'This expression also accounts for possible variations due to a temperature change (TT0; measured with respect to reference value T0), resulting from endothermic or exothermic chemical reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expansion coefficients  and T characterize the magnitude of density variations in response to changes in solute concentrations Cj and temperature (TT0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To demonstrate the physical mechanisms of convective transport, we choose a specific realizable system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we consider convection in the long, narrow channel schematically shown in Fig 1 and, as a representative example of a catalytic chemical reaction, we choose the well-studied decomposition of an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide by a catalyst (for example, platinum or catalase) to form oxygen and water: .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here catalase was chosen as the model catalyst, since the essential reaction parameters are known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At low hydrogen peroxide concentrations, , the chemical reaction is accompanied by the production of small concentrations of oxygen, , and a temperature increase of (TT0)0.11â€‰K.

500â€‰m above the Pt pattern (see Supplementary Movie 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of H2O2, fluid flow was not observed for the Pt system (Supplementary Movie 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Urease pump', 'The urease pump showed similar behaviour to the platinum-based system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Namely, in the presence of urea, a reagent gradient perpendicular to the array gave rise to unidirectional fluid flow away from the gel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tracer particles were pumped away from the gel near the surface of the slide, with a return flow further above the surface due to fluid continuity (Supplementary Movie 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As predicted, the tracer particle speed shows reagent concentration dependence, decreasing from 6.5Â±0.4â€‰mâ€‰s1 at 500â€‰mM urea to 2.8Â±1.1â€‰mâ€‰s1 at 250â€‰mM urea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This tracer particle speed was measured at the beginning of the pattern, at a distance of 1â€‰mm from the reagent source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of reagent, fluid flow was not observed (Supplementary Movie 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These speeds were observed 50â€‰m above the pattern surface, comprising the forward flow of the convective loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the platinum system above, flow in the opposite direction was observed at an increased height from the surface, consistent with fluid continuity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Spatial variations in pumping', 'Variation in fluid-pumping speed was investigated across the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with the simulations (Fig 3b), the experiments reveal that the tracer particles slow down as they move away from the gel, and, at a certain distance, the fluid flow stops and tracer particles show only Brownian diffusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For pump arrays with 10â€‰nm Pt deposited on the surface and a reagent gradient generated by a 0.29â€‰M H2O2-soaked gel, the distance at which fluid flow dies off is 4â€‰mm away from the gel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For gold patterns soaked in an enzyme concentration of 3â€‰M urease and a reagent gradient generated by a 500â€‰mM urea-soaked gel, the distance is 10â€‰mm away from the gel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This behaviour is a result of a combination of the differences in reaction rates between platinum and urease catalysis and differences in densities and diffusion rates of the chemical species in each system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spatial profile of the tracer velocity for the two different systems is demonstrated in Fig 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The velocity profiles qualitatively agree with the spatial decay of the maximal horizontal velocities presented in Fig 3b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in the simulations, the distance at which the fluid flow stops and Brownian diffusion dominates depends on the reaction rate and resulting reagent depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In regions where the reagent concentration is small, the fluid density variations that generate convective flows are also small and the fluid velocity goes to zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: Spatial profile of the pumping speed of 2â€‰m sPsL particles.The plot in (a) is for the platinum system and the plot in (b) is for the urease

bars are calculated by taking the s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of the speed of 30 particles in a viewing window.Full size image', 'Convection-assisted delivery of microparticles', 'As indicated by the simulations, the decrease in tracer speeds across the surface and subsequent tracer sedimentation can be exploited for the directed delivery of microparticles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There exists a uniform distribution of tracers in the microchamber at the start of the experiment; however, at the end of an hour, all the tracers have settled onto the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on the experimental conditions, sPsL tracers, which serve as analogues for general micron-sized analyte particles, can be focused at specific locations on the surface of the glass slide (Supplementary Movies 10 and 11).

system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the inorganic platinum-based array, the thickness of the catalyst deposited on the strip was held constant at 10â€‰nm, while the reagent concentration in the gel was varied

distribution further away from the point of entrance, at all simulated reaction rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, a similar shift further away from the gel is seen in Figs 8 and 9, which show the experimental results when the reagent concentration was increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The particle density curve for 100â€‰mM urea is not as smooth as for 500â€‰mM urea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction rate for urease increases until the urea concentration reaches 80â€‰mM, beyond which it plateaus28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the maximum urea concentration in the chamber never reaches the initial gel concentration of 100â€‰mM due to incomplete diffusion from the gel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variability in reaction rate at the lower urea concentration (likely 80â€‰mM in the chamber due to slow diffusion) is likely the reason for the lack of smoothness in the particle density curve for 100â€‰mM urea, relative to the 500â€‰mM urea curve.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In summary, through a combination of modelling and experiments, we created a system where catalytic surface reactions produce unidirectional fluid flows that convey micron-sized particles to specific regions on the surface of microchambers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The introduction of reagents at one end of the chamber generated density variations within the fluid along the length of the chamber, producing asymmetric flow fields that are necessary for directed transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The consumption of the reagent and resulting sedimentation of the dissolved particles led to the localized surface deposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A powerful feature of the system is that the flow profile, and hence the location at which the particles are concentrated, can be tuned by altering the catalytic turnover rate and the concentration of the added reagent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While we used a polymer gel as the reservoir of reagent, other materials (for example, porous membranes) could also be used for this purpose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once all the reagents have been consumed, these reservoirs can be re-stocked with chemicals and, thus, the system can be used multiple times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the reservoir can be placed at different locations in the chamber, providing distinct ways to introduce spatially varying chemical gradients into the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This flexibility in the design of the system opens new routes to fabricating complex microstructures or patterned surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, by tailoring the amount of reagent in sequential applications of the device, one can create complicated morphologies on the surfaces in a step-wise manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the tunable, active transport by catalytic pumps demonstrated here permits significant amounts of particulates to be delivered to sensors on surfaces and, thus, enables highly sensitive assays to be performed both efficiently and rapidly in micron-scale platforms.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Fabrication of micropump array patterns', 'The square arrays, consisting of 200 thin strips of metal spaced evenly, were fabricated over glass slides in the Nanofabrication Laboratory of Materials Research Institute at the Pennsylvania State University using standard lithography and deposition techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glass slides are first cleaned with acetone and air-dried, then spin-coated with 5â€‰ml of SPR-955 photoresist (Microposit) at 500â€‰r.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  for 10â€‰s and then at 3,500â€‰r.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  for 60â€‰s. This was followed by soft-baking the coated slides over a hot plate at 95â€‰Â°C, for 1â€‰min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The array geometry was modelled in CAD and printed over a chrome-on-glass mask (Nanofabrication Laboratory, Materials Research Institute, Penn State).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For photolithography, the mask was placed in direct contact with the photoresist over the glass slide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resist was then exposed to ultraviolet radiation for 12â€‰s in a Karl Suss MA/BA6 Contact Aligner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exposed wafers were post-baked for 1â€‰min over a hot plate at 100â€‰Â°C to cross-link the exposed film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MF CD26 developer was used to remove unexposed SPR-955 from the slide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mould was developed for 2â€‰min while being agitated, followed by washing it thoroughly with deionized water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the glass slides were dried with a nitrogen blower, a 5â€‰nm-thick layer of chromium and either a 50â€‰nm layer of gold or a 10â€‰nm layer of platinum was deposited on them using electron-beam evaporation using the Semicore Evaporator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once the gold or platinum had been deposited, the glass slide was sonicated in a solution of dimethyl sulfoxide to remove the resist layer with gold or platinum on top.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This left only the gold or platinum deposited on the glass slides in the desired pattern, shown in Fig 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For enzyme-based micropump arrays, enzyme was attached to the gold stripes, as fabricated above, using a biotinstreptavidin interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Enzyme immobilization on arrays', 'To achieve the biotinylation of enzymes, a urease solution (2â€‰mgâ€‰ml; urease from Canavalia ensiformis, Jack bean, Sigma Aldrich) was prepared with 100â€‰mM PBS as the buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before completing the total volume of the enzyme solution, a certain volume of a 0.1â€‰mM biotin solution was added to get a ratio of 4:1 enzymes:biotin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biotin linker used was 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for targeting the cysteine residues in urease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mixture was reacted for 2â€‰h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dialysis of the final solution was carried out at 4,500â€‰r.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  for 5â€‰min, followed by multiple washes with 10â€‰mM PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solution obtained at the end was diluted and stored at 4â€‰Â°C until needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Another step involved the biotinylation of Au arrays for the enzyme immobilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biotinylation of the Au arrays was achieved by following a procedure reported previously30, (through the formation of a self-assembled monolayer using a biotin-thiol linker).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the preparation of the linker, a sulfhydryl-reactive biotinylating agent, Biotin HPDP (Apexbio), was reacted with a phosphine compound to form a thiol end group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, Biotin HPDP (1â€‰mg per 2 array assemblies) was dissolved in dimethyl formamide (0.13â€‰mg/ml) through sonication for 3â€‰minutes at 45â€‰Â°C, and tri-butylphosphine solution (Sigma) (5â€‰l per mg of biotin) was added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction mixture was allowed to react for 30â€‰mins at 45â€‰Â°C, after which it was dissolved in a solvent mixture of 1:1 H2O:Ethanol (8â€‰ml of solution per mg of biotin).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was the soaking solution for the Au arrays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The arrays were then incubated overnight at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After incubation, the arrays were washed several times with deionized water, followed by 10â€‰mM PBS buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The self-assembled monolayer-modified surfaces were then incubated in a streptavidin solution (9â€‰M in 10â€‰mM PBS) for 3â€‰h, after which the surfaces were washed with 10â€‰mM PBS buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incubation of streptavidin-containing surfaces with enzyme-biotin solution was performed for 34â€‰h before the experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enzyme-functionalized surfaces were thoroughly washed with 10â€‰mM PBS to remove any unbound enzyme molecules from the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the case of the urease pump experiments, secure-seal hybridization chambers were used to create a closed system on top of the urease-immobilized arrays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

1â€‰mm) was placed perpendicularly to the micropump array pattern on the glass slide, at a distance of 1â€‰mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that the gel varies in exact shape, size and location between experiments, which prevents the calculation of standard deviations between experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The whole system (gel and micropump array pattern) was covered with a secure-seal hybridization chamber (Electron Microscopy Sciences) with dimensions of 20â€‰mm diameter and 1.3â€‰mm height to establish a closed system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Care was taken to not damage the gel.

580â€‰nm and emission of 605â€‰nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To measure fluid-pumping velocity in each experiment, 30 tracer particles were tracked using the Tracker software (Cabrillo College).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Once the system was closed by the hybridization chamber seal and the tracer solution was introduced, observation of the system began after 5â€‰min of equilibration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A microscope with optical and fluorescence capabilities was used to view the system, using a Ã— 10 objective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Videos were recorded for a minute at 8â€‰f.p.s., using an NIS-Elements camera, at
