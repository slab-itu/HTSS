Pentlandite rocks as sustainable and stable efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen generation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The need for sustainable catalysts for an efficient hydrogen evolution reaction is of significant interest for modern society.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inspired by comparable structural properties of FeNi-hydrogenase, here we present the natural ore pentlandite (Fe4.5Ni4.5S8) as a direct rock electrode material for hydrogen evolution under acidic conditions with an overpotential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it reaches a value as low as 190 mV after 96 h of electrolysis due to surface sulfur depletion, which may change the electronic structure of the catalytically active nickeliron centres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rock material shows an unexpected catalytic activity with comparable overpotential and Tafel slope to some well-developed metallic or nanostructured catalysts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the rock material offers high current densities (650 mA cm2) without any loss in activity for approximately 170 h. The superior hydrogen evolution performance of pentlandites as rock electrode labels this ore as a promising electrocatalyst for future hydrogen-based economy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The increasing global need of energy marks the finding of alternative and storable energy sources an important enterprise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this view, hydrogen is of particular interest since it combines the possibility to efficiently store energy, possesses the highest-energy density of common fuels and reveals a sustainable combustion process1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, platinum and its alloys play a dominant role in the H2 evolution reaction (HER) and allow production of H2 at low overpotentials with fast reaction rates and high current densities in acidic electrolytes2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The actual price and low natural abundance, however, render platinum a dinosaur in a future sustainable hydrogen economy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the numerous suggested non-noble metal HER catalysts, nanostructured transition metal dichalcogenides are promising candidates for this reaction3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The establishment of MS2-based HER electrocatalysts, however, with satisfactory stability and activity yet remains elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, nanostructured transition metal chalcogenides, for example, NiSe2 nanofibres7, MoS2/CoSe2 hybrid catalysts8, Ni3S2 nanosheets9 and FeS2 nanostructures10, induced a high HER activity in such materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An improved performance has been observed when these materials were anchored to graphene5,11,12,13,14,15, Ni/NiO (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16) or gold surfaces17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation also reveals a significant problem of non-noble metalstheir intrinsically low electrical conductivity compared with noble metal HER electrocatalysts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, ultrathin metallic FeNi sulfide nanosheets with unknown composition showed significantly improved HER activity18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This material was operated as a HER electrocatalyst with a low overpotential (117 mV) at current densities of 10 mA cm2 for 200 h without any loss in activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this material is very effective, the need for specific surface shapes and the concomitant synthetic procedures required render those materials non-economical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Contrary to such systems, nature utilizes highly efficient machineries to generate H2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enzymes such as the FeNi- as well as the FeFe-hydrogenase comprising Ni- and Fe-sulfide containing active sites are well known for their capability to reduce protons to H2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, electrons are provided to the bimetallic active sites by closely neighbored 4Fe4S clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The property to combine a highly conductive backbone with a well-defined bimetallic catalytic center rather than well-defined nanoparticles, therefore, seems to be a key towards a sustainable and endurable HER catalyst.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A material that combines all of those properties is the ore pentlandite, which has the composition Ni4.5Fe4.5S8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pentlandites show high electronic conductivity and possess Fe- and Ni-centres bridged by sulfur (Fig 1a)20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The special assembly of iron, nickel and sulfur, comprising short intermetallic distances (2.51 Å) closely resembles structural features of both the active site of the FeNi-hydrogenase (dNiFe=2.573 Å)22 and FeFe-hydrogenase (dFeFe=2.566 Å)23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A striking advantage is that these minerals are a main source for the production of nickel24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, they can be hauled from natural deposits at low cost and used without major processing if sufficiently pure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Structural comparison of penlandite with hydrogenases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Crystal structure of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nickel and iron sites (brown) share the same positions within the crystal and are bridged by sulfur (yellow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Active site of the FeNi-hydrogenase (PDB: 4U9H) as well as (c) FeFe-hydrogenase (X=NH, PDB: 1HFE).Full size image', 'Herein, we report on the application of pentlandite as electrocatalyst for the HER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that this material can be used as rock-electrodes without the need of further surface modifications and they provide high activity and stability at low overpotential for the generation of hydrogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the help of density functional theory calculations, we show a plausible pathway for the formation of H2 on the catalyst surface.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Synthesis and characterization', 'The natural pentlandite ore contains considerable amounts of silicates in the structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, for better comparison we synthesized Ni4.5Fe4.5S8 from the elements by means of solid-state synthesis at 1,100 °C for 10 h (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Powder X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoemission spectroscopic (XPS) measurements were performed to analyse the quality and composition of both materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the natural pentlandite showed several reflections besides the main pentlandite phase, the synthetic Ni4.5Fe4.5S8 revealed high purity20 without the commonly observed monosulfide solid solution phases (Fig 2a)25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, Mössbauer spectroscopy confirmed the presence of similar iron sites in both materials (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The synthetic material reveals two distinct different iron sites with isomeric shifts of 0.13 (±0.02) and 0.50 (±0.02) mm s1 as well as quadrupole couplings of 0.12 (±0.02) and 0.13 (±0.02), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is in good agreement with literature reports and structural findings showing two different iron sites26.

'The chemical composition of the natural ore is obviously different from the synthetic material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis confirmed the different overall surface composition of both materials (Supplementary Figs 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas synthetic pentlandites showed an ideal iron to nickel to sulfur ratio of 1:1:2.25, the natural mineral revealed only negligible small amounts of nickel and contained a significant amount of silicates (Supplementary Figs 1 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phase is also visible in scanning electron micrographs (SEMs) and is absent in synthetic Ni4.5Fe4.5S8 (Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, no appreciable periodical surface features were observed in either case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  XPS spectra show that both Fe and Ni in the surface appear severely oxidized in pristine samples (Supplementary Figs 4 and 5; Supplementary Note 1), reflecting the presence of metal oxide species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peaks at 706.5 and 852.7 eV can be attributed to metallic states that are in good agreement with values reported for NiS2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27) and FeS2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28) compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results display the oxidation states of iron and nickel in the synthetic material to be 0 as well as III with the relative ratios provided in Supplementary Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The metallic character of pentlandite as well as the close structural resemblance with the hydrogenases active sites inspired us to apply the pentlandite rock material as an electrode material for the HER reaction without further surface modification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Electrochemical hydrogen evolution', 'Electrodes for HER were subsequently prepared from the bulk materials by directly connecting the solid materials with a copper wire surrounded by a Teflon tube using epoxide glue (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Electrochemical HER measurements of as-prepared rock

(10 mA cm2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This poor HER activity of natural pentlandite rock is most likely attributed to the low conductivity of the material due to the presence of large amounts of Si- and Mg-containing phases incorporated into the ore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to natural pentlandites, synthetic pentlandite rock electrodes with a defined Ni4.5Fe4.5S8 composition revealed a substantially improved electrocatalytic activity at low overpotentials of 280 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, compared with NiS2, FeS2 and MoS2 nanomaterials applied as reference materials within this study, synthetic pentlandite rock electrodes reveal a superior performance as evidenced from the voltammograms (Fig 3a; Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The essentially higher HER activity of the synthetic pentlandite may be attributed to a larger number of exposed active sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hence determined the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of NiS2, FeS2, MoS2, the natural and the synthetic pentlandite from the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) of the catalysts using cyclic voltammetry (Fig 3b; Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The linear slope of the capacitive current as a function of scan rate (Fig 3c) is equivalent to twice of the double-layer capacitance and represented as ECSA18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the ECSA of the synthetic pentlandite is significantly larger than that of the other materials tested and suggests an increased HER activity of the synthetic pentlandite with a large number of exposed surface sites (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The influence of surface structure', 'We subsequently focused on the synthetic pentlandites as an idealized mineral.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas effective non-noble metal-based HER catalysts require nanostructured particles mounted on a conductive electrode9,18 pentlandites do not require any artificial nanostructuring or grafting to achieve high HER activities at low overpotentials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to bulk materials, the high surface area of a nanoscaled material is considered to have an impact on the interaction with the surrounding electrolyte and the observed improved catalytic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, understanding the interactions occurring at electrode/electrolyte interfaces at the atomic level is considered to be of utmost importance for the design of effective electrocatalysts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mere fact that the herein reported pentlandites reveal such high HER activity at low potentials indicates that besides a high surface area commonly arising from nanostructuring additional factors need to be addressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, neither measurement with exfoliated nor ball-milled nanosized pentlandite samples revealed any improved electrocatalytic behaviour (Supplementary Figs 9 and 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'HER reaction kinetics', 'Elementary reaction steps on the electrode surface are a key factor to understand the materials performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand such steps involved in the HER kinetics, we analysed the Tafel plots (= log j+log j0, overpotential , current density j, Tafel slope  and exchange current density j0) that allow for an initial mechanistic hypothesis (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, HER mechanisms can involve the following three steps29', '', '', '', 'For Pt nanopowder the Tafel slope is 29 mV dec1, which is close to the theoretical value (b=2.3 RT/2F) and can be assigned to a HER mechanism including Volmer and Tafel steps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recombination step (equation (3)) was shown to be the rate-limiting step at low overpotentials, where the chemisorption of hydrogen by the metal is not favoured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For MoS2 nanosheets, a Tafel slope of 95 mV dec1 gives rise to a Volmer- and Heyrovsky-based mechanism with electrochemical desorption of hydrogen as the rate-limiting step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to MoS2 nanosheets, the synthetic Ni4.5Fe4.5S8 rocks exhibit a Tafel slope of 72 mV dec1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tafel slopes of 6070 mV dec1 can be assigned to a fast Volmer-type discharge reaction (equation (1)), followed by a rate-limiting recombination step (equation (3)), where the chemisorption of hydrogen from aqueous solutions at the electrode surface only requires small activation energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the rate-determining process, the adsorbed H atoms migrate over the electrode surface to interact with other adsorbed H atoms to form molecular hydrogen29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Impedance measurements', 'We assumed the resistance of the electrocatalyst to be responsible for the surprisingly high activity of the synthetic pentlandite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore performed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to characterize the interfacial electrode kinetics and resistance of the material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 4a shows the Nyquist plots of natural (black curve) and Ni4.5Fe4.5S8 pentlandite rocks (red curve) at an applied overpotential of 300 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The impedance data were fitted to an equivalent circuit (Fig 4a), employing a constant phase element to determine the charge-transfer resistance Rct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data reveal a significantly lower charge-transfer resistance (Rct, 57.2 ) of the Ni4.5Fe4.5S8 bulk electrode as compared with the natural pentlandite (1.05 k), MoS2 nanosheets (412.4 ), NiS2 (213.2 ) as well as FeS2 (374.6 ) nanoparticles (Supplementary Fig 11), revealing a faster electron transfer and a higher Faradaic efficiency during HER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe that the high HER activity stems from synergetic effects between the bi-transition metals and sulfur sites resulting in a high conductivity as well as the right surface assembly of the catalytic sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with XPS data from sputtered pentlandite, revealing a higher metallic character on cleaning of the electrode surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Impedance spectroscopy and durability testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The increase in the H2 gas concentration was quantitatively monitored by gas chromatography with a thermal conductivity detector (GC-TCD) during the first 4 h giving rise to 2.14 mmol h1 cm2 of H2 (inset of Fig 4c) produced during electrolysis at Ni4.5Fe4.5S8 rocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This amount of H2 is surprising and comparable to that of Pt-based electrolysers that were shown to afford 11 mmol h1 cm2 at a constant potential of 1.2 V (versus RHE) with a Faradaic efficiency of 94% (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar values for non-noble metal HER catalysts were never observed for any rock-like bulk compound before.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas chronoamperometric experiments at a current density of 10 mA cm2 revealed a constant potential over time, the performed electrolysis at 0.6 V overpotential versus RHE showed an unexpected phenomenon (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, with time, the current density increases and a constant current was only observed after 48 h. This indicates that the electrode surface can be activated under reductive conditions at more negative potentials leading concomitantly to higher HER activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This activation could, in principle, further lead to a downshift of the onset potential for the HER reaction and is evidenced from the linear sweep voltammograms (Fig 4d; Supplementary Fig 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, H2 formation occurs with overpotentials of only 190 mV at 10 mA cm2 current density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A likely explanation for this phenomenon is the depletion of surface sulfur from the material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Pt oxidation and subsequent deposition at the working electrode was reported to show a similar behaviour31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To clarify this hypothesis, we performed analogous electrochemical experiments applying a glassy carbon counter electrode (Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to our observations with the Pt counter electrode, a decrease of the overpotential for HER (Supplementary Fig 13) as well as an increase of activity was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation clearly confirms that the activation is not a result from a deposition of Pt on the working electrode and more likely stems from depletion of surface sulfur from the catalyst, thus, affording more exposed nickeliron surface sites21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the activation process, the surface structure and overall composition of the electrode remained unaltered (Supplementary Figs 14 and 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore investigated S 2p core-level XPS spectra of the electrode before and after electrolysis (Fig 4e; Supplementary Fig 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to pentlandite electrodes before electrolysis, the activated sample solely showed sulfur 2p doublets at the lower binding energies of 161.3 and 162.5 eV attributable to the S2 ion (Fig 4e) and the amount of disulfide-type sulfur (S22) was significantly decreased resulting in sulfur vacancies on the catalyst surface32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a behaviour inevitably promotes the reactivity of the exposed NiFe sites and thus the HER performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along this line, treatment with additional sulfides thus can be expected to reverse the activation of the electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hence investigated the activated electrodes in H2S saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 solutions for HER (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The onset potential shifts by 30 mV to more negative potentials suggesting occupation of S vacancies and further supporting the reversible activation by S depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Hydrogen quantification and alternative proton sources', 'In addition, the Faradaic efficiency () of the Ni4.5Fe4.5S8 rock electrode was determined for the first 4 h to be 91±5% confirming the high activity of the electrode material to efficiently catalyse the HER reaction in 0.5 M H2SO4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we investigated the influence of the pH value on the turnover frequency from the slope of the Clark electrode signal during the first hour of the catalytic HER at different pH values and normalized to the amount of H2 quantified by gas chromatography measurements (Supplementary Fig 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the high activity is not restricted to sulfuric acid solutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different tests with strong acids such as HCl, HNO3, HBr, as well as H3PO4 revealed H2 evolution at comparable overpotentials and current densities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, acetic acid as well as citric acid were tested as potential proton sources and allowed for moderate H2 generation, which is expected due to their lower pKa value and the subsequent lower ionic strength (Supplementary Fig 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Commonly noble metal catalysts are severely poisoned by sulfur-containing species present in waste acidic materials33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hence simulated sulfur-poisoning conditions by performing proton reduction in H2S atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of H2S did not affect the catalytic H2 evolution notably.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We noticed that although revealing a smaller activity, H2S can be directly utilized as a proton source for H2 evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is only limited by its low solubility (0.2 M in H2O) and acidity (pKa=7;
