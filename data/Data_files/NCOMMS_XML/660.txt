Somatic increase of CCT8 mimics proteostasis of human pluripotent stem cells and extends C. elegans lifespan  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Human embryonic stem cells can replicate indefinitely while maintaining their undifferentiated state and, therefore, are immortal in culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This capacity may demand avoidance of any imbalance in protein homeostasis (proteostasis) that would otherwise compromise stem cell identity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that human pluripotent stem cells exhibit enhanced assembly of the TRiC/CCT complex, a chaperonin that facilitates the folding of 10% of the proteome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that ectopic expression of a single subunit (CCT8) is sufficient to increase TRiC/CCT assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, increased TRiC/CCT complex is required to avoid aggregation of mutant Huntingtin protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further show that increased expression of CCT8 in somatic tissues extends Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan in a TRiC/CCT-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ectopic expression of CCT8 also ameliorates the age-associated demise of proteostasis and corrects proteostatic deficiencies in worm models of Huntingtons disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest proteostasis is a common principle that links organismal longevity with hESC immortality.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The survival of an organism is linked to its ability to maintain the integrity of the cellular proteome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxidative or thermal stress, misfolding-prone mutations and aging challenge the structure of proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Damaged proteins form toxic aggregates and disrupt cellular membranes, overwhelming the cellular machinery required for their degradation and causing cell malfunction and death1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quality of the proteome is controlled by proteostasis, a complex network of competing and integrated cellular pathways that regulate the synthesis, folding, aggregation, trafficking, interaction and degradation of proteins2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With age, post-mitotic cells lose extensive control of proteostasis: widespread, aberrant changes in translation, a generalized downregulation of chaperones and a loss of function in protein degradation machineries often appear in differentiated cells across time3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This demise in proteostasis is considered one of the hallmarks of aging and contributes to the functional loss characteristic of old organisms2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteostasis dysfunction is associated with multiple age-related disorders such as Huntingtons disease (HD), Alzheimers or Parkinsons disease2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, preservation or enhancement of proteostasis surveillance systems until late in life improves resistance to proteotoxic stress and slows down the aging process4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) demonstrate a striking capacity to proliferate indefinitely while maintaining their pluripotency6a capacity that necessarily demands avoidance of any imbalance in proteostasis that would otherwise compromise their function and immortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, ESCs require high global translational rates to maintain their pluripotency7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations raise an intriguing question: how do ESCs maintain the quality of their proteome under enhanced protein synthesis and proliferation rates?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we hypothesize that ESCs can provide a novel paradigm to study proteostasis and its demise with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human ESCs (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) exhibit high proteasome activity compared with their differentiated counterparts8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, pluripotent stem cells are remarkably more sensitive (100 × ) to proteasome inhibitors than progenitor or terminally differentiated cells8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased proteasome activity of human pluripotent stem cells is induced by enhanced levels of the proteasome subunit PSMD11/RPN-6 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, RPN-6 overexpression (OE) in somatic tissues is sufficient to induce proteotoxic resistance and extend healtshpan in the organismal model Caenorhabditis elegans10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides increased proteasome activity, we hypothesize that other proteostasis components are also enhanced in hESCs/iPSCs to maintain their pluripotency and immortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we focused on the chaperome network, a key node of proteostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The human chaperome is formed by 332 chaperones and co-chaperones that regulate the folding and function of proteins11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The binding of chaperones to nascent proteins assists their folding into the correct structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, chaperones assure the proper folding and cellular localization of proteins throughout their life cycle12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene expression analysis of human brain aging shows a striking repression of 32% of the chaperome, including ATP-dependent chaperone machines such as cytosolic HSP90, HSP70 family members (for example, HSPA8 and HSPA14) and subunits of the T-complex protein-1 ring complex/chaperonin containing TCP1 (TRiC/CCT) complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, 19.5% of the chaperome is induced during human brain aging11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, these repression and induction are enhanced in the brains of those with HD, Alzheimers or Parkinsons disease compared with their age-matched controls11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, knockdown of specific chaperome components that are repressed during aging such as CCT subunits, HSPA14 or HSPA8 induces proteotoxicity in HD C. elegans and mammalian cell models11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, defining differences in the levels and regulation of chaperone machines between immortal hESCs and their differentiated counterparts could be of central importance not only for understanding hESC identity but also the aging process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we show that human pluripotent stem cells exhibit increased assembly of the chaperonin TRiC/CCT complex, a mechanism induced by high levels of specific CCT subunits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By studying proteostasis of pluripotent stem cells, we find that CCT8 is sufficient to increase TRiC/CCT assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, enhanced TRiC/CCT assembly is required for the striking ability of pluripotent stem cells to maintain proteostasis of aggregation-prone huntingtin (HTT), the mutant protein underlying HD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that the differentiation process correlates with a decline in the expression of CCT subunits and TRiC/CCT assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the levels of CCT subunits are further decreased in somatic tissues during organismal aging11, we examined whether modulation of CCT8 can delay the aging process and proteostasis dysfunction by using C. elegans as a model organism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, upregulation of CCT8 levels in somatic tissues triggers TRiC/CCT assembly and extends organismal lifespan particularly under proteotoxic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we define CCT8 as a key modulator of TRiC/CCT assembly and establish a link between TRiC/CCT chaperonin, hESC identity and youthfulness.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'CCT subunits decrease during hESC differentiation', 'To examine changes in the chaperome network during differentiation, we performed quantitative analysis of both the transcriptome and proteome comparing hESCs with their neural progenitor cell (NPC) and neuronal counterparts (Supplementary Figs 1 and 2 and Supplementary Data 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our transcriptome analysis, we identified 279 chaperome components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among them, 119 genes were downregulated and 44 genes were upregulated during differentiation into NPCs (Supplementary Fig 1 and Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the protein level, we found that 36 out of 122 identified chaperome components decrease during differentiation into NPCs (Supplementary Fig 2 and Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, 27 chaperome components were increased during neural differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the 44 chaperome components decreased in terminally differentiated neurons compared with hESCs, 28 proteins were already downregulated during differentiation into NPCs (Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Notably, several subunits of the chaperonin TRiC/CCT complex decreased at both transcript and protein levels during neural differentiation of hESCs (Supplementary Fig 3 and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TRiC/CCT is required for cell viability as a key component of the proteostasis network that facilitates the folding of 10% of the eukaryotic proteome13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TRiC/CCT not only assists the folding of newly synthesized proteins15 but also binds to misfolded proteins regulating their aggregation16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In eukaryotes, the hetero-oligomeric TRiC/CCT complex consists of two stacked rings of eight paralogous subunits each17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our quantitative proteomics assay, we found that CCT3, CCT4 and CCT8 subunits are significantly increased in hESC compared with NPCs (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed these results by western blot analysis and found that other subunits also decrease during neural and neuronal differentiation (that is, CCT2, CCT6A and CCT7; Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decrease in the protein amount of CCT subunits correlated with a reduction of the mRNA levels during differentiation (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This downregulation of CCT subunits was not a specific phenomenon associated with the neural lineage as differentiation into either endoderm or mesoderm induced a similar decrease (Fig 1cf).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because hESC lines can vary in their characteristics, we differentiated a distinct hESC line as well as two iPSC lines, and obtained similar results (Supplementary Figs 4 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the ability of pluripotent stem cells to self-renew indefinitely while maintaining their undifferentiated state6, the expression of CCT subunits and pluripotency markers did not decline with passage (Fig 1g,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our results indicate that human pluripotent stem cells are able to maintain enhanced expression of CCT subunits under unlimited proliferation in their undifferentiated state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the levels of subunits such as CCT8 or CCT2 decrease when hESCs/iPSCs differentiate into distinct cell lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, increased levels of CCT subunits could be an intrinsic characteristic of human pluripotent stem cells linked to their immortality and identity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: The expression of CCT subunits decreases during differentiation.

expression of CCT8 induces TRiC/CCT assembly', 'Prompted by these findings, we asked whether increased levels of CCT subunits resulted into more assembled TRiC/CCT complexes in human pluripotent stem cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although both hESCs and NPCs have similar levels of total CCT1 subunits (Figs 1a and 2a, Supplementary Fig 4 and Supplementary Table 1), hESCs lines exhibited a dramatic increase in the assembly of TRiC/CCT in the form of two stacked rings (Fig 2a and Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, iPSCs also had increased TRiC/CCT assembly compared with differentiated cells (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since all the subunits are required for TRiC/CCT function18, downregulated CCT subunits could become structural limiting factors during differentiation and modulate the decrease of TRiC/CCT assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An intriguing possibility is that specific subunits can also function as assembly activators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparison between the levels (relative to CCT1) of the different subunits in hESCs and NPCs showed that CCT8 is the most abundant subunit in both cell types despite decreasing during differentiation (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicate that CCT8 is not stoichiometric limiting for TRiC/CCT assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we asked whether an increase in the total protein levels of CCT8 could trigger TRiC/CCT assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, ectopic expression of CCT8 induced an increase in TRiC/CCT assembly whereas the total protein levels of CCT1 remained similar (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, we found a decrease in the levels of CCT1 in its monomeric form on CCT8 OE (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our results suggest that human pluripotent stem cells have an intrinsic proteostasis network characterized by high levels of TRiC/CCT complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the levels of several CCT subunits decrease during differentiation resulting in diminished assembly of TRiC/CCT chaperonin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we identified CCT8 as a potential activator of TRiC/CCT assembly by using hESCs/iPSCs as a model to study proteostasis.

whether increased levels of CCT8 contribute to maintain pluripotency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that TRiC/CCT is essential for cell viability13, loss of CCT subunits induced cell death and detachment of hESCs (Supplementary Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid these effects, we induced a mild knockdown of 3050% (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, downregulation of CCT8 resulted in decreased levels of pluripotency markers (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that high CCT8 expression impinges on hESC function via enhanced assembly of TRiC/CCT complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since mutation or loss of a single subunit is sufficient to impair the activity of the complex18, we knocked down other subunits (that is, CCT2, CCT6A and CCT7) to determine whether increased TRiC/CCT is required for hESC function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with CCT8 knockdown, decreased levels of other subunits affected the expression of pluripotency markers (Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed these experiments in an independent hESC line as well as two iPSC lines and obtained similar results (Supplementary Fig 6bd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, loss of CCT levels induced the expression of markers of the distinct germ layers (Fig 3c and Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since we observed an upregulation in specific markers of the three germ layers (Fig 3c and Supplementary Fig 7), our data suggest that hESCs/iPSCs undergo a decline of pluripotency on knockdown of CCT subunits but they do not differentiate into a particular cell lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we cannot discard a role of free

proteins16, we asked whether this chaperonin is required for increased proteostasis of pluripotent stem cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine this hypothesis, we used iPSCs derived from HD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HD is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a CAG triplet repeat region in the huntingtin gene (HTT), which translates into a polyglutamine stretch (polyQ) in the protein resulting in proteotoxicity and aggregation19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In its wild-type form, HTT contains 635 glutamine residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in individuals affected by HD, it contains  greater than 35 glutamine residues and longer repeats predict younger disease onset19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we used three different control iPSC lines and HD-iPSCs from four donors with different allelic series (that is, polyQ57, polyQ60, polyQ71 and polyQ180).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These HD-iPSC lines possess one mutant copy of huntingtin gene but also one normal allele (Fig 4a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the levels of mutant HTT were lower compared with the normal protein, HD-iPSCs exhibited significant amounts of mutant polyQ-expanded HTT protein (Fig 4a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In iPSCs that express longer CAG repeat expansions (polyQ180), the differences between the levels of mutant and normal HTT were more dramatic (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, we confirmed the expression of mutant HTT in these iPSCs by using an antibody that detects remarkably better polyQ-expanded HTT than wild-type HTT (refs 20, 21; Fig 4b,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the aggregation of mutant HTT in HD-iPSCs, we performed filter trap analysis that allows for quantification of polyQ aggregates10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although HD-iPSCs expressed significant levels of polyQ-expanded HTT, these cells did not exhibit accumulation of detectable polyQ aggregates compared with control iPSCs as assessed by both filter trap and immunohistochemistry analyses (Fig 4c,e and Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In HD organismal models and mammalian cells, the inhibition of HSP90 induces heat-shock response (HSR) and reduces polyQ-expanded protein aggregation22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the treatment with an inhibitor of HSP90 did not further decrease the signal observed in HD-iPSCs by filter trap, reinforcing that these cells do not accumulate detectable aggregates of mutant HTT (Supplementary Fig 8a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a collapse in proteostasis induced by proteasome inhibition triggered the accumulation of polyQ aggregates in HD-iPSCs (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23;

and death occurs in many brain regions in HD, but striatal neurons expressing cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP32) undergo the greatest neurodegeneration27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HD-iPSCs can be terminally differentiated into neurons (including DARPP32-positive cells) that exhibit HD-associated phenotypes such as cumulative risk of death over time and increased vulnerability to excitotoxic stressors20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, proteotoxicity induced via autophagy inhibition or oxidative stress results in higher neurodegeneration of HD cells compared with controls20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these phenotypes, mutant HTT-expressing neurons present important limitations for disease modelling such as lack of robust neurodegeneration, polyQ aggregates and gene expression changes resembling HD (refs 20, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the efforts to detect polyQ aggregates under different conditions (for example, adding cellular stressors), the presence of inclusions has not been observed in neurons derived from HD-iPSCs (refs 20, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of inclusions in these cells could reflect the long period of time before aggregates accumulate in HD (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, HD human neurons do not accumulate detectable polyQ aggregates at 12 weeks after transplantation into HD rat models whereas these inclusions are observed after 33 weeks of transplantation23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess whether loss of CCT subunits triggers neurodegeneration and polyQ aggregation in these cells, we differentiated three HD-iPSC lines (Q57, Q71 and Q180) into striatal neurons28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among those cells expressing the neuronal marker MAP2, 50% also expressed DARPP32 (Supplementary Fig 11a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with proteasome inhibitor treatment, we could not detect polyQ aggregates in mutant HTT-expressing neurons on knockdown of different CCT subunits (that is, CCT2, CCT6, CCT7 and CCT8) by either immunohistochemistry (Supplementary Fig 11b) or filter trap (Supplementary Fig 11c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, knockdown of CCTs resulted in increased cell death of HD neuronal cultures as assessed by activation of caspase-3 whereas it did not induce neurodegeneration of control cells (Supplementary Fig 11d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, proteasome inhibition triggered cell death at the same extent in both control and HD neurons (Supplementary Fig 11d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that mutant HTT-expressing neurons are more susceptible to TRiC/CCT dysfunction than controls, providing a link between downregulation of CCTs with onset of neurodegeneration in HD during aging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Somatic overexpression of CCT8 extends organismal lifespan', 'Our results indicate that

somatic post-mitotic cells could have a positive role in longevity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the impact of TRiC/CCT on organismal aging and proteotoxic resistance, we used the nematode C. elegans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this organism, CCT transcripts are detected in most tissues and developmental stages29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of TRiC/CCT complex in proliferating cells during C. elegans development has been extensively studied30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disruption of TRiC/CCT assembly by knockdown of different CCT subunits causes a variety of defects in cell division and results in embryonic lethality30,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These effects are partially mediated by a collapse in microtubule function as a consequence of diminished folding of tubulin by TRiC/CCT (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, loss of different cct subunits during post-embryonic developmental stages results in larval arrest, body morphology alterations as well as defects in developing gonads and sterility, indicating a key role of the TRiC/CCT complex in C. elegans development30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In adult worms, the only proliferating cells are found in the germline whereas somatic tissues are formed exclusively by post-mitotic cells33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the expression of CCTs in germ cells, we dissected the germline and intestine from adult C. elegans and compared the levels of CCT subunits by immunohistochemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that CCT1 subunit is enhanced in germ cells compared with the intestine (Supplementary Fig 12a), suggesting that CCTs are highly expressed in the germline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, knockdown of cct subunits during adulthood dramatically decreased the number of germ cells destabilizing the germline (Supplementary Fig 12b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we observed a dramatic decrease in the number of laid eggs after 1 day of cct RNA interference (RNAi) treatment during adulthood (Supplementary Fig 12c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these data suggest that high levels of TRiC/CCT complex are essential for proliferating cells and germline stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, knockdown of cct subunits during adulthood did not decrease lifespan in wild-type worms (Supplementary Fig 13 and Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To assess the expression of CCT subunits in somatic tissues of adult C. elegans, we generated a green fluorescent protein (GFP) transcriptional reporter construct for cct-8 gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we did not observe GFP expression in germ cells as a result of germline silencing of transgenes34,35, these experiments confirmed wide expression of cct-8 in somatic cells including neurons or body wall muscle cells (Supplementary Fig 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Somatic expression pattern of cct-8 resembled other cct subunits (for example, cct-1, cct-2 and cct-7) showing a high expression in pharynx and tail30,35 (Supplementary Fig 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In aging organisms, post-mitotic somatic tissues undergo a gradual deterioration and become particularly susceptible to age-associated protein aggregation diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we asked whether increasing the levels of the TRiC/CCT complex in somatic tissues could delay the aging of post-reproductive organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine this hypothesis we overexpressed CCT8, a subunit that promotes TRiC/CCT assembly in mammalian cells (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, we induced ectopic expression of cct-8 under sur-5 promoter (Fig 5a), which is expressed ubiquitously in somatic tissues but not in the germline10,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, somatic OE of cct-8 was sufficient to extend the lifespan of C. elegans under normal conditions (20 °C; Fig 5b and Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These worms exhibited up to 20% increased median lifespan compared with the control strain and other cct-overexpressing worms (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed similar results in two independent OE lines of the different cct subunits tested (Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since OE of a single cct subunit did not change the levels of other subunits, the longevity phenotype can be attributed specifically to cct-8 (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the lifespan extension induced by ectopic expression of cct-8 was more dramatic at 25 °C, a condition that results in mild heat stress (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under this temperature, cct-8(OE) C. elegans lived up to 40% longer than the control strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of cct-2 also increased lifespan significantly at 25 °C, although to a lesser extent than cct-8 (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since heat stress challenges the structure of proteins and triggers the accumulation of misfolded proteins, our results indicate that both cct-8 and cct-2 extend longevity by sustaining the integrity of the proteome during adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Somatic

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our findings establish enhanced assembly of the TRiC/CCT complex as an intrinsic characteristic of pluripotent stem cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increased assembly correlates with an upregulation of several CCT subunits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, human pluripotent stem cells are able to maintain high expression of CCT subunits during unlimited proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, pluripotent stem cells lose their high levels of CCT subunits on differentiation and this decline is already significant in multipotent cells (for example, NPCs) before terminal differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, enhanced TRiC/CCT assembly could be linked to the immortal and pluripotent characteristics of hESCs/iPSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we found that slight dysfunctions of the TRiC/CCT complex induce a decrease in pluripotency markers and, concomitantly, an increase in differentiation markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Defining the mechanisms by which increased TRiC/CCT regulates hESC/iPSC identity could open a new door to a better understanding of pluripotency and differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the exact mechanisms are still unknown, the TRiC/CCT complex could impinge on hESC/iPSC function in several (and non-exclusive) manners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TRiC/CCT assists the folding of a significant percentage of nascent proteins such as actin and tubulin14,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, one possibility is that enhanced TRiC/CCT assembly is required for the proper folding of specific regulatory or structural proteins involved either in maintenance of hESC/iPSC identity or generation of healthy differentiated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, a study performed in calreticulin/ mouse ESCs showed a downregulation in the expression of Cct2, Cct3 and Cct7 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  42) in these cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calreticulin, a chaperone that binds to misfolded proteins preventing their export from the endoplasmic reticulum, is essential for cardiac development in mice43 and required for proper myofibril formation during cardiomyocyte differentiation of mouse ESCs in vitro44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the TRiC/CCT complex regulates folding and actin dynamics, the downregulation of Cct subunits in calreticulin/ mouse ESCs could forecast the myofibrillar disarray observed in their cardiomyocytes counterparts42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As TRiC/CCT also regulates the aggregation of misfolded and damaged proteins, increased TRiC/CCT levels could be linked to the biological purpose of pluripotent stem cells and their intrinsic properties such as high global protein synthesis rates and immortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the ability of hESCs to replicate indefinitely and generate every other cell type in the body, the TRiC/CCT complex could be a key quality control mechanism to maintain a global intact proteome for either self-renewal or the generation of progenitor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, the accumulation of damaged and misfolded proteins caused by proteostasis defects may affect hESC/iPSC function and immortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the asymmetric divisions invoked by these cells, the passage of damaged proteins to progenitor cells could also compromise development and organismal aging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this hypothesis, we found that the TRiC/CCT complex determines the ability of pluripotent stem cells to maintain proteostasis of mutant huntingtin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Another important question is how pluripotent stem cells achieve their high TRiC/CCT levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, specific subunits such as CCT4 are relatively more abundant compared to CCT1 in hESCs whereas this proportion is reversed in NPCs (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, these subunits could become limiting assembly factors during differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite decreasing during neural differentiation, other CCT subunits (that is, CCT8 and CCT2) were more abundant relatively to the rest of subunits in both hESCs and NPCs suggesting that they could be activators of TRiC/CCT assembly rather than limiting factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, increasing the expression of CCT8, the most abundant subunit, triggers TRiC/CCT assembly regardless the levels of other subunits such as CCT1 in both mammalian cells and C. elegans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies will be required to understand how CCT8 promotes TRiC/CCT assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A fascinating hypothesis is that CCT8 could act as a scaffold protein that triggers the interaction between the different subunits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our findings in human pluripotent stem cells led us to identify CCT8 as a powerful candidate to sustain proteostasis during organismal aging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The somatic induction of TRiC/CCT assembly via CCT8 OE extends lifespan and protects from proteotoxic stress in C. elegans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, somatic CCT8 OE can partially protect this nematode from knockdown of hsf-1, a transcription factor that coordinates cellular protein-misfolding responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precise mechanism by which the TRiC/CCT complex ameliorates the detrimental effects triggered by loss HSF1 is not yet understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In response to proteotoxic stress, HSF1 binds heat-shock elements in the promoters of target genes and triggers their expression45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mammalian cells, all the CCT subunits contain heat-shock elements and are transcriptionally activated by HSF1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, ectopic expression of CCT8 could ameliorate the effects induced by a decrease of CCT subunits on HSF1 knockdown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a direct regulatory interaction between TRiC/CCT activity and induction of proteotoxic stress response by HSF1 has been recently reported47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HSF1A, a chemical activator of HSF1, binds to the TRiC/CCT complex and inhibits its folding activity47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the inactivation of TRiC/CCT complex by HSF1A or its depletion by loss of CCT subunits induce HSF1 activity47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since TRiC/CCT chaperonin interacts with HSF1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  47), TRiC/CCT could have a direct repressor role in regulating HSF1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a decrease in TRiC/CCT activity mediated by either HSF1A or knockdown of CCT subunits can also lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins that trigger the HSF1-induced proteotoxic response47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this hypothesis, our results suggest that increased TRiC/CCT assembly induced by CCT8 reduces the accumulation of misfolded proteins and, therefore, ameliorates the deleterious impact of reduced HSF1-mediated signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'During organismal aging, loss of proteostasis in somatic tissues could contribute to the late onset of age-related diseases such as HD (refs 3, 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the decrease in the levels of several CCT subunits during human brain aging11 may induce TRiC/CCT dysfunction, proteotoxic stress and neurodegeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this hypothesis, knockdown of CCT subunits hastens aggregation of mutant HTT and worsens HD-related changes in HD models11,24,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have shown that simultaneous OE of all eight CCT subunits ameliorates polyQ-expanded HTT aggregation and neuronal death24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, OE of CCT1 remodels the morphology of HTT aggregates and reduces neurotoxicity26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although CCT1 OE does not increase TRiC/CCT assembly, this subunit modulates the interaction between HTT and TRiC/CCT complex26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since CCT8 is sufficient to increase TRiC/CCT assembly, this subunit could be a candidate to correct deficiencies in age-related diseases associated with proteostasis dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we found that OE of CCT8 can protect from the accumulation of polyQ-expanded proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, a link between CCT8 and mutant HTT expression was observed in an integrated genomics and proteomics study of knock-in HD mouse models expressing the human HTT exon1 carrying different CAG lengths (polyQ20, Q80, Q92, Q111, Q140 or Q175)49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, highly expanded-polyQ HTT exon1 (Q175) induces a significant increase of CCT8 at both transcript and protein levels in the striatum of young mice (6 months) whereas other subunits were not altered49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, CCT8 induction was not observed in knock-in mice expressing mutant HTT with lower than 175 polyQ repeats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that upregulation of CCT8 could be a compensatory mechanism to protect from polyQ aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While expression of CCT subunits decrease during both differentiation and biological aging, our results indicate that mimicking proteostasis of pluripotent stem cells by modifying either the chaperome or proteasome network8 delays the aging of somatic cells and extends organismal lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the link between sustained proteostasis in somatic cells and healthy aging, our findings raise an intriguing question: why the levels of CCT8 decrease during differentiation if this subunit could have beneficial effects on organismal longevity and proteotoxic stress resistance?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, it is important not to diminish potential detrimental effects of mimicking proteostasis of pluripotent stem cells in somatic tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, cancer cells and pluripotent stem cells not only share their immortality features but also increased proteostasis nodes such as proteasome activity and specific chaperones50,51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteasome and chaperone levels in cancer cells are consistent with the special requirements of these cells, such as elimination of aberrant proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the expression of CCT8 is increased in gliomas and hepatocellular carcinoma whereas its knockdown induces a decrease in the proliferation and invasion capacity of these cells53,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, other CCT subunits have been linked to cancer55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas proteasome inhibitors and interventions of the chaperome network have been suggested as potential strategies for anticancer therapy52,56, an abnormal activation of these mechanisms in somatic dividing cells could have the opposite effect inducing their abnormal proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, although the TRiC/CCT complex is important for the proliferation of cancer cells, this chaperonin is also required for the proper folding of p53 and, therefore, promotes tumour suppressor responses57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the TRiC/CCT complex could be an important factor to avoid misfolding of tumour suppressors and the increase incidence of cancer during the aging process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides its link with cancer, other factors could explain the decline of CCT subunits during differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of the disposable soma theory of aging58, a fascinating hypothesis is that downregulation of the TRiC/CCT complex during differentiation is part of an organismal genetic programme that ensures a healthy progeny whereas somatic tissues undergo a progressive demise in their homeostasis and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the limitation of nutrients in nature, organisms divide the available metabolic resources between reproduction and maintenance of the non-reproductive soma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evolutionary pressure has been theorized to force a re-allocation of the resources to prevent or eliminate damage to the germline and progeny, while little resources are placed on the maintenance of somatic cells58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this hypothesis, signals from the germline modulate the aging of somatic tissues and removal of the germline extends lifespan40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, our results indicate that germline-lacking worms exhibit increased levels of TRiC/CCT in post-mitotic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Collectively, we underscore the importance of defining proteostasis of pluripotent stem cells to uncover novel mechanisms of organismal healthspan extension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides CCT subunits, other chaperome components also decrease during differentiation and, therefore, could be interesting targets to be studied in the context of aging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, it will be fascinating to explore whether other
