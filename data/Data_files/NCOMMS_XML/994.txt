Controlling photophysical properties of ultrasmall conjugated polymer nanoparticles through polymer chain packing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Applications of conjugated polymer nanoparticles (Pdots) for imaging and sensing depend on their size, fluorescence brightness and intraparticle energy transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecular design of conjugated polymers (CPs) has been the main focus of the development of Pdots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate that proper control of the physical interactions between the chains is as critical as the molecular design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unique design of twisted CPs and fine-tuning of the reprecipitation conditions allow us to fabricate ultrasmall (3.04.5 nm) Pdots with excellent photostability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extensive photophysical and structural characterization reveals the essential role played by the packing of the polymer chains in the particles in the intraparticle spatial alignment of the emitting sites, which regulate the fluorescence brightness and the intraparticle energy migration efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings enhance understanding of the relationship between chain interactions and the photophysical properties of CP nanomaterials, providing a framework for designing and fabricating functional Pdots for imaging applications.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'New fluorescence microscopy methods often require fluorophores with specific spectroscopic properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The development of new fluorophores is thus increasingly important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Various types of fluorophores, including organic dyes, fluorescent proteins and semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), have been used in fluorescence microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conjugated polymer nanoparticles (Pdots) have recently emerged as a new class of fluorescent nanoparticles because their fluorescent properties can be fine-tuned by an appropriate molecular design of conjugated polymers (CPs)1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given their superior fluorescent brightness and photostability as well as low cytotoxicity, the applicability of Pdots as fluorescent tags3,4 and sensors5,6,7 has been expanding significantly during the last few years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies have demonstrated that, in some cases, the performance of Pdots as fluorescent tags surpasses that of conventional organic dyes and QDs8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Several key factors, including the fluorescence wavelength, brightness of the fluorescence and size of the particle, greatly influence the applications of Pdots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most bioimaging applications require fluorescence in far-red to near-infrared spectral region3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bright fluorescence with high photostability always provide better quality of fluorescence images1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vast majority of the previously reported Pdots were in the 10100 nm diameter range2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when the Pdots are used as fluorescent tags, they should be as small as possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Especially in clinical applications, the particle sizes should be smaller than 5.5 nm in diameter for complete elimination from the body by renal filtration2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the unique features of CP materials is their nanoscale intra- and inter-chain excitation energy transfer (EET)10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EET often causes quenching of fluorescence in CP materials at a length scale of a few nanometres up to tens of nanometres due to efficient funnelling of the excitation energy to the trap sites12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the sizes of the particles, fluorescence brightness of Pdots is highly related to EET.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, CP-based fluorescence sensing utilizes EET-mediated fluorescence quenching to enhance detection sensitivity15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, EET is one of the key factors that determines the applicability of Pdots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Single-molecule spectroscopy studies on single CP molecules and CP aggregates have demonstrated that the conformational state of the polymer chain has a significant effect on their photophysical properties11,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although those studies implied that controlling the physical interaction between the polymer chains in the particles would be important to regulating the EET process and thus controlling the fluorescence properties of Pdots, including their brightness, little is known about the impact of intraparticle chain conformation and chain interactions on the fluorescence properties of Pdots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report the fabrication of far-red-emitting ultrasmall (diameter3.04.5 nm) Pdots with high photostability (photobleaching yield1.73.3 × 1011) from an appropriate molecular design combined with proper control of the physical interactions between the polymer chains.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Fabrication of the Pdots', 'In this study, we fabricated Pdots based on a donor-acceptor-type CPs from a poly(1,8-carbazole)-benzothiadiazole copolymer (PCzBT) and a poly(1,8-carbazole)-dithienylbenzothiadiazole copolymer (PCzDTBT) (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCzBT and PCzDTBT in tetrahydrofuran (THF) exhibited broad absorption spectra with maxima at 482 and 494 nm, respectively (Fig 1c,d)18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bands are attributed to intramolecular charge-transfer (CT) absorption between donor (carbazole (Cz)) and acceptor (benzothiadiazole (BT) or dithienylbenzothiadiazole (DTBT)) moieties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike most CT-type CPs that have a linear/planar shape, our CPs have a nonplanar twisted conformation due to the steric hindrance between the monomer units19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCzBT and PCzDTBT in THF displayed fluorescence from the CT excited states with maxima at 608 and 652 nm, respectively (Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluorescence quantum yield (fl) and the mean fluorescence lifetime (fl) in THF were respectively determined to be 0.25 and 3.36 ns for PCzBT and 0.50 and 4.63 ns for PCzDTBT (Supplementary Fig 1, Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Spectroscopic properties of the fabricated Pdots.Chemical structure of (a) PCzBT and (b) PCzDTBT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Steady-state absorption (solid lines) and fluorescence (broken lines) of PCzBT in THF (black lines) and PCzBT Pdots fabricated at 277 K (PD1-L) (blue lines) and at 343 K (PD1-H) (red lines) dispersed in water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Steady-state absorption (solid lines) and fluorescence (broken lines) of PCzDTBT in THF (black lines) and PCzDTBT Pdots fabricated at 277 K (PD2-L) (blue lines) and at 343 K (PD2-H) (red lines) dispersed in water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluorescence spectra were recorded upon 510-nm excitation.Full size image', 'The Pdots were fabricated using a modified reprecipitation method (see Methods for details)20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A highly diluted THF solution of the CPs was rapidly added to excess water under vigorous ultrasonication at either 277 or 343 K, which was followed by an evaporation of THF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of Pdots obtained from PCzBT (PD1-L) and PCzDTBT (PD2-L) at 277 K (Fig 2a,f) showed that they were nearly spherical in shape with the mean diameters of 3.0 and 4.5 nm, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TEM images also demonstrated narrow size distributions of the obtained Pdots (standard deviation of 0.56 and 1.36 nm for PD1-L and PD2-L, respectively) (Fig 2e,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cryo-electron microscopy images also confirmed the 3.0-nm size of the fabricated Pdots in an aqueous environment (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ultrasmall particle sizes are likely to be due to the nonplanar shapes of PCzBT and PCzDTBT (Fig 2i, see Discussion for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PD1-L and PD2-L in water had highly negative zeta potentials of, respectively, 54 and 51 mV at neutral pH, indicating high dispersion stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The colloidal solution remained stable in the dispersion for a period of at least six months.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Size distribution of the fabricated Pdots.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of (a) PD1-L and (b) PD1-H.

see Supplementary Fig 5, Supplementary Table 1), suggesting that CP chains are densely packed in the particles (see Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence intensity trajectories obtained from single Pdots exhibited nearly constant intensities without any sign of blinking including triplet-state blinking (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is due to the presence of multiple emitters inside the particles that fluorescence independently (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The photobleaching quantum yields (bl) of PD1-L and PD2-L were estimated to be 3.3 × 1011 and 1.7 × 1011, respectively (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings demonstrate the successful fabrication of one of the smallest Pdots with the highest photostability reported so far in a reliable manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Each PCzBT and PCzDTBT chain may adopt different conformational states because of the relatively short chain lengths (on average 7.9 and 3.3 monomers, respectively), and thus may exhibit different fluorescence properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the single-chain experiments revealed the large heterogeneity in the fluorescence properties between the chains19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the single-particle experiments showed the narrow distributions of the fluorescence brightness (Supplementary Fig 4, Supplementary Table 3) and lifetime (Supplementary Fig 8, Supplementary Table 3), demonstrating the homogeneous fluorescence properties of the fabricated Pdots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is most likely due to the large number of the CP chains in each Pdot (see Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'During optimization of the fabrication protocol, we found that while the reprecipitation temperature did not affect the size and shape of the Pdots (Fig 2b,d,e,g,h), spectroscopic properties of the Pdots depend significantly on the temperature during ultrasonication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PCzBT and PCzDTBT Pdots fabricated at 343 K (PD1-H and PD2-H) exhibited smaller CT absorption (Fig 1c,d) and lower fluorescence quantum yields (fl=0.08 and 0.09, respectively) compared with the Pdots fabricated at 277 K (fl=0.16 and 0.20 for PD1-L and PD2-L, respectively) (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oscillator strength (that is, absorption intensity, f) of the CT absorption band depends on the rotational twist angle between the Cz and BT moiety (that is, smaller f with larger twist angle)19, suggesting larger twist angle between the Cz and BT moiety in PD1-H than in PD1-L.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the structural similarity of PCzBT and PCzDTBT, the difference in the absorption spectra observed in PD2-L and PD2-H can also be interpreted by twist-angle-dependent f. A drop in fl is often observed in CP aggregates including Pdots due to the generation of energy trap sites to which the excitation energy is funnelled through EET processes11,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no reduction in fl was observed in nanoparticles obtained from a dimeric form of CzBT (Supplementary Fig 9) under the same reprecipitation conditions (data not shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This excludes simple aggregation-induced fluorescence quenching as the mechanism of the reprecipitation condition-dependent fl of the Pdots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, this observation implies critical roles of the intraparticle chain conformation and chain interactions in the brightness of the fluorescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Photophysical interaction between the emitting sites', 'We next investigated the spatial orientation of the emitting sites in single Pdots using single-particle excitation polarization modulation (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PD1-L and PD2-L showed greater modulation depths (mean

to spatially well-ordered orientation of the absorption transition dipoles of the chromophores27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results, therefore, demonstrate that the emitting sites in PD1-L and PD2-L are more spatially ordered than those in PD1-H and PD2-H (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Spatial orientation of the emitting sites in the individual Pdots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic

or CP nanomaterials (such as CP aggregates) are described by either the strong electronic coupling between the subunits (that is, delocalization of excited state over multiple subunits) or weak coupling (that is, localized excited-state hops between the subunits through Förster-type dipoledipole interactions)16,28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absorption and fluorescence spectra of PCzBT in organic solvents are similar to the dimeric form of CzBT, suggesting that the delocalization of the excited state occurs in up to two monomer units (that is, the dimeric form of CzBT can be treated as the spectroscopic unit of PCzBT)19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluorescence spectrum obtained for PD1-L in water has a peak wavelength that is similar to that of PCzBT in THF (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a significant change in the fluorescence lifetime between PD1-L in water and PCzBT in THF was not observed (Supplementary Fig 1, Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The small change in the fluorescence lifetime between PD1-L in water and PCzBT in THF can be understood from the twist-angle-dependent radiative deactivation and the chain interaction-induced non-radiative deactivation (see Discussion for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large modification to the fluorescence spectrum and lifetime is expected when strong coherent coupling between the subunits occurs16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such modifications were not observed in PD1-L in water and PCzBT in THF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results, therefore, suggest that the contribution of the strong coupling between the spectroscopic units (that is, dimeric form of CzBT) is negligible in the Pdots fabricated in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We conducted single-particle photon coincidence measurements to estimate the numbers of independently fluorescing emitting sites in each Pdot (Fig 4a)16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of independent emitters is estimated from the intensity ratio of the peaks at the delay time of 0 ns (IC) to the neighbouring peaks (IL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While IC/IL=1 is expected for multichromophoric systems with large numbers of independently emitting fluorophores, smaller IC/IL values are obtained from multichromophoric systems with small numbers of independent emitters due to efficient singletsinglet annihilation30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean IC/IL values obtained from PD1-L and PD2-L were 0.70 and 0.82, respectively (Fig 4b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values correspond to 3.3 and 5.5 independent emitters in the PD1-L and PD2-L particles, respectively (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since each PD1-L

anti-bunching behaviour was not observed in PD1-H and PD2-H (Fig 3b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the fabricated Pdots are similar in size (Fig 2e,h) and consequently contain a similar number of the emitting sites, the mean IC/IL values obtained from PD1-H and PD2-H (I0/IL=0.90 and 0.98) indicate inefficient directional EET occurring in these particles despite their small size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our findings provide an important clue to the development of ultrasmall Pdots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the packing of the PCzBT chains is significantly different in PD1-L and PD1-H (Fig 6), these two Pdots have similar sizes (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the size of the particle is determined by the PCzBT molecule itself rather than by the interaction of the PCzBT chains inside the particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most CPs have a linear shape, and they therefore have to adopt strained conformations if these chains are squeezed into ultrasmall Pdots23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, PCzBT and PCzDTBT have twisted shapes, which can be easily squeezed into ultrasmall Pdots without introducing energetically unfavourable strained conformations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allows for the reliable and efficient fabrication of the 3-nm diameter Pdots with very high colloidal stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduced surface energy of the CP chains in a bent conformation inside the Pdots might also contribute to the high stability of the particles34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our findings also provide an important clue to the development of brighter Pdots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The brightness of the fluorescence is highly related to the fluorescence quantum yield (fl).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  fl is determined by the ratio of the radiative rate constant (kr) and the non-radiative rate constant (knr) (Supplementary Fig 11a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, larger kr and smaller knr are required for achieving a high fl value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most far-red-emitting Pdots suffer from a significant reduction in fl compared with the CPs from which they were fabricated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is mainly due to the significant increase in knr due to the generation of energy trap sites in the particles through aggregations of CP chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, it has been widely believed that higher spatial order and better packing of CPs inside Pdots lead to interchain interactions through  stacking, which causes fluorescence quenching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The standard method to resolve this problem is to fabricate Pdots by mixing CPs and non-CPs3,26 and/or inserting bulky side groups35 to CPs, which allow for physical separation of the CPs in the Pdots36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this strategy works well for planar-shaped CPs, large fl is obtained at the cost of a lower density of fluorescing moieties26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our comprehensive characterization of the Pdots fabricated using structurally similar but different CPs demonstrates that quenching can largely be suppressed without physical isolation of the CP chains by fabricating Pdots with non-planar CT-type CPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PD1-L and PD2-L, which were fabricated without any non-CPs and/or bulky side chains, showed marginal increases of knr compared with the corresponding CPs (PCzBT and PCzDTBT; Supplementary Fig 11b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The generation of energy trap sites is thus inefficient in PD1-L and PD2-L. Obviously, this is one of the reasons that relatively high fl are maintained in PD1-L and PD2-L.', 'While spatially ordered packing of the chains (that is, PD1-L and PD2-L) resulted in efficient intraparticle EET, it did not cause reduction in fl, suggesting that fluorescence quenching is governed by local chain interactions rather than by the overall spatial order of the emitting sites within the particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main difference between most previous Pdots and PD1-L/PD2-L is the shape of the CPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While most far-red-emitting CPs have linear and planar shapes, PCzBT and PCzDTBT have twisted nonplanar shapes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since  stacking of the CP chains is responsible for the aggregations of the chains and therefore the generation of quenching sites (that is, energy trap sites), our findings suggest that the unique twisted shape of the CPs used in this study prevents the CP chains from  stacking and from forming quenching sites, which results in brighter fluorescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The drop in fl in PD1-H and PD2-H compared with PD1-L and PD2-L is partly explained by the increase in knr values (Supplementary Fig 11b,c) and therefore by the generation of additional quenching sites (that is, energy trap sites) in PD1-H and PD2-H.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural characterization (Fig 6) revealed temperature-dependent polymer chain packing during fabrication, which demonstrated the critical role played by chain packing in the generation of quenching sites in the particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results clearly indicate that the brightness of Pdots is partly governed by the packing of CP chains in the particles, which can be optimized by reprecipitation conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Steady-state absorption spectra of PCzBT (Fig 1c) exhibited the largest CT absorption in the solution phase, followed by PD1-L. PD1-H exhibited smallest CT absorption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar trend was observed with PCzDTBT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since fluorescence brightness is proportional to the absorption cross-section, the results indicate that PD1-L and PD2-L exhibit brighter fluorescence compared with PD1-H and PD2-H.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cross-section (which is proportional to the oscillator strength, f) of the CT absorption between Cz and BT depends on the rotational twist angle between the two moieties (that is, larger f for smaller twist angle)19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the Cz and BT moieties adopt most planar conformation in THF and a more twisted conformation in PD1-H.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the different packing of the PCzBT chains in PD1-L and PD1-H, the rotational twist angle between Cz and BT is regulated by the packing of the chains in the Pdots that is controlled by the reprecipitation conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the StricklerBerg equation37, f is proportional to kr; the rotational twist thus affects fl as well (that is, larger kr results in larger fl) (Supplementary Fig 11a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As predicted by the StricklerBerg equation, the CT absorption cross-sections of PCzBT and PCzDTBT are proportional to kr (Supplementary Fig 11b,c) except for a small deviation in PD1-H.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The brighter fluorescence observed in PD1-L and PD2-L is, therefore, partly attributed to the smaller rotational twist between the Cz and BT or DTBT moieties compared with PD1-H and PD2-H.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fabrication temperature-dependent rotational twist angle is most likely due to the different CP chains packing in the Pdots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'All these observations point to a new strategy for obtaining brighter Pdots: design non-planar CPs that prevent the formation of local quenching sites and control the packing of the CP chains in Pdots by optimizing the reprecipitation conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EET between different CPs (that is, energy donor CP and energy acceptor CP) in single Pdots has been used to design and fabricate far-red/near-infrared emitting Pdots3,26,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although very bright Pdots can be obtained by this approach, residual fluorescence from the energy-donor CP cannot be avoided completely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, heterogeneity between individual particles has to be evaluated carefully in such Pdots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This will be a particularly important issue in the fabrication of ultrasmall Pdots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the particles consist of a relatively small number of CP chains, the efficiency of intra-particle EET could vary between individual particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Advanced fluorescence imaging such as fluorescence lifetime imaging and single-particle tracking with such Pdots might not be straightforward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our new strategy to design and fabricate bright far-red/near-infrared-emitting Pdots would serve as a fundamental framework for the future development of Pdots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We also demonstrated that EET occurring in Pdots can be regulated by controlling the physical interactions between the chains by modifying the reprecipitation conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intraparticle EET is especially important in the sensing applications of Pdots5,6,7,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While simultaneous realization of bright fluorescence with high EET efficiency is required in sensing applications, efficient EET often results in quenched fluorescence due to intrachain interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that very bright Pdots with efficient intraparticle EET can be fabricated by selecting proper CT-type CPs and appropriate reprecipitation conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While the number of independent emitters in the particles depends on the reprecipitation conditions, multiple simultaneously emitting sites exist in all the fabricated Pdots that create spatially isotropic fluorescence emitted by the particles (Supplementary Fig 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spatially isotropic fluorescence is essential for accurate localization of the particles39, which is not always straightforward with fluorophores that emit anisotropic luminescence such as organic dyes and QDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result together with the small size and high photostability of the obtained Pdots suggests that they could be ideal fluorophores for single-particle tracking studies40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given an increasing number of applications of Pdots based on CT-type CPs because of their wide tunability of fluorescence wavelength, our findings provide a fundamental framework for designing and fabricating new functionalized Pdots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the reliable method to fabricate Pdots with 3-nm size reported here should open the possibility of using Pdots in a wide spectrum of in vivo applications in clinical settings.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
