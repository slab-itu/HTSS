The -tubulin-specific inhibitor gatastatin reveals temporal requirements of microtubule nucleation during the cell cycle  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Inhibitors of microtubule (MT) assembly or dynamics that target /-tubulin are widely exploited in cancer therapy and biological research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, specific inhibitors of the MT nucleator -tubulin that would allow testing temporal functions of -tubulin during the cell cycle are yet to be identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By evolving -tubulin-binding drugs we now find that the glaziovianin A derivative gatastatin is a -tubulin-specific inhibitor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gatastatin decreased interphase MT dynamics of human cells without affecting MT number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gatastatin inhibited assembly of the mitotic spindle in prometaphase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of gatastatin to preformed metaphase spindles altered MT dynamics, reduced the number of growing MTs and shortened spindle length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, gatastatin prolonged anaphase duration by affecting anaphase spindle structure, indicating the continuous requirement of MT nucleation during mitosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, gatastatin facilitates the dissection of the role of -tubulin during the cell cycle and reveals the sustained role of -tubulin.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Microtubules (MTs) are dynamic polymers of /-tubulin heterodimers that are involved in a wide variety of biological functions such as mitosis, organelle positioning and cell motility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MTs are inherently polar structures with -tubulin terminating the MT minus end and -tubulin the MT plus end.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While /-tubulin heterodimers can spontaneously polymerize to generate MTs in vitro, MT nucleation in vivo is initiated from a ring-like template of -tubulin (another member of the tubulin superfamily) that can promote MT nucleation at concentrations below those required for spontaneous assembly1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -Tubulin recruits accessory proteins, so-called -tubulin complex proteins (GCPs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -Tubulin, GCP2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4) and GCP3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5) form a tetrameric 2:1:1 complex named the small -tubulin complex (-TuSC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In many eukaryotes, -TuSC assembles with additional GCPs (GCP46) into the stable -tubulin ring complex (-TuRC)6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the importance of -tubulin function for MT formation, -tubulin-specific MT nucleation inhibitors are yet to be reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This deficiency in our drug repertoire limits the temporal analysis of -tubulin functions in eukaryotic cells to lengthy short interfering RNA (siRNA) depletion experiments that arrest cells in prometaphase because of spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) activation after sustained deficiency in -tubulin functions for many hours before observation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore lack a clear understanding of the requirements of -tubulin at discrete cell cycle phases that arises from acute inhibition of -tubulin functions through pharmacological intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we used recombinant human -tubulin to screen for -tubulin inhibitors and identified the AG1 (refs 7, 8) derivative gatastatin9 as -tubulin-specific inhibitor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gatastatin blocked -tubulin-dependent MT nucleation, without affecting /-tubulin polymerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gatastatin identified novel -tubulin functions for metaphase spindle maintenance and anaphase spindle elongation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data demonstrate the continuous importance of -tubulin throughout the cell cycle for MT homeostasis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our study has identified gatastatin as the inhibitor of -tubulin that blocks GTP binding to -tubulin and -tubulins MT nucleation activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several lines of evidence support the notion that gatastatin specifically inhibits -tubulin without affecting /-tubulin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, gatastatin showed a 12-fold higher affinity towards -tubulin in comparison with /-tubulin (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, gatastatin did not affect glutamate, paclitaxel or Tau-induced MT assembly in vitro while -TuSC-induced MT assembly was inhibited (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, gatastatin did not affect dynamics of MTs in vitro (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forth, gatastatin blocked binding of -TuSC to the minus end of preformed MTs (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fifth, gatastatin inhibited -tubulin-dependent MT nucleation in Xenopus egg extracts while DMSO-induced MT assembly was unaffected (Fig 1e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, gatastatin blocked -tubulin-dependent MT nucleation activity of centrosomes in human cells (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these experiments provide a strong case for the -tubulin specificity of gatatastin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we cannot exclude the possibility that gatastatin at higher concentrations affects MTs directly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'What is the mode of action of gatastatin?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gatastatin did not misplace -tubulin from centrosomes (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is unlikely that it inhibits Nedd1-dependent recruitment processes15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since GTP binding to yeast -tubulin regulates the interaction of -tubulin with /-tubulin14, we suggest that this critical step in MT nucleation is blocked by gatastatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as for paclitaxel that modifies intrinsic MT properties by targeting tubulin, gatastatin probably modulates -tubulin activity without invoking a complete inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This view is supported by the observation that gatastatin did not completely inhibit RanQ69L-induced aster formation (Fig 1e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'When used to unravel novel functions of -tubulin during the cell cycle, gatastatin highlights the importance of -tubulin in the regulation of MT plus end dynamics during interphase and in preassembled metaphase spindles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this observation, changes in MT dynamics in response to -TuRC components depletion or mutations in -TuSC components have been reported in Drosophila S2 cells, S. pombe and budding yeast S. cerevisiae14,20,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How -tubulin regulates MT plus end dynamics is still unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One attractive possibility is that the -tubulin complex at the MT minus end1 superimposes a structural change on the MT lattice that is propagated along the length of the MT wall to alter the structure and thus dynamics of the remote plus end.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In preassembled metaphase spindles after -tubulin inhibition, the polekinetochore and polepole MTs were not fully functional, as indicated by the persistent activation of the SAC, the reduced number of growing MTs and the reduced spindle length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, -tubulin activity is not only needed to assemble the mitotic spindle as this was already indicated by -tubulin siRNA depletion analysis26 but also to maintain a functional metaphase spindle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study has shown that -TuRC actively contributes to spindle architecture by organizing MT minus ends that originate within the main body of the spindle before being transported to the spindle poles27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', '-Tubulin activity was also important for anaphase spindle elongation (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of gatastatin, the anaphase spindle was much broader and spindle MTs were less organized into parallel bundles of MTs than in the control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these defects, gatastatin increased anaphase duration from 18.6 to 32.4 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presently, it is unclear whether this anaphase activity of -tubulin resides at centrosomes or is bound to MTs via the augmin complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'During ingression of the cleavage furrow, the MTs of the central spindle become compacted to form the midbody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of gatastatin, midbody MTs were less organized but still were able to recruit the cytokinesis marker CEP55 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24) and to induce actin ring assembly (Supplementary Figs 11 and 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is consistent with the localization of -tubulin to the midbody and the finding that -tubulin antibody micro-injection experiments disturbed midbody formation without inhibition of cytokinesis28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', '-Tubulin is overexpressed in glioblastoma cells29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, elevated MT nucleation activity from centrosomes enhances the invasiveness of cancer cells30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reversing the elevated nucleation capacity of centrosomes through -tubulin inhibition may offer one route to reduce the aggressiveness and metastatic potential of the wide range of tumour cells in which centrosomes are amplified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our proof-of-principle study showing that chemical modifications of known /-tubulin inhibitors can switch target specificity towards -tubulin is therefore an exciting new avenue for the development of novel cancer therapeutics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
