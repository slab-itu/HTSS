Antibody-based PET imaging of amyloid beta in mouse models of Alzheimers disease  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Owing to their specificity and high-affinity binding, monoclonal antibodies have potential as positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands and are currently used to image various targets in peripheral organs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the central nervous system, antibody uptake is limited by the bloodbrain barrier (BBB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present a PET ligand to be used for diagnosis and evaluation of treatment effects in Alzheimers disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amyloid  (A) antibody mAb158 is radiolabelled and conjugated to a transferrin receptor antibody to enable receptor-mediated transcytosis across the BBB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PET imaging of two different mouse models with A pathology clearly visualize A in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PET signal increases with age and correlates closely with brain A levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we demonstrate that antibody-based PET ligands can be successfully used for brain imaging.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of amyloid  (A) deposits in the brain has rapidly advanced in recent years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The introduction of the radioligand 11CPIB (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1), a derivate of thioflavin-T, was an important development for diagnosis of Alzheimers disease (AD), as 11CPIB amyloid imaging detects AD pathology early in the course of disease2 and helps distinguishing AD from other types of dementia3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11CPIB, and analogues of PIB, detect amyloid plaques, mainly consisting of insoluble fibrils of A (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the load of insoluble A does not correlate well with disease progression5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soluble A is a better marker of disease status7,8,9,10, and many therapeutic as well as diagnostic efforts are currently targeting soluble A aggregates, for example, oligomers and protofibrils11,12,13,14,15,16,17, which are strongly implicated as the cause of synaptic failure and neurodegeneration in AD9,10,18,19,20,21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This new focus highlights the pressing need for an imaging agent that can visualize soluble A aggregates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The development of small molecular PET radioligands often suffers from nonspecific binding of the radioligand, and further, low ability to discriminate between different forms of a protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radioligands based on antibodies have recently been introduced in clinical use for various peripheral antigens primarily related to cancer24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibodies have the advantage that they can be developed to bind a specific form of a protein, but their use as PET radioligands for targets in the central nervous system (CNS) is hampered by their low brain penetration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, whereas a high enough brain uptake is essential to achieve a PET signal, the specific-to-nonspecific binding, expected to be very high for a monoclonal antibody compared with small molecules, may be equally important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our previously developed conformation-selective monoclonal antibody mAb158 displays a distinctive selectivity for soluble A protofibrils as compared with monomeric A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It binds preferentially to soluble protofibrils over mature, insoluble fibrils, but without affinity for the A protein precursor (APP)25,26,27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These characteristics make the antibody suitable to selectively target soluble A aggregates in vivo, and its humanized version, BAN2401, (hereafter referred to as h158), is currently studied in a phase 2b clinical trial as an anti-A therapy against AD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a previous study we showed that 72 h after administration, the brain concentrations of iodine-125-labelled mAb158 (125ImAb158) was significantly increased in a transgenic AD mouse model (tg-ArcSwe, harbouring the Arctic (E693G) and Swedish (KM670/671NL) APP mutations29) compared with non-transgenic littermates (wild type; WT)27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, total levels of 125ImAb158 in the brain were rather moderate, which is anticipated for antibodies in general30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Different strategies have been applied to increase the brain uptake of antibodies and other large molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among them is receptor-mediated transcytosis, where the antibody is fused to a molecule that specifically binds to a bloodbrain barrier (BBB) expressed receptor, for example, the transferrin or insulin receptor, which enables active transport across the BBB (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This technique was pioneered by Pardridge and colleagues31 in the 1990s, and has recently been implemented in AD therapy to decrease production32,33 or increase degradation34 of A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Generation of bispecific fusion protein 8D3-F(ab)2-h158.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic picture of TfR-mediated transcytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) SDSPAGE displaying F(ab)2-h158, TfR antibody 8D3 and the fusion protein consisting of F(ab)2-h158 and 8D3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Inhibition ELISA demonstrating the fusion proteins selective binding to A protofibrils (IC50 1.0 nM) over fibrils (IC50 12 nM) and monomers (IC50 240 nM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fusion protein showed retained binding to TfR (d) and A protofibrils (e) after 125I labelling, as demonstrated with ELISA (absorbance values on the left y axis and radioactivity on the right y axis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Representative images from triplicate experiments are shown in ce.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  conc., concentration;

'Engineering of an ATfR bispecific fusion protein', 'A PET ligand with a fairly short systemic half-life is desired since a rapid elimination from the blood increases the specific signal compared with the background, derived from the blood volume of the studied tissue (about 5% in brain) and decreases the radiation dose for the patient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, a F(ab)2 fragment was generated by enzymatic cleavage of h158, reducing its systemic half-life to 2 h in both tg-ArcSwe and WT mice, compared with 11 days for mAb158 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The A-binding properties of F(ab)2-h158 were unchanged, compared with the parent antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To increase brain uptake of F(ab)2-h158, it was chemically conjugated to the anti-TfR antibody 8D3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36), which has been widely used to increase the brain uptake of large molecules34,37,38,39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The 8D3-F(ab)2-h158 fusion protein was sufficiently pure for the intended purpose (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in fusion protein binding in solution to A monomer, protofibril and fibril, reflected by their ability to inhibit the fusion proteins binding to an A-coated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate, was very similar to what we have previously reported for mAb158 (refs 25, 27), with median inhibitory concentration values of 240 nM for monomers, 1.0 nM for protofibrils and 12 nM for fibrils (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it retained its binding to both TfR and A protofibrils also after radioiodination (Fig 1d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Increased brain uptake by TfR-mediated transcytosis', 'The pharmacokinetic blood profile of the radioiodinated fusion protein 125I8D3-F(ab)2-h158 was the same in tg-ArcSwe and WT mice displaying a half-life of 11 h (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For successful PET imaging, it is important to have a high brain uptake of the ligand in relation to its concentration in blood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the brain-to-blood ratio (Kp) of the fusion protein was assessed by ex vivo studies at three different time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radioactivity was measured in blood and saline-perfused brains of  greater than 12-month-old tg-ArcSwe and WT mice, killed 4, 24 and 72 h after intraperitoneal (i.p.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection of 125I8D3-F(ab)2-h158.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 4 h Kp was low (0.02±0.01), with no difference between tg-ArcSwe and WT mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kp had increased at 24 h and was significantly different (P less_than 0.05) between the groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 72 h post injection, Kp had further increased to 0.44±0.10 (P less_than 0.001) in tg-ArcSwe, while the WT mice were stable on a low level (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fusion protein transport into the brain was assessed in  greater than 18-month-old mice at 4 and 2 h, corresponding to Cmax of the fusion protein and the F(ab)2 fragment in blood, respectively, and measured as per cent of injected dose per gram brain tissue (% ID per g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this point, the fusion protein was taken up ninefold more than 125IF(ab)2-h158, with no difference between tg-ArcSwe and WT mice (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When studied 72 h post injection, that is, at the highest Kp of the fusion protein, it showed a 15-fold higher brain retention in tg-ArcSwe mice than the F(ab)2 fragment and a greater difference between tg-ArcSwe and WT mice (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: In vivo blood pharmacokinetics and brain distribution of fusion protein in tg-ArcSwe and WT mice.

were determined in the same mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously established that total A, measured by ELISA, closely matches A plaque load as determined with immunohistochemistry in tg-ArcSwe mice27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a significant difference in brain retention of the fusion protein between tg-ArcSwe and WT mice at 12 months (3.5-fold) and  greater than 18 months (6.8-fold), as

'Several new drug compounds intended for treatment of AD have entered clinical phase II and III studies, but there are limited possibilities to measure their effects on the molecular level in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All existing amyloid PET radioligands bind to the -sheet structure of insoluble fibrillar A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidence today points to soluble forms of aggregated A being better correlated with disease severity and soluble A oligomers and protofibrils are likely to cause the synaptic failure that eventually leads to dementia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present study shows for the first time an in vivo PET image of A pathology acquired with an antibody-based radioligand (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was achieved by a combination of TfR-mediated transcytosis to increase BBB penetration and the use of a well-characterized A protofibril selective antibody, which ensures that A aggregates are selectively targeted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although mAb158 binds, albeit with a lesser affinity, to A fibrils and monomers in vitro25,27 (Fig 1c), evidence suggests that it primarily targets soluble A protofibrils in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When administered to tg-ArcSwe mice with plaque pathology, mAb158 selectively reduced brain levels of A protofibrils, without altering the plaque pathology43, unlike other A antibodies of the same isotype44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is probably because soluble A protofibrils, which are already favoured by mAb158, are more accessible to the antibody when it enters the brain parenchyma than the insoluble fibrils deposited in plaques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is also reflected in Fig 4e,f, where in vivo administered fusion protein appears in the parenchyma and around the periphery of plaques, where A oligomerization has been reported to occur41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Further, the PET signal and brain retention of the generated bispecific fusion protein increased with age (Fig 5), that is, with progression of A pathology in the tg-ArcSwe and tg-Swe mouse models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tg-ArcSwe mice exhibit very dense A plaque pathology, similar to that of the human AD brain, with an onset around 6 months of age42, and an almost linear increase of soluble A protofibrils with age (Figs 4 and 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tg-Swe mice display less dense plaques42 with a later onset and a more rapid increase in A pathology (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, at 12 months of age, higher concentrations of 124I8D3-F(ab)2-h158 was observed in the brains of tg-ArcSwe compared with tg-Swe mice, while the opposite was observed at 18 months.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference between the two animal models was also evident in the 11CPIB scans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11CPIB binds poorly to the loose unstructured plaques in tg-Swe mice brain and thus 11CPIB concentrations were lower than 124I8D3-F(ab)2-h158 in tg-Swe mice, while the concentration of the two radioligands was similar in tg-ArcSwe brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brain retention of the fusion protein correlated closely with brain concentrations of soluble A protofibrils in both animal models (Fig 4), while total A levels, reflecting the plaque pathology, increased at a higher rate, suggesting that the fusion protein preferably binds to soluble A protofibrils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, low radioactivity was detected with PET in the cerebellum in all age groups, while it increased with age in the rest of the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, while the level of soluble A protofibrils increased with age in the whole brain, cerebellum displayed a low and constant level of protofibrils over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the PET brain/cerebellum radioactivity concentration ratio, which is often used in clinical PET as a read-out measure, correlated with the brain/cerebellum ratio of soluble A protofibrils (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a correlation was not seen for total A, since both A40 and A42 increased with age in the cerebellum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results do not per se exclude that the radioligand may also to some extent bind to fibrillar A in the brain, possibly in the shape of diffuse deposits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Taken together, our findings suggest that brain retention of the fusion protein measured with PET reflects the progression of A pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach could become an important diagnostic tool to predict disease stage in AD patients, likely including the group of patients displaying mainly diffuse plaque pathology45 that are diagnosed falsely as non-AD with the available amyloid PET radioligands46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment strategies to reduce soluble A aggregates are today studied in late-phase clinical trials, but biomarkers for evaluating the effects of such treatments need to be improved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A PET radioligand visualizing soluble A aggregates could bring substantial benefit in assessing emerging A-reducing treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To our knowledge this is the first successful study using an antibody-based PET ligand for a CNS application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since antibodies are very specific binders, the drawback of large unspecific binding often experienced with small molecular PET ligands (including 11CPIB and analogues) will most likely be avoided with antibody-based ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study therefore also demonstrates the feasibility of antibody-based in vivo imaging of proteins involved in other neurodegenerative disorders, for example, Parkinsons disease or frontotemporal lobar degeneration, for which small molecular PET ligands are currently lacking.'
