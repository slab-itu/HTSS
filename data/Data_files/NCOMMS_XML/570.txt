Land-use choices follow profitability at the expense of ecological functions in Indonesian smallholder landscapes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Smallholder-dominated agricultural mosaic landscapes are highlighted as model production systems that deliver both economic and ecological goods in tropical agricultural landscapes, but trade-offs underlying current land-use dynamics are poorly known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, using the most comprehensive quantification of land-use change and associated bundles of ecosystem functions, services and economic benefits to date, we show that Indonesian smallholders predominantly choose farm portfolios with high economic productivity but low ecological value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The more profitable oil palm and rubber monocultures replace forests and agroforests critical for maintaining above- and below-ground ecological functions and the diversity of most taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between the monocultures, the higher economic performance of oil palm over rubber comes with the reliance on fertilizer inputs and with increased nutrient leaching losses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strategies to achieve an ecological-economic balance and a sustainable management of tropical smallholder landscapes must be prioritized to avoid further environmental degradation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Large expanses of lowland tropical rainforest have been converted to large-scale commercial plantations or small-scale mosaic agricultural landscapes1, in which fragments of forests are surrounded by a mixture of settlements, monocultures and mixed-species land uses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While smallholder-dominated mosaic landscapes often retain natural resources and combine land uses that support complementary ecosystem functions, services and benefits2,3, these are subject to trade-offs and synergies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, an immediate effect of the production of food and other raw materials on economic benefits4 could drive increases in crop production and associated returns from the land at the expense of other ecological functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, land-use intensification, conversion of semi-natural habitat remnants and specialization on a few cash crops remain pervasive5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies combining empirical evidence on land-use dynamics, economic benefits, biodiversity and ecological functions in smallholder systems are scarce but essential to better understand these dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The present study aims at quantifying land-use dynamics and their drivers, as well as economic and ecological impacts of land-use choices in smallholder-dominated tropical landscapes in Sumatra, Indonesia (Fig 1a), using a unique multidisciplinary data set collected in a collaborative project by over 20 research groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Originally covered by sparsely populated rainforest, large parts of the lowlands now consist of large-scale oil palm, Acacia plantations, and small-scale smallholder-dominated mosaics of forest remnants, jungle rubber (rubber-enriched secondary forest6 and rubber monocultures) and oil palm monocultures (Fig 2ad; see Supplementary Note 1 for historical and institutional background).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While expansion of large-scale industrial plantations of oil palm in the region have raised much environmental concern, dynamics in smallholder land-use and their consequences are less well known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is despite smallholder-managed land making up the largest share of agricultural land, even among so-called estate crops such as rubber and oil palm7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect the most productive and profitable agricultural land-use types to be increasing, and that underlying ecological-economic trade-offs lead to reductions not only in biodiversity, but also in key ecological functions underpinning ecosystem services such as climate regulation and water quality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assessed land-use, profitability, agricultural inputs and outputs for 464 smallholder households from 45 villages in Jambi province, Sumatra (Supplementary Fig 1), and attitude to risk was quantified for a subsample of farmers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Land-use transitions over the past 20 years were assessed at household level with survey data, and at regional level using land-use classification inferred from remote sensing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each of the studied land-use types (rainforest, jungle rubber, rubber and oil palm plantations), we empirically assessed biodiversity, ecological functions and ecosystem services in 32 core study sites (eight per land-use type, Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we evaluated biodiversity with (i) three indicators for naturalness index: forest bird species, indigenous tree species and absence of the ten common invasive weed species, (ii) local species richness across important plant, vertebrate, invertebrate, protist and prokaryote groups and (iii) plant genetic diversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The former is a proxy for the potential to contribute to nature conservation, while the others have been shown to support ecosystem functioning8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we assessed stability in micro-climatic conditions on the basis that a buffering from extreme conditions is beneficial for biodiversity and ecosystem functioning9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, we quantified leaf litter decomposition, soil microbial functioning and nutrient leaching in the soil as indicators of regulating services through sustainability of soil fertility and ground-water quality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourth, we measured harvested yield, net primary production (NPP) and ecosystem carbon stocks as indicators of both provisioning (yield) and regulating (carbon sequestration) services.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the more profitable oil palm and rubber monocultures replace forested systems that play a key role in supporting biodiversity end ecological functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oil palm is profitable and attractive, but degrades soil quality and causes nutrient leaching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finding strategies to balance ecological and economic functions in these landscapes, including a more sustainable management of smallholder oil palm, is required to avert further environmental problems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Land-use change in smallholder-dominated mosaic agricultural landscapes.Aerial photo (Photo: Heiko Faust) (a) and changes in the land-use composition (b) of the studied landscapes around the national park Bukit Duabelas and the Harapan Forest Restoration concession in Jambi Province, Indonesia from 1990 to 2011, based on land-use classification inferred from remote sensing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rainforest (dark green diamonds), rubber (light green filled circles), oil palm (red squares), shrub/bushland (grey up-pointing triangles), and others (blue down-pointing triangles), which includes amongst others food crops, timber and fruit tree plantations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Table 1 for the 19902011 land-use change matrix.Full size image', 'Figure 2: Land-uses and associated ecological functions.Forest remnants (a,e), jungle rubber (b,f), rubber plantation (c,g) and oil palm plantation (d,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ecological functions are represented as flower diagrams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each function, the minimum (circle centre) is the 5th quantile and the maximum (circle edge) is the 95th quantile of the standardized ecosystem function indicators, observed in a plot of any land-use types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The outer edge of the flower petals indicates the estimate for the aggregate ecosystem function in a given land use relative to these minima and maxima.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the importance of functions may differ between stakeholders, unweighted values are presented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photo credits: Katja Rembold (a), and Yann Clough (bd).Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Productivity, inputs and profitability', 'Farms were characterized by a low diversity (high specialization) of cultivated crops (Supplementary Fig 2), especially in the transmigrant villages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rubber and oil palm were most prevalent, being cultivated by 82 and 35% of smallholder farmers, respectively (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rubber was predominantly grown in monoculture, as only 17% of visited rubber plots could be categorized as jungle rubber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cultivation of other crops was much less common and undertaken only in small plots (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Distribution of land ownership was highly uneven, with 50% of the land area being held by about 10% of the farm households (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The household survey showed that oil palm was managed much more intensively with herbicides, and soil amendments (that is, chemical fertilizers and lime) than rubber, but required less labour (see Fig 3a,b,d; statistical results and summary statistics in Table 2 and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, oil palm cultivation resulted in a high gross margin per labour unit (high labour productivity), but lower gross margin per land unit (low land productivity), compared with rubber plantations (Fig 3c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, compared with oil palm, both jungle rubber and monoculture rubber were labour-intensive, with a low labour productivity (Fig 3b,d), due to rubber being harvested around five times a week, compared with once in every two weeks for oil palm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference was crucial to explain the land-use changes in Jambi, as it helps the labour-constrained smallholders expand their farm by incorporating oil palm in the crop-portfolio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rubber plantations had a higher land productivity than jungle rubber (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the core plots, maximum and mean rubber yield in monoculture plantation was four and two times the yield in jungle rubber, respectively (Fig 4g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oil palm plantations were cultivated by more risk-averse farmers than jungle rubber (HoltLaury values; LR-test; P=0.044; Fig 3e), whereas farmers with monoculture rubber showed intermediate levels of risk-taking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transmigrant villages differed from non-transmigrant villages in having higher fertilizer costs, in particular in oil palm, and in having a larger share of family labour over hired labour in jungle rubber and rubber plantations, and higher gross margins (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Land-use/land cover change (%) from 1990 to 2011 in the study landscapes in Jambi Province (Indonesia) based on land-use classification inferred from remote sensing.Full size table', 'Figure 3: Economic functions for three agricultural land-uses.Measures for agricultural input use (ab), profitability functions (cd), and farmer risk aversion (e) in three agricultural land-uses (Jambi, Indonesia): material inputs (a), labour inputs (b), gross margin per hectare (c) in units of 103 Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) ha1 yr1 and gross margin per labour unit (d) in units of 103 IDR h1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Farmers risk aversion (e) is measured with a HoltLaury lottery, higher values indicate higher risk aversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Summary statistics of all variables are in Supplementary Table 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Boxplots indicate the lower quartile, median and upper quartile, with whiskers extending to the most extreme data point that is no more than 1.5 times the interquartile range from the edge of the box.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Horizontal bars indicate the estimated mean indicator variable value;

we assumed no extraction from forests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fertilization-driven soil biochemical indicators were also higher in oil palm than in the other land-use types (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values of both net primary productivity (excluding yield) and carbon stocks were highest in forest, intermediate in jungle rubber and lowest in monocultures (Fig 4h,i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carbon (C) stocks were equally distributed amongst the plant biomass and soil organic C in forest and jungle rubber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the monoculture plantations, C stocks in plant biomass were much lower than in forested systems, with much less marked differences for soil organic C stocks, which were very variable even within the same land-use type (Fig 4i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Economic-ecological trade-offs', 'The trade-offs between ecological functions incurred by choosing one land-use over another are illustrated in a standardized manner in Fig 2, and are also reflected in the ecological function correlation matrices (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When considering ecological functions across a forestagroforestmonoculture plantation sequence, production of harvested biomass increased, but most other functions decreased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nutrient retention, calculated as the additive inverse of nutrient leaching, was the only function for which rubber monocultures, usually unfertilized in smallholder landscapes, attained similarly high relative values as forest and jungle rubber.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The persistence of biodiversity and ecosystem-service delivery in human-dominated tropical mosaic landscapes depends on land-use dynamics and the contribution of the dominant land uses to bundles of ecosystem services and local benefits, where significant trade-offs may be expected between economic and ecological functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In smallholder-dominated landscapes of lowland Sumatra, forest cover has diminished drastically over the past 20 years and current land-use choices favour the adoption of the most profitable monocultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes led to higher crop production and incomes among smallholders, but were accompanied with declines in multiple ecological functions directly related to biodiversity conservation, climate regulation and water quality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The province of Jambi is a model of crucial dependency on its agricultural sector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2013, approximately half of the workforce was employed in the agricultural sector, a share which has not changed much over the past four years, while the total population in the province is increasing7,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rural poverty is low in Jambi (7%) in comparison with national urban-poverty value (14%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is true in both absolute terms and in relation to urban poverty10, making the Jambi agricultural sector attractive for migrants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between 1990 and 2010, the population of Jambi increased from 2 to 3 million, and that of the five regencies constituting our study area from 0.8 to 1.4 million10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased numbers of smallholders as well as increased area of large-scale plantations has gradually reduced the area of accessible farmland for smallholders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in land scarcity has several effects: extensification to secure land, forced agricultural intensification as farmers subsistence strategies shift from extensive slash-and-burn cultivation to cash-crop production, and increased agricultural transition11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In agreement with previous studies11,12, we found that the total area under cultivation had increased, mainly due to the conversion of forest to oil palm and rubber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deforestation, especially of near-primary forest, causes biodiversity losses that are impossible to compensate with other land uses, which is clearly visible from all three measures of biodiversity used in the present study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides the local loss in naturalness and biodiversity, the regional persistence of species even in larger, protected forest fragments (such as the Harapan Rainforest where there was a more stable forest cover, Supplementary Fig 4) may be jeopardized in the long-term by increasing isolation from other forested habitats and by reducing connectivity of the landscape matrix following monoculture establishment2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With low values of naturalness and biodiversity of conservation-relevant groups, rubber and oil palm monocultures cannot contribute to the maintenance of the characteristic fauna and flora of the studied landscapes in general13, unless effective regional planning achieves the combination of high yields under monocultures with land set aside for forest regrowth14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Jungle rubber is associated with intermediate levels of biodiversity, but its usefulness for conservation is impeded by low yields and poor economic performance, which may potentially lead to increased deforestation elsewhere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Jungle rubber was formerly the main rubber production system6, but low land and labour productivity (Fig 3c,d) explain why jungle rubber decreased in area, while both monocultures increased (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rubber and oil palm plantations were complementary16, in that rubber plantations had high labour productivity and oil palm high return-to-labour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the per hectare land productivity was comparable between monoculture rubber and oil palm plantations, households facing labour constraints could increase and diversify their farm income by adopting oil palm, which required relatively less involvement of labour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In interviews of smallholders, respondents stated that they viewed oil palm as an easier crop to cultivate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The risk-averseness of farmers cultivating oil palm over farmers owning jungle rubber may seem surprising given the flexibility of the agroforestry systems17, but suggests other causes of oil palm expansion besides the attractiveness of higher and quicker returns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Substantial economic benefits of the expansion of monoculture cultivation were apparent from our data and are visibly linked to increased human welfare in the region, as is the case elsewhere14,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Focusing mainly on contribution to average farmer income may mask that human welfare is not limited to economic variables, and that the impact of land-use change may affect different persons differently, depending on gender, ethnicity, social and economic status19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, our results support differences in agricultural inputs and profitability between systems for transmigrant and non-transmigrant villages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data analysed in this study do not allow for a full assessment of impacts of land-use changes on human wellbeing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, welfare impacts are found strongly linked to the farmer heterogeneity and differential factor (especially human labour) endowment of the farm-household20, indicating potentially negative implication of plantation expansion on economic equality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The degree to which these developments benefit the whole population thus is uncertain and the inequality in holding sizewith 10% of the farmers holding over 50% of the land areasuggests significant disparities21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides these potential socio-economic caveats, our study highlights pervasive negative side effects on ecological functions and the natural capital and ecosystem services they support.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While oil palm plantations have attracted more attention than rubber for their negative environmental impacts, we show that both monocultures perform similarly in terms of most ecological functions and services, despite the crop plants and the resulting vegetation structure being very different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lower taxonomic and genetic plant diversity (Fig 4ac), simpler vegetation structure and more variable microclimate of monocultures (Fig 2ad) in comparison with forested systems were concordantly associated with low species richness of birds, invertebrates and protists, as expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, similar plot-scale diversity of ant and archaea diversity across systems, and higher bacterial diversity in monocultures than forested systems showed that communities were not always simpler in monocultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detailed linkages between biodiversity and ecosystem functions assessed in our study are still being investigated, yet first results show that the observed changes in biodiversity are accompanied by strongly altered soil food webs22, leading to equally strong alteration of ecosystem functioning and soil processes (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As examples, decomposition and specific respiration, a key process controlling carbon and nutrient cycling, shifted from being large in forest and jungle rubber with high biodiversity and stable abiotic factors to being reduced in oil palm and rubber monocultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to findings of previous study, where a dominant termite species maintained similarly high decomposition rates in oil palm as in forest23, our results show that decomposition of tree leaf litter in monoculture systems was slower (ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  61% less mass loss, Table 2 and Supplementary Table 3) compared with forest and jungle rubber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These shifts are paralleled with other changes in soil biochemical characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a recent pan-tropic study, including Jambi Province, lowland forest conversion to smallholder oil palm and rubber plantations was associated by the loss of up to 50% of stored soil organic carbon (SOC) in the original forest soils24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These SOC losses were contributed by an increase in soil erosion25, a decrease in NPP and thus in organic matter input (Fig 4e) and changes in abiotic conditions (Fig 4d) that altered leaf litter decomposition (Fig 4e) in rubber and oil palm monoculture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The fertilized oil palm plantations stand out as having very high nutrient-leaching fluxes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amongst the environmental aspects which autochthonous residents most frequently associated with oil palm expansion were periodic decreases in water quality and quantity26, resulting in scarcity of water for drinking, bathing and washing clothes (see Carlson et al.27 for freshwater data from Kalimantan).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In oil palm, fertilization is an important management practice, without which decline in soil fertility with years of cultivation after deforestation would be inevitable28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nitrogen fertilization in oil palm plantations was associated with high nutrient leaching (Fig 4f) which may have negative impacts on ground-water quality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, N-oxide emission from the soil may have increased as can be inferred from the increased soil 15N natural abundance signatures in oil palm plantations (Table 2), which is a result of isotopic fractionation from soil processes producing gaseous N (nitrification and denitrification) leaving isotopically-enriched soil N behind29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the low acid-buffering capacity of Acrisol soils (Supplementary Table 3), which cover 50% of the land area in Sumatra, continued N fertilization will lead to more deleterious effects (for example, further increases in aluminium solubility and base cation leaching losses and decrease in soil phosphorus availability, Fig 4f and Supplementary Table 3) rather than just increase N availability, unless lime is applied30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oil palm plantations will increasingly be dependent on fertilization and liming, which incur additional costs to smallholders unless sustainable management practices are employed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is essential that management trials be tested on-site to screen for practices that will yield optimum benefits (for example, harvest and profit) with less nutrient losses, that is, by combining better fertilization management and improving nutrient retention efficiency in the soil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The performance of agroforestry systems such as jungle rubber for multiple ecological functions, aside from providing income, suggests that they could in principle serve to sustain both ecological and economic functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in our studied landscapes, smallholder jungle rubber produced less and generated less income than monocultural rubber (Fig 3c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A combination of monocultures and reforestation may therefore, at least theoretically, be more efficient in combining agriculture and conservation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unless land-use policy options provide economic incentives for their preservation, primary forests, secondary forest and jungle rubber have little future in smallholder-dominated landscapes despite their contribution to biodiversity and ecosystem services.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In principle, however, opportunities for combining agriculture and conservation already exist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A priority region called the RIMBA (RIau, JaMBi and Sumatra BArat) Integrated Ecosystem to the north of our study area, which straddles Jambi as well as Riau and West Sumatra, has been designated by the Indonesian Ministry of Public Works as a demonstration area for implementing ecosystem-based spatial planning31, which could facilitate the allocation of land to forested land-uses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proper implementation of the REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries) program may open up economic incentives for communities to reforest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The positive correlations of C stocks and non-harvested NPP with other ecological functions (Supplementary Fig 8) suggest that this would benefit multiple ecosystem services.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at present, concrete incentives to conserve natural capital and ecosystem services in smallholder-dominated landscapes are absent32, and REDD+ may not be economically attractive on mineral soils as an alternative to oil palm development33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A cornerstone of the economic development plan for Sumatra34 is the intensification of smallholder rubber and oil palm, which could be seen on the one hand as an opportunity to achieve higher production levels on less land.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, it could simply reinforce negative environmental impacts of monocultures, without gains in productivity being translated to increases in land spared for forests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The question is whether increasing wealth, locally, regionally and nationally, could in the long-term place improvement of environmental performance higher up on the agenda, which could then lead to the development and enforcement of agri-environmental regulations and incentives35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent findings suggest that this will depend on the strengthening of environmental governance36, and, especially if agriculture is not to be segregated from ecosystem-service generation, on rewarding land managers for increased ecosystem services delivery37.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Study region, households and study sites', 'The province of Jambi, on the island of Sumatra, covers a total land area of 5 Mha (million hectares).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focused on the five regencies that comprise most of the lowland, non-peat smallholder systems: Sarolangun, Bungo, Tebo, Batanghari and Muaro Jambi10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a questionnaire-based farm household survey, covering 701 smallholder farmers randomly selected from 45 villages (covering both autochthonous/transmigration villages), we used the data of 464 smallholder respondents whose main parcel of cropland we have visited and categorized as either jungle rubber (n=33), monoculture rubber plantation (n=162) or monoculture oil palm plantation (n=269).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These respondents were independent

represents a smallholder rubber agroforest system established by planting rubber trees into secondary rainforest8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its implementation dates back to the early 20th century before rubber and oil palm monocultures became more common.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The criteria for jungle rubber plot selection was that plots should contain non-rubber trees that are older than rubber and individual rubber trees should not be planted in rows and are of varying ages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All rubber and oil palm plantations were smallholder plantations, meaning that they were owned and managed by small farm households, as opposed to large-scale company plantations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The implicit assumption of our experimental design, comparing the changes in converted land-uses to the reference land use (that is, forest) with assess effects of land-use change, is that the initial soil conditions were comparable before conversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this assumption, we statistically compared land-use independent soil characteristics (that is, soil texture at depths 0.52 m) among land uses within each landscape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not detect significant differences in soil texture

than 1 cm were extracted by washing over a sieve of 200 m mesh size (Retsch, Haan, Germany) and separated under a stereomicroscope into live (biomass) and dead fractions (necromass).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Woody coarse debris was analysed within all forest and jungle rubber plots, where snags (DBH  greater than 10 cm) and logs (mid-point diameter  greater than 10 cm, length  greater than 1 m) were recorded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three decay stages based on from Grove65 were used to characterize the woody debris, and debris mass was calculated using the equations by Kauffmann and Donato66 and by applying the allometric equation by Chave et al.59 for calculation of AGB of un-degraded trees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Net primary productivity', 'We measured above-ground litterfall, pruned oil palm fronds, rubber latex harvest, oil palm fruit harvest, and stem increment from March 2013 to April 2014.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For litter collection, 16 litter traps (75 × 75 cm), made from polyvinyl chloride tube frames and nylon mesh (mesh size of 3 mm) and mounted on 1 m-long wooden stakes, were placed on each of the plots except in oil palm plantations (n=24) in randomly selected grids in each plot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Litter collection was done at monthly intervals and the collected litter was sorted into leaves, small woody material (diameter  less_than 2 cm), propagules and inflorescences, which were subsequently oven-dried for 72 h at 60°C until constant mass was attained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the oil palm plantations, all pruned oil palm fronds on each plots were counted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average dry weight per frond, obtained from 16 harvested and dried fronds, was used for the calculation of litter production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oil palm was harvested every two weeks, while rubber was harvested at frequencies depending on season and expected productivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The yield of oil palm fruits and rubber latex (in Mg ha1) was recorded by weighing the harvested fresh material for all trees in each plot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dry weight was then determined after oven-drying representative sub-samples of oil palm fruits (five multiple fruits) and rubber latex (five harvest bowls) at 70 °C to constant mass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these data and the area of the plots we obtained the yield as dry weight per hectare.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Annual above-ground tree woody biomass production (Mg ha1yr1) was calculated from stem increment, measured with dendrometer (UMS, München, Germany), of 40 trees per plot (960 trees in total).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cumulative biomass increment of each tree was calculated as the mass difference of a tree between March 2013 and April 2014, based on the allometric equations used for biomass estimation as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a plot-based estimation of above-ground tree biomass, we applied mean increment rates per plot and tree species for the remaining tree individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An in-growth core measurement was conducted to estimate fine-root productivity in all plots, using the method described by Powell and Day67.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sixteen in-growth cores per plot were installed at random locations (at 30 cm distance from the litter traps) and re-sampling of the cores was done after 810 months.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extracted soil cores were processed in the same manner as done for the fine-root inventory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fine-root growth in the cores was extrapolated to one year and expressed in g dry mass produced per m2 surface area per year, representing the annual fine-root production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine carbon stocks and carbon sequestration, the C concentration of stem wood, fine roots, dead wood, and litter fractions was analysed with a CN Analyzer (Vario EL III, Hanau, Germany) at the University of Göttingen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all methodological details see Kotowska et al.68.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Statistical methods', 'Data were standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Species richness, nutrient flux and yield data were log10-transformed before standardization to avoid heteroscedasticity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a single response was indicated by a single measured indicator variable, we used general linear models for ecological data, and linear mixed models with village as a random grouping factor for household-based data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a single response was indicated by multiple measured indicator variables, we used linear mixed models with plot (ecological data), or household nested in village (household data), as a grouping variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, when including an indicator variable expected to negatively affect the response, we used its additive inverse (see soil fertility and stability in climatic conditions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significance of the transformation system effect and its interaction with the identity of the indicator variables was assessed using F/Wald-tests on models fitted using Maximum-likelihood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the household data we also included these tests for the type of village (transmigrant vs. non-transmigrant) and its interaction with transformation system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences among transformation systems are assessed using Tukey post-hoc tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses were done
