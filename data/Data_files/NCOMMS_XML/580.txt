Flare differentially rotates sunspot on Suns surface  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Sunspots are concentrations of magnetic field visible on the solar surface (photosphere).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was considered implausible that solar flares, as resulted from magnetic reconnection in the tenuous corona, would cause a direct perturbation of the dense photosphere involving bulk motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the sudden flare-induced rotation of a sunspot using the unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution of the 1.6 m New Solar Telescope, supplemented by magnetic data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is clearly observed that the rotation is non-uniform over the sunspot: as the flare ribbon sweeps across, its different portions accelerate (up to 50° h1) at different times corresponding to peaks of flare hard X-ray emission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rotation may be driven by the surface Lorentz-force change due to the back reaction of coronal magnetic restructuring and is accompanied by a downward Poynting flux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results have direct consequences for our understanding of energy and momentum transportation in the flare-related phenomena.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Sunspots on the solar surface are the most visible manifestation of solar magnetic field1,2, which has a direct and critical influence on space weather.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Line-tied to the dense (107 g cm3) photosphere with high plasma beta (ratio of gas to magnetic pressure,  greater than 1; 1 in sunspots), magnetic fields of sunspots and the induced active regions (ARs) extend into the tenuous (1015 g cm3) low-beta ( less_than  less_than 1) corona.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the long-term (in days) evolution of photospheric magnetic field, as driven by surface flows and new flux emergence, plays a key role in shaping coronal field structure and, importantly, building up free energy in the corona that powers solar flares via magnetic reconnection3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the gradual rotational motion of sunspots (generally up to a few degrees per hour) can, in principle, braid and twist the field, leading to an increase of helicity and energy in the corona5,6,7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sunspots frequently exhibit rotation and this has been linked in the past to the storage of free magnetic energy associated with currents flowing through the corona11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Once triggered, solar flares give rise to a variety of emission signatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is generally accepted that accelerated particles can stream down from the magnetic reconnection site in the corona to the low atmosphere along newly formed magnetic loops, producing chromospheric H-alpha and hard X-ray (HXR) emissions14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The former usually appears in eruptive flares as two separating ribbons straddling the magnetic polarity inversion line15; the latter is thought to be due to thick-target bremsstrahlung of high-energy particles16, both reflecting the reconnection process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, the heated plasma evaporates to fill flare loops, emitting soft X-rays (SXRs) and other wavelength emissions as it cools.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As magnetic flux tubes in the corona are anchored in the dense photosphere, the possibility of a non-particle-related, impulsive (in tens of minutes) and permanent photospheric structure change has been ignored in almost all models of flares and the often associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which primarily focus on the coronal field restructuring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, a theory based on momentum conservation predicts that as a back reaction on the solar surface and interior, the photospheric magnetic field would become more horizontal (that is, inclined to the surface) near flaring magnetic polarity inversion lines after flares/CMEs17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This prediction has been confirmed in multiple observations (for example, see refs 19, 20, 21, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the plasma beta within sunspot umbrae and inner penumbrae could be lower than unity2,23, the Lorentz-force change at and below the photosphere, as quantified by the above back reaction theory, may drive bulk plasma motions in sunspots; however, related supporting observations are extremely rare24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is only one study reporting the rotation of a sunspot along with a flare25, but a definite conclusion on its relationship with the flare emission was hampered by insufficient image resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To advance our understanding of the response of the photosphere to the flare-associated coronal restructuring, here we study the 22 June 2015 M6.5 flare (SOL2015-06-22T18:23) using TiO broadband (a proxy for the continuum photosphere near 7,057 Å) and H-alpha red-wing (+1 Å) images with the highest resolution (60 km) ever achieved and rapid cadence (15 and 28 s, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are obtained from the recently commissioned 1.6 m New Solar Telescope (NST)26,27,28,29 at Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO), which is equipped with a high-order adaptive optics system (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high spatiotemporal-resolution imaging capability of NST offers an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the low-atmosphere dynamics in detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also used are time profiles of flare HXR and SXR fluxes from the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor30 and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-15, respectively, and photospheric vector magnetograms from the Solar Dynamics Observatorys (SDOs) Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With these multiwavelength observations, we clearly see the sunspot in this flaring AR rotating when the flare ribbon propagates through it; more importantly, different portions of the spot accelerate (up to 50° h1) at different times corresponding to the flare HXR peaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fast rotation is distinct from the aforementioned slow sunspot rotation seen in the pre-flare stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a comparison, the only other similar study25 used the SDO/HMI intensity data, of which the spatial (temporal) resolution is about 12 (3) times lower than that of the current BBSO/NST data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our highest resolution makes it possible to resolve the differential sunspot rotation and uncover its intrinsic relationship with the flare emission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also analyse the flare-related photospheric vector magnetic field change and find that the observed sunspot rotation may be driven by the Lorentz-force change due to the back reaction of coronal magnetic restructuring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we compute the temporal evolution of the energy (Poynting) and helicity fluxes through the surface, and find that they reverse sign during the flare, suggesting that the energy source for the sudden rotation comes from the corona rather than from below the photosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results have direct consequences for our understanding of energy and momentum transportation in the flare-related phenomena.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Event overview', 'The 22 June 2015 M6.5 flare occurred in NOAA AR 12371 (8°W, 12°N) and was associated with a halo CME.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flare starts at 17:39 universal time (UT), peaks at 18:23 UT and ends at 18:51 UT in GOES 1.612.4 keV SXR flux, and has three (IIII) main peaks in Fermi 2550 keV HXR flux at 17:52:31, 17:58:37 and 18:12:25 UT, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flare core region was covered by the field of view of BBSO/NST, showing two separating flare ribbons in H-alpha (see Fig 1a and also Supplementary Movie 1 of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ribbons in TiO are much weaker but still discernible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the eastern flare ribbon sweeps through the regions of two sunspot umbrae f1 and f2 of positive magnetic polarity (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the movies constructed using the TiO and H-alpha images (Supplementary Movies 13), one can clearly find that f1 and f2 (especially f1) exhibit a sudden rotational motion in the clockwise direction closely associated with the flare.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such observation of a sudden sunspot rotation following a flare, with great details revealed in high resolution, was never achieved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the TiO data are ideal for tracing the photospheric plasma flow motions, especially in sunspot umbrae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1b shows the flow patterns in f1 and f2 right before the flare, derived using the differential affine velocity estimator (DAVE)33 (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It portrays fine-scale umbral flows, with a general pattern of inward motion34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DAVE results allow us to examine the sunspot rotation in a comprehensive way, as described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Flaring region and sunspot dynamics observed with BBSO/NST.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) H-alpha +1 Å image at the second main HXR peak time showing two separating H-alpha ribbons, with flare-related sunspot umbrae labelled as f1, f2, p1 and p2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The white (black) lines contour the 17:58:25 UT vertical magnetic field from SDO/HMI at 1,100 (1,100) G.

see Fig 4a) starts rotating right after the HXR peak I, at a mean angular velocity of 50° h1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Later, as the ribbon proceeds (Fig 3a) the far western portion of f1/f2 seemingly forms a clockwise rotational pattern, which can be visualized by the average flow field in this phase (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean angular velocity of f1 reaches a maximum of 38° h1 at 17:56:23 UT (Fig 4b), about 4 min after the HXR peak I (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is pertinent to point out that the afore-described ellipse fitting under a solid-body assumption shows a significant rotation of f1 only after 17:56 UT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This highlights the differential nature of this sunspot rotation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Phase 2 (from HXR peak II at17:58:37 UT to about peak III at 18:12:25 UT): the flare ribbon, mainly its northern part, moves a significant distance towards the east, across the main regions of f1/f2 (Figs 3c and 4cf).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As can be seen in Fig 6, the southern and eastern portions of f1, represented by features 57 and 810 marked in Figs 3b,d and 4ce, begin a rotation-like motion immediately following the HXR peak II, at a mean angular velocity of 52° and 30°h1, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can also be noticed that the northwestern portion of f1 (for example, features 14) keeps rotating in this phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the entire f1 and f2 display a rotational flow pattern in the clockwise direction (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean angular velocity of f1 has the second maximum of 36° h1 at about 4 min after the HXR peak II and sustains roughly this speed till about 18:08 UT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As for f2, its clockwise rotation keeps accelerating after the HXR peak I, and peaks at 45° h1 about 3.5 min after the HXR peak II (see Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Phase 3 (from about HXR peak III at 18:12:25 UT): the flare ribbon almost moves out of the sunspot region (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rotational flows involving both f1 and f2 diminish, as reflected by the observations that the mean vorticity of f1/f2 largely returns to the pre-flare level (Fig 5), and that drifting features nearly flattens in the re-mapped space-time slice images (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, f1 shows overall westward and southwestward flows (Fig 3f), and it continues to rotate clockwise as a whole (see Fig 2 and Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Taken together, the exceptionally high-resolution observations from BBSO/NST make it possible to witness, for the first time, a sudden sunspot differential rotation that exhibits an intrinsic spatiotemporal relationship with the coronal energy release process, manifested as flare ribbon propagation and HXR emission profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured angular velocity of rotation amounts up to 50° h1, which is much higher than that of the reported pre-flare rotating sunspots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These strongly indicate that the observed sunspot rotation on the photosphere is a result, not a cause, of the flare magnetic reconnection in the corona, which challenges the conventional view of the photosphere-corona coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is worth noting that similar to the propagating ribbon, the negative vorticity feature also progresses from west to east across the sunspot (see Supplementary Movie 5, vorticity evolution).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More exactly, the development of regions of intense negative vorticity follows the flare ribbon motion and concentrates on the portion swept by the ribbon (see Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that the sunspot rotation is intimately linked to the flaring process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The features 17 in the west start rotating as the flare ribbon sweeps by and ensuing the peaks of the HXR emission (Figs 4a,c and 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, features 810 in the east begin to move northeastward (with little rotation, that is, low vorticity) at the HXR peak II (Figs 4c and 6), when the ribbon has not spread to their locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enhancement of the negative vorticity in these regions occur only when the ribbon arrives 5 min later (Fig 4d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two movement stages of the eastern part of f1 are discernible in the time-lapse movie (Supplementary Movie 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For simplicity, we still describe the earlier motions of features 810 as rotations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The umbrae f1/f2 gain maximum angular velocity in a few minutes after the initiation of rotation of sunspot features, consistent with the low Alfvén speed of the photospheric plasma (1020 km s1 in sunspot umbrae).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike f1, no obvious internal rotations are observed within f2; in fact, together they present a coherent rotation (Fig 3d), despite of the sunspot light bridge lying between them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This connotes that f1 and f2 may be parts of a unified magnetic structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the rotational motion of the whole sunspot shows a deceleration after 18:12:29 UT (Fig 2), phase 3 could be an after-effect following phase 1 and phase 2 of the rapid rotation directly related to the flare.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Flare-related magnetic evolution', 'As moving H-alpha ribbons are regarded as a mapping of the reconnecting coronal magnetic field onto the low solar atmosphere14 and HXR emissions could gauge the magnitude of coronal magnetic reconnection3, the revealed correlation between the sunspot rotation and flare emissions motivates us to explore the changes of magnetic field and related quantities, which can shed light on the mechanism of the flare-induced sunspot rotation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To analyse the photospheric magnetic field and its evolution, we use vector magnetograms from SDO/HMI with 12 min cadence and 1 arcsec spatial resolution (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe that the flare causes apparent changes of the sunspot (especially f1) structure, in terms of intensity and vector magnetic field (see Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we mainly concern ourselves with the Lorentz-force change exerted at and below the surface by coronal magnetic field from above, which is attributed to the restructuring of coronal magnetic field in the back reaction theory17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are two HMI measurements made during the main phases of sunspot rotation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 18:00:44 UT (1.5 min into phase 2), the density map of the horizontal component of the Lorentz-force change  Fh (calculated using equation (2) in Methods) is presented in Fig 7a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is remarkable that  Fh forms a swirl in the western portion of f1 and also exhibits a coherent clockwise rotation over regions of f1/f2, resembling a combination of TiO flow patterns of phase 1 and phase 2 (see Fig 3b,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 7b, the  Fh density map at 18:12:44 UT (beginning of phase 3) changes to an overall rotating structure also similar to the flow pattern of phase 3 (Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, similar to the flow vorticity (Fig 4) the  Fh distribution seems to evolve with the ribbon motion; however, this aspect needs to be further addressed when higher cadence vector magnetograms become available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In any case, these hint that the torque T produced by  Fh may drive the sunspot rotation, a scenario also suggested by the only other related study25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For simplicity, ignoring the differential rotation but assuming a rigid rotation of the elliptical f1 around its centre (cross in Fig 7), the time profile of T on f1, as plotted in Fig 8a, shows impulsive T signals closely associated with the rotation of f1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A rough quantitative estimate also indicates that the amount of T on f1 is sufficient compared with that required for the measured rotation (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The torque rapidly decrease to zero soon after the beginning of phase 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the torque evolution is also in line with the observed acceleration followed by deceleration of the overall sunspot rotation (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: Horizontal Lorentz-force change.SDO/HMI vertical magnetic field, with the white (black) colour representing positive (negative) polarity, superimposed with arrows (colour-coded by direction) displaying the horizontal Lorentz-force change vectors between 17:48:44 and 18:00:44 UT (a), and between 18:00:44 and 18:12:44 UT (b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The projected and re-mapped HMI data product is used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Methods for details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arrows are only shown at locations with vertical field  greater than 1,200 G.

'Our observations demonstrate that sunspots f1/f2 rotate as a response of the flare energy release, and that the rotation is progressive and differential, ensuing the flare emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We notice that f1 and f2 are at the footpoints of erupting flux loops, which develop into a halo CME accompanying the present flare.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These loops connect to two other sunspots p1 and p2 in negative field regions (Fig 1a), which vaguely show a similar flare-related clockwise rotation in SDO/HMI data (details, however, are unknown as p1/p2 are out of the field of view of BBSO/NST).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This alludes to the possibility that on the large scale, the observed sunspot dynamics may be linked to the properties of a twisted flux tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With related to sunspot rotation, let us consider theoretically the emergence of a vertical, twisted magnetic flux tube from the interior into the corona37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During its emergence, rapid expansion and stretching occur to the coronal portion of the tube, where the twist rate of the field (=J·B/B2) decreases rapidly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, along the field lines a gradient of the twist rate gets established, and it drives torsional Alfvén waves that propagate twist from the interior into the corona, until a twist balance is reached on a time scale of a few days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This constitutes an explanation of rotating sunspots in emerging flux regions (for example, see refs 8, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if an eruption suddenly happens that stretches out the coronal field again, the gradient of twist rate and hence the torque on the photosphere would increase, which can consequently cause a sudden increase of the sunspot rotational motion in the same direction as before the eruption, as seen in the only other observation of a flare-related sunspot rotation25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under this scenario, it would be expected that the Poynting flux  and also helicity flux  (with the same sign as that before the eruption) injected into the atmosphere by the emerging flux tube would also suddenly enhance40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we observe the exact opposite behaviours of  and  during this eruptive flare event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Therefore, we are led to conclude that the driving agent behind and the energy source of the observed sunspot rotation originates from the corona rather than below the photosphere, most probably associated with the back reaction of the flare-related restructuring of coronal magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also postulate that the torque produced by coronal transients might drive the low atmosphere down to a certain depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Certainly, more observations of the low solar atmosphere in high resolution, together with simulations of photospheric sunspot dynamics41 and further understanding of the photosphere-corona coupling, are desired to tackle the problem of energy and momentum transportation in the flare-related phenomenon.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
