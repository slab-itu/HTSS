Basolateral and central amygdala differentially recruit and maintain dorsolateral striatum-dependent cocaine-seeking habits  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In the development of addiction, drug seeking becomes habitual and controlled by drug-associated cues, and the neural locus of control over behaviour shifts from the ventral to the dorsolateral striatum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The neural mechanisms underlying this functional transition from recreational drug use to drug-seeking habits are unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we combined functional disconnections and electrophysiological recordings of the amygdalo-striatal networks in rats trained to seek cocaine to demonstrate that functional shifts within the striatum are driven by transitions from the basolateral (BLA) to the central (CeN) amygdala.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, while the recruitment of dorsolateral striatum dopamine-dependent control over cocaine seeking is triggered by the BLA, its long-term maintenance depends instead on the CeN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data demonstrate that limbic cortical areas both tune the function of cognitive territories of the striatum and thereby underpin maladaptive cocaine-seeking habits.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cocaine addiction is increasingly considered to stem from progressive neural adaptations to chronic drug exposure1,2,3 subserving a loss of control over drug-seeking behaviour that has become established as habitual4 and predominantly controlled by drug-associated conditioned stimuli in the environment5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mechanisms whereby maladaptive cocaine-seeking habits are established are not yet understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The initiation of cocaine seeking as a goal-directed behaviour6,7 depends on limbic cortico-striatal networks including the nucleus accumbens (Acb) and its functional interactions with the basolateral amygdala (BLA)8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the core of the Acb (AcbC) is suggested to translate drug-related motivation into drug-seeking actions4,9, the BLA encodes Pavlovian incentive associations9,10 and through its projections to the AcbC11 underlies the performance of prolonged sequences of drug seeking reinforced by drug-associated conditioned stimuli (CS) acting as conditioned reinforcers12, bridging delays to drug taking4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the BLA and its interactions with the AcbC are necessary for the acquisition of voluntary cue-controlled cocaine-seeking behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'However, cocaine addiction is not simply a problem of voluntary, or recreational, drug use, but is instead characterized by a compulsive drug-seeking habit4, the transition to which has been shown neurally to depend on functional shifts in the control over behaviour from the ventral to the anterior dorsolateral striatum (aDLS)5,13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus protracted exposure to cocaine recruits neurobiological adaptations in the striatum that progressively spread from the AcbC to the aDLS14,17,18,19,20 finally to consolidate aDLS6,21, dopamine-dependent cocaine-seeking habits13,21 and compulsivity22,23, a hallmark of addiction24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This intrastriatal functional shift has been suggested to depend on the recruitment of the ascending striato-nigro-striatal spiralling dopamine circuitry25,26, which allows control by the AcbC over dorsal striatal dopaminergic processes5,13,27, thereby linking aberrant drug-related incentive motivational processes to a more rigid habit system5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the neural mechanisms that underlie this striatal plasticity in the control over drug seeking are poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite having no direct projections to the aDLS28, as opposed to the posterior dorsomedial striatum28, the BLA is both a key determinant of AcbC activity11,29, which is in turn necessary to recruit DLS-dopamine-dependent cocaine-seeking habits13, and also of the recruitment of aDLS-dependent functions such as response learning in a spatial navigation task30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, synaptic plasticity at the BLAAcbC pathway is involved in both appetitive learning32, reward seeking29 and the strengthening of drug conditioned reinforcement (incubation of cocaine craving) in rats33, that may presage the association between cue-evoked cocaine craving and increased dopamine transmission in the aDLS observed in humans34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore hypothesized that the BLA, through its functional interactions with the ventral striatum, is the neural locus that triggers the recruitment of DLS-dependent cocaine-seeking habits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Behaviourally, habitual cocaine seeking has been operationalized as instrumental responding in over-trained second-order schedules of reinforcement35,36 (SOCR) procedures5,15,37,38 whereby drug seeking during prolonged time periods is under the direct control of the conditioned reinforcing properties of cocaine CSs39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We therefore tested the hypothesis that functionally disconnecting the BLA from dopaminergic transmission in the aDLS may prevent the establishment of cue-controlled cocaine-seeking habits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we combined a pretraining unilateral excitotoxic lesion of the BLA (see Supplementary Fig 1 for the timeline of the experiments), which we predicted would prevent the cocaine-induced functional recruitment of aDLS-dopamine-dependent control over cocaine seeking on this side of the brain, with dopamine receptor blockade in the contralateral aDLS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such an asymmetric manipulation bilaterally disruptsor disconnectsthe functional circuitry linking the BLA to dopaminergic transmission in the DLS recruited via the AcbC13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As predicted, we show that the BLA, which controls the activity of the aDLS through AcbC glutamatergic mechanisms, is required to recruit aDLS control over cocaine seeking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further demonstrate that a functional shift occurs in the amygdala from the BLA to the central nucleus (CeN) over the course of cocaine seeking such that it is the CeN, and not the BLA, that maintains aDLS-dopamine-dependent control over behaviour when cocaine seeking has become habitual.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'BLA recruits aDLS control of cocaine-seeking habits', 'Permanent pretraining unilateral BLA lesions (see Supplementary Fig 2 for histological assessment) did not impair the acquisition of cocaine self-administration nor the acquisition of cue-controlled cocaine-seeking behaviour under a SOCR (Supplementary Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Goal-directed6, cue-controlled cocaine seeking, measured at an early stage of training (Supplementary Fig 1), was sensitive neither to bilateral aDLS-dopamine receptor blockade nor to the BLAaDLS disconnection manipulation (Fig 1a,b left panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus disconnecting the BLA from aDLS-dopamine transmission does not impair cue-controlled cocaine seeking when we have previously shown it to be goal-directed and dependent on the AcbC and the posterior dorsomedial striatum40, but not the aDLS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when rats had an intermediate history of training in cocaine seeking, associated with a moderate increase in active lever presses (from 47 to 73 active lever presses in 15 min) (Fig 1a,b middle panel), behavioural control over cocaine seeking began to devolve to the aDLS as revealed by a limited (27%) but significative effect on cocaine seeking of both bilateral aDLS-dopamine receptor blockade or BLAaDLS disconnection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Basolateral and central amygdala are both necessary to recruit dorsolateral striatum, dopamine-dependent, cocaine-seeking habits.Early-stage cocaine seeking was sensitive neither to bilateral aDLS infusion of -flupenthixol (10 g per side13,40,41) (n=15) (a, left panel) nor to BLAaDLS (n=7) or CeNaDLS (n=12) disconnections (b,c; left panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Active lever responses in each group were impervious to these manipulations (main effect of group, dose, group × dose or lever × dose interaction: Fs1,20 less_than 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When rats had an intermediate training history in cocaine seeking (a,b; middle panel) their responses increased significantly (lever × time interaction: F1,21=13.76 P less_than 0.01, partial 2=0.39) and became slightly sensitive to both bilateral aDLS-dopamine receptor blockade (a) or BLAaDLS disconnections (b) (main effect of group: F1,20=1.17, P=0.29; dose: F1,20=9.98, P less_than 0.01, partial 2=0.33), selectively on active lever presses (lever × dose interaction: F1,20=4.59, P less_than 0.01, partial 2=0.18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CeN was not involved in this initial recruitment of aDLS-dopamine-dependent control over behaviour (main effect of lever: F1,11=31.59, P less_than 0.001 partial 2=0.39; dose and dose × lever interaction: Fs less_than 1) (c, middle panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at a later stage of training, when cocaine seeking has become habitual, while BLAaDLS-dopamine-dependent disconnection and bilateral aDLS-dopamine receptor blockade further dose-dependently reduced active lever presses (a,b; right panel) (46% decrease at the unit dose of 10 g per side and up to 73% at 15 g) (main effect of group: F1,20 less_than 1, lever: F1,20=56.69, P less_than 0.01 partial 2=0.73; dose: F3,60=8.52, P less_than 0.01, partial 2=0.29 and dose × lever interaction: F3,60=7.93, P less_than 0.01, partial 2=0.28), CeNaDLS disconnection resulted also in a dose-dependent decrease in active lever presses (main effect of dose: F3,33=4.24, P less_than 0.05 partial 2=0.28 and dose × lever interaction: F3,33=4.24, P less_than 0.05, partial 2=0.26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inactive lever presses are represented in black.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  *P less_than 0.05, **P less_than 0.01 versus vehicle,

reflecting the emergence of a DLS-dependent cocaine-seeking habit under the control of cocaine-associated CSs5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, as previously described13,21,40, at this later stage of training, cocaine seeking was dose-dependently decreased by bilateral aDLS infusions of the non-selective dopamine receptor antagonist -flupenthixol (Fig 1a right panel), an effect that was dependent on both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors as it was also observed after aDLS infusions of SCH23390 or raclopride, selective antagonists of D1 and D2 receptors, respectively (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, cocaine seeking was similarly dose-dependently decreased by disconnecting the BLA from aDLS dopaminergic mechanisms (Fig 1b right panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus a pretraining unilateral BLA lesion prevented the functional recruitment of the aDLS ipsilaterally, such that otherwise ineffective unilateral dopamine receptor blockade in the contralateral aDLS now resulted in a decrease in cocaine seeking to the same extent as that seen following bilateral aDLS manipulations in non lesioned rats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The effect of causal manipulations of the amygdalo-striatal circuitry on cocaine seeking was attributable to a functional disconnection between the BLA and the DLS because neither unilateral DLS dopamine receptor blockade, nor a double ipsilateral manipulation, impaired instrumental performance (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the BLA is required to recruit intrastriatal functional shifts subserving the development of cocaine-seeking habits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'CeN maintains aDLS control over cocaine-seeking habits', 'Recent evidence that appetitive memories are associated with long-term potentiation of the BLAAcbC pathway and concomitant long-term depression of the BLACeN pathway32 suggests that BLA control over striatal mechanisms as observed here is functionally independent of its connections with, and circuitry involving, the CeN, and thus does not rely on serial processing (BLA-to-CeN) in the amygdala.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the BLA and CeN have also been shown to be involved in parallel and independent processes42; for example, the CeN is functionally linked to the aDLS through its direct projections to the substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons43,44, and via this pathway mediates the invigoration of instrumental responding in the presence of conditioned Pavlovian excitors45,46 and also biases motivation towards specific rewards47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus the CeN projections to the substantia nigra may also be involved in intrastriatal functional shifts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This alternative amygdalo-striatal route, shown to be involved in habitual control over behaviour for natural reinforcers48, may serve as a regulatory route, transmitting arousal caused by presentation of cocaine CSs49 to the aDLS-dependent habit system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore investigated whether disconnecting the CeN from the aDLS could also influence the recruitment of a aDLS-dependent cocaine-seeking habit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As predicted, when cocaine seeking did not depend on the aDLS, that is, early after training40,41, a disconnection combining a selective lesion of the CeN with contralateral aDLS-dopamine receptor blockade had no effect on cocaine seeking (Fig 1c left panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In marked contrast to the effects of a bilateral aDLS manipulation or the BLAaDLS disconnection, the CeNDLS disconnection also had no effect on cocaine seeking after intermediate training (Fig 1c middle panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in contrast, this disconnection markedly decreased well-established, habitual, seeking responses by 70% (Fig 1c right panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The influence of the asymmetric manipulation of the CeN and dopaminergic transmission in the aDLS is attributable to a functional disconnection, since a unilateral CeN lesion or a double ipsilateral manipulation had no effect on the acquisition of cocaine self-administration, cocaine seeking (Supplementary Fig 3) or the expression of cocaine-seeking habits (Supplementary Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus the CeN is involved in the long-term maintenance of cocaine-seeking habits by the aDLS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The lack of effect of the CeNaDLS disconnection at an intermediate stage of training suggests that the CeN is functionally recruited later to exert an influence on the aDLS control over cocaine-seeking behaviour, consolidating a process initiated by the BLA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We therefore sought further to investigate whether the BLA and the CeN were indeed controlling successive, non-overlapping, stages of intrastriatal, dopamine-dependent, functional shifts subserving cocaine-seeking responses5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we tested the influence of acute bilateral inactivation or acute functional disconnection of either amygdala territory from aDLS dopaminergic mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'BLA-to-CeN shift in the control over cocaine-seeking habits', 'Transient inactivation of the BLA by bilateral infusion of a mixture of GABA receptor agonists (baclofen/muscimol (B/M))50 decreased early, but not well-established cocaine-seeking behaviour (Fig 2a), the latter being dependent on aDLS dopaminergic processes (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These drug-seeking habits were not influenced by an acute disconnection of the BLA and aDLS dopaminergic mechanisms, nor were they decreased by a double ipsilateral manipulation of the two structures (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In marked contrast, bilateral inactivation of the CeN, which had no effect on early cocaine seeking (Fig 2a), dramatically decreased well-established cocaine seeking to the same extent as bilateral blockade of aDLS-dopamine receptors (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This habitual cocaine seeking was also dose-dependently decreased by a functional disconnection of the CeN and aDLS, while a double ipsilateral manipulation of these two structures had no effect on instrumental responding (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Basolateral to central amygdala shift in the control over aDLS dopamine-dependent cocaine seeking

animals (in which the amygdalo-striatal system is in the same state as that in experiment 1 when rats received pretraining lesions of the BLA), the BLA should influence the electrophysiological activity of aDLS neurons and this in turn should depend on antecedent glutamatergic mechanisms in the AcbC, the primary striatal target of the network originating from the BLA8,11,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

acid)CNQX (6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione) mixture into the AcbC prior to BLAM1 stimulation in the range of 100300 ms IsI (Fig 3e) completely abolished the increase and decrease in spike

'Together these results demonstrate that associative processing in two domains of the amygdala, namely the BLA and the CeN, are both necessary remotely to engage, through parallel processes, functional shifts in the striatal locus supporting well-established cocaine-seeking behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The influence exerted by the BLA over aDLS pMSNs is bidirectional, potentially reflecting a dopamine-dependent modulation of D1 and D2 dopamine receptor containing neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because this influence requires antecedent glutamatergic transmission in the AcbC, it may reflect the recruitment of the striato-nigro-striatal serial, or loop, circuitry13,25, providing an informational route whereby conditioned incentive processing in the BLA reaches, and controls, aDLS-dopamine-dependent instrumental response mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation warrants further research to understand the routes by which the BLA and CeN control the activity of aDLS MSNs in the course of the development of cocaine-seeking habits in behaving rats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These results also demonstrate that a shift occurs within the amygdala from the BLA to the CeN to support well-established cocaine seeking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, while the BLA is necessary to recruit aDLS-dopamine-dependent mechanisms, the CeN comes online later to maintain aDLS-dependent drug-seeking habits at a point when BLA manipulations are without effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this parallel processing in the amygdala56 may provide two different informational routes whereby conditioned incentive processes control the aDLS-dopamine-dependent habit system5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Future studies will be necessary to define the precise circuitry supporting these amygdalo-striatal interactions57, as well as the mechanisms influencing the shift from BLA-to-CeN control over aDLS mechanisms in the development of cocaine-seeking habits, which may depend on top-down influences of structures such as the infralimbic or insula cortex58,59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'However, the present studies provide clear evidence for independent amydgalo-striatal functional networks linking associative processes in the amygdala, that underlie the motivational salience of drug CSs, to the rigid habit system, resulting in the emergence and persistent performance of maladaptive cocaine-seeking habits5.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
