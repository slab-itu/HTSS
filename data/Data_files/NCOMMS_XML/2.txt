The seasonal sea-ice zone in the glacial Southern Ocean as a carbon sink  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Reduced surfacedeep ocean exchange and enhanced nutrient consumption by phytoplankton in the Southern Ocean have been linked to lower glacial atmospheric CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, identification of the biological and physical conditions involved and the related processes remains incomplete.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we specify Southern Ocean surfacesubsurface contrasts using a new tool, the combined oxygen and silicon isotope measurement of diatom and radiolarian opal, in combination with numerical simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data do not indicate a permanent glacial halocline related to melt water from icebergs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Corroborated by numerical simulations, we find that glacial surface stratification was variable and linked to seasonal sea-ice changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During glacial springsummer, the mixed layer was relatively shallow, while deeper mixing occurred during fallwinter, allowing for surface-ocean refueling with nutrients from the deep reservoir, which was potentially richer in nutrients than today.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This generated specific carbon and opal export regimes turning the glacial seasonal sea-ice zone into a carbon sink.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The past four climate cycles are characterized by a repetitive pattern of gradually declining and rapidly increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, ranging between 180 p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  during glacials and 280 p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  during interglacials1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although multiple processes on land and in the ocean are involved in the modulation of the observed CO2 variability2, physical and biological processes in the Southern Ocean (SO) have been identified to be the key in these changes3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This view is supported by the tight relationship between CO2 and Antarctic temperature development4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most important are changes in ocean ventilation/stratification, sea-ice extent, wind patterns, atmospheric transport of micronutrients (for example, iron) and biological productivity and export, according to proxy and model-based studies3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the scientific progress, the different hypotheses on the SOs sensitivity to modulate the carbon cycle and the identification of involved processes remain under debate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the SO, the availability of silicon nutrients (Si), the consumption by primary producers (diatoms) and cycling pathways are key for effective carbon sequestration8,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The widespread deposition of biogenic opal, which consists primarily in diatoms but also in radiolarians and, to a minor extent, in sponge spicules, allows for the application of specific opal-based proxies to trace these processes and related environmental conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, controversial views exist for the interpretation of the proxies used to trace past productivity and their impact on the carbon cycle3,5,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, glacialinterglacial changes in surface ocean stratification, which control ocean atmosphere exchange and the availability of nutrients, have been discussed contentiously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has resulted in different notions of the impact of physical and biological processes in ice-free and ice-covered areas on the glacialinterglacial climate evolution3,5,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isotope records of diatom-bound nitrogen (15N) are interpreted to indicate a low-productivity glacial seasonal sea-ice zone (SIZ) resulting from constricted nutrient supply to the surface ocean, owing to permanent and enhanced near-surface stratification3,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further information on surface water (euphotic zone) conditions comes from oxygen isotopes (18O) of diatoms, used to identify meltwater supply from the Antarctic continent14,15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Silicon isotope (30Si) measurements on diatoms and sponge spicules provide insights into the development of silicon utilization in surface waters18,19,20 and the silicon inventory of the deep ocean19,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A yet unexploited window into subsurface and deeper water conditions presents the isotope signal from radiolarians (protozooplankton).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In combination with the diatom isotope data, these signals provide an enhanced framework to detect changes of upper and lower water column conditions, and thus the pattern and glacialinterglacial variability of stratification and nutrient exchange.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we apply the new approach to combine 18O and 30Si measurements of diatom and radiolarian opal to two late Quaternary sediment cores (PS1768-8 and PS1778-5) from the sea ice-free Antarctic Zone and from the Polar Front Zone of the Atlantic sector of the SO, respectively (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are aware that the calibration of the new proxies requires further investigations, especially with respect to the isotope fractionation of radiolarians.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we attenuate the lack of data on radiolarian fractionation by combining 30Si measurements from surface sediments and water-column samples available from the study area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As least information is available on oxygen isotope fractionation of radiolarians, we primarily base our 18O-related interpretations on the signals from diatom opal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, the combination of our opal isotope results with other proxy data and climate simulations using a fully coupled global atmosphereocean general circulation model23 (AOGCM) enables the establishment of coherent paleoceanographic scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This combined data/modelling interpretation implies that the glacial near-surface stratification in the SIZ was variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relatively deep mixing during fall and winter allowed for surface-ocean refueling with nutrients from a potentially enriched deep reservoir, which generated a carbon sink in the glacial SIZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Opal-based isotope proxies', 'A critical requirement for appropriate analyses and interpretation of 18O and 30Si in diatom (18Odiat and 30Sidiat) and radiolarian (18Orad and 30Sirad) opal is the extraction and separation of both microfossil groups (Methods, Supplementary Figs 14 and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our diatom fraction (1040 m) used for isotope measurements to reconstruct surface water conditions is dominated by two species: Eucampia antarctica in the lower part of the cores and Thalassiosira lentiginosa in the upper core portions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shift in species composition is abrupt and its timing is unrelated to the glacialinterglacial change of the opal isotope signals (Methods and Supplementary Fig 5), which suggests that the diatom isotope signals are not biased by species-related effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Except for two studies from the North Pacific, this is in line with other investigations, indicating vital effects to be either non-existent or within the analytical reproducibility14,17,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the diatoms, the species composition of the individual radiolarian fractions does not significantly vary throughout the investigated core sections, so that species-related isotope effects in the different fractions remain unlikely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The radiolarian fraction 250 m (PS1768-8) consists of two large-sized species (Actinomma antarctica and Spongotrochus glacialis adult), mainly dwelling in the upper 100400 m of the water column, thus representing surfacesubsurface conditions (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radiolarians assembled in the 125- to 250- m fraction (PS1768-8) and the 125-m fraction (PS1778-5) display a more diverse species composition, also including species with a deeper habitat (400 m)25 (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also rule out seasonal effects, because sediment trap studies show that the diatom and radiolarian export in the SIZ of the SO occur synchronously and are restricted to springsummer26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The 18O signal in diatoms generally depends on both temperature and 18O in seawater17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A robust relationship between diatom 30Si and silicic acid utilization is derived from culture experiments and field data19,20,24,27,28,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diatom culture studies point to a mean fractionation factor of 1.1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24) and show limited variation with species and growth rate19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Larger variability in diatom 30Si fractionation was derived from field data ranging between approximately 0.6 and 2.3, which reflects the natural variation but also the methodological challenge of calculating fractionation offsets19 (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the oxygen and silicon isotope fractionation of diatoms is rather well investigated, the knowledge concerning the isotope fractionation of radiolarians is less developed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The generation of such data is complicated by the lack of successful radiolarian culturing experiments31 and isotope measurements of radiolarians collected in the water column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A first approach to obtain information on this important issue relies on the modelling of a fractionation offset ranging between 1.1 and 2.1 derived from deglacial 30Sirad values32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assist the interpretation of our results, we moved a step forward and estimated the radiolarian fractionation offset (30Sirad) by using 30Sirad values from four surface sediment samples from the Atlantic sector in combination with 30SiSi(OH)4 values from surface and deeper waters close to the surface sediment sample sites29 (Figs 1, 2a,b, and Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that the fractionation of diatoms and sponges is suggested to occur in equilibrium with the surrounding water19,24, it is reasonable to assume that this is also true for the fractionation of radiolarians.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the calculation of 30Sirad, we used the following equation adapted from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21', 'Figure 2: 30Si data of radiolarians (30Sirad) and 30Si offsets in surface sediments compared with Si(OH)4

silicon isotope composition of radiolarian opal and 30SiSi(OH)4 is the silicon isotope composition of sea water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 30Sirad values were calculated with 30SiSi(OH)4 values averaged from two different water depth intervals (0 to 300400 m and 0 to 1,000 m), to cover all possible depth ranges of the included species (Fig 2b and Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The obtained 30Sirad values range between 0.5 and 0.9, and show a linear relationship with the Si(OH)4 concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 30Sirad fractionation offset calculated in our study is more positive than the fractionation applied in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32 (1.1 to 2.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, both fractionation estimates are in the range of the observed diatom fractionation (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modern 30Sirad values display an inverse trend to the Si(OH)4 concentrations29,33 in the upper 400 and upper 1,000 m of the water column (Fig 2a and Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher 30Sirad values of approximately +1.4 correspond to lower Si(OH)4 concentrations of 3045 M l1, whereas lower 30Sirad values of +0.7 and +0.8 correlate with higher Si(OH)4 concentrations of 6798 M l1, which is comparable to the relationship between 30Si values and Si(OH)4 concentrations documented for diatoms and sponges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To test the reliability of the available information on diatom and radiolarian fractionation we calculated 30SiSi(OH)4 from 30Si values of radiolarians and diatoms averaged over the Holocene in both cores (Methods and Supplementary Table 4) and related the obtained 30SiSi(OH)4 data to 30SiSi(OH)4 and Si(OH)4 concentrations reported from modern water column studies29 (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our 30SiSi(OH)4 calculation we considered a fractionation of 1.1 for diatom 30Si data24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the remaining uncertainty in the definition of radiolarian fractionation offsets, we tested the applicability of three offset values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This includes 30Sirad of 0.8 (average estimated offset from this study, Supplementary Tables 3 and 4), 1.5 (average estimated offset from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32) and 1.2 representing an average over both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the Holocene 30SiSi(OH)4 values reconstructed from 30Si of diatoms and surfacesubsurface dwelling radiolarians (250 m fraction) are in the range of 30SiSi(OH)4 values reported from the modern mixed layer (ML) in the Atlantic sector of the SO29 (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 30SiSi(OH)4 values reconstructed from the 30Si data in the radiolarian fractions 125250 m and 125 m, which also include species with a deeper habitat, are shifted towards lower values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These 30SiSi(OH)4 values are in the range of 30SiSi(OH)4 data and Si(OH)4 concentrations from the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW)28,29 (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the application of 30Sirad values of 1.2 and 1.5 leads to realistic seawater Si(OH)4 concentrations, estimates calculated with a fractionation offset of -0.8 tend to result in overestimated Si(OH)4 concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is most apparent for the result from the 125- to 250-m radiolarian fraction (PS1768-8) reaching values comparable to those in modern Northwest Pacific Deep Water20, which exceed CDW concentrations (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although information on isotope fractionation in radiolarians remains incomplete and requires additional efforts (for example, in water column studies and new approaches for radiolarian culturing), our 30Sirad calculations and their relation to modern Si(OH)4 concentrations point to a similar fractionation in diatoms and radiolarians.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assumption represents a step towards quantification of past Si(OH)4 concentration and its variability in surface and subsurface to intermediate-deeper water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Reconstructed 30SiSi(OH4) values and Si(OH)4 seawater concentrations compared

record is punctuated by 18Odiat decreases that are in close correlation with increased values of ice rafted debris (IRD)15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to a more recent geochemical study, IRD in

biogenic silica, also non-biogenic components such as terrigenous minerals and volcanic tephra, may result in lower 18O values and thus bias the isotopic signal towards freshwater-related values17,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the apparent anti-correlation between the content of IRD (mostly tephra) and 18Odiat values in core TN057-13 may not only be explained by salinity decrease due to iceberg melting but also by a contribution from 18O-depleted tephra to the 18Odiat signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, IRD deposition in core PS1768-8 decreases between 18 and 16 cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ka BP.

higher glacial 30Sidiat values around +1.6 and a slight decrease by 0.05 towards the Holocene, which is however within the analytical error (Fig 4h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In comparison with the diatom records, the contrasts between glacial and interglacial 30Sirad values are generally more pronounced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During glacial conditions, the silicon isotope signals of diatoms and radiolarians

also includes signals from intermediate-deeper waters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even more pronounced is the offset between the glacial diatom and radiolarian 30Si signals from the northern core PS1778-5 where the radiolarian fraction 125 m combines species dwelling at surfacesubsurface and intermediate-deeper water depth (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The glacial 30Sirad values range around 1.1 and thus are 2.7 lower than the diatom values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the deglacial transition, surfacesubsurface 30Sirad values in the southern core PS1768-8 increase to 30Sidiat values and remain close to the

surface-water stratification separating the diatom and radiolarian habitats at the time of their production (springsummer).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that the 18Odiat records are not indicative of significant freshwater supply, we suggest that the stratification is primarily induced by sea-ice melt during spring, as melting sea ice has no significant effect on the oxygen isotopic composition of

assisted by seasonal warming and weakening winds as observed in the modern SO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming that the offsets between the 30Sidiat and 30Sirad records reflect stratification in the upper water column, they would point to glacial surface waters with increased silicic acid consumption and subsurface and intermediate deepwaters with higher silicic acid availability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deglacial convergence between the 30Sidiat and 30Sirad records may point to a deepening of the springsummer ML depth (MLD), leading to the same Si pool for surfacesubsurface-dwelling radiolarians (250 m fraction) and surface-dwelling diatoms at site PS1768-8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that this interpretation is strongly based on a radiolarian isotope signal obtained from a nearly monospecific 250 m fraction, we are confident that the 30Sirad signal represents environmental change rather than fractionation effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Modelling glacial sea ice and MLD variability', 'To further evaluate the physical changes associated with sea-ice variations, we re-analysed two model simulations with conditions during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)23 and interglacial periods43, respectively, and performed two additional sensitivity experiments to test the impact of a deglacial CO2 rise and a poleward wind field shift in the SO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All model results are based on simulations using the same fully coupled AOGCM23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model configuration includes the atmosphere component ECHAM5 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  44) at T31

ice formulated using viscous-plastic rheology47, has an average horizontal resolution of 3° × 1.8° with 40 uneven vertical layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The performance of this climate model was evaluated for SO Holocene43 and glacial23 conditions, showing that the glacial and interglacial (pre-industrial) sea-ice field (Supplementary Fig 9) and general ocean circulation can be simulated reasonably well, providing a suitable reference to explore the underlying physical mechanism accounting for the proxy records developed in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model has also been applied to analyse glacial millennial-scale variability48 and warm climates in the Miocene49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For further details of the model and experimental configuration, see Methods and Supplementary Figs 911.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By re-analysing model results for the LGM23 from two latitudinal transects (centred at the respective core locations) across the SO in 10° longitudinal windows (Fig 1), we identify strong seasonal changes in sea-ice cover in the area of both core locations (Fig 5b,c) consistent with the interpretation of a link between vertical stratification changes and seasonal sea-ice variations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These variations result in annual sea-surface salinity and accompanying MLD variations that favour an increase of the MLD during the season of sea ice growth, followed by an MLD decrease when sea ice declines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the glacial simulation shows a relatively shallow glacial ML during austral springsummer, reaching minimum values of 4060 m in the study area (Fig 5), which can be attributed to the melting of sea ice during this time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a pattern would separate the main habitat depth of diatoms from the deeper living radiolarians as suggested by the glacial diatom-radiolarian 30Si offset (Fig 4d,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An MLD deepening is simulated for fallwinter seasons, which is promoted by enhanced vertical mixing during sea-ice

enhanced in-situ sea-ice formation and northward sea-ice export, which are key processes for SO deep water formation during the LGM (for example, see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23).Full size image', 'To test the robustness of this interpretation, zonal heterogeneities in sea-ice distribution need to be taken into account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we evaluated the seasonal MLD changes for both the exact latitudes of the core locations (Fig 5, dashed lines) and the latitudes where the physical conditions coincide with the proxy-based LGM WSIC (Fig 5, solid lines).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The respective WSIC amounts on average to 60% at PS1768-8 and to 41.6% at PS1778-5 (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach ties the proxy-based information from the sediment cores to physical conditions simulated by the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on this approach, we can estimate that during glacial springsummer the MLD reached minimum values between 40 and 60 m at both studied sites and increased during sea-ice formation in fallwinter, reaching a maximum depth of up to 350 m at the site located in the area of the GWIE (Fig 5a).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The combination of proxy data and AOGCM modelling implies that the sea surface of the glacial SIZ and the GWIE, at least in the Atlantic sector, was distinctly stratified during austral springsummer with a relatively shallow MLD (4060 m; Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased glacial deposition of iron50,51 released from the melting winter sea ice transformed the glacial SIZ into a seasonally high productivity region governed by primary producers with low Si:N demand5, leading to enhanced utilization of nitrate3,13, slightly reduced consumption of silicic acid and low opal export50 (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar productivity regime was triggered by iron-fertilization experiments in the modern SO, showing that involved diatoms (for example, Chaetoceros) follow a boom-and-bust life cycle strategy characterized by rapid biomass build-up during favourable growth conditions, succeeded by mass mortality and rapid population decline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a productivity regime results in enhanced organic carbon but low biogenic opal export to the deep ocean and thus leads to the decoupling of biogenic carbon and opal export12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to modern conditions, this would convert the glacial SIZ, which was enlarged during the glacial34,52, into an efficient carbon sink during springsummer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Authigenic uranium concentrations, a potential proxy for organic carbon deposition, support this view, because they display increased values in sediments deposited in the glacial SIZ50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For the area of the GWIE (PS1778-5), modelling suggests even longer-lasting springsummer stratification compared with the glacial SIZ (PS1768-8) (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in this environment a different productivity-export regime developed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This regime is characterized by the production of thick-shelled diatoms (Si:N ratios 4, ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  53) leading to enhanced silicic acid utilization (30Sidiat=+1.62 to +1.86) at the sea surface and high percentages of biogenic opal in the sediments5,50 (Fig 4h,j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Species involved (for example, Fragilariopsis kerguelensis)5 follow a persistence strategy and are hallmarked by enhanced ability to withstand grazing pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are most prominent producers in the modern iron-limited open SO and present efficient silica sinkers12 with a major contribution to the modern Antarctic opal belt5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sediment records suggest that this regime extended from the glacial SIZ into the area of the modern Subantarctic Zone as mirrored by increased opal flux and dominant deposition of F.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  kerguelensis5,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The northward displacement of the zone of enhanced opal burial (opal belt) together with winter sea-ice expansion50 during glacial periods was identified to represent a phenomenon most difficult to explain3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Queries concern the northward transfer of required nutrients from the glacial Antarctic Zone, assuming that surface water stratification resulted in reduced nutrient supply and almost complete consumption of available nutrients in this zone during the glacial3,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Suggested explanations address increased leakage of silica into the Subantarctic region3,54 and northward-shift in wind-driven upwelling13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We emphasize a process (nutrient supply by winter mixing) that has been previously rejected13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our modelling suggests that the shallow springsummer stratification was disrupted by a significant MLD increase during glacial austral winter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulations indicate that the winter MLD is more than double the summer MLD in the area of PS1768-8 (200 m) and up to 350 m close to the GWIE (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Around the GWIE and north of it, thus in the zone of enhanced glacial opal export50, modelling indicates even deeper ML conditions during glacial winter (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a deep MLD would allow for efficient nutrient refueling of glacial winter surface waters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A deep winter mixing would provide high nutrient (for example, Si(OH)4) availability at the onset of springsummer production when surface water stratification is suggested to develop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar winter mixing process between ML, Winter Water and CDW is also suggested to take place in the modern SO (refs 29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During springsummer stratification, nutrient supply to the ML may be accomplished by diapycnal diffusion as described from the modern SO (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Amplification of the nutrient injection into the glacial surface ocean may stem from the presence of a deep reservoir that was more enriched in Si(OH)4 compared with modern conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 30Sidiat values at both studied sites point to similar isotopic compositions of the glacial ML and the modern ML (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the glacial radiolarian-derived 30SiSi(OH)4 signal that can be related to surfacesubsurface conditions (fraction 250 m) is close to modern 30SiSi(OH)4 values reported from the nutrient replete Winter Water and CDW in the Atlantic sector south of the Antarctic Polar Front.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the Holocene, the glacial radiolarian-derived 30SiSi(OH)4 values from the fractions 125250 m and 125 m, which reflect intermediate and deeper water conditions as well, are distinctly lower.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These lower values fall in the range of 30SiSi(OH)4 values reported from the modern deep Northwest Pacific (approximately +0.5), which are related to the highest Si(OH)4 concentrations observed in the World Ocean (160180 mol l1)20 (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our estimates still bear uncertainties, our reconstructions using different radiolarian fractionation offsets consistently result in lower glacial 30SiSi(OH)4 values and thus higher glacial Si(OH)4 concentrations in SO intermediate deepwaters compared with the Holocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The suggested presence of higher Si(OH)4 concentrations in glacial circumpolar deep waters may be challenged by sponge spicule-based 30Si records from the Scotia Sea, interpreted to indicate that the glacial deep Si(OH)4 concentrations were not different from modern conditions21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the records exhibit very negative 30Si values (3 to 3.5) and thus are in a range where the application of this proxy to sponge spicules is prone to larger uncertainties56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another sponge spicule-derived 30Si record from the area straddled by the Subtropical Front (ODP1089, Fig 1), indicating no significant glacialinterglacial contrast in bottom water Si(OH)4 concentration in the Atlantic sector22, is not in conflict with our results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, this observation allows for approximation of the northern extent of higher Si(OH)4 concentrations trapped in the glacial SO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presuming a similar relationship between modern and glacial biogenic opal deposition and decline of high silicic acid concentration throughout the water column (Supplementary Fig 12), the northward displacement of the biogenic opal belt by 5° in latitude50 would place the glacial silicic acid front in the area between 50 and 45°S, but not as far north as the area of site ODP1089 (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in line with a northward migration of the Subantarctic Front as postulated from the mapping of 14C reservoir ages57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further support comes from the pattern of LGM surface water temperature34 and model simulations, indicating a frontal northward displacement by 5°7° in latitude from interglacial to glacial conditions (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A glacial SO trapping nutrients more efficiently than at present is consistent with the scenario of an Antarctic deep water body, whose age relative to the atmosphere was more than two times older than during the Holocene, and which was presumably CO2 enriched57 and characterized by increased salinity as mirrored by our model23 and suggested by proxy data58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Possible mechanisms that have an impact on the nutrient trapping may include wind-generated changes of upwelling and downwelling in the SO, sea-ice extent variability and the availability of iron54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A glacial northward export of the nutrient Si (Silicic Acid Leakage Hypothesis) would be in some conflict with a glacial SO nutrient enrichment, but data suggest that enhanced Si leakage was confined to the deglacial period19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the sponge spicule-derived 30Si record from the Subantarctic Atlantic (ODP1089, Fig 1) indicates a bottom water spillout of the SO reservoir during this time, marked by a distinct 30Si excursion towards more negative values (increased Si(OH)4 concentrations)22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such Si(OH)4 export would support the hypothesis that an expansion of Si(OH)4-enriched Antarctic Bottom Water was the source for maximum opal fluxes (diatom blooms) in the coastal upwelling area off northwest Africa during the last deglaciation59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The glacialinterglacial transition is characterized by successive changes, starting with the retreat of the sea ice that is accompanied by an increase in opal sedimentation between 18,000 and 16,000 years ago (Fig 4e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is followed by a steep increase in ocean ventilation at about 15,000 years ago58 (Fig 4b), which marks the rapid intensification in Atlantic thermohaline circulation at the onset of the Bølling60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming that the deglacial convergence between our 30Sidiat and 30Sirad records reflects a deepening of the springsummer MLD as proposed above, the MLD deepening would coincide with increased biogenic opal rain (Fig 4d,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to a data gap in our 250 m radiolarian record in PS1768-8, we cannot document exactly the onset of the change in surface water structure in the glacial SIZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, considering that the available record is closely tied to the retreat of sea ice and increasing deposition of biogenic opal (Fig 4df), we speculate that the process of MLD deepening was initiated around 18,000 years ago, and that the MLD possibly reached its maximum thickness at around 14,000 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In core PS1768-8, this is documented by the lowest 30Sidiat values in the studied sediment interval (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These 30Sidiat minima that are only recorded by surface dwellers (diatoms) during a time of enhanced ventilation and maximum biogenic opal export suggest that the supply of silicic acid exceeded the consumption by diatoms during this time interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This points to the injection of nutrient-rich deep waters into the euphotic zone5, interpreted to result from enhanced wind-driven upwelling governing biogenic opal production and export6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The deglacial MLD deepening leads to conditions that persist in the Holocene (PS1768-8) as recorded by diatom and surfacesubsurface radiolarian (250 m) 30Si, which can be related to modern ML conditions in the Atlantic sector of the SO (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Holocene down-core data are comparable to available 30Sidiat and 30Sirad data from surface sediments (assumed to reflect modern conditions) in the study area (Fig 4d,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It has been postulated that the destratification and enhanced upwelling during the last deglaciation allowed for a CO2 release from the deep SO, providing a direct link to the coinciding increase in atmospheric CO2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primary mechanisms proposed to drive the destratification is a southward shift in the Southern Westerlies winds in response to a displacement of the Earths thermal equator, the Intertropical Convergence Zone6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another mode of operation can be derived from our sensitivity experiments applying a prescribed atmospheric CO2 increase from 180 to 240 p.p.m.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (representing a surrogate for deglacial warming) and a poleward shift of the Southern Westerlies wind belt by 3° (Supplementary Figs 10 and 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sensitivity experiments show that the poleward shift of the Westerlies has a negligible effect on the position of the Antarctic Polar Front and MLD in comparison with the changes induced by the increase in atmospheric CO2 (Supplementary Figs 10 and 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the destratification during the last deglaciation can be primarily attributed to sea-ice margin retreat induced by atmospheric warming and an associated southward shift of the seasonal sea-ice melting zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The view that sea ice presents the major player in governing SO glacial surface-water structure and related oceanatmosphere exchange, nutrient cycling and biological productivity and export regimes entrains major implications to be considered for the estimation of SO effects on the climate system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of the impact of physical and biological processes in the SO on the glacial carbon cycle requires consideration of seasonal variability in sea-ice extent and related seasonal and spatial variability in surface ocean mixing rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other factors to be taken into account are the development of specific productivity regimes making the SIZ an efficient carbon sink and the area north of the sea-ice edge a region that primarily affects the Si cycle, and the potential establishment of a nutrient-enriched deep SO reservoir.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Stratigraphy', 'To generate reliable age models for the studied cores, which lack continuous foraminiferal isotope records and carbonate-based AMS14C data series, we considered the strategy and stratigraphic data presented in a compilation of last glacial sea-surface temperature and sea-ice records from the Atlantic sector of the SO38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have revised the correlation of 12 cores including PS1768-8 and PS1778-5 using 53 AMS14C dates from 8 cores (with 3 AMS14C dates available from PS1768-8) in addition to intercore correlation based on different parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AMS14C dates were converted to calendar years and presented as cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ka BP (103 years before present).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parameters used for intercore correlation include the abundance pattern of the radiolarian Cycladophora davisiana and the diatom E. antarctica, together with foraminiferal oxygen isotope records, if available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correlations were performed with AnalySeries 2.0 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The age assignment of the radiolarian and diatom abundance pattern was inferred from AMS14C dates obtained from 12 cores from the study area38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stratigraphic pointers for both cores (including the AMS14C dates from PS1768-8) and their definition are presented in Supplementary Tables 5 and 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this approach to construct age models for SO records bears uncertainties due to interpolations, especially in (mostly glacial) intervals that could not be dated by continuous 14C dates or 18O data, we are confident that our age model is robust enough to allow for appropriate documentation of the environmental development from the last glacial into the present interglacial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to our age models, the summer SST and WSIC began to shift towards Holocene values between 18 and 16 cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ka BP (Fig 4 and Supplementary Figs 7 and 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This timing fits well with the onset of Southern Hemisphere warming and the start of CO2 release documented in Antarctic ice cores, dated independently of our approach62,63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increase and decline of biogenic opal sedimentation is similar to the pattern recorded from the nearby core TN057-13 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in contrast to TN057-13, the biogenic opal, summer SST and WSIC records in our core PS1768-8 display no distinct variations, which can clearly be attributed to short-term climate variability (for example, the Antarctic Cold Reversal) during the last deglacial period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be attributed to three- to fourfold higher sedimentation rates at site TN057-13 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6) compared with site PS1768-8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Isotopes in biogenic opal', 'A prerequisite for measuring 18O and 30Si in diatom and radiolarian opal is the careful extraction and separation of sufficient purified material from both microfossil groups (Supplementary Figs 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because the different life strategies and depth habitats of the two microfossil groups and different species within these groups, as well as contamination by sponge spicules and non-biogenic components (for example, rock fragments and clay minerals), may affect the isotope signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For our study we have applied a new method, which allows for the separation of pure diatom and radiolarian fractions from the same sample aliquot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With our technical setup, an average of 2 mg purified diatom or radiolarian opal per sample is needed to obtain combined 18O and 30Si measurements from the same sample aliquot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This represents the lowest amount yet used for such combined measurements in comparison with other measuring techniques64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that replicates and triplicates should be measured, as far as sample availability allows, to test the reproducibility of the measurements, the amount of opal to be separated and to be enriched increases accordingly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This precludes in general the separation of radiolarians by picking single radiolarian skeletons, because such a procedure takes an extraordinary expenditure of time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To generate well-established and large sample sets, a routine preparation method has been developed allowing for the removal of non-biogenic components and biogenic carbonate followed by the separation and enrichment of radiolarians and diatoms in specific size fractions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Sample preparation includes wet-chemical cleaning and extraction of radiolarian and diatoms through different sieving and settling techniques (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples are first washed with HCl and H2O2 to remove carbonates and organic material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mineral grains are removed through density separations (on average ten density treatments for silica-rich sediments from the SO) using specific sodium polytungstate solutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The separation of radiolarians from diatoms and sponge spicules is accomplished through several sieving and settling steps combined with ultrasonic treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our tests show that after ultrasonic treatment radiolarians are still intact, whereas diatoms break up and can be removed through sieving.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repetitions of ultrasonic treatment and sieving steps lead to the separation and enrichment of radiolarians and diatoms in different size fractions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For isotope determinations, we use the pure 1040 m diatom fraction (both cores), the 250-m and the 125- to 250-m pure radiolarian fraction for core PS1768-8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As there was not enough material, we could only use one radiolarian fraction (125 m) for core PS1778-5 and one radiolarian fraction (250 m or 125 m) for each surface sediment sample (Supplementary Tables 3 and 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The smaller size fraction 40125 m contains radiolarians and diatoms of similar size, which are difficult to separate from each other and thus were not used for isotope measurements.

Europa 2020 mass spectrometer according to the method described in refs 65, 66.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 18O/16O reference ratio of known isotopic composition is measured in analogy to the 18O/16O sample and the final 18O value was calculated relative to Vienna standard mean ocean water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For silicon isotope measurements, the separated and cleaned SiF4 gas was directed into glass vials and measured separately with a Finnigan MAT 252 mass spectrometer and measured against the 30Si/28Si reference ratio of a SiF4 gas of known isotopic composition18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final 30Si value

measurements', 'In general, contamination of biogenic opal samples by minerals (for example, quartz, feldspar, micas, clay minerals, rock fragments and volcanic tephra) can bias, especially the 18O signal towards lower values17,40, a pattern that may lead to misinterpretation of the isotope results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that the contaminants may be silicates that are difficult to remove with the generally applied cleaning methods, the purity of the samples cleaned for isotope measurements needs to be tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can document that the cleaning procedure applied in our

depths, we used data from a plankton study in the Atlantic sector of the SO (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25), to get information about the depth habitat of radiolarians in the upper 1,000 m of the water column (Supplementary Fig 13 and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both species occur in the upper 200400 m with S. glacialis predominantly occurring in the upper 100 m and A. antarctica in the upper 300400 m. As there was not enough material to separate the 250-m fraction from core PS1778-5, we used here the 125-m fraction for radiolarian isotope measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fraction is also dominantly composed of the two species A. antarctica and S. glacialis, but in contrast to the 250-m fraction from core PS1768-8 the 125-m fraction also contains deeper living species (for example, Spongopyle osculosa, Spongogurus pylomaticus and Cromyecheinus antarctica) that occur in water depths 400 m (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the 30Sirad values of the 125-m fraction exhibit distinctly lower values (glacial average 1.06) than the 30Sirad values from the 250-m fraction from core PS1768-8 (average glacial values +0.54), we segregated the 125- to 250-m fraction from core PS1768-8 to get more information about this latitudinal difference in the 30Si signature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 30Sirad measurements from this fraction show distinctly lower values (glacial average 0.67) than the 30Sirad values from the 250-m fraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fraction 125250 m also includes deeper dwelling radiolarians similar as in the 125-m fraction from core PS1778-5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the presence of deeper dwelling radiolarians shifts the 30Si signal to lower values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C. davisiana, a species typical for glacial assemblages, is not included to the fractions 125 m because of its small size, which impedes a potential impact of this species on glacial results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Estimation of 30SiSi(OH)4 and Si(OH)4

that our reconstructed 30SiSi(OH)4 values reflect a rather broad range in Si(OH)4 concentrations (Fig 3 and Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In spite of this large range in variability, our calculated 30SiSi(OH)4 values for the diatoms and different radiolarian fractions are in the range of 30SiSi(OH)4 values of specific water masses and reflect their range in Si(OH)4

diatom taxa/taxa groups, logarithmic-transformed diatom data, quadratic regression and a three-factor model with a root mean square error of prediction of 7.3% (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  35).
