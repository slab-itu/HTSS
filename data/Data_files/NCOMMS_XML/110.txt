Carbon-depleted outer core revealed by sound velocity measurements of liquid ironcarbon alloy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The relative abundance of light elements in the Earths core has long been controversial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, the presence of carbon in the core has been emphasized, because the density and sound velocities of the inner core may be consistent with solid Fe7C3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the longitudinal wave velocity of liquid Fe84C16 up to 70 GPa based on inelastic X-ray scattering measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find the velocity to be substantially slower than that of solid iron and Fe3C and to be faster than that of liquid iron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thermodynamic equation of state for liquid Fe84C16 is also obtained from the velocity data combined with previous density measurements at 1 bar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The longitudinal velocity of the outer core, about 4% faster than that of liquid iron, is consistent with the presence of 45 at.% carbon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, that amount of carbon is too small to account for the outer core density deficit, suggesting that carbon cannot be a predominant light element in the core.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Sound velocity and density are important observational constraints on the chemical composition of the Earths core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While properties of solid iron alloys have been extensively examined by laboratory studies to core pressures ( greater than 136 GPa)1,2,3, little is known for liquid alloys because of experimental difficulties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The core is predominantly molten, and the longitudinal wave (P-wave) velocity of liquid iron alloy is the key to constraining its composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, previous static high-pressure and -temperature (PT) measurements of liquid iron alloys were performed only below 10 GPa using large-volume presses4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shock wave experiments have been carried out at much higher pressures but only along a specific Hugoniot PT path7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "Carbon is one of the possible light alloying components in the core because of its high cosmic abundance and strong chemical affinity with liquid iron9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its high metal/silicate partition coefficients indicate that thousands of parts per million to several weight percent of carbon could have been incorporated into the core during its formation9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, recent experimental and theoretical studies12,13 have suggested that solid Fe7C3 may explain the properties of the inner core, in particular its high Poisson's ratio14,15, supporting the presence of carbon in the core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ", 'In this study, we determine the P-wave velocity (VP) (equivalent to bulk sound velocity, V, in a liquid) of liquid Fe84C16 at high PT based on inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS) measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined with its density data at 1 bar (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16) both velocity and density () profiles of liquid Fe84C16 along adiabatic compression are obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are compared with seismological observations, indicating that both VP and  in the Earths outer core are not explained simultaneously by liquid FeC.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Longitudinal wave velocity measurements', 'We collected the high-resolution IXS spectra from liquid Fe84C16 (4.0±0.3 wt.% carbon) at static high PT using both resistance- and laser-heated diamond-anvil cells (Methods; Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The starting material was synthesized beforehand as a mixture of fine-grained Fe and Fe3C at 5 GPa and 1,623 K in a multi-anvil apparatus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental PT conditions were well above the eutectic temperature in the FeFe3C binary system (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The carbon concentration in the eutectic liquid is known to be 3.84.3 wt.% at 1 bar to 20 GPa (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17), almost identical to the composition of our sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Above 20 GPa, we heated the sample to temperatures comparable or higher than the melting temperature of Fe3C, a liquidus phase in the pressure range explored, assuring a fully molten sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molten state of the specimen was carefully confirmed, before and after the IXS measurements, by the absence of diffraction peaks from the sample (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We sometimes, depending on a sample volume, were also able to observe the diffuse diffraction signal typical of a liquid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Typical inelastic X-ray scattering spectra.These data were collected at 26 GPa and 2,530 K at momentum transfers Q, as indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectra include three components: a quasi-elastic peak near zero energy transfer (blue), longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonon mode of liquid Fe84C16 (red), and transverse acoustic (TA) phonon mode of diamond (turquoise).Full size image', 'Figure 2: X-ray diffraction spectra before and after melting.They were collected at 2,160 K (a), 1,810 K (b) and 1,690 K (c) during heating at 31 GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The starting material was composed of Fe ( or ) and Fe3C (c), and the peaks of Al2O3 (a) were from a thermal insulator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coexistence of - and -Fe phases at 1,610 K was due to a sluggish solidsolid phase transition49 and the peaks from the -phase were lost at 1,810 K. All sample peaks disappeared between 1,810 and 2,160 K. In addition, the background was enhanced slightly, indicating a diffuse scattering signal from a liquid sample.Full size image', 'The VP of liquid Fe84C16 was determined between 7.6 and 70 GPa (Fig 3

21, 22, 23; note that a starting material in the present experiments was a mixture of these solid phases) (Fig 5), confirming that we measured a liquid sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The velocities of a fictive solid Fe84C16 alloy are also estimated assuming a linear velocity change between Fe (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24) and Fe3C (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23) indicating that VP drops by 13% upon melting at 2,300 K, a eutectic temperature at 45 GPa (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a velocity change is comparable to that expected for pure Fe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in V between solid and liquid Fe84C16 is very small (1.8%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the VP of our liquid Fe84C16 sample is 314% faster at 870 GPa than that of liquid Fe determined by shock-wave study8

that the VP of liquid Fe84C16 is also not sensitive to temperature with the temperature effect much smaller than the uncertainty in the present velocity determinations (±3%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

taken to be temperature dependent16 (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We fit equation (1) to our PVP data for liquid Fe84C16 and find KS0=110±9 GPa and KS=5.14±0.30 when T0=2,500 K (Supplementary Table 2 and

value for KS0 is similar to that for liquid iron8 but for KS is higher than that for pure iron, KS=4.7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that liquid Fe84C16 becomes progressively stiffer than liquid Fe with increasing pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found VP0=4,121±177 m s1 for liquid Fe84C16 from KS0 and 0, in good agreement with a previous study28 of liquid Fe86C14 at 1 bar (4,050 m s1) and

larger than KT0=55.4 GPa for liquid Fe86C14 at 1,500 K and KT0=50 GPa for liquid Fe75C25 at 1,973 K from previous density measurements29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the calculated density for Fe84C16 using the present EoS are in reasonable agreement with the previous density measurements of Fe75C25 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29) (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The disagreement of elastic parameters with such earlier experiments may be attributed either to the limited pressure range of the previous density determinations, or to a different structure or magnetic (or electronic) change in the state of the liquid FeC at low pressure, as has been suggested from the change in compressional behaviour of liquid Fe78C22 around 5 GPa (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data were collected above

the VP of liquid Fe by as large as 0.8%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the effect of carbon is much larger than a recent theoretical prediction of only 0.2% increase in velocity per 1 at.% carbon at 136 GPa

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We now compare the sound velocity and density of liquid Fe84C16 and liquid Fe with the seismologically based PREM model35 for the outer core (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The VP and  of liquid Fe are 4.6% slower and 10.18.6% denser, respectively, than the PREM at the CMB (3,6004,300 K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To match the PREM values, considering the uncertainty of data extrapolation to higher pressures (Supplementary Note 1), only 5.24.0 at.% (1.20.9 wt.%) carbon is required to match the velocity, whereas 15.412.0 at.% (3.82.9 wt.%) carbon is necessary to account for the density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, carbon cannot be a predominant light element in the outer core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 8: Effect of carbon on the velocity and density of liquid Fe at 136 GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Velocity and (b) density for liquid Fe84C16 at TCMB=4,300 K (red) and 3,600 K (blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Present results (closed diamonds, solid curves) are compared with theoretical calculations34 (triangles, broken curve).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data for pure Fe are from shock compression study8 (open diamonds) and theoretical calculations26 (closed circles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PREM denotes seismological observations35 at the CMB.Full size image', 'These results suggest there is  less_than 5.2 at.% (1.2 wt.%) carbon in the outer core, consistent with the previous cosmochemical and geochemical arguments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the silicate portion of the Earth exhibits much higher 13C/12C isotopic ratio than that of Mars, Vesta and chondrite meteorites, as may be attributed to a strong enrichment of 12C in core-forming metals9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The carbon isotopic fractionation that occurred during continuous core-formation process proposed previously36,37 will give a reasonable 13C/12C ratio in the silicate Earth, and yields 1 wt.% carbon in the core9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Wood et al.9 demonstrated that carbon strongly affects the chemical activity of Mo and W in liquid metal, so that their abundance in the mantle can be explained by partitioning between silicate melt and core-forming metal with 0.6 wt.% carbon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been repeatedly suggested that the inner core may be composed of Fe7C3, which accounts for high Poissons ratio observed14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystallization of solid Fe7C3 from a liquid outer core with  less_than 1.2 wt.% carbon may still be possible if sulfur is also included in the core38.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
