A substrate-bound structure of cyanobacterial biliverdin reductase identifies stacked substrates as critical for activity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Biliverdin reductase catalyses the last step in haem degradation and produces the major lipophilic antioxidant bilirubin via reduction of biliverdin, using NAD(P)H as a cofactor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the importance of biliverdin reductase in maintaining the redox balance, the molecular details of the reaction it catalyses remain unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present the crystal structure of biliverdin reductase in complex with biliverdin and NADP+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, two biliverdin molecules, which we designated the proximal and distal biliverdins, bind with stacked geometry in the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nicotinamide ring of the NADP+ is located close to the reaction site on the proximal biliverdin, supporting that the hydride directly attacks this position of the proximal biliverdin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of mutagenesis studies suggest that a conserved Arg185 is essential for the catalysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distal biliverdin probably acts as a conduit to deliver the proton from Arg185 to the proximal biliverdin, thus yielding bilirubin.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Biliverdin reductase (BVR, EC 1.3.1.24), first discovered in the 1960s (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1), is the enzyme that converts biliverdin IX (BV), a product of haem degradation, to bilirubin IX (BR); this product is a bile pigment and a source of jaundice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because BR forms intra-molecular hydrogen bonds, this reduction reaction causes the bilin pigment to change from hydrophilic to lipophilic2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neonatal jaundice is a common disease in newborns; light therapy dramatically reduces the symptoms by changing the conformation of BR and breaking these intra-molecular hydrogen bonds, causing BR to become more hydrophilic and thus promoting its excretion3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although over-accumulation of BR is toxic, at physiological concentrations BR is the major antioxidant responsible for protecting cells from H2O2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concomitant with H2O2-scavenging, BV produced by oxidation of BR is rapidly reduced back to BR by BVR, thereby amplifying its antioxidant efficiency 10,000-fold even though the BR concentration in tissues is quite low (2050 nM:  less_than 0.1% level as compared with glutathione)5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The depletion of BVR by RNA interference markedly increases the level of reactive oxygen species and causes apoptotic cell death4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, BVR plays a crucial role in the maintenance of intracellular redox balance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'BVR catalyses the reduction of the C10 double bond (-methene bridge) of BV using NAD(P)H to produce BR, a reaction in which the hydride (H: a proton and two electrons) is donated by NAD(P)H (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reaction also requires one additional proton to reduce the C10 double bond, but this proton donor has remained enigmatic for the past 50 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, the catalytic residue in the BVR protein moiety remains to be identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several crystallographic analyses have been performed to date: the structures of rat BVR in the apo-form and in complex with NAD+ have been reported by two independent groups6,7, and the structure of human BVR in complex with NADP+ has been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 2H63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These crystallographic analyses revealed the binding site and mode of NAD(P)+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the substrate-binding site remained unclear, the residues located around the nicotinamide ring of NAD+ were considered strong candidates for the catalytic residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, however, extensive site-directed mutagenesis experiment revealed that alteration of these residues did not affect enzymatic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One exception was Tyr97 in rat BVR, which is located in the immediate vicinity of the nicotinamide ring; mutation of this residue reduces activity by 50% (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, Tyr97 promotes the enzymatic reaction, probably by indirectly influencing hydride transfer from NAD(P)H, but is not essential for catalysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Reaction catalysed by BVR.The C10 double bond (-methene bridge) in BV is reduced by hydride from the cofactor, and the pyrrole nitrogen of the ring is protonated (hydride and proton are depicted on grey circular backgrounds on the product, BR).Full size image', 'Other characterizations of the mechanism underlying the BVR-catalysed reaction have been carried out, for example, investigations of substrate specificities using synthesized tetrapyrrole compounds8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments examined a wide variety of tetrapyrrole compounds, including not only structurally modified alkyl side chains of tetrapyrrole but also BV isomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results revealed the invariant features of the BVR substrate: BVR exhibits a broad bilin substrate specificity, but strictly requires a propionate as the tetrapyrrole side chains11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a carboxyl group with a dissociable proton on the propionate side chain is essential, because its methyl- or azo-esterification completely abolishes BVR activity12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report the X-ray structures of the apo-, NADP+-bound and BVNADP+ complex forms of BVR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the structure of the substratecofactorenzyme ternary complex of BVR, revealing a binding mode in which two biliverdin molecules bind with stacked geometry in the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This structure and the results of site-direct mutagenesis can explain how BVR reduces BV to BR, thus resolving a longstanding mystery regarding the BVR reaction mechanism.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Overall structure of apo-BVR from cyanobacteria', 'In this study, we used a cyanobacterial BVR from Synechocystis sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCC 6803 (Syn BVR)13 as a target for the structural analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detailed properties of the purified Syn BVR, such as oligomeric state, are described in Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All previous trials aimed at determining the structure of the substrate-binding site of rat BVR were unsuccessful6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Syn BVR is composed of 328 residues and shares more than 20% sequence identity with rat and human BVR proteins (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined the crystal structure of Syn BVR by the single isomorphous replacement method coupled with anomalous scattering method using an Au-derivative crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure of apo-Syn BVR was refined at 2.1 Å resolution to R and Rfree values of 0.200 and 0.239, respectively (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The asymmetric unit contains two BVR molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the electron density for apo-Syn BVR was mostly of high quality and continuous, the densities for the N-terminal region (residues 18) and C-terminal region (residues 326328) were poorly defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, these residues were not included in the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Syn BVR consists of two structural domains (N-terminal and C-terminal domains), with the active sites in an obvious cleft between them (see Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The N-terminal domain has a typical Rossmann fold, in which a parallel -sheet (strands 15) is surrounded by five helices (helices 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C-terminal domain contains eight -strands (strands 613) and six -helices (helices 611).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall topology of Syn BVR is nearly the same as those of the rat and human homologues, with two minor differences: Syn BVR has an additional short -helix (2) in the N-terminal domain, and has three additional -strands in the C-terminal domain (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Data collection and refinement statistics.Full size table', 'Figure 2: Overall structure of the Syn BVR

NADP+ binds in the cleft between the two domains (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density is visible for only one molecule in the asymmetric unit; thus, the two crystallographically independent BVR proteins in the asymmetric unit comprise one apo-form and one NADP+-bound form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electron density of bound NADP+ was sufficiently clear that conformation and orientation could be explicitly determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NADP+ is held by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions; Thr18, Ala21, Ser44, Arg167 and Trp168 form hydrogen bonding (Fig 3a), whereas Trp41, Ile80, Glu101 and Tyr102 are involved in hydrophobic contact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparisons between the apo-form and the NADP+-bound form revealed small but significant structural rearrangements upon NADP+ binding: the N-terminal domain shifted 1.0 Å in order to expand the active site (Supplementary Fig 3), and the loop between 5 and a part of helix 6 (residues 129135) moved 2.0 Å away from the nicotinamide ring of the bound NADP+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the steric hindrance configuration of the corresponding site in the apo-form would not able to bind NADP+; accordingly, these movements reflect an induced fit type of structural change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This induced fit was probably triggered by yet other structural rearrangements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the regions around helix 8 differed from those in the apo-form (Fig 3b): the starting point of helix 8, located near helix 6 as well as the nicotinamide ring of the bound NADP+ (but not directly interacting with NADP+), was altered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the apo-form, the guanidine group of Arg185 in helix 8 formed a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of His129 in the loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the NADP+-bound form, the hydrogen bond between Arg185 and His129 was broken, and the side chain of the Arg185 rotated toward the active site due to the overall rearrangement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These structural changes confer not only substrate-binding ability, but also catalytic activity, on BVR (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Electron density map around the bound NADP+ in the Syn BVR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) An omit FoFc

to D molecules).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, two BV molecules are bound to the catalytic cleft between the two domains (Fig 2), and adopt a stacked configuration along with the tetrapyrrole plane (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each of the four BVR molecules, electron densities derived from the tetrapyrrole moiety of two BV molecules are clear (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NADP+ molecules were also bound by all four BVR molecules, although we did not add the NADP+ reagent during the purification and crystallization procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the NADP+ in the BV-bound crystal was derived from E. coli, and their binding configurations are thought to represent the authentic form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The configuration of NADP+ in the ternary complex was identical to that in the

proximal and distal BVs are almost the same.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proximal BV interacts with the distal BV by hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The propionate groups form two salt bridges with amino acid residues (Fig 5b), one interacting with Arg185, and the other interacting with Arg188.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These interactions between the propionate group and the surrounding residues fix the propionate side chains to these positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C10 double bond in the proximal BV, which is to be reduced, faces the nicotinamide C4 carbon (origin of the hydride) of the NADP+; the distance between the C10 carbon of the proximal BV and the C4 carbon of the NADP+ is 2.6 Å, and the angle between the C10 and nicotinamide ring was 120°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This configuration of the proximal BV appears suitable to accept the hydride from the nicotinamide ring, and strongly suggests that the hydride is directly transferred to the C10 carbon in the proximal BV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the distal BV, the binding configuration could be also defined based on the electron density map (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The configurations of all four distal BVs in the asymmetric unit are almost identical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tetrapyrrole plane of the distal BV is located nearly parallel to that of the proximal BV, and the directions of the propionate side chains of each BV are the same.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distal BV is located 4 Å above, translated by 2.5 Å to the solvent side and rotated 45° relative to the proximal BV (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the B-ring in the distal BV is located just above the A-ring of the proximal BV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One propionate side chain forms a salt-bridge with the Arg246, and the other side chain forms a hydrogen bond with Thr169.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the pyrrole nitrogen of the D-ring in the distal BV might form a hydrogen bond with the lactam group (C=O) of the A-ring in the proximal BV; the distance between them was 3.2 Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Steady-state kinetics of Syn BVR', 'We next investigated the catalytic residue based on this structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One proton and two electrons are served from the NAD(P)H directly to the C10 double bond in the proximal BV; thus, the other unidentified catalytic residue must be located close to the proximal BV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure, however, revealed that only the hydroxyl group of Tyr102 interacts with C10, and this interaction is weak (3.5 Å, either via van der Waals force or CH/O hydrogen bond).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous mutagenesis studies of Syn and rat BVRs clearly indicated that the tyrosine residue (Tyr97 in rat BVR) is not a direct proton donor6,7,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the H84A and D287A mutations in Syn BVR dramatically reduced its activity14, these residues have no direct interaction with bound NADP+ or bound BV (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we excluded His84 and Asp287 as candidates for the proton donor (see details in Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we further investigated the possible candidates for the catalytic residues surrounding the proximal and distal BVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six residues were considered as possible proton donors (within 3.5 Å): the hydroxy groups of Thr169 and Ser184, and the amino groups of Arg185, Arg188, Lys237 and Arg246 (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Steady-state kinetics, monitored using the Syn BVR proteins containing mutations in these candidate proton donor residues, revealed the plausible catalytic residues (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enzymatic activity of the mutation at Tyr102 was reduced to 40% in terms of kcat value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This behaviour was in agreement with that of rat BVR (Tyr97 mutant)7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the turnover rates were dramatically decreased relative to that of the wild-type protein by introduction of mutations at Arg185 (R185A and R185K): kcat/Km was reduced to 0.25%, whereas their affinity for the substrate (Km) was not significantly altered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results also indicated that the guanidine group of the arginine residue in this position was invariant for the enzymatic reaction, as it was not able to substitute for positively charged amino group of the lysine residue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This arginine residue is completely conserved among BVR homologues, including rat (Arg171) and human BVR (Arg172) (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 2 Kinetic parameters of wild-type and mutant proteins of Syn, human and rat BVRs*.Full size table', 'Next, we examined the enzymatic activity of rat and human BVRs by replacing the arginine at this site with other residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, in both rat and human BVRs, the kcat/Km values were remarkably decreased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In human BVR, the R172E and R172K mutations completely abolished the enzymatic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the cofactor-bound state, although the position of the guanidine group of this arginine residue was almost identical among Syn, human, and rat BVRs (Supplementary Fig 5), the conformation of its side chains had little variation (for example, torsion angles of C and C atoms).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data indicate that this arginine residue is the common catalytic residue of BVRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The BV binding to Syn BVR in solution states', 'To obtain further insight into the substrate-binding stoichiometry in solution, we measured BV binding to Syn BVR by optical titration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BV absorption spectrum was slightly altered upon BVR binding in the presence of NADP+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Difference spectra (that is, in Syn BVR present minus Syn BVR absent) exhibited a negative peak at 650 nm and positive peaks at 420 and 740 nm (Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BV titration revealed that all of the difference peaks blue-shifted by 10 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peak amplitudes increased with BV concentration up to a twofold excess of BVR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The titration curve at 740 nm clearly indicated that two BV molecules bound to Syn BVR (Fig 6b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This BV titration result agreed closely with the crystal structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also performed BV titration using the Syn BVR R185A mutant protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resultant titration curve confirmed that two BV molecules bound to Syn BVR R185A (Fig 6c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the arginine residue in this position is not necessary for the two BV stacked binding, but is essential for the catalytic function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Determination of the stoichiometry of BV binding to Syn BVR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) BV titration of

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this study, we experimentally determined the substrate-binding configurations in BVR concomitant with that of NADP+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To the best of our knowledge, parallel stacking of two tetrapyrrole molecules is quite rare binding configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many multi-tetrapyrrole proteins are present, including photosynthesis complexes15,16 and cytochromes17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, even if the tetrapyrrole compounds are located close to each other in these proteins, the two tetrapyrrole rings are not stacked, and the propionate side chain moieties are crossed or stacked in most cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, in the BVR structure revealed in this study, the tetrapyrrole rings in the proximal and distal BVs are nearly parallel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the tetrapyrrole rings are located close to each other (within 4 Å).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given that the enzymatic activity of BVRs is inhibited by excess BV18, this unprecedented configuration raises the possibility that this structure reflects a substrate-inhibited state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the procedure of the co-crystallization in this study, we never added a molar excess of substrate, and the crystallization drops contained equimolar amounts of BVR and BV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the enzymatic reaction of BV reduction could be induced to occur, even in the crystalline state, by addition of NADPH (see Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The colour of the crystal 10 min after the reaction was quite similar to that of a solution mixture of BV and BR (see Figs 4a,b), even though the crystal gradually melted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we confirmed that BV could be rapidly (as in the mixing time) reduced to BR by addition of NADPH in a solution identical to the one used for crystallization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the structure presented here represents the active state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The mutagenesis and kinetics experiments revealed that an arginine residue that is completely conserved among BVRs is probably the proton donor residue (see Table 2 and Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, Arg185 is located far from the C10 double bond of the reducing site of the proximal BV ( greater than 5.7 Å) and the distal BV ( greater than 6.0 Å) (see Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, the proton is not able to transfer directly to the reducing site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the guanidine group of Arg185 formed hydrogen bonds with the carboxy group of the propionate side chain of the proximal BV (within 2.8 Å in all molecules of the asymmetric unit); thus, the Arg185 must first donate its proton to the propionate side chain of the proximal BV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Because of their chi-angle rotation restraints, it would be extremely difficult for the propionate side chains of the proximal BV to transfer the proton to reduced site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parallel stacked configuration of the proximal and distal BVs indicates that the proton from Arg185 in the propionate side chain of the proximal BV can easily transfer to the propionate side chain in the distal BV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the propionate side chain of the distal BV is also located close to Arg185 (3.1 Å), and probably the proton could be directly transferred from Arg185, a hydrogen bond may not be formed due to the parallel configuration between the amino acid residue and the side chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The propionate side chain in the distal BV is in a suitable location for transferring the proton to the proximal BV: it can approach within 2.6 Å of the C10 carbon, as well as the pyrrole nitrogen in the B-ring in the proximal BV ( less_than 2.5 Å), via rotation of the propionate side chain of the distal BV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Taken together, these observations suggest a plausible proton pathway for conversion of BV to BR (Fig 7): a hydride from NAD(P)H is directly transferred to the C10 double bond of the proximal BV, initiating the reduction of the proximal BV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The propionate side chain of the proximal BV accepts a proton from Arg185, thereby abolishing the electrostatic interaction between Arg185 and the propionate and increasing the flexibility of the side chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, the proton is transferred to the propionate side chain in the distal BV, and the protonated propionic acid group in the distal BV moves toward the reducing site in the proximal BV to transfer the proton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the exact site to be transferred to the proton could not be determined by the present structure, the B-ring in the proximal BV is the most reasonable site since the propionate side chain in the distal BV can be located close to the B-ring in the proximal BV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the proximal BV accepts the proton to produce BR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: Proposed mechanism of the BVR reaction.A hydride from NAD(P)H is directly transferred to the proximal BV, initiating the reduction of the proximal BV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The propionate side chain of the proximal BV accepts a proton from Arg185, subsequently, the proton is transferred to the propionate side chain in the distal BV, and the protonated propionic acid group in the distal BV moves toward the reducing site in the proximal BV to transfer the proton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the proximal BV accepts the proton to produce BR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arrows in the nicotinamide and pyrrole rings indicate the electron flow, and in the other positions indicate the proton or hydride transfer.Full size image', 'The reaction mechanism proposed here could explain not only why BVR strictly requires the propionate as tetrapyrrole side chain11, but also why a carboxyl group with a dissociable proton on the propionate side chain is essential12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mantles group performed sophisticated kinetic analysis of BVR, and found that Syn BVR obeys an ordered steady-state kinetic mechanism, with NADPH the first to bind and NADP+ the last to dissociate14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on this concept, we proposed a reaction mechanism for BVR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following NADPH binding, the reaction is likely to start with hydride transfer from NAD(P)H, because in time-course ultravioletvisible spectra we have never observed a peak derived from BVH+, as seen in other BV-related enzymes19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The propionate side chain in another tetrapyrrole compound, protochlorophyllide, serves as proton donor for its self-reduction at the C17=C18 double bond to form chlorophyllide a21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is feasible that the proton donation function of the propionate side chain of BV is involved in the reduction reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  QM/MM calculations for human BVR (BVR-A) and a related enzyme (BVR-B) have shown that the water molecule might be a proton donor22,23, although the working hypothesis is that BVR binds one biliverdin molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hope that by assuming binding of two biliverdin molecules, the QM/MM calculations can be used to reveal the detailed reaction mechanisms of BVR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A structural and mechanistic understanding of the BVR reaction may enable the development of new inhibitors that target severe jaundice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the active pocket, where two BVs bind with the unique stacked geometry, is a promising target for design of drugs with minimal risk of deleterious side effects.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
