Phosphate steering by Flap Endonuclease 1 promotes 5-flap specificity and incision to prevent genome instability  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'DNA replication and repair enzyme Flap Endonuclease 1 (FEN1) is vital for genome integrity, and FEN1 mutations arise in multiple cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FEN1 precisely cleaves single-stranded (ss) 5-flaps one nucleotide into duplex (ds) DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, how FEN1 selects for but does not incise the ss 5-flap was enigmatic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we combine crystallographic, biochemical and genetic analyses to show that two dsDNA binding sites set the 5polarity and to reveal unexpected control of the DNA phosphodiester backbone by electrostatic interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Via phosphate steering, basic residues energetically steer an inverted ss 5-flap through a gateway over FEN1s active site and shift dsDNA for catalysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations of these residues cause an 18,000-fold reduction in catalytic rate in vitro and large-scale trinucleotide (GAA)n repeat expansions in vivo, implying failed phosphate-steering promotes an unanticipated lagging-strand template-switch mechanism during replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, phosphate steering is an unappreciated FEN1 function that enforces 5-flap specificity and catalysis, preventing genomic instability.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The structure-specific nuclease, flap endonuclease-1 (FEN1) plays a vital role in maintaining genome integrity by precisely processing intermediates of Okazaki fragment maturation, long-patch excision repair, telomere maintenance, and stalled replication forks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During DNA replication and repair, strand displacement synthesis produces single-stranded (ss) 5-flaps, at junctions in double-stranded (ds) DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During replication in humans, FEN1 removes 50 million Okazaki fragment 5-flaps with remarkable efficiency and selectivity to maintain genome integrity1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, FEN1 deletion is embryonically lethal in mammals4, and functional mutations can lead to cancer5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FEN1 also safeguards against DNA instability responsible for trinucleotide repeat expansion diseases6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As FEN1 is overexpressed in many cancer types7,8, it is an oncological therapy target9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Precise FEN1 incision site selection is central to DNA replication fidelity and repair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FEN1 preferentially binds to double flap substrates with a one nt 3-flap and any length of 5-flap, including zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It catalyses a single hydrolytic incision one nucleotide (nt) into dsDNA (Fig 1a) to yield nicked DNA ready for direct ligation11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, FEN1 acts on dsDNA as both an endonuclease (with 5-flap) and an exonuclease (without 5-flap).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent single molecule experiments show that FEN1 binds both ideal and non-ideal substrates but decisively incises only its true substrate13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to homologs in bacteriophage14,15,16 and some eubacteria17, eukaryotic FEN1s do not hydrolyse within 5-flap ssDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Specificity and inverted threading of ss5-flap in hFEN1 D86N substrate structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic FEN1 incision on an optimal double-flap substrate, incising 1 nt into dsDNA to ensure a ligatable product.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Proposed models for ssDNA selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Top view of hFEN1-D86N crystal structure showing extensive interaction to dsDNA arms of 5 flap substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 5-flap substrate is composed of three strands; the 5-flap strand (orange), the template strand (brown), and the 3-flap strand (pink).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functionally critical regions in FEN1 include the gateway (blue) and the cap (violet) for selecting substrates with ss-5-flaps, the hydrophobic wedge between the 3-flap binding site and the gateway/cap (dark green), the K+ ion and H2TH (purple) that interacts with the downstream DNA, the beta pin (grey) that locks in the DNA at the bend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative DNA orientation shown in schematic on lower right.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Front and side views of hFEN1-D86N crystal structure showing helical gateway and cap architecture position positively-charged residues to steer ss 5-flaps through a protecting gateway in an inverted orientation across the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative DNA orientation is shown in schematic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inverted 5-flap ssDNA is threaded between gateway helices (blue) and under the helical cap (violet).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inverted threading reveals charged interactions to basic sidechains in the cap and van der Waals interactions to ssDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See also Supplementary Figs 13; Table 1, and Supplementary Movies 1 and 2.Full size image', 'However, key features of FEN1 substrate selection remain unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FEN1 must efficiently remove 5-flaps at discontinuous ss-dsDNA junctions yet avoid genome-threatening action on continuous ssds junctions, such as ss gaps or Holliday junctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paradoxically, other FEN1 5-nuclease superfamily members3 are specific for continuous DNA junctions: namely, ERCC5/XPG (nucleotide excision repair), which acts on continuous ss-ds bubble-like structures; and GEN1 (Holliday junction resolution), which processes four-way junctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structures determined with DNA of eukaryotic superfamily members lack ss-ds junction substrate with 5-ssDNA or the attacking water molecule leaving cardinal questions unanswered18,19,20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, structures of FEN1 and Exo1 go from substrate duplex DNA with the scissile phosphodiester far from the catalytic metals to an unpaired terminal nt in the product; is the unpairing occurring before or after incision?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Models of FEN1 specificity must address how ssds junctions are recognized and how 5-flaps, as opposed to continuous ssDNA are recognized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are threading and kinking models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To exclude continuous DNAs, 5-flaps may thread through a tunnel21,23,24,25 formed by two superfamily-conserved helices flanking the active site, known as the helical gateway, topped by a helical cap (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to cap and gateway disorder in DNA-free FEN1, they are thought disordered during threading and to undergo a disorder-to-order transition on 3-flap binding21,24,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this threading model, however, ssDNA passes through a tunnel without an energy source and directly over the active site, risking non-specific incision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These issues prompted an alternative clamping model where the ss flap kinks away from the active site11,20 (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas these models explain selection against continuous DNA junctions, FEN1 exonuclease activity does not require a 5-flap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, how FEN1 prevents off target incisions and moves the dsDNA junction onto the metal ions are not explained by these models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here crystallographic analyses uncover an unprecedented electrostatic steering of an inverted 5-flap through the human FEN1 (hFEN1) helical gateway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gateway and cap positively-charged side chains are positioned to steer the phosphodiester backbone across the active site, energetically promoting threading and preventing nonspecific hydrolysis within the 5-flap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutational analysis of these positively charged steering residues revealed an added role of phosphate steering in moving dsDNA towards the catalytic metal ions for reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, phosphate steering mutations efficiently blocked Rad27 (S. cerevisae homolog of hFEN1) function, causing a compromised response to DNA damaging agents and dramatically increased expandable repeat instability.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'FEN1 selects for 5-flaps by steering flap through a gateway', 'To obtain structures of hFEN1 with a ss 5-flap substrate for insight into ss 5-flap selection, we crystallized three hFEN1 active site mutants D86N, R100A and D233N with a double-flap (DF) substrate and with Sm3+ (Fig 1 and Supplementary Figs 1 and 2A)27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mg2+ is the physiological cofactor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D86N, R100A and D233N mutations slow the hFEN1 catalysed reaction rate by factors of 530, 7,900 and 16 respectively (Supplementary Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DF substrates in the crystal structures had a ss 5-flap (45 nt) and a 1 nt 3-flap, termed S4,1 or S5,1 (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DNA-enzyme complex structures for hFEN1-D86N, hFEN1-R100A, and hFEN1-D233N were determined to 2.8, 2.65, and 2.1 Å resolution, respectively (Figs 1c,d and 2, Supplementary Fig 2 and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cases, the overall protein resembled wild-type (wt) hFEN1 (with product DNA, PDB code 3Q8K)21, with root mean square deviation (RMSD) values of 0.26 for hFEN1-R100A, 0.22 for hFEN1-D233N, and 0.42 for hFEN1-D86N.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: FEN1 superfamily sequence and

interacts primarily (88% by PISA interface analysis28) with two regions of 100° bent dsDNA supporting prior observations21, rather than to the ss 5-flap in these structures (Figs 1c,d and 2, Supplementary Movie 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FEN1 binding to dsDNA is mediated by four regions: (1) a hydrophobic wedge (composed of helix 2 and helix 23 loop) and  pin (formed between  strands 8 and 9) sandwich upstream and downstream dsDNA portions at the bending point of the two-way junction with Tyr40 packing at the ss/dsDNA junction; (2) a C-terminal helix-hairpin-helix motif binds upstream dsDNA and the one nt 3-flap and is absent from superfamily-related members hEXO1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20) and bacteriophage 5-nuclease structures29; (3) the helix-2turn-helix (H2TH) motif with bound K+ ion and positive side chains bind downstream dsDNA; and (4) the two-metal ion active site near the 5-flap strand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Much of the interaction (43% by PISA analysis) is to the strand complementary to the flap strands, reinforcing dsDNA specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The dsDNA binding sites on either side of the active site, the K+ and the hydrophobic wedge, are spaced one helical turn apart (Supplementary Movie 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their spacing enforces the specificity for helical dsDNA and places the 5-flap in the active site, selecting against unstructured ssDNA or 3-flaps that would require a narrower spacing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the minor-groove phosphate backbone is recognized by superfamily-conserved Arg70 and Arg192 pair spaced 14 Å apart (Fig 2, Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unique to FEN1, cap positive side chains (Lys125, Lys128, Arg129) interact with the template strand at the ss/dsDNA junction (Supplementary Fig 3, Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lys128 and Arg47 pack against each other, linking the 3-flap pocket to the gateway helices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The active site consists of seven superfamily-conserved metal-coordinating carboxylate residues plus invariant Lys93 and Arg100 from gateway helix 4 and Gly2 at the processed N-terminus (Figs 2 and 3c, Supplementary Movie 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An ordered gateway and cap formed by helices 2, 4 and 5 are observed above the active site in these three structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Helix 2 Tyr40 forms part of the hydrophobic wedge and packs against the duplex DNA at the bend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Three FEN1 crystal structures show threading through the capped gateway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) DNA from hFEN1-D86N, hFEN1-R100A, and hFEN1-D233N

substrate threaded through the tunnel formed by the gateway/cap (Figs 1d and 2a, and Supplementary Fig 2A and Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation explains how FEN1 excludes continuous DNA like Holliday junctions and DNA bubbles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third independent hFEN1-D233N crystal structure captures two cleaved nts from the 5-flap bound on the other side of the tunnel from the dsDNA, consistent with threading (Fig 3a and Supplementary Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these three distinct structures support the threading model to validate substrates have a ss 5-flap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Phosphate steering inverts the ss phosphodiester backbone', 'In both threaded substrate structures, the ss 5-flap phosphodiester backbone is inverted between the +1 and +2 positions, with the +2 and +3 phosphates facing away from the active site metals and the DNA bases facing the metals (Fig 1b,d and Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (We denote the plus and minus positions relative to the scissile phosphate).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This inversion would place the flap phosphodiesters away from the catalytic metals and thereby logically reduce inadvertent incision within the ssDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both structures, the inverted +1 phosphodiester is directly between the gateway helices with the bases on either side of the gateway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the hFEN1-D86N structure, two basic residues of the gateway/cap, Arg104 and Lys132, were within 47 Å of the +1, +2 and +3 phosphodiester.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These residues are positioned to energetically promote threading and an inverted orientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are conserved in FEN1 and semi-conserved across the 5-nuclease superfamily and shown important for incision activity (Fig 2 and Supplementary Fig 3)3,21,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The +2 and +3 nt of the 5-flap were sandwiched between the main chain (residues 8689 and residues 132135) on one side of the channel and Leu97 on the other (Supplementary Fig 2C) by non-sequence specific van der Waals contacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall inverted flap orientation resembles the hFEN1-R100A structure with the +1 phosphate remaining within 7 Å of Arg104, but shifted towards Arg103, presumably due to Arg100 removal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these substrate structures suggest that basic residues enable a phosphate steering mechanism, which we here define as electrostatic interactions that can dynamically position the phosphodiester backbone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Shifting of the scissile phosphate and the catalytic mechanism', 'In the hFEN1-D86N structure, we were surprised that the scissile phosphate was within catalytic distance of the active site while surrounding bases remained basepaired to the template strand (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This contradicts the prevailing hypothesis that surrounding bases must unpair for the scissile phosphate to move into the active site for incision3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarities and functionally-significant differences appeared on closer examination of hFEN1-D86N, hFEN1-R100A, and an earlier structure of FEN1-substrate with no 5-flap or +1 phosphate (PDB code 3Q8L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all three substrate structures, the dsDNA major groove is widened as it approaches the active site, and DNA bases flanking the scissile phosphate are stacked with one another, with the +1 base packed against Tyr40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the basepairing, the scissile phosphodiester bond location and the Tyr40 rotamer are distinctly different in the respective complexes, despite containing the same dsDNA sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the 3Q8L structure, the DNA remained fully basepaired, and the scissile phosphodiester was positioned 6 Å away from catalytic metals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the hFEN1-R100A structure, the scissile phosphodiester bond was 45 Å away from the metal ions, although 1 and +1 nts have moved towards the active site and away from the template strand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 1 and 2 nts display less base overlap (stacking), and the +1 and 1 nts are no longer hydrogen bonded to the template strand (46 Å apart).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In striking contrast, the scissile phosphodiester bond was directly coordinated to the one active site metal ion in the hFEN1-D86N structure (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the +1 and 1 nts remained unexpectedly basepaired to the template strand, which is shifted relative to the other substrate structures via a dsDNA distortion surrounding the scissile phosphodiester (Fig 3b and Supplementary Fig 2D,E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is no base stacking between 1 and 2 nts in the 5-flap strand; instead, an unusual interstrand base stacking interaction occurs between the 2 nt of the 5-flap strand and the template strand opposite of the 1 nt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We had hypothesized that unpairing of the +1 and 1 was required to move the scissile phosphate to within catalytic distance of the active site metals3,21,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This new hFEN1-D86N substrate structure shows instead that basic residues can rotate dsDNA into the active site with basepairing intact (Fig 3, Supplementary Movie 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, since the DNA in 3Q8L, which was the furthest from the active site, lacked a 5-flap or +1 phosphate, the DNA movements observed in the hFEN1-R100A and hFEN1-D86N structures are likely partly a consequence of either the 5-flap and/or the +1 phosphate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In concert with the DNA rotation in hFEN1-D86N, Tyr40 is in a different rotamer conformation from all other substrate or product bound or DNA-free hFEN1 structures (Fig 3a,b and Supplementary Movie 3)21,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This Tyr40 rotamer shift tracks duplex DNA rotation into the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Tyr ring is fully stacked on the +1 base, and its side chain hydroxyl forms a hydrogen bond to the +1 phosphate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, as duplex DNA is not shifted close to the catalytic metal in the R100A structure, this structure may represent a pre-reactive substrate form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its Tyr40 stacks at a 50° angle with the +1 nt and resembles the other hFEN1 structures, suggesting that the Tyr40 rotamer is linked to shifting duplex DNA into a catalytic position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the hFEN1-D86N-substrate structure, cap and gateway helices 4 and 5 are shifted 13 Å towards the dsDNA relative to all other hFEN1 crystal structures with DNA (Fig 3b and Supplementary Movie 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The backbone of helix 2 (which contains Tyr40) does not change position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Close examination of the hFEN1-D86N structure revealed a water molecule 3.3 Å from the scissile phosphate (Fig 3c, Supplementary Fig 4, and Supplementary Movie 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This water is positioned for a linear attack on the scissile phosphate and for its evident activation by the catalytic metal and the Gly2 at the FEN1 N terminus, which was proposed to replace the third metal in bacteriophage FEN33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Asp233 is 3 Å from the attacking water and contributes modestly to catalysis; the D233N mutant has 16-fold reduced but still substantial catalytic activity compared to mutants of other invariant carboxylates, such as D181A21 and D86N (Supplementary Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a second metal ion is modeled by overlay with the hFEN1-product structure (PDB code 3Q8K), the structure is reminiscent of the classical two-metal-ion catalysis34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, superfamily conserved and catalytically required21 Lys93 and Arg100 sidechains point towards the scissile phosphodiester bond, poised to assist metal ion mediated hydrolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of the hFEN1-R100A structure, Arg100 is also likely essential for shifting of the scissile phosphate into direct contact with the catalytic metals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the scissile phosphate has moved 12 Å between hFEN1-D86N-substrate and wt hFEN1-product (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An analogous metal movement into more optimal coordination geometry in an RNaseH-product structure was proposed to favour product formation35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We cannot exclude a possible third metal ion as time-resolved experiments on other enzymes show metals ions can appear and disappear during reaction36,37,38,39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Together these structures reinforce and extend biochemical data that suggest that FEN1 checks for the ss 5-flap by threading it through a tunnel formed between the active site and capped gateway helices (Fig 1d)24,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The substrate structures imply the 5-flap is (1) electrostatically steered through the capped gateway by conserved basic residues in the gateway and cap and (2) positioned in an inverted orientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Biochemically testing phosphate steering', 'If the gateway/cap region basic residues steer the phosphodiester backbone as implied by the structures, then their mutation should affect 5-flap substrate incision rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of the hFEN1-R100A structure, we mutated three basic residues (Arg103, Arg104 and Lys132) positioned to guide the phosphodiester backbone and stabilize the inverted ssDNA orientation (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also mutated Arg129, which is adjacent the other residues and could act in steering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the helical cap is structured, Arg129 makes a long-range electrostatic interaction with a phosphate of the template strand21, a distance shortened in hFEN1-D86N by template strand relocation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, these four basic residues are conserved across all FEN1s including yeast and archaeal, except for the less-specific phage 5 nucleases (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the helical gateway and cap regions are flexible before productive DNA binding22,24,26, specific interactions would seem unlikely during the flap threading process but electrostatic guidance is possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, as these side chains range from 10 to 19 Å from the target phosphate, they are unlikely to impact FEN1 activity by aspects other than electrostatic guidance and substrate-positioning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this idea, we mutated them to alanine or glutamate to either remove the attractive positive charge or provide a repulsive charge, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These charge mutations all reduced specific incision activity on a 5-flap substrate, S5,1 (Fig 4a), indicating an important functional role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under multiple turnover conditions, single mutations R103A and K132A moderately decreased the reaction rate relative to wt hFEN1 by 3- and 5-fold, respectively, whereas a 20-fold decrease was observed with either R104A or R129A (Fig 4b and Supplementary Fig 5A,B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These rate decreases are consistent with a single residue electrostatic guidance interaction42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Double mutant R104AK132A showed an additive effect with 200-fold reduced activity and, significantly, the corresponding repulsive mutant R104EK132E was far more severely compromised with a rate reduction of 11,000 compared to the wt enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the substrate dissociation constant (Kd) for each of these double mutants was only modestly raised (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests deficient substrate positioning, not poor binding, as the major contributing factor to diminished activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, double mutants R103AR129A or R103ER129E showed reductions in reactivity of 70- or 5,000-fold, respectively, without any substantial effect on Kd.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analogous trends in rate effects were observed under single turnover kinetic

basic cap residues are primarily required for ss 5-flap steering, then their mutation should not be deleterious to incision activity on an exonucleolytic substrate lacking a 5-flap but with a

facilitates access to the catalytically competent conformation, as well as being a key mechanism in substrate selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For reaction rates expressed relative to wt hFEN1 to normalize for this sevenfold difference, the gateway mutants all proved similarly defective on both the exonucleolytic (S0,1-5P) and endonucleolytic (S5,1) substrates (relative rates given in Supplementary Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results unmask a key universal role for +1 phosphate steering in the FEN1 incisions of both exonucleolytic and endonucleolytic substrates (since this phosphate is present in both substrates).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given the results with the exonucleolytic substrate and the observation that DNA movement towards the active site required a +1 phosphate43, we reasoned that some basic residues were electrostatically interacting with the +1 phosphodiester of dsDNA to facilitate this movement44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we measured reaction rates with an analogous exonucleolytic substrate lacking the 5-phosphate at the +1 position (S0,1-5OH; Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This substrate was bound 20-fold more weakly and incised 300-fold more slowly than

fragment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the major mutations caused by disruption of the RAD27 gene in yeast were repeat-related expansions of 5108 bases53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, the median size of the unprocessed 5-flap in S. pombe FEN1 knockout was measured as 89 nts54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given these numbers, the median expansion size of GAA repeats in our experimental system should be 30 repeats in Rad27 mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To define the size distribution of expansion products, we measured the scale of repeat expansions in wt and Rad27 mutants described above via PCR (Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the wt strain, median expansion size corresponded to 47 triplets49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rad27 knockout was different: median expansion size was 32 repeats, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) comparison confirms a significant difference from the wt strain (P less_than 0.001), which agrees with known flap size in FEN1 knockouts54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expansion scale in near-catalytic-dead (D179A) and 4E Rad27 mutants lies between the wt and knockout mutant: the median is 40 repeats and KS shows significant difference from wt (P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the scale of expansions in 2E and 4A mutants is greater than wt with medians from 50 to 66 added repeats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the 100-fold increase in expansions (Fig 5c) in phosphate steering mutants cannot be explained by an increase in small-scale expansions alone (caused by simple 5-flap ligation), but is a consequence of larger expansions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, most expansions in the Rad27 phosphate steering mutants originate via mechanisms distinct from simple 5-flap ligation (see Discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these Rad27 results suggest that functional phosphate

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We sought to understand the mechanism whereby FEN1s binds and precisely incises ss-dsDNA junctions yet excludes hydrolysis of continuous DNA substrates, reasoning that this specificity was key to FEN1 functions during replication and repair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These investigations resolve controversies and improve our understanding of how FEN1-DNA interactions provide specificity and genome stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'First, elucidation of a 5-flap DNA threaded through the helical gateway/cap answers a longstanding question in eukaryotic FEN1 function and explains the selection of 5-flap substrates with free 5-termini.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although threading occurs in other enzymes, phosphate steering and inverted threading are extraordinary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, bacteriophage T5 5-nuclease threads substrates29, but positions the 5 flap primarily through hydrophobic interactions to the 5 flap nucleobases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phosphodiester is closer to the metals than the nucleobases, consistent with its lower incision site specificity and tendency to cleave within the ssDNA 5-flap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other enzymes, threading selects for free ss 5-termini that will undergo incision and there is no inversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, FEN1 preserves, rather than degrades, the threaded nucleic acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Second, our results uncover an essential function in FEN1 specificity and catalysis for phosphate steering, which we define as electrostatic interactions that dynamically control the phosphodiester backbone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parallel effects of steering mutations on either endonucleolytic or exonucleolytic reactions (that is, on substrates with or without a 5-flap) indicated involvement of basic gateway/cap residues in a rate-limiting step in the FEN1 catalytic pathway, that is, in moving the target phosphodiester bond from the ss-ds junction onto catalytic metal ions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, phosphate steering may act in orienting the ss 5-flap during threading (negative design to avoid off-target reactions) and moving the scissile phosphate into catalytic distance of the metals (positive design to enhance target reactions) (Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, steering residue Arg104, is semiconserved throughout the superfamily suggesting that phosphate positioning occurs in other members.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: Multiple motifs for FEN1 substrate recognition and hydrolysis ensure accurate incision activity and prevent genomic instability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic

R245G/W, R70L and R73G), 3-flap binding (Leu53ins, A45V, S317F, E318V and R320Q), helical gateway/cap (I39T, Q112R and A119V) or active site (A159V).Full size image', 'Third, the proposed requirement for double base unpairing for the dsDNA to reach the active site metal ions3 needs re-evaluation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observation of basepaired DNA contacting an active site metal ion with a water molecule positioned for in-line attack, would generate the arrangement for two-metal-ion catalysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This basepaired catalytically competent conformation appears at odds with spectroscopic characterization of FEN1 and GEN1 substrate complexes19,32,44, and the inability of FEN1 to process duplexes cross-linked at the terminal basepair31,55, consistent with an unpairing mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, the DNA distortion seen in structures here (Supplementary Fig 2E) provides an alternative explanation implying dsDNA can remain basepaired and roll onto the active site metal ions aided by Tyr40 rotation and by positive side chains on the helical gateway and cap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Whereas replication fidelity is canonically based on sequence, it furthermore depends on sequence-independent specificity in FEN1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, structural elements critically involved in FEN1 function, including phosphate steering and inverted threading, require key residues distant from the active site metal ions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, clinically relevant FEN1 mutations compiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and others5,56,57 map to these structural elements (Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So, although tumour mutation data has been called a bewildering hodgepodge of genetic oddities58, for FEN1, there is a clear link of structurally-mapped mutations to compromised function, genomic instability and cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these mutations may retain nuclease activity, even tiny off target activity risks toxicity and genomic instability, and replication mutations account for two-thirds of the mutations in human cancers59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We uncovered a role for phosphate steering in triplet (GAA)n repeat expansions, that also implicates template switching from the lagging strand due to FEN1 defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most expansions in Rad27 phosphate steering mutants were large-scale ( greater than 30 repeats; Fig 6a) which is difficult to explain by the canonical flap-ligation model for repeat instability46,48,51,60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this model, an unprocessed 5-flap is ligated to the 3-end of the approaching Okazaki fragment (Fig 6b, left), limiting the length of expansions to the size of those flaps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, the median size of the 5-flap in a FEN1 knockout was found to be 89 nts54, that is, 30 triplet repeats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since median expansion size in phosphate steering mutants is  greater than 30 repeats, we propose that besides a flap-ligation model, a template switch between nascent repetitive strands occurs as a replication fork stumbles through the repeat sequence50 (Fig 6b, right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unprocessed (TTC)n 5-flaps of the Okazaki fragments may form a stable triplex61 with the downstream repetitive run.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could block displacement synthesis by the lagging strand polymerase62 and prompt it to search for a new template.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large-scale repeat expansions would then occur when the polymerase switches templatecontinuing DNA synthesis along the nascent leading strand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a starting repeat gets longer, larger expansions become feasible, consistent with the progressive increase in expansion amplitudes with the length of original repeat tract, as observed in human pedigrees63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The profound stimulation of large-scale expansions in the phosphate steering mutants unexpectedly sheds light on the molecular mechanism of template switching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A priori, either a nascent leading strand can switch onto the nascent lagging strand to use it as a template49,50, or the nascent lagging strand can switch onto the nascent leading strand serving as a template47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since it is the lagging strand synthesis and specifically Okazaki fragment maturation that are unraveled in Rad27 mutants, the sheer magnitude of their effects on large-scale repeat expansions implies that the lagging strand likely switches onto the nascent leading strand accounting for the repeat instability, and this merits further biochemical investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another question emerges from biochemical studies of FEN1 functions during long-patch base excision repair where expansions occur on dysregulation of DNA handoffs from polymerase  to FEN1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  64), which suggests studies to investigate whether phosphate steering may prevent expansions during long-patch repair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we find FEN1 phosphate steering energetically promotes dsDNA rotation into the active site and inverted threading of the 5-flap to enforce efficiency and fidelity in replication and repair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, elevated FEN1 expression safeguards against repeat instability in somatic tissues6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphate steering mutations could thus be the trans-modifiers of repeat expansions during either somatic, or intergenerational transmissions in human disease65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, as the basic residues implicated in phosphate steering are largely conserved in the 5-nuclease superfamily, control over the +1 and 1 phosphates may be a superfamily-conserved mechanism.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
