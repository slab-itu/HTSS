Genomic analyses identify recurrent MEF2D fusions in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Chromosomal rearrangements are initiating events in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here using RNA sequencing of 560 ALL cases, we identify rearrangements between MEF2D (myocyte enhancer factor 2D) and five genes (BCL9, CSF1R, DAZAP1, HNRNPUL1 and SS18) in 22 B progenitor ALL (B-ALL) cases with a distinct gene expression profile, the most common of which is MEF2D-BCL9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examination of an extended cohort of 1,164 B-ALL cases identified 30 cases with MEF2D rearrangements, which include an additional fusion partner, FOXJ2; thus, MEF2D-rearranged cases comprise 5.3% of cases lacking recurring alterations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MEF2D-rearranged ALL is characterized by a distinct immunophenotype, DNA copy number alterations at the rearrangement sites, older diagnosis age and poor outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rearrangements result in enhanced MEF2D transcriptional activity, lymphoid transformation, activation of HDAC9 expression and sensitive to histone deacetylase inhibitor treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, MEF2D-rearranged ALL represents a distinct form of high-risk leukaemia, for which new therapeutic approaches should be considered.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'B progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) is characterized by recurrent gross chromosomal alterations, including aneuploidy and rearrangements that deregulate oncogenes or result in the formation of chimeric fusion proteins that have functional properties distinct from their non-rearranged counterparts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such fusion proteins, including ETV6-RUNX1 and TCF3-PBX1, and those involving PAX5, KMT2A (MLL) and tyrosine kinases such as BCR-ABL1, are typically acquired early in leukaemogenesis and drive tumour formation by perturbing cellular pathways including haematopoietic development, tumour suppression, kinase signalling and chromatin remodelling1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identification of these rearrangements is important in the management of ALL, as several are associated with treatment outcome and/or may serve as therapeutic targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The prevalence of recurring rearrangements varies significantly according to age and in part explains the inferior outcome of ALL in older individuals3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, rearrangements associated with favourable outcome such as ETV6-RUNX1 are frequent in younger children compared with older children, whereas BCR-ABL1 and rearrangements involving CRLF2 and tyrosine kinases observed in Philadelphia chromosome-like (Ph-like) ALL are more common with increasing age3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the genetic basis of up to 30% of ALL cases is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To identify chromosomal rearrangements in B-ALL cases lacking a known recurring sentinel alteration, we performed transcriptome sequencing (RNA sequencing (RNAseq)) of 560 cases and recurrence testing in a cohort of 1,164 cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified multiple new targets of rearrangement, with rearrangements of MEF2D and ZNF384 defining subtypes with distinct transcriptional signatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, a group of 42 cases are discovered with MEF2D rearranged to BCL9, CSF1R, DAZAP1 (DAZ (deleted in azoospermia)-associated protein 1), HNRNPUL1 (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U-like 1), SS18 (synovial sarcoma translocation, chromosome 18) or FOXJ2 (Forkhead Box J2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These rearrangements dysregulate expression of MEF2D target genes and, by increasing expression of HDAC9, create a vulnerability to targeting with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The distinct gene expression profile, tumour cell immunophenotype, older age of onset and poor outcome of MEF2D-rearranged ALL cases together suggest that MEF2D-rearranged ALL represents a biologically distinct form of leukaemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fusion partners of MEF2D have a diverse range of biological functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MEF2D is a member of a family of four myocyte enhancer factor transcription factors with an important role in neuronal differentiation13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MEF2D is expressed throughout B-cell differentiation15 and inactivation of Mef2c/d results in an arrest in B-lymphoid maturation at the pre-B-cell stage15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BCL9 is located on chromosome 1q21 and was first identified as the target of a t(1;14)(q21;q32) IGH-BCL9 rearrangement in the pre-B-cell leukaemia cell line CEMO-1 (refs 5, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although IGH is rearranged to a variety of cytokine receptors and transcription factor genes in ALL, including CRLF2, EPOR and members of the CEBP family of transcription factors18,19,20,21, and multiple known and novel IGH rearrangements, were identified (Supplementary Data 1), none of the BCL9 rearrangements identified in this study involved IGH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BCL9 is a component of the WNT/-catenin signalling cascade that has important roles in development, stem cell self-renewal and oncogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BCL9 is part of the nuclear complex consisting of T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor, -catenin, BCL9/BCL9L and PYGO, which activates transcription of canonical WNT target genes such as FGF20, DKK1, WISP1, MYC, CCND1 and GCG (Glucagon)22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BCL9 has also been shown to have an oncogenic role in multiple myeloma24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The MEF2D-BCL9 rearrangement results in deregulated expression of the C terminus BCL9 expression (Supplementary Fig 2), raising the possibility that these fusions may perturb WNT/-catenin signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the MEF2D-BCL9 rearrangements involve only the last one or two of ten exons of BCL9 exons resulting in loss of the BCL9 domains that mediate interaction with PYGO1 and -catenin, consistent with the lack of enrichment of WNT/-catenin signalling in the gene expression profile of MEF2D-rearranged ALL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, IGH-BCL9 and MEF2D-BCL9 probably exert different roles in leukaemic transformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DAZAP1 is located at 19p13.3 and encodes an RNA-binding protein that interacts with the infertility factors DAZ and DAZL, and other RNA-binding proteins25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MEF2D-DAZAP1 rearrangement has previously been identified and shown to result in proliferation of fibroblasts26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HNRNPUL1 encodes a nuclear RNA-binding protein of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein family that may exert a role in nucleocytoplasmic RNA transport and DNA repair28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SS18 is fused with SSX1 or SSX2 in synovial sarcoma, and has putative roles in chromatin remodelling and WNT/-catenin signalling29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FOXJ2 is a transcription factor that has been reported to affect migration and invasiveness of various tumours31,32 but, unlike other forkhead transcription factor genes, has not previously been identified as a target of rearrangement in cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These data demonstrate the power of transcriptome sequencing to identify novel rearrangements that define new genetic subtypes of ALL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finding of MEF2D rearrangements as a hallmark of a subtype of ALL with a distinct gene expression profile provides another example of ALL subtypes that are cryptic (in this case, due to the common involvement of rearrangement of two genes co-located on one chromosome) and represented by rearrangement to diverse partners rather than a single fusion observed in other subtypes of ALL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the common involvement of the WNT co-factor BCL9, there was no evidence of dysregulated WNT/-catenin signalling in leukaemogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, deregulated MEF2D activity, with activation of HDAC9 and resulting inhibition of MEF2C were characteristic of this form of leukaemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies are required to dissect the relative role of MEF2D and partner gene involvement in leukaemogenesis, but our existing data suggest the potential for HDAC inhibition in this form of leukaemia.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
