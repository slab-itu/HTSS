Control of diabetic hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance through TSC22D4  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Obesity-related insulin resistance represents the core component of the metabolic syndrome, promoting glucose intolerance, pancreatic beta cell failure and type 2 diabetes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Efficient and safe insulin sensitization and glucose control remain critical therapeutic aims to prevent diabetic late complications Here, we identify transforming growth factor beta-like stimulated clone (TSC) 22 D4 as a molecular determinant of insulin signalling and glucose handling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hepatic TSC22D4 inhibition both prevents and reverses hyperglycaemia, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in diabetes mouse models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TSC22D4 exerts its effects on systemic glucose homeostasisat least in partthrough the direct transcriptional regulation of the small secretory protein lipocalin 13 (LCN13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human diabetic patients display elevated hepatic TSC22D4 expression, which correlates with decreased insulin sensitivity, hyperglycaemia and LCN13 serum levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results establish TSC22D4 as a checkpoint in systemic glucose metabolism in both mice and humans, and propose TSC22D4 inhibition as an insulin sensitizing option in diabetes therapy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Under physiological conditions, energy homeostasis is tightly controlled by counter-regulatory hormonal systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas pancreatic glucagon as well as adrenal glucocorticoid hormones mediate essential parts of the fasting response to ensure organ function during nutrient depletion1, the pancreatic beta-cell hormone insulin triggers the fast uptake and oxidative catabolism of glucose in liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and simultaneously inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in liver during the postprandial state2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insulin actions are mediated through its membrane-bound tyrosine kinase receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon insulin binding, the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor at the cell surface becomes activated and leads to the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple signalling components, involving consecutive phosphorylation events at the insulin receptor substrate proteins and the subsequent activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) signalling axis3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon insulin stimulation 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) phosphorylates PKB/Akt on T308 within the kinase domain, whereas PDK2, which is represented by several kinases including mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) phosphorylates Akt within its C terminus tail on S473 (refs 5, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once phosphorylated and activated Akt phosphorylates and inhibits the inhibitor of mTORC1 the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2; a.k.a Tuberin) within the Tsc1/2 to activate downstream mTORC1 signalling to S6K1 and S6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other targets of Akt include glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3 beta and Forkhead Box O 1 and 3 (FoxO1 and 3) transcription factors7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insulin signal transduction exerts control over biochemical pathways through either modulation of metabolic key enzyme activities or through the stimulation or inhibition of metabolic target gene transcription, eventually culminating in the regulation of anabolic glucose, lipid and protein metabolism8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The inability of key metabolic tissues, including skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and liver to respond to normal circulating concentrations of insulin, that is, insulin resistance, is commonly associated with obesity, ageing and a sedentary lifestyle8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions, systemic glucose and lipid homeostasis are substantially compromised, leading to successive pancreatic beta cell exhaustion and further deterioration of glucose homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon the manifestation of glucose intolerance as a marker of the pre-diabetic state, 510% of glucose-intolerant patients indeed further progress into full-blown type 2 diabetes9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interestingly, insulin resistance is not only associated with obesity-related metabolic dysfunction but also with opposing conditions of systemic energy availability, for example, tumour-induced body wasting (cancer cachexia) and lipodystrophy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, both excess and lack of adipose tissue energy stores are coupled to systemic inflammation, fatty liver development, skeletal muscle degradation and increased adipose tissue lipolysis, favoured by insulin resistance and the lack of anabolic insulin action10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, safe and effective modalities to improve systemic insulin sensitivity are direly needed not only for counteracting obesity-related type 2 diabetes but may also pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches in wasting diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this respect, we have recently identified transcription factor TSC22D4 as a regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism during cancer cachexia12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Livers of tumour-bearing mice had elevated levels of TSC22D4 and hepatic knockdown of TSC22D4 acutely led to the induction of lipogenic genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, hepatic TSC22D4 levels positively correlated with the degree of tumour-induced body wasting12, overall suggesting that hepatic TSC22D4 activity may not only be involved in the control of tissue-specific lipid metabolism but also be linked to systemic energy homeostasis by thus far unknown mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis prompted us to define the hepatic TSC22D4 target gene network and the systemic implications of hepatic TSC22D4 action at a more global level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We now identify the hepatic TSC22D4 as a potent regulator of insulin sensitivity in both murine and human diabetes, actingat least in partthrough the secreted factor lipocalin LCN13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TSC22D4 thus represents a previously unknown checkpoint in inter-organ communication and systemic metabolic control and may serve as an attractive target in insulin sensitizing diabetes therapies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Hepatic TSC22D4 deficiency improves insulin sensitivity', 'To understand the range of TSC22D4-regulated transcriptional programmes beyond the lipogenic pathway, we performed high throughput transcriptome profiling in primary mouse hepatocytes infected with adenovirus carrying either non-specific control or TSC22D4-specific shRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KEGG pathway analysis demonstrated that loss of TSC22D4 significantly regulated several biological processes, most notably including insulin signalling (Supplementary Fig 1a), suggesting that TSC22D4 may exert an important impact on hepatic and systemic insulin responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To test this hypothesis, we employed TSC22D4-deficient and control primary mouse hepatocytes and probed for the phosphorylation of prototypical insulin signalling pathway components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, TSC22D4 depletion significantly increased phosphorylation of Akt/PKB on both T308 and S473 as well as its downstream targets GSK3 beta on S9 and FoxO1 on S256 under basal and insulin-stimulated conditions, respectively (Fig 1a), overall indicating that TSC22D4 downregulates the insulin signalling pathway in a hepatocyte-autonomous manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: TSC22D4 controls intra-hepatic insulin signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Western blot analysis from representative negative control (NC shRNA) or TSC22D4 (TSC shRNA) shRNA adenovirus-treated primary mouse hepatocytes using indicated antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Right: quantification of the phospho-immunoblots normalized to corresponding total protein levels (y axis is in arbitrary units).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analysis: Students t-test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  *P0.05;

Supplementary Fig 1f), demonstrating that hepatic TSC22D4 is a critical determinant of insulin signalling also in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These results prompted us to explore the functional impact of hepatic TSC22D4 on systemic glucose metabolism in healthy C57Bl/6 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we employed an adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivery system allowing the expression of TSC22D4-directed miRNAs specifically in liver parenchymal cells but not in other liver cell types for a period of several months13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six weeks after AAV-mediated miRNA delivery, wild-type mice with hepatocyte-specific TSC22D4 deficiency (Supplementary Fig 2a) showed no change in fasting blood glucose levels (Fig 2a) but displayed significantly reduced levels of serum insulin (Fig 2b) and an improved homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index as compared with control littermates (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, hepatic TSC22D4 deficiency improved insulin-triggered systemic glucose clearance in an intra-peritoneal insulin tolerance test (Supplementary Fig 2b), and also improved glucose tolerance (Fig 2d), overall pointing towards improved systemic insulin sensitivity and glucose handling upon hepatocyte-specific TSC22D4 knockdown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate these findings in an independent and more acute setting, we down regulated hepatic TSC22D4 expression by adenoviral shRNA delivery into wild-type mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with the long-term effects, inhibition of hepatic TSC22D4 had no effect on serum glucose concentrations in healthy animals under both fasting and feeding conditions (Fig 2e;

TSC22D4 in an independent model, we acutely disrupted TSC22D4 expression in livers of New Zealand obese (NZO) mice, which represent a multigenic model of diabesity15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 16 weeks of age, NZO mice displayed severe obesity, insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia as described15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Liver-specific knockdown of TSC22D4 markedly improved insulin (Supplementary Fig 3f) and glucose tolerance (Fig 3f), normalized blood glucose levels under refed conditions (Fig 3g), and elevated Akt and GSK3 beta phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig 3j) compared with control littermates, perfectly matching the effects in db/db mice (Fig 3ae).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, while TSC22D4 knockdown in NZO mice did not affect body weight, it slightly decreased abdominal and inguinal WAT mass (Supplementary Fig 3gi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The efficient and acute improvements in diabetic glucose homeostasis next prompted us to test for a putative diabetes prevention potential of hepatic TSC22D4 inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we chronically knocked-down TSC22D4 specifically in hepatocytes of young (5 weeks old) db/db mice that still showed no signs of obesity and metabolic dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, while control animals developed severe hyperglycaemia over the course of 10 weeks and displayed substantial insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia and glucose intolerance at an age of 15 weeks (Fig 3h-j), hepatic TSC22D4 knockdown (Supplementary Fig 3k) not only prevented the onset of hyperglycaemia (Fig 3k) but also significantly improved insulin sensitivity and insulin tolerance (Fig 3h,i; Supplementary Fig 3km) and glucose tolerance over time (Fig 3j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noteworthy, at the end of the experimental 10-week period, TSC22D4 knockdown had caused a roughly 25% reduction in HbA1c levels as compared with controls (Supplementary Fig 3n), thereby outpacing the performance of metformin in an almost identical db/db experimental setup16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the induction of hypertriglyceridemia in cancer cachectic wild-type mice upon liver-specific TSC22D4 knockdown12, long-term TSC22D4 deficiency diminished serum triglycerides (TAGs) (Supplementary Fig 3o) but left liver TAG levels unaltered (Supplementary Fig 3p).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only minor changes in body weight, fat, and lean mass were transiently detectable over the course of the experiment (Supplementary Fig 3rt).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these metabolic phenotypes, long-term TSC22D4 knockdown impaired gluconeogenic gene expression but left genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and lipogenesis mostly unaffected (Fig 3ln).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'LCN13 partially mediates the effects of hepatic TSC22D4', 'To get mechanistic insights into the insulin sensitizing and glucose lowering action of hepatic TSC22D4, we screened for the most strongly regulated TSC22D4 target genes in the transcriptome data sets from TSC22D4-deficient and control mice (Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the most strongly upregulated gene upon TSC22D4 knockdown was represented by lipocalin 13 (LCN13), a member of a conserved family of small secreted proteins17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Liver cistrome analysis by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments coupled to massive parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) and subsequent ChIP-PCR confirmation identified three TSC22D4-binding sites within the Lcn 13 gene locus (Fig 4a), proposing a direct regulatory function of TSC22D4 in Lcn 13 expression through chromatin recruitment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, siRNA-mediated TSC22D4 knockdown in hepatoma cells transfected with Lcn 13 luciferase reporter constructs carrying the identified TSC22D4-binding sites within the Lcn 13 locus induced reporter gene activities (Supplementary Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance, hepatic TSC22D4 knockdown elevated Lcn 13 mRNA levels 100-, 11- and 4-fold in livers of wild-type, db/db, as well as NZO mice, respectively (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, Lcn 13 mRNA levels were significantly diminished upon hepatic TSC22D4 overexpression under both LFD and HFD conditions (Supplementary Fig 4c), and Lcn 13 mRNA was also suppressed in livers of methionine- and cholin-deficient (MCD) diet-fed lipodystrophic mice (Supplementary Fig 4d), thereby correlating with high levels of TSC22D4 in this model as reported previously12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with the proposed endocrine function of Lcn 13, western blot analysis of Akt S473 phosphorylation in skeletal muscle revealed that hepatic TSC22D4 deficiency induced not only hepatic but also skeletal muscle insulin signalling (Supplementary Fig 4e), thereby correlating with elevated LCN13 serum levels upon hepatic TSC22D4 deficiency (Fig 4c) and with direct insulin sensitization in cultured C2C12 myotubes as well as differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes upon exposure to recombinant LCN13 (Fig 4d, data not shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, hepatic TSC22D4 knockdown did not only elevate liver but also skeletal muscle glycogen stores (Supplementary Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address the functional role of LCN13 as a potential mediator of hepatic TSC22D4-dependent glucose control, we performed genetic rescue experiments in db/db diabetic mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single TSC22D4 knockdown significantly ameliorated glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia in db/db mice as shown above (Fig 4eg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably simultaneous knockdown of hepatic LCN13 and TSC22D4 expression by double adenoviral shRNA delivery (Supplementary Fig 4g) partially re-induced systemic glucose intolerance (Fig 4e) as well as dysfunctional glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance in diabetic mice (Fig 4f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, simultaneous knockdown of LCN13 and TSC22D4 also abrogated the improved liver and skeletal muscle insulin signalling that we observed with single TSC22D4 knockdown, indicated by Akt S473 phosphorylation and Glut4 expression (Supplementary Fig 4h,i), while levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were unaltered (Supplementary Fig 4j,k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these findings demonstrate that inhibition of LCN13 acts as one major functional downstream target of TSC22D4 in the control of (diabetic) glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition neither TSC22D4 nor LCN13 single or double knockdowns affected body weight, abdominal or inguinal WAT mass compared with control animals (Fig 4hj).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, consistent with improvements in insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance by whole-body transgenic overexpression of LCN13 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18) or hepatic TSC22D4 knockdown, comparative transcriptome profiling in control, single LCN13- and double TSC22D4/LCN13-deficient animals revealed that TSC22D4-dependent hepatic LCN13 regulation significantly controlled gluco- and lipid-regulatory processes as defined by KEGG pathway and gene clustering analyses in skeletal muscle (Supplementary Fig 5a,b), overall suggesting that the TSC22D4-dependent effects on systemic insulin sensitivity and glucose handling were mediated through both local, hepatic and remote, LCN13-dependent effects on extra-hepatic tissues, including skeletal muscle and probably adipose tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, LCN13 re-constitution in TSC22D4 knockdown animals (Fig 4) only partially reversed the TSC22D4-mediated phenotype and previous reports demonstrated that TSC22D4 localizes both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm in cultured neuronal cells19, suggesting that in addition to the nuclear regulation of LCN13 gene expression, TSC22D4 may engage additional cytoplasmic mechanisms to control cellular insulin signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis is in line with the cell-autonomous effects of TSC22D4 inhibition on insulin signalling in isolated hepatocytes (Fig 1) and needs to be further explored in future studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: TSC22D4 acts via the LCN13 endocrine system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Chromatin immunoprecipitation of LCN13 promoter regions

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Based on substantial side effects of existing pharmacological approaches, efficient and safe insulin sensitization and glucose control remain critical therapeutic aims to prevent diabetic late complications20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data now establish TSC22D4 as a critical node in systemic glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given its upstream regulatory function for the multi-organ enhancement of insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake, modulation of TSC22D4 function now provides novel perspectives in both the understanding of mechanisms in metabolic inter-organ communication and the development of insulin sensitizing treatment strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'According to the WHO, diabetes affects more that 347 million individuals these days with almost 90% suffering from insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these patients, blood glucose lowering therapies are the primary treatment option.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, major classes of current anti-diabetic and/or insulin sensitizing drugs are associated with severe limitations, highlighted by the recent market withdrawal of rosiglitazone20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Metformin, the most widely used first-line type 2 diabetes drug, efficiently reduces HbA1c levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this reduction is often insufficient for many diabetic patients and its functional dependence on the organic cation transporter (OCT) 1 may generate a cohort of non-responders in genetic OCT1 loss-of-function carriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, despite the proven efficacy of metformin, treatment is associated with gastro-intestinal side effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current guidelines then recommend drug combinations of metformin with sulfonylurea, thiazolidinediones, DPP-4 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These agents, however, are associated with severe side effects such as bone mineral density loss and increased fracture risk for thiazolidinediones and potentially dangerous hypoglycaemic episodes for sulfonylureas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the progressive beta-cell dysfunction that characterizes type 2 diabetes, many diabetic patients eventually require insulin replacement therapy despite oral anti-diabetic treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is tempting to speculate that the improvement of metabolic inter-tissue communication through TSC22D4 actions as demonstrated in the current manuscript may represent a particularly effective therapeutic approach in future diabetes and insulin sensitizing therapies, particularly supported by the notion of an overall conservation of the TSC22D-insulin sensitivity axis in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Of note, ablation of TSC22D4 in animals did not provoke enhanced tumour formation or hepatic dysfunction within the time spans investigated thus far, indicating that TSC2D4-based long-term therapeutic application may not be associated with enhanced tumour risk as may be predicted from the potent stimulatory impact on PI3K/Akt signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, while potential long-term complications of TSC22D4 inhibition need to be addressed in future experimental studies in detail, our data indicate that other TSC22 family members with documented pro-tumorigenic activities21 were not able to compensate for the reduced levels of hepatic TSC22D4, underlining the hypothesis that TSC22D4 displays a rather unique spectrum of biological features that might spare tumorigenic potential upon long-term inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this regard, while acute TSC22D4 inactivation in tumour-bearing animals led to hypertriglyceridemia12, this effect was absent upon long-term TSC22D4 inhibition in diabetic animals, indicating that elevated systemic lipid levels either represent a more transient consequence of hepatic TSC22D4 deficiency and may not compromise the beneficial effects of TSC22D4 inactivation in the long run or only occur in the wild type but not in the diabetic situation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Overall, our data are consistent with a model in which aberrant TSC22D4 function imposes a tonic inhibition of liver insulin signalling and LCN13 secretion, thereby promoting a metabolically dysfunctional phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interestingly, delivery of recombinant LCN13 into diabetic animals has been proven to be remarkably ineffective in terms of insulin sensitization and the restoration of glucose homeostasis18, particularly when compared with the marked effects of hepatic TSC22D4 knockdown as shown here, suggesting that the endogenous action of TSC22D4, comprising both LCN13 secretion as well as an additional, to-be-identified intracellular mechanism provides a particularly effective cue to control insulin sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the lack of efficient and safe insulin-sensitizing therapies to date, TSC22D4-mediated restoration of insulin action and thus systemic energy homeostasis under relevant disease conditions, definitely deserves further experimental exploration in the future.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
