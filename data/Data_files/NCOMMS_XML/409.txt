Fasting induces a subcutaneous-to-visceral fat switch mediated by microRNA-149-3p and suppression of PRDM16  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Visceral adiposity is strongly associated with metabolic disease risk, whereas subcutaneous adiposity is comparatively benign.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, their relative physiological importance in energy homeostasis remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that after 24-h fasting, the subcutaneous adipose tissue of mice acquires key properties of visceral fat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During this fast-induced visceralization, upregulation of miR-149-3p directly targets PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16), a key coregulatory protein required for the browning of white fat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cultured inguinal preadipocytes, overexpression of miR-149-3p promotes a visceral-like switch during cell differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice deficient in miR-149-3p display an increase in whole-body energy expenditure, with enhanced thermogenesis of inguinal fat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a visceral-like adipose phenotype is observed in inguinal depots overexpressing miR-149-3p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that in addition to the capacity of browning to defend against hypothermia during cold exposure, the subcutaneous adipose depot is also capable of whitening to preserve energy during fasting, presumably to maintain energy balance, via miR-149-3p-mediated regulation of PRDM16.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Adipocytes have been studied with increasing intensity due to the onset of the obesity epidemic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Traditionally, adipose tissues have been divided into two types: white adipose tissue (WAT), best known for storing excess energy in the form of triglycerides, and brown adipose tissue (BAT), which oxidizes chemical energy to produce heat to protect against hypothermia and obesity1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most mammals have stereotypical adipose depots located throughout the body4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Classical BAT is typically located in the interscapular region in human infants and small mammals5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WAT generally develops in distinct intra-abdominal (visceral) depots and in the subcutaneous layer1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scientists have recognized that the distribution of fat is closely linked to metabolic disease risk6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the accumulation of visceral WAT is strongly correlated with an increased risk of metabolic dysfunction and cardiovascular disease7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the expansion of subcutaneous adiposity shows little or even an inverse correlation with disease risk10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transplantation of subcutaneous depots, but not visceral fat, into the abdomen of mice leads to improved whole-body metabolism12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These divergent metabolic effects of different adipose depots have raised interest in the unique properties of visceral and subcutaneous fat1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recently, it has become clear that subcutaneous and visceral WAT have unique gene expression signatures1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, subcutaneous fat possesses substantial thermogenic capacity in response to cold stimulation compared with visceral depots14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A large accumulation of brown-like cells (termed beige/brite cells) during cold exposure is most prominent in the subcutaneous inguinal depot, whereas visceral adipocytes are less susceptible to browning1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The developmental and transcriptional control of beige cells have received much attention, mainly because of their potential roles in the defence against obesity and associated disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As an integrator of energy homeostasis, many basic physiological functions provided by adipose tissue have been overlooked because of their association with obesity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cold and hunger were probably the baseline states in humans over a substantial portion of evolutionary time15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the lipid-burning brown/beige adipocytes are specialized to maintain body temperature by producing heat in a cold environment, whereas the lipid-storing white adipocytes are adapted to cope with food shortage16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cold-induced emergence of brown-like adipocytes in subcutaneous WAT suggests that certain adipose processes are extraordinarily plastic in response to changes in environmental cues17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fasting is defined as a coordinated set of metabolic changes that spare carbohydrate usage and increase reliance on fat as the energy supply19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although several studies have reported that mobilization of the subcutaneous depot appears to be less than that of visceral fat during starvation, an important challenge is to understand the molecular mechanisms by which physiological changes regulate these different white adipose depots20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16) is a zinc-finger protein that functions as a bidirectional cell fate switch between skeletal myoblasts and promotes BAT differentiation2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, ectopic expression of PRDM16 in adipocytes strongly induces the thermogenic programme in subcutaneous depots but not in visceral fat5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, PRDM16 mRNA and protein levels are depot dependent, likely due to differential stability of the PRDM16 protein in subcutaneous and visceral depots1,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant attention has been focused on the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in adipocyte function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, several miRNAs have a preferential effect on brown and beige cell differentiation and function, including some that target PRDM16 (refs 21, 22, 23, 24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we report that, after 24 h of food deprivation, subcutaneous inguinal WAT (ingWAT) takes on many of the morphological and molecular characteristics of visceral fat to preserve energy via miR-149-3p-mediated suppression of PRDM16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data unravel the critical role of subcutaneous WAT in regulating the energy balance through miRNA-mediated regulation of PRDM16.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Fasting mobilizes more visceral fat than subcutaneous depot', 'The early stages of fasting last for up to 24 h as the body adjusts to the absence of nutrient ingestion19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we tested the relevant metabolic parameters in mice fed ad libitum or fasted for 24 h. Decreased CO2 production resulted in a markedly reduced respiratory exchange ratio (RER) in male mice, indicating that 24-h fasting stimulated a substantial shift from carbohydrate to fat-based fuel (Fig 1ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fasting for 24 h significantly reduced the body weight of both male and female mice (Fig 1d; Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six adipose depots, including interscapular BAT (BAT); three representative visceral WATs, -retroperitoneal (-RP), -mesenteric (--mes) and epididymal (-epi, male)/periovarian (-PO, female) WAT; and two major subcutaneous WATs, -inguinal (-ing) and anterior (-Ant) WAT, were collected from male and female mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a trend towards decreased weight was observed in the examined male and female depots, the weight of the BAT was mainly unchanged in fasted mice (Fig 1e; Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the subcutaneous depot, which exhibited a moderate reduction in weight, the weight of the visceral depots was significantly decreased in both male and female mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gonadal fat (-Epi for males, -PO for females) was decreased by 50% in mice, and greater than 50% fat loss was observed in the mesenteric depot, which also exists in larger mammals include humans (Fig 1fh; Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the mobilization of subcutaneous and visceral fat pads during fasting was different in male and female mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate possible depot-specific responses in fasted mice, lipogenic-related genes were measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mRNA levels of Ppar2 (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 2) and Srebp1c (sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c), two main lipogenic transcription factors, were significantly decreased in the epiWAT and mesWAT of fasted mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, twofold upregulation of Ppar2 and a slight increase in Srebp1c mRNA levels were observed in the ingWAT of fasted mice (Fig 1i,j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fasting also decreased the mRNA levels of fatty acid synthesis-related genes in the epiWAT and mesWAT, including Lpl (lipoprotein lipase), Fas (fatty acid synthesis) and Glut4 (glucose transporter type 4); however, these genes were not significantly altered in the ingWAT (Fig 1km).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the mRNA levels of Cpt1 (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1), Acox1 (acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1) and Acsl1 (Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain 1), three lipolysis genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, were markedly increased in fasted epiWAT and mesWAT, whereas the same set of genes showed a tendency towards a reduction in ingWAT (Fig 1n-p).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar depot-specific responses were observed in female fasted mice (Supplementary Fig 1ah).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that 24-h fasting triggered differential responses among adipose tissues in male and female mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the preferential mobilization of lipids in response to fasting was observed in the more internally located visceral WAT compared with the relatively externally located subcutaneous ingWAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Fasting induces depot-specific mobilization of lipids in different adipose tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ac) O2 consumption (a), CO2 production rates (b) and the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) (c) were measured by indirect calorimetry from ad libitum fed or 24 h-fasted male mice (n=6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (dh) Male mice (n=8) were fed ad libitum or fasted for 24 h (n=8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Body weight (d), weight of brown fat mass (e), subcutaneous fat mass (f), visceral fat mass (g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decreased ratios of subcutaneous and visceral fat mass (h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ip) Expression of lipogenic and lipolytic genes in epididymal, mesenteric and inguinal depots from ad libitum fed or 24 h-fasted mice (n=8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same amount of RNA was used for reverse transcription followed by real-time PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene expression was normalized to housekeeping gene Gapdh.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative levels of the lipogenic genes Ppar2 (i), Srebp1c (j), Lpl (k), Fas (l), Glut4 (m), and the lipolytic genes Cpt1 (n), Acox1 (o), Acsl1 (p) are shown (n=8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ant, anterior;

Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we used flow cytometry to measure the changes in cell size and number in ingWAT/epiWAT after a 24-h fast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the ingWAT, cold exposure induced an increase in the proportion of smaller adipocytes (FSC-H shift to the left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, a sharp decrease in smaller adipocytes was observed in the fasted ingWAT (FSC-H shift to the right); however, the size of the unilocular adipocytes was relatively stable (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vanishing of the smaller adipocytes might account for the moderate weight loss observed for the fasted ingWAT, which resulted in decreased adipocyte numbers along with an increased proportion of unilocular adipocytes in ingWAT (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For epiWAT, 24 h of cold exposure yielded no significant alteration of adipocyte size or number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the histogram showed that 24-h fasting caused a moderate decrease in epididymal cell size, which is consistent with the histological analysis (Fig 2d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the number of epididymal adipocytes was markedly decreased (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the decreased cell volume and the significantly decreased cell number presumably account for the marked weight loss in the epiWAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also quantified the major myeloid and lymphoid subsets in the ingWAT of different groups of mice26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with control animals, ingWAT from cold-exposed mice exhibited a 35% decrease in the number of CD11b+F4/80+ macrophages, whereas ingWAT from fasted mice exhibited a 30% increase (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These alterations were restricted to subcutaneous ingWAT because no differences were observed in visceral epiWAT or BAT (Fig 2g; Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data confirm previous observations of a visceral-like phenotype in the fasted ingWAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, two sets of marker genes were analysed in ingWAT and epiWAT from cold-exposed mice and fasted mice, including classical WAT-selective genes and newly identified visceral signature genes by Cohen et al.26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The classic WAT-selective genes, including Serpina3k (serine peptidase inhibitor, clade A, member 3k), Resistin, Anxa1 (annexin A1), Endra (endothelin receptor type A), Psat (phosphoserine aminotransferase) and Wdnm1 (WDNM1-like protein), were markedly increased in the fasted ingWAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the newly identified visceral signature genes3,26, which include two transcription factors (Wt1 (Wilms tumour 1) and Bnc1 (basonuclin 1)) and several proinflammatory genes (Saa3 (serum amyloid A3), Agt (angiotensinogen), Opgn (osteoprotegerin) and Raldh2 (retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2)) were also significantly upregulated in the fasted ingWAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, both sets of genes were expressed at reduced levels in the cold-exposed ingWAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither cold exposure nor fasting influenced the expression of the general adipogenic markers aP2 (adipocyte protein 2) and AdipoQ (adiponectin C1Q and collagen domain containing) (Fig 2h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results confirmed that a visceral-like switch occurred at the molecular level in the fasted ingWAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also tested these representative WAT/visceral-selective genes in BAT and visceral WAT (epiWAT and mesWAT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither the classic WAT-selective nor the visceral signature genes were significantly altered in these adipose tissues (Fig 2i; Supplementary Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results were also confirmed in female mice, indicating that fasting can drive a subcutaneous-to-visceral-like switch at both the morphological and molecular levels (Fig 2j; Supplementary Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Fasting drives visceral-like morphological and molecular phenotypes in ingWAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Representative images from haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections of inguinal adipose tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 100 m.

When mice were exposed to cold, the 24-h fast did not efficiently induce morphological, molecular or functional visceralization of ingWAT, indicating that cold diminished the effect of fasting on visceral switching (Supplementary Fig 3dh).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emerging evidence suggests fascinating effects of intermittent fasting27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we performed intermittent fasting on mice, by alternating 24-h cycles of fasting and ad libitum feeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The visceral fats decreased, which might account for the observation of a slight decrease in body weight (Supplementary Fig 3i,k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This alternate day-fasting (ADF) also markedly increased the expressions of mitochondrial biogenesis genes in the epiWAT of the mice (Supplementary Fig 3l).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, unlike visceral fat, both the decreased weight and the impaired mitochondrial biogenesis were restored in subcutaneous depots by 24-h refeeding, suggesting that the visceralization of the ingWAT is an adaptive response to 24-h fasting-induced physiological stress to maintain whole-body energy homeostasis (Supplementary Fig 3j,l).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results confirmed that ADF preferentially consumes the metabolically harmful visceral fat, and that long-term ADF might benefit health28,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, the 24-h fast did not significantly influence on the mRNA level of Prdm16 (Fig 3i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, the protein level of PRDM16 decreased markedly in the fasted ingWAT of both male and female mice (Fig 3j,k; Supplementary Fig 3m,n).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because PRDM16 is a critical mediator of adaptive thermogenesis in subcutaneous WAT, fasting might suppress the thermogenic programme in the ingWAT mainly by suppressing the protein level of PRDM16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inconsistency in mRNA and protein levels strongly suggests that a post-transcriptional mechanism may function in the regulation of PRDM16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the expression levels of Gapdh (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and 36b4 were stable in both fasted and cold-exposed mouse samples (Supplementary Fig 3o), the relative gene expression levels were obtained by normalization to Gapdh and confirmed by 36b4 (Supplementary Fig 3p).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Fasting induces a functional visceral-like switch in ingWAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Transmission electron microscopy of inguinal adipose tissue in the three groups of mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 5m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Mitochondrial numbers in inguinal adipose tissue sections from male mice (n=5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) O2 consumption in inguinal, epididymal and mesenteric white adipose tissue from the three groups of mice (n=6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Normalized expression of mitochondrial component genes in inguinal, epididymal and mesenteric adipose tissue in fasted mice compared with that in male control mice (n=8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Normalized thermogenic genes in inguinal adipose tissues from the ad libitum and 24 h-fasted male and female mice (n=8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (fh) Quantification of UCP1 protein in inguinal subcutaneous adipose tissue from ad libitum-fed and, 24-h-fasted male mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) Representative images of sections from UCP1 immunohistochemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 100 m.

Supplementary Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, inhibition of the miRNA using an anti-miR-149-3p oligonucleotide markedly increased the protein level of PRDM16 in control cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mRNA level of Prdm16 was largely unchanged in cells transfected with the anti-miR-149-3p, although a trend towards elevation was observed (Fig 4h,i; Supplementary Fig 4g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because the levels of PRDM16 mRNA and protein were both very efficiently decreased (greater than 75% reduction) by the sh-Prdm16 vectors in adipocytes, transfection with neither the miR-149-3p mimic nor the anti-miR-149-3p oligonucleotide significantly altered the PRDM16 protein level (Fig 4g,i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that PRDM16 is a direct target of miR-149-3p in subcutaneous ingWAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 4j, because miR-149-3p has rarely been reported, we also measured its expression level in different mouse tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Prdm16 is directly targeted by miR-149-3p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Heat map showing the relative expression of miRNAs that changed in the opposite direction in inguinal adipose tissues of fasted and cold exposed mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each sample comprised a pool of inguinal adipose tissues from four animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each column depicts an individual miRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each row depicts the miRNA expression in fasted or cold exposed samples relative to the expression in control mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fold change for the samples is colour-coded according to the key.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Relative expression level of miRNA-149-3p normalized to snRNAU6 measured by quantitative real-time PCR in inguinal, epididymal, mesenteric and brown adipose tissue from cold-exposed and fasted male mice, or in inguinal adipose tissue from fasted female mice (n=8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Putative miRNA target sites of miR-149-3p within the 3-UTR of Prdm16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Bioinformatic prediction of miR-149-3p target sites and free energy values within the 3-UTRs of mouse and human Prdm16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Relative luciferase activity in HEK293T cells transfected with plasmid reporter constructs containing the 3-UTR or mutated 3-UTR of Prdm16, co-transfected with mimic-miR-149-3p (n=6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f,g) Prdm16 mRNA (f) and protein (g) levels in two-day differentiated inguinal SV cells infected with adenovirus expressing a shRNA targeted to Prdm16 or a scrambled control shRNA (sh-Nc), co-transfected with scramble or miR-149-3p mimic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (h,i) PRDM16 mRNA (h) and protein (i) levels in two-day differentiated inguinal SV cells infected with adenovirus expressing a shRNA targeted to Prdm16 or a scrambled control shRNA (sh-Nc), co-transfected with scramble or miR-149-3p anti-miRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (j) Relative miR-149-3p expression level in different tissues of mice measured by RTPCR (n=8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BAT;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The obesity epidemic has generated considerable interest in adipose tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The clinical description of obesity has largely been based on measurements that gauge total body fat34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, scientists have recognized that the location of fat appears to have a close association with obesity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Visceral adiposity, which is more commonly observed among men than premenopausal women, is strongly associated with increased mortality35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the accumulation of subcutaneous adiposity has been termed metabolically healthy obesity, which suggests that the distinct metabolic effects of visceral and subcutaneous WAT are most likely cell autonomous36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fasting has been practiced for millennia and has been used as a powerful tool for studying the regulation of intermediary metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we showed that 24-h fasting triggered a depot-specific pattern of changes in both lipogenic and lipolytic genes in mice, indicating preferential mobilization of lipids in visceral depots compared with subcutaneous fat pads (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Food deprivation also stimulated a visceral-like switch in subcutaneous depots, from the morphological to the functional level (Figs 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation may be evolutionarily important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During fasting, preferentially oxidized visceral fat can drain directly into the portal circulation and appears to be more efficient at meeting energy needs compared with the relatively externally located subcutaneous fat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simultaneously, because large amounts of visceral fat are being used, subcutaneous fat must undergo a morphological and functional visceral-like switch to prepare to become a backup energy reservoir.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, under certain physiological circumstances, subcutaneous fat can be used to supplement the functions of visceral fat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite sharing the ability to accumulate triglycerides, the physiological roles of WAT and BAT are almost diametrically opposite2, which makes sense evolutionarily, because hunger and cold are two historical challenges during the development and evolution of mammals15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although studies have demonstrated the existence of BAT in adult humans, it is still debated whether the amount of activated BAT in humans is sufficient to impact energy balance in a meaningful way17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, subcutaneous WAT is very abundant in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies indicate that a subset of the precursor cells within subcutaneous adipose tissue can give rise to beige/brite cells, which are capable of defending against hypothermia and obesity37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, beige cells are rarely observed in visceral fat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The striking but appreciated browning ability of subcutaneous has caused an explosion of interest in the function of this adipose tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, using a 24-h fasting stimulus, we found that fasting stimulated a set of visceral-selective gene transcripts but decreased the expression of genes related to the thermogenic programme (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This whitening of subcutaneous adipocytes intuitively makes sense, because it not only reduces heat production but also reserves energy to supplement visceral fat during fasting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, cold exposure and fasting, two different physiological stimuli, lead to nearly opposite phenotypic and functional changes in subcutaneous adipocytes to maintain the energy balance (Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This extraordinary plasticity of subcutaneous adipocytes suggests that this adipose tissue might play even broader roles in the physiology and homeostasis of animals, particularly in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 9: Subcutaneous WAT links energy balance through miR-149-3p-mediated regulation of Prdm16.After fasting for 24 h, subcutaneous ingWAT takes on many of the morphological and molecular characteristics of visceral fat to preserve energy via miR-149-3p-mediated suppression of PRDM16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, 24-h cold exposure decreased miR-149-3p and led to increased PRDM16 protein levels and adaptive thermogenesis in ingWAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings unravel the extraordinary plasticity of subcutaneous WAT and its critical role in regulating energy homeostasis, especially in response to different physiological changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BAT, brown adipose tissue; SubQ, subcutaneous; VISC, visceral; WAT, white adipose tissue.Full size image', 'miR-149-3p has rarely been investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study demonstrated that miR-149-3p directly targets and negatively regulates Prdm16 and that inhibition of miR-149-3p promotes the differentiation of precursors from subcutaneous to beige cells, thereby leading to increased mitochondrial activity (Figs 4 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, neither of these alterations was observed in miR-149-3p-depleted epididymal adipocytes, suggesting that miR-149-3p might have tissue-specific roles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might be because the expression of Prdm16 is much lower in epiWAT than in ingWAT1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the manipulation of fat stores is an obvious therapeutic objective, but disruption of the normal differentiation or development of WAT causes lipodystrophy in both humans and experimental animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrated that subcutaneous inhibition by anti-miR-149-3p-activated beige cell development in ingWAT and subsequently increased whole-body energy expenditure without causing dysfunction in other tissues, which might be a potential strategy to counteract obesity (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We are still in the process of understanding the similarities and differences between subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that in addition to the capability of browning to defend against hypothermia during cold exposure, subcutaneous WAT acquires many characteristics of visceral WAT to preserve energy during fasting via miRNA-mediated regulation of PRDM16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest an important role for subcutaneous in the regulation of energy homeostasis, especially when encountering different physiological changes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
