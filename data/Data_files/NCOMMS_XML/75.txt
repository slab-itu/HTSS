KCNJ15/Kir4.2 couples with polyamines to sense weak extracellular electric fields in galvanotaxis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Weak electric fields guide cell migration, known as galvanotaxis/electrotaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sensor(s) cells use to detect the fields remain elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we perform a large-scale screen using an RNAi library targeting ion transporters in human cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify 18 genes that show either defective or increased galvanotaxis after knockdown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of the KCNJ15 gene (encoding inwardly rectifying K+ channel Kir4.2) specifically abolishes galvanotaxis, without affecting basal motility and directional migration in a monolayer scratch assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depletion of cytoplasmic polyamines, highly positively charged small molecules that regulate Kir4.2 function, completely inhibits galvanotaxis, whereas increase of intracellular polyamines enhances galvanotaxis in a Kir4.2-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of a polyamine-binding defective mutant of KCNJ15 significantly decreases galvanotaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown or inhibition of KCNJ15 prevents phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) from distributing to the leading edge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together these data suggest a previously unknown two-molecule sensing mechanism in which KCNJ15/Kir4.2 couples with polyamines in sensing weak electric fields.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Being able to sense the environment is one of the most critical functions of living cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ligandreceptor binding is a well-understood biochemical sensing (signalling) mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells are also responsive to mechanical force, electrical fields (EFs), heat and light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sensing mechanisms for those physical factors are different and unique, and are much less well understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small physiological direct current EFs are found in living organisms from plants to animals, for example at wounds, regeneration sites and tumours, and provide a strong guidance cue for directional cell migration, a phenomenon termed galvanotaxis/electrotaxis that was first demonstrated over 100 years ago1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small applied EFs can regulate cell migration, proliferation, morphology, orientation, polarization and even the collective behaviours of large cell groups5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Galvanotaxis may play a crucial role in wound healing/regeneration and development7,8,9,10,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interest in using this powerful mechanism to engineer cells and tissues is growing stronger14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electric stimulation has long being attempted and trialled in many diverse conditions such as chronic wounds15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecules serving as the sensor(s) for the weak EFs, however, remain unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Ion channels are the key molecules involved in production and sensing of biological electrical activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ion channels conduct ion(s) across the cell membrane and play important roles for the generation of action potential in various excitable cells, the maintenance of resting membrane potential in either excitable and non-excitable cells, and homoeostasis of ionic environments of the cell16,17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ion channels are localized at the plasma membrane and are among the first groups of molecules exposed to extracellular EFs; this category of proteins therefore would be a promising candidate to be the sensor of weak extracellular EFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We developed a large-scale systematic screen to determine roles for ion channels in sensing weak EFs in galvanotaxis of human cells.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Implementation of screening strategy', 'As a first step to discover the sensor molecule(s) for galvanotaxis, we developed large-scale screening methods to identify ion channel genes that are important in galvanotaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the On-target plus siRNA human ion channel siRNA library.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This library contains 381 siRNAs against genes coding human ion channels, pumps and transporters (Fig 1, Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We transfected siRNA individually into telomerase immortalized human corneal epithelial cells (hTCEpi cells) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transfection efficiency was over 95% as judged from fluorescence of control oligo transfection (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Large-scale RNAi

stencil facilitated cell spotting in the galvanotaxis chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells, 48 h after transfection, were spotted onto galvanotaxis/electrotaxis chamber, pre-coated with FNC coating mixture, which could be guided by the stencil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Multi-field video imaging to efficiently record cell migration of many types of cells in one experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After cells adhered to the culture dish, the stencil was removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chamber was covered with a coverslip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct current was applied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell migration was imaged with a time-lapse imaging system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Knockdown of channels with the RNAi library revealed genes important for galvanotaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Graphs show migration directedness (cos ) and migration speed from first screening of the whole library.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control is indicated by the blue line (cos =0.64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Migration speed was normalized to paired control (=1,

in red, representing genes that after knockdown significantly inhibited galvanotaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell numbers analysed for each conditions 3569.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EF=200 mV mm1.Full size image', 'We used multi-spot seeding to screen for the galvanotaxis phenotype in large numbers of different types of cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To increase screen efficiency, we developed stencils with multi-wells in which cells after different treatments could be seeded separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Placing the stencil on the culture dish allowed us to simultaneously seed cells on spot arrays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells after transfection with different siRNA can therefore be seeded separately on each bottomless well without cross contamination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used polydimethylsiloxane materials that adhere to the culture dish base with a water-tight seal that prevents well to well exchange of medium or cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our current galvanotaxis chamber allows up to 50 different treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 48 h after transfection cells were trypsinized and seeded into the wells of the galvanotaxis chamber pre-coated with FNC Coating Mix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After cells adhere to the dish, the stencil can be lifted and removed (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were then exposed to EFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On a motorized stage with multi-field video imaging, cells transfected with different siRNAs on up to 50 different spots can be video imaged at the same time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Galvanotactic migration was recorded with an inverted microscope for 30 min in a direct current EF of 200 mV mm1, and quantitatively analysed using ImageJ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method increased screening efficiency 50 times or more compared with traditional galvanotaxis experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, cells transfected with different siRNAs were processed and imaged at the same time in the same chamber together with the transfection control, minimizing batch to batch variation and significantly optimizing comparability of migration analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'RNAi screening identified genes important in galvanotaxis', 'We used the large-scale screening strategy to obtain galvanotaxis profiles after knockdown of individual ion channel subunits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We quantified directedness (cos ) and migration speed using ImageJ software with MTrackJ and Chemotaxis Tool plugins (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The directedness value quantifies how directionally the cells move in the field direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Migration of a population of cells toward the cathode gives a directedness value larger than 0 and approaching 1, with a value of exactly 1 indicating a cell moved straight to the cathode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Migration of a population of cells towards the anode gives a directedness value smaller than 0 and approaching 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of some channels showed significant effects on both migration directedness and speed, while some affected migration directedness more than the speed, and some affected speed more than the directedness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compilation of the directedness and speed data demonstrated the profiling of galvanotaxis after knockdown of individual ion channels in the library (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To identify which gene knockdowns showed significant effects on the migration speed and directedness, we set cutoff lines at 2.5% of the population distribution of both the directedness and migration values after knockdown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis identified 35 gene knockdowns that showed significant effects on galvanotaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All except one affected migration speed or directedness separately, not both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After knockdown, 18 genes significantly affected directednessKCNJ15, KCNAB2 and 7 others genes significantly decreased the directedness value, while knockdown of KCNJ5 or GABRG3 or any of other 6 genes significantly increased the directedness (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seventeen gene knockdowns significantly affected the migration speedKCNA3, KCNA1 and seven other genes reduced the migration speed, while CLIC3, AQP3 and six other genes increased the speed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The one exception is ANO1; after knockdown, both migration speed and directedness increased significantly (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a few cases, there appeared to be distinctively separate roles for the same category of genes in regulation of speed and directedness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of ligand-gated Cl channelsGABRG3, GABRQ decreased the directedness without affecting migration speed, while the other family members GABRR2, GLRA1 and GLRA2 decreased the speed without significantly affecting the directedness (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Voltage-gated K+ channels also showed similar separately regulated speed and directednessKCNA7, KCNAB1, KCNAB2 reduced directedness, while KCNA1, KCNA3 decreased speed (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We performed a z score analysis which allows differentiation of more significantly different values from large samples (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We set the cutoff value as a z score  greater than 0.495 or  less_than 0.7, according to the upper and lower 2.5% of the distribution of the data, and this identified 18 genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knocking down nine candidates increased directedness, and knockdown of nine decreased directedness (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of K+, Ca2+, Cl and non-selective cation channels showed significant decrease or increase in galvanotaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 18 genes identified include five K+ channels (KCNJ15, KCNJ5, KCNA7, KCNAB1 and KCNAB2), three that encode -subunits of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (CACNGsCACNG3, CACNG5 and CACNG8), two CLC Cl channels, Ca2+-activated Cl channel (ANO1), two ligand-gated Cl channels (GABRG3 and GABRQ), two purinergic receptors (P2RX1 and P2RX5), water channel (MIP) and two other genes (ENSA and TNFAIP1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Genes which after knocking down caused impaired or enhanced galvanotaxis.Full size table', 'KCNJ15 specifically mediated the field sensing', 'To minimize possible interference of decreased speed on quantification of directedness, we grouped genes according to the effects on migration speed and directedness after knockdown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose to focus on genes that after knockdown showed significantly decreased directedness without significant effect on migration speed (rose-coloured part in Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KCNJ15 stood out; knockdown of KCNJ15, a gene encoding inwardly rectifying K+ channel Kir4.2, completely inhibited galvanotaxis while maintaining the same migration speed as non-target RNAi control (Table 1; Fig 2ce; Supplementary Video 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because this gene knockdown showed the most significant inhibition of directedness without affecting migration speed, we chose KCNJ15 for further study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown efficiency was confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and western blot for mRNA and protein, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transfection of siRNA against KCNJ15 successfully reduced mRNA expression level by 80% (Supplementary Fig 3a) and Kir4.2 protein level by 60% (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inwardly rectifying K+ channels, including KCNJ15/Kir4.2, are known to be important for the maintenance of resting membrane potential in various cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore measured the resting membrane potential of KCNJ15 knocked down cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resting membrane potential of KCNJ15 knocked down cells was significantly less negative (38.98±0.66 mV; mean±s.e.m.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  than that of control cells (52.14±0.78 mV; Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether other inward rectifying K+ channels may also participate in EF sensing, we tested KCNJ10/Kir4.1, which is also expressed in mouse corneal epithelial cells20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the hTCEpi cells tested here, Kir4.1 appeared to localize exclusively in the perineuclear region (Supplementary Fig 11, see below for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Effective knocking down of KCNJ10 had significantly less effect on the membrane potential (48.57±1.04 mV from 52.14±0.78 mV) than knocking down of KCNJ15 (Supplementary Figs 3b and 4), and also on galvanotaxis (cos =0.69±0.09 from 0.64±0.001) than knocking down of KCNJ15 (cos =0.12±0.11 from 0.64±0.001; Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KCNJ10/Kir4.1 perhaps plays a lesser role in both galvanotaxis and resting membrane potential maintenance than KCNJ15/Kir4.2 in the hTCEpi cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: KCNJ15

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Important intracellular signalling mediators for galvanotaxis have been identified, for example, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase  (PI3K), PTEN, Src, Rac, cAMP and cGMP (refs 26, 33, 34, 35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proximal sensor molecule(s) and/or sensing mechanism(s) remain elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies suggested some potential molecule sensor(s), including epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in keratinocytes, voltage-gated sodium channel in prostate cancer cells and potassium transporters in yeasts37,38,39,40,41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Voltage-gated sodium, potassium and calcium channels (Nav, Kv and Cav) possess a voltage sensing domain and respond to membrane potential change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these channel proteins can usually only respond to large potential change (10 mV or more across the cell membrane)43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is one to several orders larger than the threshold fields that can induce marked electrotaxis (0.22 mV across a cell of 20 m diameter in a field of 10100 mV mm1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No known molecules are able to detect such a small field, which only induces less than 1% change in membrane potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Potassium channels are implicated in migration in epithelial cells, neutrophils, astrocytes and fibroblasts, presumably through ion influx or efflux, which would generate a driving force for water flow at both leading and trailing edges through aquaporin water channels27,44,45,46,47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kir4.2 is an inward rectifying K+ channel that co-localizes with 91 integrin and SAT/SSAT at the leading edge in glioma and Chinese hamster ovary cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SAT/SSAT decreases local SPM/SPD concentration and allows K+ efflux locally to regulate cell migration27,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'KCNJ15 was one of a group of genes whose knockdown showed significantly decreased directedness but less effect on speed of cell migration (Supplementary Fig 2, rose-coloured part).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to KCNJ15, three other K+ channel-encoding genes (KCNA7, KCNAB1 and KCNAB2), one cation permeable channel gene (P2RX5), two GABA receptor subunit coding genes (GABRG3 and GABRQ) and two other genes ENSA and TNFAIP1 fell into this group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The product of ENSA may regulate the ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of the gene targets appear to relate to K+ fluxes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a recent elegant study using budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), Haupt et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  demonstrated that K+ transporter Trk1p is a key molecule for EF-induced budding and polarization, which may be mediated by Cdc42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using light-sensitive ion channels expressed in yeast, the site of polarization could be controlled using a focused laser beam42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results in human cells reported here and the identification of K+ transport in yeast polarization by Haupt et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  suggest a conserved role for K+ flux in integration of electrical regulation into much better understood biochemical pathways in cell polarity, for example, through cdc42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further investigation on K+ in regulation of cell polarization and directional migration will likely provide significant insights.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of those channels are known to be involved in membrane potential regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, knockdown of KCNJ15 significantly depolarized the cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These different channel targets offer a great basis to answer whether channels other than K+ channels share the same signalling transduction mechanism, and how they converge to result in directional polarization and migration in an EF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In hTCEpi cells, inhibition of Kir4.2 by knockdown of KCNJ15 or BaCl2 treatment, or depletion of intracellular SPM/SPD, abolished galvanotaxis without affecting motility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells establish front-rear polarity and maintain the polarity during migration49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Establishment of polarity requires the breaking of cell symmetry50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many signalling molecules, such as small GTPases (Rho, Rac and Cdc42), atypical PKC (aPKC) and PIP3/PIP2 regulate and maintain front-rear polarity51,52,53,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PIP3 accumulates at the front of Dictyostelium cells and neutrophils in establishment and maintenance of polarity in chemotaxis as well as in electrotaxis26,36,55,56,57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KCNJ15 knockdown and BaCl2 treatment abolished PIP3 accumulation at the front (Figs 2h and 3d), and these cells did not migrate directionally (Figs 2ce and 3ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the expression of polyamine-binding defective mutant (E157N) partially inhibited PIP3 polarization in the front of hTCEpi cells (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that KCNJ15/Kir4.2 and its interaction with polyamines are essential for sensing an EF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In anode-migrating HaCaT and MDA-MB-231 cells, knocking down of KCNJ15 or manipulation of intracellular polyamines also affected galvanotaxis significantly (Figs 4 and 5e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that KCNJ15/Kir4.2 and polyamines are also important for anodal galvanotaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polarization of anode-migrating cells under EFs might be regulated by different mechanism(s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, our recent study shows that fish keratocyte and fragments derived from parental keratocyte use competing mechanisms to migrate in opposite directions in response to EFs (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Poo and colleagues have reported that differences in cyclic AMP-dependent activity in a neuronal cell result in opposite turning of the growth cone in response to the same guidance cue (for example, Netrin-1)59,60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Xu et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  reported that inhibition of Gi with pertussis toxin caused HL-60 cells to polarize away from chemoattractants61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that presetting of the intracellular signalling networks may determine cell polarization direction so the cells may polarize in opposite directions to the same stimulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It has been suggested that intracellular charged small molecules migrate in a certain direction (positively charged molecules migrate to negative pole, and negatively charged molecules migrate to positive pole) when the cells are exposed to a physiological extracellular EF (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cooper et al.63 demonstrated that an applied EF redistributed injected dye molecules with positive charge in a crayfish nerve cord.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dye moved toward the negative pole in response to an extracellular EF, and could even migrate to the neighbour cells through gap junctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Applied EFs induced intracellular polyamines to accumulate at the cathode-facing edge (Fig 5i,j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, localization of Kir4.2 protein was not affected by applied EFs (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Asymmetrically redistributed polyamines bind to Kir4.2 to regulate K+ fluxes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, expression of mutated molecule with defective polyamine-binding site in KCNJ15-E157N significantly decreased the electrotaxis response (Fig 5fh), suggesting the necessity of Kir4.2-polyamine interaction in regulation of electrotaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We propose here a two-molecule coupling model in galvanotaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Weak extracellular EFs redistribute positively charged polyamines, which then bind to Kir4.2 to regulate the K+ fluxes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, this two-molecule mediated sensing mechanism appears to be essential for both cathode- and anode-migrating cells (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that Kir4.2 activity-induced local changes in membrane potential, osmolality and ionic environment may affect the well-established PI3K/Akt pathway, and eventually affect actin polymerization and membrane protrusion64,65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There may be direct interaction between Kir channel(s) and Akt, which is downstream of PIP3 (refs 66, 67; Supplementary Fig 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we have developed an effective screening strategy to profile the galvanotaxis phenotype in large numbers of different types of cells from libraries, either through RNAi knockdown, mutation or other treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach identified a group of key channel genes and proteins that are critical for galvanotaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, two categories of channel are foundenhancers and inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among them, KCNJ15 is an essential gene for sensing extracellular EFs in human epithelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest a novel two-molecule model by which Kir4.2 interacts with intracellular polyamines in sensing weak extracellular EFs in galvanotaxis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
