Dynamic control of light emission faster than the lifetime limit using VO2 phase-change  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Modulation is a cornerstone of optical communication, and as such, governs the overall speed of data transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, the two main strategies for modulating light are direct modulation of the excited emitter population (for example, using semiconductor lasers) and external optical modulation (for example, using MachZehnder interferometers or ring resonators).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recent advances in nanophotonics offer an alternative approach to control spontaneous emission through modifications to the local density of optical states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, by leveraging the phase-change of a vanadium dioxide nanolayer, we demonstrate broadband all-optical direct modulation of 1.5 m emission from trivalent erbium ions more than three orders of magnitude faster than their excited state lifetime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This proof-of-concept demonstration shows how integration with phase-change materials can transform widespread phosphorescent materials into high-speed optical sources that can be integrated in monolithic nanoscale devices for both free-space and on-chip communication.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The tunable properties of phase-change materials provide an exciting opportunity to modulate the optical response of optoelectronic devices, potentially at ultrafast speeds1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, phase-change materials have been considered as a means to modulate reflection and transmission of nanoscale films and devices5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose here a new framework to directly modulate light emission from integrated sources faster than their radiative lifetime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concept is based on the dynamic manipulation of light through tailoring the local density of optical states (LDOS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such LDOS engineering can be used to control the direction9, polarization10,11 and spectrum12,13 of light emission, even at sub-lifetime scales14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we use phase-change materials within an engineered optical environment to dynamically control the spontaneous light emission of a quantum emitter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We leverage the ultrafast insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) of vanadium dioxide (VO2)2,3,4 as well as the symmetry difference in the polarization of electric dipole (ED) and magnetic dipole (MD) transitions of erbium ions to demonstrate direct all-optical modulation of spontaneous emission at sub-lifetime scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Distinct from direct electronic modulation of off-chip III-V based lasers15,16,17 or optical modulation using external interferometers18,19,20, this approach enables both the emitter and modulator to be monolithically integrated into a single nanoscale device.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Design', 'The key to realizing optical modulation is to design a multilayer structure such that the phase-change layer can be externally switched by a control laser while also having maximum influence on the LDOS of the emitter layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A simple design to achieve this goal is a quarter-wavelength phase-change layer (that is, thickness  where n is the refractive index) located between an emitter layer and a metal mirror, as shown in Fig 1a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the stack is constructed in this way, there is a  phase shift in the effective optical path length when the VO2 is switched from the insulating to metallic state (Fig 1b,c), which maximizes the influence of the phase-change on the surrounding LDOS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Sketch of the sample and illustration of LDOS modulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Sketch of the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inset shows the polarization symmetries of ED and MD radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b,c) illustrate the interference of ED and MD emission processes when the VO2 layer is in the insulating and metallic phases, respectively.Full size image', 'As the process of light emission depends both on the optical environment and on the intrinsic properties of the emitter, engineering spontaneous emission also requires knowledge of the underlying electronic transitions (that is, emission wavelength and dipolar nature).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emission from erbium at 1.5 m has a multipolar character, showing equal contributions from ED and MD transitions13,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the energy-momentum spectroscopy set-up shown in Fig 2a, we can precisely quantify the intrinsic radiative rates of ED and MD transitions in a thin film of Er3+:Y2O3 (refs 13, 22; Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of this analysis illustrate how the photoluminescence spectrum (shown in Fig 2b) originates from a combination of spectrally distinct ED and MD transitions (shown in Fig 2c)13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two kinds of transitions typically present differing field symmetries: ED emit with symmetric electric fields, while MD emit with antisymmetric electric fields (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This symmetry difference can be leveraged to dynamically enhance (or suppress) their emission by modifying the electric and magnetic LDOS via the VO2 IMT and therefore switch between these distinct spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Experimental set-up and ED/MD contributions to Er3+ emission around 1.5 m.(a) Experimental set-up used for conventional photoluminescence,

experimentally investigate this direct modulation of Er3+ light emission induced by the VO2 phase-change, we fabricated a multilayer structure with  and .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this particular geometry, the device is designed such that the emitter layer has a high magnetic LDOS when VO2 is in the insulating state, but switches to a high electric LDOS when VO2 is in the metallic state as shown in Fig

optical properties (that is, thickness and refractive index of individual layers), we can theoretically predict the normalized photoluminescence spectrum as a function of the VO2 state (see Methods section and Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the measured refractive indices of VO2 in the insulating state, as shown in Fig 3c, the theoretical prediction (black line) matches well with the experimental spectrum without 1,064 nm laser illumination (shaded red area).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the insulating state, these calculations indicate that 70% of the total emission originates from MD transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, as shown in Fig 3d, when we use the measured refractive indices of VO2 in the metallic state, we accurately predict the experimental spectrum obtained under 1,064 nm illumination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the metallic state, the calculations suggest that MD transitions account for a much smaller percentage of emission (21%) and the vast majority of emission (79%) originates from ED transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Modulating spontaneous emission faster than lifetime limit', 'We have therefore experimentally demonstrated that light emission from Er3+ ions around 1.5 m can be controllably switched from MD-dominant emission to ED-dominant emission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result of this tuning is a significant modulation of the spectral shape, intensity and polarization of light emission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But the two most important implications of using a phase-change material to modulate light emission are the following: (i) The resulting modulation is broadband: in this experiment it covers the S-, C- and L-bands of conventional fibre-optic communication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, given the ultra-broadband tuning of VO2 refractive index (Supplementary Fig 5), the modulation range can easily be extended to shorter wavelengths (down to 500 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) This all-optical switching exploits modifications to the LDOS rather than pumping on and off the electronic system governing light emission (Supplementary Figs 6 and 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a fundamental difference in the time-scales of these two processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example when Er3+ ions are subjected to a pulsed excitation, the time-scale of the decay process is intrinsically limited by the long lifetime of the emitters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is clearly evidenced in Fig 4b, where full decay of photoluminescence from the 4I13/2 excited state requires almost 10 ms. On the other hand, if we use the 532 nm laser as a continuous excitation source and a pulsed 1,064 nm laser to dynamically switch the VO2 phase, we can modulate the emission much faster than the decay time of Er3+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4c presents the normalized time-resolved photoluminescence in two wavelength ranges of interest: the S-band (1,4501,520 nm; ED-dominant, blue line) and the C-band (1,5401,560 nm; MD-dominant, red line) when the 1,064 nm control laser is chopped by an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) at a repetition rate of 200 kHz (see Fig 2a for a schematic of the set-up and Methods for a detailed description of the measurements).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are able to clearly modulate light emission at time-scales more than three orders of magnitude faster than the lifetime of Er3+ ions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Note that without the VO2 layer, no modulation is observed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we observe that when the S-band ED-emission (blue line) is enhanced, the C-band MD-emission (red line) is simultaneously suppressed: a clear indication that the modulated emission is consistent with the linked ED and MD LDOS changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the observed intensity modulation ratio of 2:1 results from our use of spectrally mixed ED and MD transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even when switching from strongly MD emission (72% MD) to strongly ED emission (21% MD), the resulting intensity modulation will be lower than the average rate change (for example, 72%/21%), because ED and MD emission is mixed throughout the wavelength region of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One could achieve greater modulation depths by leveraging further differences beyond spectral intensity, such as the differing phase and polarization symmetries of ED and MD emission22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the -phase shift between ED and MD transitions could be used for differential phase shift keying modulation23.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We expect the fundamental limit on the speed of modulation to be significantly faster than this initial demonstration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our experiment, the speed of switching is mainly limited by the AOM used to modulate the 1,064 nm control laser.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In theory, dynamic modulation of emission through tuning the LDOS is only limited by retardation effects (that is, the time needed for light to propagate from the emitter to the reflecting layer and back).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the proposed device should allow modulation speeds approaching the time-scale of the IMT of VO2, which may be as fast as a few hundreds of femtoseconds2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ultimate switching speed of our device could be tested in future studies by using an ultrafast laser (for example, Ti:Sapphire) to switch VO2 (refs 2, 4), while continuously pumping Er ions and monitoring their luminescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, one could electrically modulate the VO2 layer to eliminate the need for ultrafast lasers and, in turn, investigate device performance in a more practical operating mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using phase-change media such as VO2 to dynamically control spontaneous emission allows for complete device integration onto a single chip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a monolithic and heterogeneous integration is demonstrated here for the first time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the use of phase-change materials dramatically increases the speed of LDOS modulation by orders of magnitude over initial mechanical approaches using piezoelectrically actuated mirrors14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dynamic modulation of spontaneous emission in this monolithic nanoscale device could potentially reach ultrafast speeds, up to the phase transition kinetics of VO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The presented device has a very simple geometry: it is composed of a stack of planar nanolayers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (See Supplementary Fig 8 for demonstration of sub-lifetime modulation of Er3+ emission using a different multilayer stack with a silicon spacer and gold mirror.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the respective thicknesses are crucial for engineering the modulation amplitude, there are no restrictions on the lateral dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, in this experiment, both laser beams were confined to a diffraction-limited spot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a device could therefore easily be integrated on a variety of structures including cavities, waveguides and light-emitting devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this initial demonstration focused on all-optical modulation, switching of VO2 could also be produced by electrically triggering the IMT24,25 (see Supplementary Note 2 for discussion of switching energy).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined with electroluminescent devices26,27, all-electrical direct modulation of emission could be obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presented concept is not limited to Er3+ ions and VO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the dynamic modulation of the LDOS could be extended to any phase-change material which experiences a large change in optical properties1,5,7,28 and any emitters with spectrally close ED and MD transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such emitters include both lanthanide14,21 and transition-metal doped materials29,30 that are widely used as phosphors in solid-state light sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore hope that the device and concept presented here will engage both academic and industrial researchers working on optoelectronics and nanophotonics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
