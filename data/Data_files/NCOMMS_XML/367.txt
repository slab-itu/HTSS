miR-216b regulation of c-Jun mediates GADD153/CHOP-dependent apoptosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The ability of the unfolded protein response, UPR, to regulate cell homeostasis through both gene expression and protein synthesis has been well documented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One primary pro-apoptotic protein that responds to both PERK and Ire1 signalling is the CHOP/GADD153 transcription factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although CHOP deficiency delays onset of cell death, questions remain regarding how CHOP regulates apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we provide evidence demonstrating that CHOP/GADD153-dependent apoptosis reflects expression of micro-RNA, miR-216b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MiR-216b accumulation requires PERK-dependent induction of CHOP/GADD153, which then directly regulates miR-216b expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As maximal expression of miR-216b is antagonized by Ire1, miR-216b accumulation reflects the convergence of PERK and Ire1 activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functionally, miR-216b directly targets c-Jun, thereby reducing AP-1-dependent transcription and sensitizing cells to ER stress-dependent apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide direct insight into the molecular mechanisms of CHOP/GADD153-dependent cell death.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) serves as a nexus for the folding and maturation of proteins that transit the secretory pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins are imported co-translationally whereupon they undergo additional energy intensive post-translational modifications before folding and maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein folding is both regulated and sensed by ER resident chaperones, such as Grp78/BiP and Grp94 (refs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under conditions where protein production out paces protein folding capacity, for example, under nutrient-deficient conditions as might occur during neoplastic growth, misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER triggering a stress sensing/adaptive pathway referred to as the unfolded protein response (UPR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mammalian cells contain three ER transmembrane proteins that function as proximal effectors of the UPR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inositol-requiring enzyme, Ire1, isoforms (, ubiquitously expressed;  tissue restricted) are composed of a luminal domain that senses stress, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytosolic tail that contains both a protein kinase domain and an RNase domain6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ire1 triggers increased expression of numerous ER chaperones through activation of the X-box-binding protein 1 (Xbp1) transcription factor8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accumulation of Xbp1 is mediated by the RNase and splicing function of Ire1; stress-induced splicing generates a shorter Xbp1 mRNA that is more efficiently translated10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) is activated in a manner analogous to the Ire1; it catalyses serine 51 phosphorylation of eIF2 resulting in repression of protein synthesis12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third signalling component are the transmembrane transcription factors ATF6/ (refs 15, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although normally tethered to the ER, upon stress, ATF6 migrates to the trans-Golgi, where it is processed by S1P and S2P proteases to release the N-terminal DNA-binding transcription factor domain17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of PERK, Ire1 and ATF6 is mediated by sequences within their respective luminal domains to which the ER chaperone, BiP, binds20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation is triggered by increased unfolded proteins, which compete for BiP binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The ability of the UPR to regulate protein synthesis, gene expression and contribute to cell homeostasis has been well documented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, an added layer of communication that entails the regulation of small non-coding RNAs, micro-RNAs, was recently revealed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Micro-RNAs are 2022 nucleotide molecules that generally impact protein expression by virtue of their capacity to degrade target mRNAs or reduce their efficiency of translation21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the past 45 years, work from several groups has revealed that all three branches of the UPR regulate specific subsets of micro-RNAs23,24,25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modes of regulation include Ire1-mediated micro-RNA degradation25, ATF4-dependent and ATF6-dependent transcription27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The consequences of micro-RNA induction include the modulation of protein expression as would be expected, while certain micro-RNAs also directly contribute to regulated gene expression27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The UPR can communicate both pro-adaptive and pro-apoptotic signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ambiguities remain regarding whether an adaptive or apoptotic signal is generated given that all three transducers have been associated with both survival and apoptosis under varying conditions (9,28,29,30,31,32,33,34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One primary pro-apoptotic protein that responds to both PERK and Ire1 signalling is the CHOP/GADD153 transcription factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although CHOP deficiency delays onset of cell death, questions remain regarding how CHOP regulates apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data presented here reveal evidence for CHOP-dependent micro-RNA, miR-216b, which subsequently suppresses c-Jun expression thereby, triggering cell death.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Activation of the UPR under varying stress conditions triggers an alteration in cellular protein content through direct modulation of gene expression, micro-RNA biosynthesis and protein translation rates; this in turn impacts cell division and ultimately enforces cell fate determination57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final outcome, cell adaptation or cell death, is influenced by both stress intensity and duration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, how stress intensity is sensed by the UPR transducers, PERK/Ire1/ATF6, and transmitted into a fate decision remains to be elucidated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complexity of this is increased by genetic evidence revealing that both genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of anyone branch can either sensitize cells to apoptosis or delay onset of apoptosis33,42,58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of these paradoxical outcomes can be resolved when one considers either the type of stress or the cell/tissue type being stressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, such context still requires that downstream effectors of the primary transducers be selectively activated to achieve specific fates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elucidation of how effectors interpret signals and regulate cell fate requires a detailed understanding of both pro-survival and pro-apoptotic signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Accumulating evidence supports a role for differential regulation of micro-RNAs by the UPR in the regulation cellular fate decisions under conditions of stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, all three UPR transducers have been associated with micro-RNA regulation24,25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus far, Ire1 activity has been generally associated with inhibition of micro-RNA accumulation through its RNase function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeted micro-RNAs include miRs-17, 34a, 96 and 125b (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, PERK-dependent activities appear to be associated with both micro-RNA induction, miR-211/204, miR-708 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23) and suppression miR-106-25 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is of interest that all of the PERK-dependent micro-RNAs have been linked to the pro-survival activities of PERK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the work described here, miR-216b is demonstrated to accumulate via the coordinated activities of both PERK and Ire1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, in contrast to other PERK-regulated micro-RNAs, miR-216b contributes to UPR-associated apoptosis through regulation of a newly identified target, c-Jun.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although c-Jun, a component of the AP-1 transcription factor54, has not previously been demonstrated to contribute to gene expression patterns associated with ER stress, activation of Jun kinase pathway (JNK), was previously linked with Ire1-dependent activation of apoptotic signalling kinase-1 (refs 59, 60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, activation of JNK is associated with increased apoptosis, a consequence of JNK-dependent inactivation of Bcl-2 (refs 61, 62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Induction of miR-216b is not associated with alterations in JNK signalling; however, it also contributes to increased apoptosis through downregulation of c-Jun.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'miR-216b accumulation peaks several hours into the stress response, suggesting it functions as cells commit to either survival or death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conclusion is supported by a number of experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, miR-216b expression is directly dependent upon CHOP activity, another pro-apoptotic factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, reduction in miR-216b activity increases cell resistance to UPR-dependent cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, overexpression of a miR-216b increases apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we demonstrate that modulation of c-Jun, a bona fide target of miR-216b during ER stress, also has the expected outcome on cell fate during an ER stress response including loss increasing cell death during ER stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One of the more vexing issues associated with UPR-triggered apoptosis has been the CHOP transcription factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic evidence from both cell and animal models has revealed CHOP to be a pro-apoptotic transcription factor during cellular stress, whether ER stress or DNA damage62,63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several mechanisms have been suggested to mediate the pro-apoptotic activity of CHOP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include suppression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression64, inducing pro-apoptotic Bim and DR5 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  64), increasing translation and thereby compromising cellular bio-energetics and redox homeostasis65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Critically, many of these activities are not only dependent upon PERK-dependent activation of CHOP expression, but also depend upon ASK1-dependent activation of p38MAPK, which phosphorylates and induces CHOP66 demonstrating key points of Ire1 and PERK convergence on the establishment of an apoptotic fate under high stress conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data, which demonstrates CHOP-dependent induction of miR-216b, reveal yet another point of pro-apoptotic convergence wherein miR-216b antagonizes c-Jun accumulation and thereby promotes cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The collective data suggest that CHOP-dependent apoptosis is unlikely to reflect a single functional target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, as with many transcription factors, it is the additive function of several downstream targets that facilitate the establishment of cell fate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this model, CHOP serves as a focal point downstream of PERK and Ire1 action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CHOP-dependent transcription of targets such as Bcl-2, BIM and miR-216b, the latter of which then targets an increasing number of transcripts, c-Jun as one example, thereby amplifying the pro-apoptotic activity of CHOP (Fig 7f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the action of miR-216b is delayed, by virtue of the time needed for its induction and targeting its substrates, this latency likely provides a needed opportunity for cells to repair and adapt if possible prior to initiating apoptosis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
