EpsteinBarr virus particles induce centrosome amplification and chromosomal instability  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Infections with EpsteinBarr virus (EBV) are associated with cancer development, and EBV lytic replication (the process that generates virus progeny) is a strong risk factor for some cancer types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that EBV infection of B-lymphocytes (in vitro and in a mouse model) leads to an increased rate of centrosome amplification, associated with chromosomal instability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect can be reproduced with virus-like particles devoid of EBV DNA, but not with defective virus-like particles that cannot infect host cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral protein BNRF1 induces centrosome amplification, and BNRF1-deficient viruses largely lose this property.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings identify a new mechanism by which EBV particles can induce chromosomal instability without establishing a chronic infection, thereby conferring a risk for development of tumours that do not necessarily carry the viral genome.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The large majority of the world population is infected by the EpsteinBarr virus (EBV) that establishes a lifelong infection, usually without clinical consequences1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, EBV infection is etiologically associated with the development of up to 2% of all human cancers2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EBV is endowed with powerful transforming abilities that are promptly revealed upon infection of B cells, its main target1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three days after infection, B cells initiate cell division and readily establish permanently growing cell lines, termed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs)1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenomenon can also be observed in vivo, for example, in infectious mononucleosis syndromes during which EBV-infected B-cell blasts proliferate in the peripheral blood and the lymph nodes of infected individuals4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These proliferating B cells can also give rise to a tumour in immunocompromised patients, in particular in transplant recipients who receive immunosuppressive drugs6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EBV-mediated transformation requires the simultaneous expression of most latent proteins that belong to the LMP1 and EBNA families.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BHRF1, an antiapoptotic viral homologue of the Bcl2 protein and EBV microRNAs also markedly modulate this process1,7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, most tumours induced by the virus do not express all latent genes and all EBV miRNAs1,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although proteins such as EBNA1, LMP1 and LMP2 or the BART miRNAs have been shown to contribute to the acquisition of the malignant phenotype in EBV-associated nasopharyngeal and gastric carcinomas or in Hodgkins disease and Burkitts lymphomas, the precise contribution of the virus to the transformation process in these cases remains unclear1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Epidemiological studies have shown that lytic replication, the process that generates new virus progeny in infected cells, is a risk factor for cancer development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High antibody titres against viral proteins that are expressed during virus lytic replication are predictive of nasopharyngeal carcinoma13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other environmental risk factors for this tumour, such as the consumption of nitrosamines or phorbol esters in food or smoking, have all been shown to activate EBV lytic replication15,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this paper, we show that EBV lytic replication has a marked influence on the genetic stability of infected cells.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'EBV replication in B cells increases chromosomal instability', 'We addressed the contribution of EBV lytic replication to the neoplastic process induced by the virus by comparing B cells infected with the highly replicating strain M81 that was isolated from a nasopharyngeal carcinoma and a replication-deficient mutant thereof (M81/ZR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We began our investigations by comparing the mitoses of cells either stimulated with pokeweed mitogen (PWM) or infected with either M81 or M81/ZR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At day 3 post treatment, dividing PWM-stimulated B cells displayed typical mitotic figures at different stages, with equal distribution of chromosomes in daughter cells (Supplementary Fig 1ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, many dividing cells infected with either type of virus exhibited abnormal mitoses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some mitoses were multipolar, others were bipolar but arranged around multiple centrioles (Figs 1a,b and 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some mitoses contained non-aligned chromosomes and some anaphases showed images of chromosome lagging (Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found asymmetrical anaphases in which the chromosome sets were imperfectly distributed (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, this set of experiments showed that 15 to 42% of mitoses in infected cells displayed an abnormal organization, which compares to 0 to 6% after PWM stimulation (Fig 1j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, 2.2 to 7% of interphase cells showed more than four centrioles in the virus-infected population (Figs 1f and 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: B cells

#@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were cytospinned and stained with multiple markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each sample, at least 100 mitoses and 500 interphase cells were analysed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

several micronuclei coexisting with a nucleus of approximately normal size (Figs 1g,h and 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other cells contained a single large nucleus that proved to be polyploid after staining with serum from CREST patients that evidences the number of centromeres (Fig 1i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Giemsa staining of mitotic plates showed that 25 to 40% of cells in these samples were aneuploid and up to 3% were polyploid (Fig 2e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) on three sample pairs 6 days after infection with M81 or M81/ZR (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis confirmed the high level of aneuploidy in cells infected with either type of viruses (average 29.2%), but also the presence of rare cells with chromosome deletions (2/120) or translocations (3/120).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, none of these abnormalities were clonal, that is, found in more than two mitoses of the same sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this time point, PWM-stimulated cells had died and could not be analysed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We continued to monitor the cells infected with M81 and M81/ZR until day 30 postinfection, when lytic replication begins in cells infected with wild-type viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By then, both centrosomal amplification and aneuploidy rates had been reduced by approximately 3-fold in cells infected with M81/ZR, implying that the conditions that led to their appearance vanished over time (Fig 2a,b,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The investigation of cells infected with M81/ZR at day 3, 6, 15 and 30 post infection showed a regular decrease in the rate of centrosome amplification (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, although cells infected with the wild-type virus showed an initial decrease in the percentage of cells showing centrosome amplification, this rate sharply re-increased at day 30 when infected cells start to replicate (Fig 2a,b, Supplementary Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'M-FISH karyotyping of four sample pairs confirmed the much higher level of aneuploidy in cells infected with the wild-type virus than in those infected with the replication-deficient mutant after 30 days of infection (average 38.75 versus 9%) (Fig 3, Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The former cells also more frequently carried structural rearrangements, including chromosome deletions and translocations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two of these four samples infected with wild type but none of those infected with M81/ZR showed a clonal abnormality, defined by more than two identical abnormal mitoses for structural abnormalities and more than three mitoses for chromosome loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One B-cell sample infected with wild-type virus carried a recurrent t(6;9), the other showed a clonal loss of the chromosome Y (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We extended our observations to cells infected with B95-8, a virus strain that hardly induces lytic replication, and found that they exhibited a pattern of chromosomal instability (CIN) and aneuploidy very similar to the one induced by M81/ZR (Supplementary Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1di, 3c,d and 4b,d,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also analysed a cell line infected by B95-8 using M-FISH 60 days after infection and found that it carried a recurrent t(9;15) (Supplementary Fig 4d,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: B cells transformed by wild-type EBV

instability in vivo', 'We then injected resting primary B cells briefly exposed in vitro to EBV into immunodeficient NSG mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although infection of resting B cells with the wild-type or with replication-deficient viruses gave rise to an identical rate of cell transformation and cell growth rate in vitro, intraperitoneal injection of 4 Ã— 104 B cells infected with M81 wild type gave rise to tumour development more frequently than infection with the replication-deficient mutant (Fig 4ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference in incidence disappeared after the injection of ten times more (4 Ã— 105) EBV-infected cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in that case, the tumour burden developed by the animals was higher after infection with wild-type virus (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumour samples confirmed that the tumour cells were infected by EBV, and that only cells infected with the wild-type virus underwent lytic replication (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequency of aneuploidy and centrosomal abnormalities in these tumours was two to three times higher after infection with wild-type viruses relative to the M81/ZR mutant, and the absolute frequency of many of these abnormalities was higher than those observed in vitro (compare Figs 2 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: B cells infected with wild-type M81 induce tumours with

with EBV particles induces CIN in dividing cells', 'The results gathered so far showed that EBV lytic replication increases aneuploidy and centrosome amplification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in most infected cell populations, an average of 5% of the cells undergo lytic replication22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This subpopulation cannot account for the much higher aneuploidy and CIN rate observed in cells infected with replicating viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, cells undergoing virus replication produce virions that bind to neighbour B cells in the infected B cell population22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested whether these bound particles could generate the genetic abnormalities observed in B cells transformed with wild-type EBV by treating LCLs generated with the M81/ZR mutant with virus-like particles (VLP) that are devoid of viral DNA and cannot establish a chronic infection23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were exposed for 3 days to purified particles to exclude contamination with soluble factors from the supernatant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested VLPs derived from both B95-8 or from M81.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This treatment led to at least a doubling in the frequency of centrosome amplification and aneuploidy, after either type of VLP infection (Fig 7ac, Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, this property was not shared by VLPs that are not able to fuse with their targets because they are devoid of the gp110 protein that is required for cell entry25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we found no difference between VLPs derived from either B95-8 or M81, we concentrated on M81 VLPs that can be produced at much higher levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We added M81 VLPs to B cells expanded by the CD40L system in the presence of IL4 and obtained very similar results in these EBV-negative cells (Fig 7df).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also treated PWM-stimulated B cells, RPE-1 and HeLa cells with VLPs under the same conditions and also observed an increase in the percentage of cells carrying abnormal centrosome numbers (Fig 7gj, Supplementary Fig 7ah).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained with RPE-1 cells stably transfected with a GFP-centrin-1 fusion protein (Supplementary Fig 7im).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We infected the epithelial cell lines RPE-1 and HeLa with wild-type M81 and stained them for expression of the EBV-specific EBER noncoding RNAs (Supplementary Fig 7nq).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This staining showed that M81 infects between 1 and 1.5% of these cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that EBV can interact with the cell division machinery of cells lines without necessarily being able to establish a chronic infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M81 VLP treatment of RPE-1 cells also doubled the rate of cells present in cytokinesis, suggesting that this process is delayed by the treatment (Supplementary Fig 7r).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We addressed this issue by exposing HeLa cells stably transfected with mEGFP--tubulin and H2B-mCherry fusion proteins to EBV VLPs and performed life cell imaging (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the average mitotic time was not influenced by the treatment, cytokinesis took significantly longer in cells treated with VLPs or wild-type virus (Supplementary Movies 1 and 2, Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: Exposure of B cells or RPE-1 cells to virus-like particles leads to centriole

protein that strongly potentiates the efficiency of EBV infection26, doubled the frequency of centriole amplification and nearly tripled the frequency of multipolar mitoses, relative to mock-transfected cells (Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Staining for CEP170 revealed that transfection with BNRF1 did not increase the frequency of cells carrying more than two CEP170-positive centrioles, suggesting that this viral protein causes centriole overduplication (Supplementary Fig 9i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We monitored BNRF1 expression in primary B cells exposed to EBV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This protein was clearly detectable in the infected B cells during the first 5 days after infection (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation suggests that the levels of BNRF1 protein are not reduced by cell division in the first days post infection and fits with the observation that EBV-infected B cells do not initiate cell division before 3 days after infection27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Lytic replication has long been recognized as a major risk factor for the development of EBV-positive nasopharyngeal carcinoma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, cells that undergo EBV lytic replication also activate cellular cancer-associated pathways30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, herpesvirus lytic replication typically leads to cell death, rendering the link between replicating cells and cancer development not obvious31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results remove these conceptual difficulties by showing that the virions themselves conferred the risk induced by lytic replication to non-replicating cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The EBV particles induced the development of CIN in a few days after infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This property is substantially lost in a virus that lacks BNRF1 but reappears upon reintroduction of the protein through complementation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, transfection of BNRF1 causes centrosome overduplication, an abnormality that facilitates the occurrence of multipolar mitoses and of bipolar mitoses with clustered multiple centrosomes33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An increased number of centrosomes is a strong risk factor for defective chromosome attachment, in particular merotelic attachments that foster the occurrence of chromosome lagging and non-aligned chromosomes33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Non-aligned chromosomes can lead to micronuclei formation, an anomaly that we observed in EBV-infected cells and can foster extensive genomic rearrangements34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lagging chromosomes increase the average time of mitosis and facilitate the development of aneuploidy or of chromosome deletion, for example, if they become blocked in the furrow during cytokinesis36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with non-aligned chromosomes, they can also cause mitotic slippage that leads to polyploidy with cells carrying either an enlarged nucleus or multiple nuclei33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, an aberrant centrosome multiplication induced by BNRF1 could in principle explain all abnormalities identified shortly after EBV infection and upon inception of lytic replication in infected cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'However, although deletion of BNRF1 in the virion markedly reduced the aneuploidy rate, some residual aneuploidy persisted in the infected cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could suggest that the influence of VLPs on the mitotic machinery is not limited to BNRF1 and the centrosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this line, we noticed cytokinesis defects in HeLa cells exposed to EBV and multinucleated cells in EBV-infected LCLs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the rate of aneuploidy in cells infected with the BNRF1 knockout virus and in CD40L-stimulated cells was nearly identical, thereby suggesting that B cells growing in culture for several weeks always display a low level of aneuploidy, although previous studies reported that non-B diploid cells passaged in vitro display approximately 1% of mitoses with figures of missegregation37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also important to note that studies with the BNRF1 knockout virions were conducted with very large amounts of viruses, as these viruses have a markedly reduced ability to infect B cells26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These conditions might reveal the properties of proteins other than BNRF1 present in EBV infectious particles that usually do not or only minimally interfere with the mitotic machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We also noted that the rate of aneuploidy was higher than the rate of centrosome accumulation in infected cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be partly explained by the methodology we used to unequivocally identify cells with centrosome accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we counted non-mitotic cells as abnormal only if they carry more than four centrioles, as normal cells that went through centrosome replication carry four centrioles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, cells with three or four centrioles could be abnormal cells that had not gone yet through centrosome replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the identification of mitoses organized around an abnormal number of centrioles is only possible if these centrioles are well separated after staining and it is not always the case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we most certainly underestimated the frequency of centrosome aberrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, it is theoretically possible that cells with centrosome amplification give rise to daughter cells that received an abnormal number of chromosomes but only one centrosome upon cell division.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We observed translocations or chromosome deletions at a very low rate and no clonal chromosomal abnormality shortly after infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, two out of four cell lines infected with wild-type M81 carried a clonal abnormality (one clonal chromosome loss and one clonal translocation) 6 weeks after infection, as did the only LCL infected with B95-8 we investigated (one clonal translocation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the cell populations that carried the clonal abnormality were selected out, presumably because these genetic rearrangements confer a growth advantage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, even if translocation is a relatively rare event after EBV infection, its effects can become dominant within the infected population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Because the CIN induced by the initial contact with viral particles from non-replicating strains subsides over time although these cells continuously express the latent proteins, the effects of EBV infection on the mitotic machinery are probably independent of them1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is very likely that the EBV latent proteins modulate the effects of the virions on EBV-infected cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, EBNA3C has been shown to overcome the mitotic checkpoint that should be activated in case of chromosomal instability38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, EBV latent genes have been found to promote genomic instability and could amplify the effects induced by the virions39,40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The central role of the centrosome in organizing the mitotic process explains its frequent deregulation in various types of cancer, including those induced by the transforming papillomavirus strains42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The E7 protein expressed from the viral genome in infected cells induces centrosome overduplication42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although not formally demonstrated for EBV, herpesviruses usually use the cytoplasmic microtubule network and its organizer, the centrosome, to reach the nucleus43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, herpes viral particles will have an increased probability of interacting with the centrosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BNRF1 is a component of the tegument whose absence impairs the transfer of the virus particle containing the nucleocapsid from the endosome to the nucleus26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Migration of the virus along the tubulin network would offer an opportunity of interaction between BNRF1 and the centrosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, we find that BNRF1 can localize to the centrosomal compartment upon overexpression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore conceivable, although currently entirely speculative, that BNRF1 brought into the cell through infection but dissociated from the tegument during the course of infection could reach the centrosome on its own.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The mechanisms that underlie the ability of BNRF1 to induce centrosome accumulation remain unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We could not find any differences in the expression levels of the centrosome-regulating proteins STIL, SAS-6 or Plk4 between B cells infected by replicating or non-replicating viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BNRF1 has been found to bind to DAAX proteins in the nucleus45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DAXX can also transiently co-localize to the centromere of chromosomes after heat-shock treatment46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoprecipitation experiments using an antibody against BNRF1 coupled with protein sequencing by mass spectrometry also identified NPM1 and PARP1, two proteins present in the centrosome, as binding partners of BNRF1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the interaction with these proteins, if real, must be weak as their interactions with BNRF1 could not be confirmed in subsequent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that BNRF1 expression increases the production of the truncated PARP1 form generated by caspase cleavage within the centrosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether or not the increase of this particular PARP1 form reflects the effects of BNRF1 on the centrosome is currently unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We show that replication-competent viruses induce tumours in immuno-compromized mice with a higher frequency than replication-defective ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, tumours induced by wild-type viruses displayed stronger CIN and aneuploidy rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that wild-type viruses are more transforming in vivo because they induce more CIN and aneuploidy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this effect was not visible in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The impact of centrosome overduplication in tumorigenesis is difficult to evaluate in experimental models and some authors have previously suggested that it can only be revealed under in vivo conditions47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observations are concordant with similar experiments previously performed in humanized mice that showed that the wild-type B95-8 strain is more transforming than a mutant thereof that lacks the Z transactivator, although macroscopic tumours rarely develop in these animals48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, humanized mice have an immune system that interferes with infected cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As B95-8 induces a very limited and abortive lytic replication, it is unlikely that the effects observed in this work are due to the production of virions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The present work largely explains the high degree of aneuploidy that was previously reported in B cells infected in vitro49 or in infected cells from healthy individuals propagated in immunocompromised mice50, as well as in several types of EBV-induced lymphomas51,52 and carcinomas53,54,55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, PTLD frequently show signs of lytic replication and aneuploidy, and aneuploid tumours have a poorer response to treatment51,56,57,58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our work suggests that every EBV infection, including a primary infection, increases the risk of CIN and aneuploidy, a risk factor for cancer development and that this risk will increase proportionally to the frequency of contact with EBV virions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, patients infected with viruses that strongly replicate or whose immune system cannot control virus multiplication such as patients with immunodeficiencies are likely to be at higher risk56,59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observations also have consequences for vaccination strategies as VLPs have previously been proposed as vaccines23,24,60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of BNRF1 from these viruses, or keeping the virus from reaching the centrosome, should circumvent this potential problem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "We also found that the effects of EBV virions extend to EBV-negative cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the virus does not have to induce a stable infection to exert its effects on the centrosome, the range of cell lineages in which the virus could increase the risk of CIN could theoretically extend beyond the classical EBV targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, EBV could be a risk factor for tumour development without being present in the resulting tumour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is interesting to note that individuals who underwent an episode of infectious mononucleosis after primary EBV infection are not only at increased risk of EBV-associated Hodgkin's disease, but also of non-Hodgkin lymphomas during the first year after infection61,62,63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter tumours carry the EBV genome only in 5% of the cases64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It would be important to perform epidemiological studies that correlate clinical and biological markers of EBV lytic replication with general cancer risk."
