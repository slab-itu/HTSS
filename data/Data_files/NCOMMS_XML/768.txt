Rapid evolution of dispersal ability makes biological invasions faster and more variable  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Genetic variation in dispersal ability may result in the spatial sorting of alleles during range expansion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent theory suggests that spatial sorting can favour the rapid evolution of life history traits at expanding fronts, and therefore modify the ecological dynamics of range expansion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we test this prediction by disrupting spatial sorting in replicated invasions of the bean beetle Callosobruchus maculatus across homogeneous experimental landscapes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that spatial sorting promotes rapid evolution of dispersal distance, which increases the speed and variability of replicated invasions: after 10 generations of range expansion, invasions subject to spatial sorting spread 8.9% farther and exhibit 41-fold more variable spread dynamics relative to invasions in which spatial sorting is suppressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correspondingly, descendants from spatially evolving invasions exhibit greater mean and variance in dispersal distance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results reveal an important role for rapid evolution during invasion, even in the absence of environmental filters, and argue for evolutionarily informed forecasts of invasive spread by exotic species or climate change migration by native species.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Understanding and predicting the dynamics of biological invasions are among the leading environmental challenges in the Anthropocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biological invasions play out in the contexts of intentionally or accidentally introduced species1, recovery of threatened species2 and, increasingly, shifts in distributional limits in response to climate change3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long-standing ecological theory provides a framework for understanding and predicting the velocity of spread based on life history traits related to dispersal ability and reproductive potential4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, accurate invasion forecasts remain elusive5,6,7,8, at least partly because of the substantial variability in spreading speed that appears to be an intrinsic but poorly understood feature of biological invasions9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recent theory suggests that evolutionary processes unique to spreading populations can influence the ecological dynamics of invasion by modifying traits related to dispersal, reproduction or both12,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dispersal phase of invasion provides an opportunity for individuals to spatially sort themselves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spatial sorting is expected to cause the over-representation of highly dispersive phenotypes at the leading edge of an invasion wave, increasing the probability of assortative mating between highly dispersive individuals and, if dispersal is heritable, the probability that offspring produced at the leading edge will also be highly dispersive14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the leading edge is characterized by low population density, highly dispersive individuals may leave more descendants, per capita, because of greater resource availability and reduced intraspecific competition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This combination of spatial allele sorting and increased per capita growth at the leading edge of the invasion wavea process described in the invasion literature as spatial selectionis predicted to favour the evolution of increased dispersal at the invasion front13,14,15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, in addition to spatial selection for increased dispersal, the low-density leading edge is also subject to natural selection, which may favour the evolution of increased reproductive rate in the absence of strong resource limitation (r-selection)13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since invasion speed is determined both by dispersal and low-density reproductive rate, these evolutionary processes that occur as a result of spatial allele sorting are expected to accelerate range expansion15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite well-developed theory, empirical evidence that the ecological dynamics of invasion can be modified by the spatial sorting of alleles is scarce16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most relevant studies have been observational and retrospective, comparing demography and dispersal trait values between range-core and range-edge populations15,19,20,21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies highlight potential for rapid trait evolution during range expansion but reveal little about how trait evolution modifies the ecological dynamics of invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several considerations raise uncertainty about the general ecological importance of spatial evolutionary mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, theoretical models of spatial selection usually assume perfect heritability of dispersal behaviour12,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In reality dispersal is a complex, likely polygenic trait26 with imperfect heritability20,26,27,28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since low trait heritabilities generally dampen evolutionary change30, imperfect dispersal heritability may cause responses to spatial selection to be weaker than predicted by theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, stochastic forces may overwhelm the directional influence of spatial selection at the expanding edge: low-density, leading edge patchesprecisely the locations where spatial selection on dispersal and reproduction is expected to be most potentare also the locations most affected by stochasticity in demography10,31, dispersal10 and allelic composition because of founder events32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, even in systems where spatial selection has been implicated in accelerating spread15, the influence of alternative, non-evolutionary accelerating mechanisms4,33 is difficult to exclude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental tests are thus critical for understanding whether and to what extent the evolutionary processes that arise from spatial allele sorting modify spread dynamicsand therefore how much information is lost by ignoring them, as most ecological studies currently do.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Laboratory-based mesocosms provide a powerful setting to study spread dynamics because they distil invasions to their essential ingredientslocal population growth and dispersaland facilitate experimental manipulations that are impractical in the field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, replicated mesocosms reveal a distribution of invasion trajectories in simple settings, providing a window into intrinsic sources of variability that cannot be achieved with unreplicated invasions across heterogeneous natural landscapes9,10,16,17,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used replicated laboratory invasions of the bean beetle Callosobruchus maculatus to test the influence of spatial evolutionary processes on the ecological dynamics of range expansion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bean beetles provide a powerful and convenient system for testing rapid evolution during invasions because they are semelparous with fast (30 days) and nonoverlapping generations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experimental set-up allows beetle populations to spread through homogenous, one-dimensional (1D) landscapes of interconnected habitat patches, with opportunity for dispersal following within-patch population growth (Methods), giving rise to travelling invasion waves over successive generations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We experimentally prevented spatial allele sorting (and thus the spatial evolutionary processes that act on dispersal and reproduction) in a subset of replicate invasions (N=9) by shuffling the post-dispersal locations of all individuals: we mixed all dispersed beetles into a global pool and then randomly redistributed them back on the landscape, maintaining the density and sex ratio of each patch exactly as we found them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method decouples an individuals genotype from its spatial position, preventing highly dispersive or fecund individuals from carrying their alleles to the invasion fronts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared spread dynamics of these shuffled invasions to those of spatially sorted (control) invasions (N=9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 10 generations, we reared beetles from the leading edge of each invasion replicate in a common garden setting to measure whether spatial evolutionary processes generated genetically based differences in dispersal distance or low-density reproductive rate between treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our experiments show that spatial sorting increases the speed and variability of replicated invasions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes are caused by the rapid evolution of dispersal: we observe that descendants from spatially sorted invasions exhibit greater mean and variance in dispersal distance compared with descendants from spatially shuffled invasions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results reveal an important role for rapid evolution during invasion, even in the absence of environmental filters, and argue for evolutionarily informed forecasts of biological invasions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Effects of spatial sorting on invasion dynamics', 'Spatial evolutionary processes increased the speed of range expansion (Figs 1 and 2, Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 10 generations, spatially sorted invasions spread 8.9% farther, on average, than shuffled invasions (Figs 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spatial sorting also increased variability across realizations of the invasion process, independently of the increase in the mean invasion speed (Fig 2 and Supplementary Figs 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The greater variability of spatially sorted invasions was attributable to among- and not within-replicate variance (Supplementary Fig 1;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our results provide novel experimental evidence that the spatial sorting of alleles can, on ecological timescales, generate accelerated invasions via the rapid evolution of dispersal ability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most studies of rapid evolution during biological invasion have focused on adaptations to novel environmental selective pressures and their potential to promote invasiveness35,36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we find an influence of evolution on invasion dynamics even in homogeneous landscapes, absent environmental filters, because space per se is an evolutionary agent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments are among the first to validate a wealth of theoretical research on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of range expansion11,12,14,15,17,20,38, but also paint a more complex picture than is currently appreciated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not only did we detect a signature of evolutionary acceleration despite intrinsic variability in spread, we also found that evolution was a source of that variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the evolutionary effect on variability in spread far exceeded the effect on the mean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Evolved differences in dispersal kernels of sorted and shuffled invasions were consistent with their contrasting spread dynamics: descendants from spatially sorted invasions exhibited kernels with greater means (in females) and longer tails (in males) compared with descendants from shuffled invasions, which would increase the probability of long-distance dispersal events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since we observed no differences in pre-invasion dispersal kernels, the treatment-specific differences in post-invasion kernels reflect evolutionary divergence that developed during range expansion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the post-invasion common gardens showed no difference in low-density reproductive rate between treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This leads us to conclude that, while evolution of the reproductive rate may accompany evolution of dispersal during range expansion13,15, the faster and more variable spread of spatially sorted invasions that we observed was due primarily to rapid evolution of dispersal ability with little contribution of the reproductive rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the relatively short timescale and modest population sizes of our experiment, evolutionary changes in dispersal were likely caused by the redistribution of standing allelic variation rather than novel mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We hypothesize that gene surfing is a likely mechanism24,32,39,40,41,42 by which spatially sorted invasions exhibited amplified variance in spread dynamics11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene surfing is a drift-like process where alleles initially present at the leading edge of an incipient invasion can become fixed because of the serial founder events that are characteristic of an expanding invasion wave.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Much like genetic drift, gene surfing can cause allele fixation at expanding fronts even in homogenous, non-selective environments24,32,39,40,41 and even if the allele is deleterious41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The serial genetic bottlenecks that promote gene surfing (that is, rare, leading edge colonists are likely the offspring of leading edge colonists from the previous generation) were likely to be especially influential in our experimental invasions, where vanguard patches were often colonized by one or two individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the densities of leading edge patches were similar between our treatments (Supplementary Table 8), gene surfing would have been suppressed by the shuffle treatment along with the directional influence of spatial selection, since shuffling brings a new, random set of alleles to the invasion front in each generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The stochastic nature of gene surfing means that each realization of range expansion can propagate a unique allelic composition even if initiated from a common source pool, as in our experiments43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, our common garden results reveal not only increased dispersal distance, on average, in spatially sorted invasions but also elevated among-replicate variance in dispersal (in males).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, comparison of pre- and post-invasion dispersal kernels shows that some spatially sorted replicates show strong evolved increases in dispersal while other replicates show weaker evolved decreases in dispersal (Supplementary Fig 8), consistent with increased mean and among-replicate variance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that the net effects of spatial evolutionary processes reflect a balance of directional spatial selection and stochastic gene surfing; these forces resulted in dispersal kernels, and consequently invasion speeds, that were not only greater, on average, but also more variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results accompany a recent burgeoning of experimental tests of theory for spatial sorting and its influence on invasion dynamics16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these studies present some coherent patterns of evolution during range expansion, particularly the result that spatial sorting can generate evolutionarily accelerated invasions, even in homogenous environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, disparities between these studies make it clear that invasion contextthe stage on which these evolutionary processes play outis critically important for determining the outcome of evolution and its ecological consequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While two new studies (including ours) with sexually reproducing organisms indicate that evolution drives increased variance in invasion dynamics18, other recent work with asexually reproducing plants found the opposite: evolution reduced variance across invasion replicates17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in breeding systems may explain this disparity, since the variance-promoting effects of gene surfing are likely less prominent in populations without genetic recombination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, for invasions consisting of mixtures of asexual lineages, the fastest lineage would likely dominate the expanding fronts, such that the directional and homogenizing influence of spatial selection is the dominant evolutionary force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, while theory suggests that spatial evolutionary processes should result in the enhancement of r-selected traits, such as increased fecundity or faster life histories13, evidence from recent experiments and retrospective studies is mixed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, studies where spatial sorting is thought to promote dispersal ability have shown fecundity to be reduced18,23 or unchanged (our study), although at least one study found evidence for the evolution of a faster life cycle22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possible explanation for these mixed results is genetic constraints, such as correlations between dispersal and other life history traits, which are currently unaccounted for in most studies; these may have important effects on evolutionary outcomes25,44,45,46, a hypothesis that merits further study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Lastly, it has been suggested that there may be fundamental limits on our ability to predict invasive spread because accounting for ecological sources of stochasticity fails to capture the total observed variability9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that evolutionary sources of stochasticity may be the missing piece of this puzzle and offer a more optimistic assessment of predictive capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While accurate point estimates for the pace of invasion will likely remain elusive, accounting for evolutionary processes in ecological forecasts can yield improved uncertainty windows for the distribution of possible invasion outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With more accurate bounds on predicted invasion outcomes, natural resource managers may be better equipped to prepare for best- and worst-case scenarios of expansion by native or exotic species.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Establishing the source population', 'Laboratory populations, such as those of C. maculatus used here, are typically highly inbred and the potential loss of genetic variation due to extensive inbreeding may be unrepresentative of natural populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We minimized the influence of historical inbreeding on our experiment by randomly selecting females (N=20) and males (N=20) from each of 10 inbred lineages, originally isolated from different parts of the species global distribution47, to create a well-mixed and genetically diverse founding population of 400 beetles with a 1:1 sex ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beetles from different lineages are known to readily interbreed and create viable offspring48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provided virtually unlimited resources (400 g black-eyed peas; Vigna unguiculata unguiculata, Fabaceae) for 10 generations to allow for population growth, genetic admixture and to reduce linkage disequilibrium50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beetles were maintained in a climate-controlled growth chamber on a 16:8 photoperiod at 28 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Invasion experiments', 'We discretized the beetle life cycle into a 30-day local demography phase (mating, oviposition, development and eclosion) and a 2-h dispersal phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We initiated replicate invasions in the dispersal phase by randomly selecting 25 males and 25 females from the source population and introducing them into a 1D landscape consisting of 144 patches (Petri dishes), each containing seven black-eyed peas, with dispersal connections (1/4 length of 1/8 tubing) between adjacent patches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 50 founding beetles were introduced at equal initial densities to the first five patches (five males and five females per patch).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 2 h of dispersal, the connecting tubes between patches were blocked with pipe cleaners, and the numbers of females and males in each patch were counted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each invasion replicate assigned to the shuffle treatment, we then mixed all beetles into a global pool and randomly redistributed them back on the landscape, maintaining the density and sex ratio of each patch exactly as we found them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For spatially sorted (control) replicates, beetles were allowed to mate and oviposit in the patches to which they dispersed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since replicates were manipulated differently depending on treatment, experimenters were not blind to treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Post-dispersal, all beetles in each patch were transferred to unconnected Petri dishes, each containing seven black-eyed peas (1.4 g) for the demography phase of the life cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Limiting the number of black-eyed peas to seven imposed resource limitation, resulting in negative density-dependent population growth and a carrying capacities of roughly 40 beetles (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, in addition to spatial selection on dispersal ability, we hypothesized that beetles at low-density invasion fronts may be under natural selection for increased fecundity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'After 30 days, offspring were transferred back to their home location in the landscape (the patch where their mother laid them), beginning the dispersal phase of the next generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This sequence of dispersal, counting/sexing, shuffling (if applicable) and local demography was repeated for 10 generations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To keep the experiment logistically manageable, we removed patches from the trailing edges of the invasions; we applied the rule that only offspring from the leading 60 patches of each replicate were allowed to participate in the next generation10,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For most replicates, we began removing trailing patches after the fifth generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also discarded any beetles that dispersed more than two patches to the left of patch 0, and only tracked the right-spreading invasion wave10,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Owing to the large number of beetles in each replicate, it became unfeasible to sex beetles in the invasion core after the sixth generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, for generations seven through ten, we only sexed beetles on the expanding end of the invasion wave, using the following method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starting at the farthest occupied patch and moving towards the range core, we sexed beetles in every patch until there were a total of three patches that contained 40 or more beetles; after this patch, we continued counting beetles, but no longer identified their sex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose a density of 40 beetles because that roughly represents the local carrying capacity, given the seven-bean resource environment (Fig 1), and we chose three patches to ensure that we were safely into the core of the invasion before disregarding sex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In deep-core patches where sex ratios were not measured, we returned the required numbers of beetles from the global pool irrespective of sex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because sex ratios are roughly constant in the invasion core10, this methodology preserved the average, unmeasured sex ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For each replicate, we measured invasion extent in each generation as the distance from the starting patch (patch 0) to the farthest patch that contained at least four beetles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose a threshold density of four beetles because it limited the influence of observation error (e.g., failing to detect patches that contained single beetles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We do not assume that the leading four-beetle patch contains a viable population;
