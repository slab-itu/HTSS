Increased global transcription activity as a mechanism of replication stress in cancer  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cancer is a disease associated with genomic instability that often results from oncogene activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This in turn leads to hyperproliferation and replication stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie oncogene-induced replication stress are still poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oncogenes such as HRASV12 promote proliferation by upregulating general transcription factors to stimulate RNA synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we investigate whether this increase in transcription underlies oncogene-induced replication stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that in cells overexpressing HRASV12, elevated expression of the general transcription factor TATA-box binding protein (TBP) leads to increased RNA synthesis, which together with R-loop accumulation results in replication fork slowing and DNA damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, overexpression of TBP alone causes the hallmarks of oncogene-induced replication stress, including replication fork slowing, DNA damage and senescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, we reveal that increased transcription can be a mechanism of oncogene-induced DNA damage, providing a molecular link between upregulation of the transcription machinery and genomic instability in cancer.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cancer is a disease of genomic instability, characterized by high mutation rates and genomic rearrangements that ultimately drive aggressiveness and resistance to therapy1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the mechanisms proposed to cause genomic instability in cancer is replication stress, which occurs when DNA replication fork progression in S phase slows or stalls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This leads to collapse of forks into DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), as well as incomplete sister chromatid separation in the following mitosis2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Markers of spontaneous replication stress are found in tumour samples and cells expressing active oncogenes, and replication stress promotes chromosomal instability, the most common form of genomic instability in sporadic cancers3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spontaneous replication stress is therefore increasingly regarded as a central feature of cancer cells and there is much interest in specifically targeting this phenotype for cancer therapy7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, progress in this field is hindered, because the molecular mechanisms underlying spontaneous replication stress in cells are still largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This impairs our ability to investigate replication stress in vitro and in vivo, and to identify potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'How can mechanisms of spontaneous replication stress be identified?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overexpression of oncogenes such as RAS, MOS, MYC, CDC25A or CYCLIN E is sufficient to induce replication stress in cultured cells4,5,8,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These oncogenes all act in the growth factor signalling pathways that stimulate proliferation by promoting cell growth and division.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular changes associated with increased proliferation are therefore prime candidates for causing replication stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we and others have reported that CYCLIN E-induced replication stress results from accelerated S-phase entry and increased replication initiation during S phase9,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far, however, little attention has been paid to the fact that oncogenes such as RAS and MYC do not only activate the cell cycle machinery but also promote cell growth through the activation of transcription and protein translation13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpressed c-MYC acts as a universal amplifier, stimulating transcription by all three RNA polymerases14,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oncogenic RAS promotes transcription through the mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which activates transcription factors such as TIFIA (RRN3), UBTF, TIFIIIB (BRF1) and TATA-box binding protein (TBP)14,15,19, and can also promote transcription through other factors such as TERT20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, components of the general transcription machinery itself are found mutated, differentially expressed and deregulated across a variety of cancers14,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Upregulation of transcription in cancer cells has the potential to be a direct cause of replication stress as interference between transcription and replication leads to replication fork slowing and genomic instability22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can result from direct collisions or torsional stress between the two active protein complexes24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another important source of replication stress is the collision of the replication machinery with RNADNA hybrids (R-loops) where the nascent RNA has re-annealed with the template25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deregulated transcription is a common feature of cancers, but its importance for replication stress and consequent genomic instability has not been examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we use HRASV12 overexpression5,26 to investigate whether the oncogene-induced increase in transcription is a mechanism of endogenous replication stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report that increased transcription activity in cells expressing HRASV12 causes replication stress, as high levels of RNA synthesis and transcription intermediates interfere with replication fork progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Replication stress in these cells depends on R-loop accumulation and on increased expression of the general transcription factor TBP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, overexpression of TBP alone induces replication stress and genomic instability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that increased transcription activity is a mechanism contributing to replication stress in cancer.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

replication stress (Fig 7d and Supplementary Fig 9a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were observed in human MRC5 fibroblasts overexpressing TBP (Supplementary Fig 9bd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether TBP-induced fork slowing depended on ongoing transcription, we treated TBP-overexpressing cells with DRB for 100 min, to inhibit nascent RNA synthesis (Fig 7e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DRB treatment

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We report that increased transcription is a new mechanism of oncogene-induced replication stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of oncogenic HRASV12 increases RNA synthesis and R-loop formation, and this directly contributes to replication stress induced by HRASV12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HRASV12-induced replication stress is mediated by the general transcription factor TBP, which is a downstream target of RAS signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, overexpression of TBP itself causes replication stress and genomic instability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transcription machinery is frequently deregulated in cancer cells21 and our data suggest that transcription-associated replication stress could be an important mechanism promoting genomic instability in cancer (Fig 7j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Markers of replication stress are observed in early tumours and cancers and other conditions of high proliferation, such as stem cell reprogramming or viral infection51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies have provided first candidates for the mechanisms causing such endogenous replication stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far, all of these have involved deregulation of the cell cycle, including re-replication53 and premature or increased replication initiation, resulting in depletion of nucleotides or replication enzymes9,10,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, reactive oxygen species play important roles in DNA damage in cancer, but whether they can cause replication stress is still uncertain54,55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data support that increased transcription is another pathway causing endogenous replication stress, which may act in parallel or independently of cell cycle deregulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HRASV12 overexpression did increase the density of active replication origins, which could be reversed by CDK inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, CDK inhibition was unable to relieve HRASV12-induced replication fork slowing, suggesting that increased replication initiation is not a cause but a consequence of HRASV12-induced replication stress (Supplementary Fig 3d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that HRASV12 causes replication stress by a mechanism that is different from oncogenes such as CYCLIN E and CDC25A10,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our data support that HRASV12 overexpression promotes accumulation of R-loops, which can be a major cause for replication fork slowing and DNA breakage23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An elegant study recently reported that loss of tumour suppressors BRCA1 or BRCA2 increases R-loop levels, because these proteins act to prevent R-loop formation56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings add an important new angle to this observation, showing that oncogenes can induce R-loops, which suggests that increased R-loop levels might also be common in cancer cells that are proficient in BRCA1 or BRCA2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we observed increased protein levels of endogenous RNaseH1 in cells overexpressing HRASV12 (Fig 5b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNaseH1 and RNaseH2 are the main RNase activities counteracting R-loop formation and upregulation of these enzymes may be a response of cancer cells to increased R-loop levels23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the biology of increased RNaseH1 expression in response to HRASV12 requires further investigation, it supports the idea that oncogenic replication stress is strongly connected with R-loop metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One exciting implication of our findings is the potential to discover new factors involved in promoting replication stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Components of the transcription machineries are found overexpressed in cancer21,57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TBP is one of several general transcription factors that have been implicated in oncogene-induced cell transformation39,58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TBP promoter contains binding sites for oncogenic transcription factors and TBP is differentially expressed in cancers (Table 1)59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RAS has been reported to upregulate TBP expression through RAF-MEK and RALGDS signalling19, and TBP levels are also increased by other growth factor signalling pathways such as epidermal growth factor/epidermal growth factor receptor59,60 (Fig 7j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report here that increased TBP levels cause replication stress and markers of genomic instability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TBP expression also correlates with the expression of MYC, RAS and checkpoint kinases in a number of cancers (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As TBP overexpression did not increase RNA synthesis as strongly as HRASV12 overexpression and TBP depletion did not completely rescue HRASV12-induced replication stress, other transcription factors such as UBTF may also be involved downstream of HRASV12 (Fig 7j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A previous report showed that TBP is important for HRASV12 transforming function, and that TBP overexpression alone promotes anchorage-independent growth and tumour growth in vivo49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data presented here support the idea that TBP promotes the oncogenic phenotype by increasing transcription activity and replication stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is however no evidence that TBP itself is an oncogene, as TBP overexpression promoted tumour growth but not tumourigenesis itself49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some cancer types show recurrent mutations in TBP that affect the length of the amino-terminal glutamine-rich motif (for example, Q72dup in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and adrenocortical carcinoma)61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is yet unknown whether such mutations have pathogenic relevance in cancer and whether they could be oncogenic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, increased RNA synthesis and elevated levels of R-loops could be correlated with replication stress in cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identifying the molecular mechanisms that directly cause spontaneous replication stress should therefore help to predict and detect replication stress more accurately in cells and tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nascent RNA synthesis can only be measured in live cells but increased expression of transcription factors and RNA polymerase subunits21, as well as increased R-loops and expression of RNases H1 or H2, might be promising candidates for markers of transcription-associated replication stress.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
