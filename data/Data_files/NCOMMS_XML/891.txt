Control of randomly scattered surface plasmon polaritons for multiple-input and multiple-output plasmonic switching devices  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Merging multiple microprocessors with high-speed optical networks has been considered a promising strategy for the improvement of overall computation power.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the loss of the optical communication bandwidth is inevitable when interfacing between optical and electronic components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present an on-chip plasmonic switching device consisting of a two-dimensional (2D) disordered array of nanoholes on a thin metal film that can provide multiple-input and multiple-output channels for transferring information from a photonic to an electronic platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this device, the surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) generated at individual nanoholes become uncorrelated on their way to the detection channel due to random multiple scattering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We exploit this decorrelation effect to use individual nanoholes as independent antennas, and demonstrated that more than 40 far-field incident channels can be delivered simultaneously to the SPP channels, an order of magnitude improvement over conventional 2D patterned devices.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The clock speed of microprocessors has steadily grown over the past few decades, but it has now been saturated at around a few gigahertz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Merging multiple microprocessors has been one of the main strategies employed to increase overall computation power, but the electrical networks connecting the processors have been unable to keep up with the data streams that the individual processors produce.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optical interconnects have been considered potential solutions because optical communication is hundreds of times faster than that of electrical networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For coupling optics to electronics, surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are ideal carriers because they propagate as electromagnetic waves along the dielectric/metal interface and yet induce collective charge oscillations in a metal1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, the use of SPPs for on-chip optical interconnects has gained interest in recent years4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12, although they have long been applied in biosensing13,14,15,16, lithography17,18,19, subwavelength imaging20,21 and nanomanipulation22,23 due to their subwavelength-scale spatial confinement and strong local field enhancement24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In designing the SPP-based optoelectronic devices, it is important to implement multi-channel optical inputs to multi-channel plasmonic outputs for the maximized use of optical communication bandwidth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Otherwise, the devices will serve as bottlenecks in the data transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is not straightforward to effectively convert the input channels of far-field waves propagating in three-dimensional space to the output channels of the two-dimensional (2D) surface waves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, this dimensional reduction leads to the loss of most input channels upon conversion to output channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In recent years, various multiplexing methods have been proposed to increase the deliverable channel number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, structures have been designed in such a way that either the directionality25 or the beam shape of the output SPPs is controlled by the polarization23, wavelength26 and intensity patterns of incident waves22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While these studies demonstrated great potential, the number of controllable transmission channels remains small mainly due to the use of periodically ordered structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these cases, SPPs generated at each unit cell are replicated at the other unit cells such that they are not independent from one another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this strategy has been necessary to increase the coupling of incident far-field waves to the SPPs by means of the constructive interference of SPPs generated among unit cells, it is ineffective in the context of transferring input channels to the SPP channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this article, we propose the use of a 2D disordered array of nanoholes patterned on a thin metal film27 to increase the number of transmission channels from far-field optical inputs to plasmonic outputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the disorder enables the nanoholes distributed across 2D area to act as independent antennas by means of the random multiple scattering of SPPs generated at individual nanoholes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is clearly distinct from the case of periodically ordered 2D patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We prove that the effective number of deliverable channels can be more than 40, an order of magnitude increase in comparison with existing multiplexing methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the increased channel number, we demonstrate simultaneous focusing of SPPs at multiple spots, which is equivalent to the implementation of multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we show the delivery of a 2D far-field image to the SPPs.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Channel loss from optical inputs to plasmonic outputs', 'In converting the input channels of far-field waves propagating in three-dimensional space to the output channels of the surface waves, there occurs inevitable dimensional reduction that leads to the loss of most input channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To make it clear, let us take a periodic structure on a thin metal film for an example (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of input channels is given by the number of diffraction-limit spots within the area of illumination, which is given by  with L the side length of the pattern, and  the wavelength of incident wave in free space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the number of output channels for the surface wave is given by the length of the output line divided by half the wavelength, that is, 2L/SPP with SPP the wavelength of SPPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the output channels are significantly smaller in number than the input channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of a periodic structure, the channel conversion efficiency is even worse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are only one or two output channels because SPPs generated at each unit cell, instead of acting independently, are replicated at the other unit cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Numerical and theoretical analyses describing the performance of a 2D disordered array of nanoholes in channel transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) A 2D array of periodic nanoholes patterned on a metal film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Black dots indicate the positions of the holes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SPPs generated by a normally incident plane wave propagates along y-direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 2 m.

wavelength of the light source was 620 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SPPs were uncorrelated if the centre-to-centre distance between two neighbouring illuminations was larger than the characteristic length

#@NEW_LINE#@#  The red dots were the enhancement factor predicted after accounting for the residual correlations shown in Fig 4d (see Supplementary Note 2).Full size image', 'A simple way to avoid the problem associated with the periodically patterned devices is to use a one-dimensional (1D) array of nanoholes in the metal film (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual nanoholes are scatterers that convert the incoming far-field wave to the SPPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, they can act as antennas sending far-field information to the detection channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One can either choose the phase map of incident wave to individual holes (Fig 1b)28,29 or design the arrangement of nanoholes30 to focus SPPs at an arbitrary spot where an electronic circuit is to be connected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, however, the maximum number of transmission channels is given by N1D=2L/, which is the same in dimension as the SPP channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the dimensional reduction problem remains unsolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Deliverable channel number via disordered nanohole array', 'To increase the number of transmission channels from far-field optical inputs to plasmonic outputs, we propose the use of a 2D disordered array of nanoholes patterned on a thin metal film (Fig 1c,d) (see Supplementary Note 3 for the possible layout of the optoelectronic networks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nanoholes distributed across 2D area can act as independent antennas due to the random multiple scattering of SPPs generated at individual nanoholes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is clearly distinct from the case of periodically ordered 2D patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the multiple scattering process is problematic because it makes the SPP fields unpredictable at the detection channels (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there is a way to deterministically control these randomly scattered SPPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can measure a transfer matrix31,32,33 connecting far-field input to SPP output.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this matrix, the wavefront of an incident wave that would maximize the SPPs at arbitrary target points can be identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By shaping this wavefront using a spatial light modulator (SLM), it is possible to focus the SPPs at target spots (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, we defined  as the signal-to-noise ratio of intensity at the target spot with respect to the average intensity in the background because this signal-to-noise ratio is determined by the number of independent channels transferred to the detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We performed theoretical analysis for the effective number of transmission channels  for the 2D disordered array of nanoholes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SPPs generated at the holes illuminated by a far-field wave experience multiple scattering events on their way to the sampling line (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scattering occurs in two different pathwaysin-plane scattering which alters the propagation direction of the SPPs and out-of-plane scattering to the far-field waves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In-plane scattering gives rise to the decorrelation of SPPs generated at particular nanoholes with those at the other nanoholes and makes the contribution of individual nanoholes to the detection channels to be independent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it plays an important role in increasing the number of effective transmission channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Out-of-plane scattering works the same way as absorption loss in the sense that the photons disappear from the medium, thereby attenuating the intensity of the SPPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, we could determine the scattering (ls) and transport (lt) mean free paths of the SPPs propagating through the disordered metal film depending on the size and fill factor of the nanoholes (see Supplementary Note 4), and use these parameters to quantitatively describe the effect of multiple scattering events on the effective number of transmission channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As shown in Fig 1c, the SPPs generated at one slab of illumination gradually become uncorrelated with those at the other slabs as the separation between the slabs increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complete decorrelation occurs at the characteristic length lc, which is mainly determined by the diffraction-limit width of the far-field illumination at a high fill factor of the nanoholes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lc was measured to be 1.0 m in the experiment and 0.8 m in the numerical analysis (Supplementary Note 4), close to the width of illumination set by the numerical aperture of 0.6 used in the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, slabs of width lc can be treated as independent sources, and the 2D disordered array of nanoholes in the area L × L can be considered the combination of individual slabs of width lc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The blue, green and red rectangular areas in Fig 1c represent these slabs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Effectively, there are m=L/lc slabs, where  stands for the floor function which independently contributes to the SPPs at the output channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since there are N1D=2L/SPP independent antennas per slab along the x-direction, the total number of antennas for the entire pattern is given by m × N1D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The out-of-plane scattering and the metallic loss of SPPs attenuate SPP intensity depending on the distance between the holes to the sampling line, thereby reducing the effective channel number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decay of intensity takes the form  (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34), where la and lt are absorption length due to metallic loss and transport mean free path, respectively, and c is extrapolation length (see the Supplementary Note 4 for experimental and numerical measurements of T(y)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, la plays a major role at small y, and lt becomes more important at large y (see the Supplementary Note 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We defined the effective channel number  by the ratio of signal intensity at the target point to the average intensity in the background (signal-to-noise ratio) for SPP focusing:', '', 'Here the numerator accounts for the constructive addition of SPP fields at the target point, and the denominator for the incoherent addition of SPPs at points other than the target point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The , the enhancement factor of channel number due to the dimensional increase, is plotted as the blue dots in Fig 1e as a function of m=L/lc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under the experimental conditions introduced below, the theoretical model predicts th to be around 9 for L=10 m

radiation microscope35,36,37, to which we added a reference wave for the recording of the phase and amplitude of the SPPs generated at the air/metal interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we installed an SLM in the sample beam path to control the angle of the incident waves to the sample for the measurement of the transfer matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The device was also used to shape the wavefront of the incident waves to focus SPPs at target spots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pixel size of the SLM was 20 × 20 m2, and the magnification from SLM to the sample plane was 1/444.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of SLM pixels used for illumination was 230 × 230 to match the 10 × 10 m2 area where nanoholes were patterned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A quarter-wave plate was installed at the upstream of the SLM to set the polarization of the illumination to be circular to ensure that the scattering angles of SPPs at the holes were isotropic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a sample, we coated 100 nm-thick Au film on a glass substrate and fabricated a 2D disordered array of nanoholes using a focused ion beam (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual holes measuring 100 nm in diameter filled an L × L=10 × 10 m2 area with a fill factor ranging from 3 to 15%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the channel conversion efficiency was the best at 12% fill factor in our experiment (see Supplementary Note 5), all the data shown in the

interface and propagated down to the bottom of the glass substrate (nglass=1.515).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These leaked SPPs could be picked up by an oil-immersion objective lens because the refractive index of oil (noil=1.515) is larger than nSPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the boundary conditions, the transverse wavevectors, the component of wavevectors projected to the xy plane of the leaked SPPs in the glass is equal to the kSPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the azimuthal angle  of the SPP waves at the glass is given by .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, the SPPs appeared as a circular ring at the conjugate plane of the back focal plane of the objective lens in which the map of the Fourier transform of the transmitted electric field is displayed (inset in Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the SPPs, far-field waves scattered by the nanostructures at the air/metal and metal/glass interfaces were also present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transverse wavevectors of these waves can range from 0 to

frequency components generated at the metal/glass interface were weak as the incident waves were significantly attenuated there.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, far-field waves were mostly confined to a circle of radius k0, mostly due to the leakage of scattered waves generated at the holes on the air/metal interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We placed a circular beam block plate at the conjugate plane of the back aperture of the objective lens to block far-field waves whose transverse wavevector is smaller than kSPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to our analysis, the total intensity of the residual far-field

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have presented a 2D disordered array of nanoholes on a thin metal film as a MIMO plasmonic switching device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By exploiting the decorrelation of plasmonic waves due to their random multiple scattering, we could convert nanoholes encompassing a 2D area as independent antennas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated the transfer of more than 40 far-field input channels to the SPPs which is about an order of magnitude increase in the number of transmission channels with respect to periodically ordered 2D devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of lower loss material than gold such as silver is expected to increase channel capacity even further (see Supplementary Note 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the increased transmission channel number, we implemented the simultaneous control of 6 SPP channels at high signal-to-noise ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The additional experiments of delivering a 2D image embedded in far-field waves to the SPPs sampled along a 1D line confirmed that the nanoholes distributed across the 2D area indeed acted as independent transmission antennas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our method of exploiting the disorder to minimize the effect of the dimensional reduction from far-field waves to surface waves and therefore maximizing the deliverable far-field input channels to the plasmonic output channels will expedite the use of plasmonics in optoelectronic devices5,6,7,8,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we expect that the successful integration of the proposed switching device with multiple electrical circuits will lead to a dramatic increase in the processing speed of complex computational tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the real practices, additional steps may be necessary such as increasing the speed of channel control which can be done by replacing a spatial light modulator with the combination of a high-speed beam scanning device and multiple static phase masks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the long run, high-end microprocessors can take the advantage of the proposed type of a high-throughput switching device and help a wide range of scientific activities relying on heavy computation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'All relevant data are available from the authors.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
