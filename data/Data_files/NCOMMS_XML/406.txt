Identification of ETV6-RUNX1-like and DUX4-rearranged subtypes in paediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Fusion genes are potent driver mutations in cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we delineate the fusion gene landscape in a consecutive series of 195 paediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (BCP ALL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using RNA sequencing, we find in-frame fusion genes in 127 (65%) cases, including 27 novel fusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We describe a subtype characterized by recurrent IGH-DUX4 or ERG-DUX4 fusions, representing 4% of cases, leading to overexpression of DUX4 and frequently co-occurring with intragenic ERG deletions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we identify a subtype characterized by an ETV6-RUNX1-like gene-expression profile and coexisting ETV6 and IKZF1 alterations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this study provides a detailed overview of fusion genes in paediatric BCP ALL and adds new pathogenetic insights, which may improve risk stratification and provide therapeutic options for this disease.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Paediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (BCP ALL), the most common childhood malignancy, is stratified into prognostically relevant genetic subgroups based on the presence of certain gene fusions and aneuploidies1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, 25% of cases do not have any characteristic genetic aberrations at diagnosis, and the underlying driver events are unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these cases, here denoted as B-other, the identification of pathogenetic changes will not only increase our understanding of the leukemogenic process, but may also be important in a clinical context, because such alterations can be used for improved risk classification and for targeted treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent genome-wide studies have provided critical pathogenetic insights into paediatric BCP ALL, including the identification of a dismal prognosis for cases with IKZF1 deletions2,3,4,5 and for cases with a Ph-like4,5,6,7,8 gene-expression signature similar to that of Philadelphia (Ph)-positive ALL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the mutational landscapes of BCP ALL subtypes defined by ETV6-RUNX1, TCF3-PBX1, TCF3-HLF, high hyperdiploidy (5167 chromosomes), hypodiploidy ( less_than 45 chromosomes) or MLL (also known as KMT2A) rearrangements have been delineated using high-resolution sequencing techniques9,10,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies have almost exclusively been performed at the DNA level and no large-scale characterization of the gene-fusion landscape in paediatric BCP ALL has been reported to date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To gain a better understanding of the gene-fusion landscape of BCP ALL, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in a population-based series of 195 paediatric ( less_than 18 years of age) BCP ALL cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report that gene fusions are present in 65% of BCP ALL, and identify several new fusions and two novel subtypes; one characterized by recurrent IGH-DUX4 or ERG-DUX4 fusions and one characterized by an ETV6-RUNX1-like gene-expression profile, and coexisting ETV6 and IKZF1 alterations.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Identified subtypes enable classification of 98% of cases', 'All 195 cases subjected to RNA-seq had previously been analysed by G-banding, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and molecular analyses for the detection of established genetic BCP ALL alterations as part of routine clinical diagnostics (Supplementary Fig 1 and Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using RNA-seq, we identified an in-frame fusion gene in 127/195 (65%) BCP ALL cases and out-of-frame fusions in 20/195 (10%) cases (Fig 1 and Supplementary Data 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, of the 68 cases lacking an in-frame fusion gene, the majority (64/68, 94%) were high-hyperdiploid (n=56), hypodiploid (n=2), Ph-like (n=3), harboured a dic(9;20) (n=1) or belonged to novel subtypes further described below (n=2) (Fig 1e and Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One subgroup, comprising 16% of B-other cases (4% of the entire BCP ALL cohort), harboured rearrangements of the double homeobox 4 (DUX4) gene and overlapped with a previously described group of patients with a homogenous gene-expression profile and frequent ERG deletions6,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a new subtype, harbouring co-existing rearrangements of ETV6 and IKZF1 and associated with ETV6-RUNX1-like gene-expression pattern (3% of the cohort; 14% of B-other cases), was identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken altogether, 98% of the BCP ALL cases could be classified into distinct genetic subtypes with a known underlying driver mutation or, less commonly, with a rare in-frame gene fusion (Figs 1f, 2, Supplementary Data 3), providing new insights and pathogenetic markers in BCP ALL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Overview of the gene fusions present in 195 paediatric BCP ALL cases in the discovery cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) In-frame gene fusions (green) and out-of-frame gene fusions (orange) are illustrated using Circos59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each ribbon has one end attached to the circle, indicating the 5-partner gene of the fusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The width of the ribbon is proportional to the number of detected fusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes are arranged according to their genomic position (from chromosome 122 followed by X and Y) and chromosomes are marked in different colours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gene symbol is denoted for genes involved in more than two unique fusions or in recurrent fusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) In-frame gene fusions and out-of-frame gene fusions present in 50 B-other cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gene symbol for genes involved in more than two unique fusions or in recurrent fusions is indicated in bold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) The frequency of in-frame gene fusions by genetic subtype (indicated in the right column with the number of affected cases in parenthesis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Novel gene fusions are indicated in red (n=27, reciprocal gene-fusion pairs counted as a single fusion) and previously described fusions are indicated in black (n=22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) The frequency of out-of-frame gene fusions by genetic subtype (indicated in the right column with the number of affected cases in parenthesis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Total number of gene fusions per case by genetic subtype (including both in-frame and out-of-frame fusions;

Figs 1ac and 2, Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rearrangements were either a fusion between IGH and DUX4 (7/8 cases) or between ERG and DUX4 (1 case).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm this and other findings within the B-other group, we performed RNA-seq of an independent validation cohort of 49 paediatric B-other cases that were negative for BCR-ABL1, ETV6-RUNX1, TCF3-PBX1, MLL rearrangements and high hyperdiploidy (Supplementary Data 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis revealed an additional 20 cases with DUX4 rearrangements, resulting in a total of 26 cases with IGH-DUX4 and 2 with ERG-DUX4 across the 2 cohorts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'DUX4 encodes a homeobox-containing protein and is located within a subtelomeric D4Z4 repeat region on 4q and 10q.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is present in 11100 copies on each allele, and is epigenetically silenced in somatic tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of epigenetic silencing through shortening of the D4Z4 repeats leads to the degradation of muscle cells, and causes facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To confirm the DUX4 rearrangements at the genomic level, we performed mate-pair whole-genome sequencing (MP-WGS) in all eight cases in the discovery cohort, enabling powerful mapping of structural genomic rearrangements (Supplementary Data 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These analyses confirmed the DUX4 rearrangements at the DNA level in all cases, and revealed that the IGH-DUX4 fusions resulted from insertions of a partial copy of DUX4 into the IGH locus, including between 901,200 bp upstream of DUX4 and between 939 and 1,272 bp of coding sequence from DUX4 (Fig 3 and Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, ERG-DUX4 in case 75 was the result of an insertion of a partial copy of DUX4 into intron 3 of ERG, containing 936 bp of coding sequence of DUX4 (Fig 3j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither IGH-DUX4 nor ERG-DUX4 would give rise to a chimeric protein; instead, the rearrangements and expression pattern suggest that the relocation of DUX4 induces its expression from regulatory regions of the partner gene (Fig 3 and Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full-length DUX4 protein consists of 424 amino acids, but 7 of the 8 genomically characterized cases expressed truncated DUX4 transcripts encoding between 312 and 420 amino acids (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only case 47 expressed the full coding length of DUX4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All variants, however, retained both homeobox domains of DUX4, thus preserving its DNA-binding capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: DUX4 rearrangements in eight BCP ALL cases in the discovery cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Arrangement of immunoglobulin genes in the IGH locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Structure of the subtelomeric D4Z4 repeat region on 4q in the hg19 reference genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reference representation has seven repeats, each containing a DUX4 gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Healthy individuals have 11100 repeats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ci) Structure of the IGH-DUX4 rearrangements in (c) case 35, (d) case 47, (e) case 53, (f) case 67, (g) case 124, (h) case 174 and (i) case 179.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (j) Structure of the ERG-DUX4 rearrangement in case 75.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All genomic coordinates are based on the human reference genome hg19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because it is impossible to determine which DUX4 repeat is involved in the rearrangement, the coordinates from the first DUX4 repeat are represented in the figures.Full size image', 'All DUX4-rearranged cases displayed a distinct overexpression of DUX4 as determined by RNA-seq; in contrast, expression of this gene was significantly lower or absent in the other investigated 216 BCP ALL cases across the discovery and validation cohorts (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, all cases with DUX4 rearrangements displayed a global gene-expression pattern matching that of a subgroup of BCP ALL cases previously reported to be associated with ERG deletions in 3855% of cases (Supplementary Fig 4)6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, all cases with this gene-expression profile had DUX4 rearrangements and overexpression of DUX4, indicating that the DUX4 rearrangement is the founder event for this group (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined the frequency of ERG deletions in DUX4-rearranged cases by MP-WGS in the discovery cohort and indirectly by ascertaining truncated transcripts by RTPCR14 in the validation cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This revealed ERG deletions in 5/8 (63%) cases in the discovery cohort and in 10/20 (50%) cases in the validation cohort (Supplementary Fig 5), supporting that the DUX4-rearranged subtype reported here is identical to the previously described subtype with a distinct gene-expression profile and frequent ERG deletions6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This group has consistently been associated with a favourable prognosis, both when defined by the distinct gene-expression profile6, and when defined by the characteristic ERG deletions14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the discovery cohort, we observed no relapses among the 8 DUX4-rearranged cases, while 4 of 20 cases (20%) experienced relapse in the validation cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the identification of DUX4 rearrangement as a new marker in BCP ALL, it will be interesting to ascertain its prognostic impact in larger, uniformly treated, cohorts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To characterize further the mutational landscape of DUX4-rearranged BCP ALL, whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed in five DUX4-rearranged cases with matched constitutional samples available (Supplementary Data 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These were found to harbour between 4 and 10 non-silent exome mutations each (Supplementary Data 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only recurrently mutated gene was the transcription factor ZEB2, with mutations in two cases (#75 and #174).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A borderline significance for cases with DUX4 rearrangements being older than cases lacking such fusions (MannWhitneys two-sided test, P=0.051; median age 6.5 versus 4 years) was seen in the discovery cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The median age at diagnosis of patients with DUX4-rearranged ALL in the combined cohorts was 8.5 years (range 215 years).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the pronounced age peak at 35 years for childhood BCP ALL in general18, this indicates that DUX4-rearrangments are associated with older age, although this needs to be confirmed in larger cohorts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, an association with older age has previously been described for cases with ERG deletions14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The complexity of the genomic region where DUX4 is located is most likely the reason that DUX4 fusions have not been previously discovered in BCP ALL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our standard RNA-seq bioinformatics pipeline could only detect the rearrangement in 7 of 28 cases, whereas a guided analysis that identified RNA-seq reads that linked any region within 2 kb of DUX4 to the reads within the IGH locus identified the IGH-DUX4 in an additional 19 cases (Supplementary Data 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the remaining two cases with DUX4 overexpression, a fusion between ERG and DUX4 was discovered by surveying the RNA-seq reads for regions similarly linked to the region surrounding DUX4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The aberrations were also not expected to be detectable on the chromosomal level by either G-banding or FISH, due to the small sizes of the insertions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with this, G-banding results from the eight DUX4-rearranged cases in the discovery cohort showed normal karyotypes in four cases and unspecific changes in two cases; in two cases, G-banding analyses had failed (Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken altogether, RNA-seq followed by guided searches for DUX4 chimeric transcripts is a reliable way to identify DUX4 rearrangements, although both WES and MP-WGS allows the detection of the rearrangement at the genomic level (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'ETV6-RUNX1-like gene expression in cases lacking the fusion', 'Gene-expression profiling based on the RNA-seq data showed that 6/50 (12%) B-other cases in the discovery cohort clustered with the ETV6-RUNX1-positive cases, despite lacking molecular evidence of this fusion by FISH, RTPCR and RNA-seq (Fig 4ac, and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gene-expression similarities were further supported by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)19 (Supplementary Figs 68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These six cases were thus denoted ETV6-RUNX1-like ALL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, RNA-seq together with single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array profiling revealed that five of the six ETV6-RUNX1-like cases harboured co-existing ETV6 and IKZF1 aberrations (Figs 2, 5;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Gene fusions are strong driver mutations in neoplasia, and have provided fundamental insights into the disease mechanisms involved in tumourigenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, they are increasingly used for diagnostic purposes, risk stratification and disease follow-up, and several chimeric proteins encoded by gene fusions serve as specific targets for treatment30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We here describe the gene-fusion landscape of paediatric BCP ALL, and show that the majority of cases (65%) express in-frame gene fusions, including most B-other cases (82%) previously described to lack specific genetic changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The notable exception was high-hyperdiploid cases where only 3% of cases harboured an in-frame fusion gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low number of in-frame fusions in this group, however, highlights that the background level of gene-fusion generation in BCP ALL is low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the median number of fusion genes per case in this study was 1 for all major subtypes ( greater than 3 cases) apart from high-hyperdiploid cases, showing that additional fusion genes are rarely needed for leukemogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ETV6-RUNX1-positive cases, however, additional fusions of unclear pathogenetic importance were present in 35% of cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These typically involved ETV6 or RUNX1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the latter gene the fusions were generated through three-way translocations also creating the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We demonstrate, for the first time, that 16% of B-other cases (4% of BCP ALL) harboured rearrangements involving the DUX4 gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequency of such rearrangements differed between the discovery and validation cohorts; something that could possibly be explained by the higher mean age of the latter (7.1 versus 6.1 years).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the true incidence of DUX4 rearrangements in childhood BCP ALL needs to be further assessed in larger patient cohorts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rearrangements resulted in fusions between IGH and DUX4, or less commonly, ERG and DUX4, causing aberrant DUX4 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DUX4 has previously only been reported to be rearranged in round-cell sarcomas, forming a recurrent CIC-DUX4 fusion gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That fusion, however, only includes a small C-terminal part of DUX4, not including the two homeobox domains43, and is therefore likely to be functionally different from the fusions described here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, all cases with DUX4 rearrangements described herein displayed a gene-expression signature matching that of a subgroup of BCP ALL reported to be associated with frequent ERG deletions6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DUX4 encodes a transcription factor normally expressed in germ cells that regulates the expression of genes involved in germline and early stem cell development17,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, it is tempting to speculate that the aberrant expression of DUX4 in the rearranged cases cause activation of transcriptional programmes that normally are expressed during early stem cell development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the ERG deletions, DUX4 rearrangements were present in all cases with the characteristic gene-expression pattern, implying that DUX4 rearrangements constitute the founder event of this subtype and that ERG deletions are secondary cooperating events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Global gene-expression profiling is a powerful tool to identify leukaemias with similar mutational backgrounds, as exemplified by the Ph-like subtype: such cases were initially identified as having gene-expression patterns similar to those of Ph-positive BCP ALL cases4,5,6 and were only later identified as being characterized by genetic alterations that activate kinase or cytokine receptor signalling7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the B-other group we identified a second novel subtype, consisting of cases with a gene-expression profile similar to that of ETV6-RUNX1-positive cases but lacking this fusion gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, they harboured lesions affecting both ETV6 and IKZF1 in all cases with ascertainable data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We termed this subtype ETV6-RUNX1-like ALL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to cases with ETV6-RUNX1-like gene expression that have been reported in literature, but where cryptic ETV6-RUNX1 were not excluded45, we performed extensive genetic analyses to rule out a cryptic ETV6-RUNX1 rearrangement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we propose that combined ETV6 and IKZF1 lesions together may activate similar transcriptional programmes as the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The DUX4-rearranged and ETV6-RUNX1-like subtypes together with the well-established subgroup of Ph-like BCP ALL4,5,6,7,8 accounted for 59 and 71% of B-other cases in the discovery and validation cohorts, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the remaining B-other cases in the two cohorts, 74% expressed rare previously reported, or novel in-frame gene fusions, many of which contained genes with recurrent alterations in BCP ALL24,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, these findings illustrate that paediatric BCP ALL, with the exception of the high-hyperdiploid, near-haploid and low-hypodiploid subgroups11,12, is characterized by the presence of fusion genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because many gene fusions will be rare or even private, our study reinforces that RNA-seq may be a powerful tool for unbiased screening of fusion genes in a clinical setting with an unmatched power to detect novel but targetable gene fusions in BCP ALL8,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, this study provides a detailed view of the fusion gene landscape in paediatric BCP ALL, identifying several new gene fusions as well as distinct subgroups of BCP ALL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apart from increasing our understanding of the pathogenesis of paediatric BCP ALL, this may help improve risk stratification and eventually increase the therapeutic options for this most common form of childhood malignancy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
