Sesquinary catenae on the Martian satellite Phobos from reaccretion of escaping ejecta  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The Martian satellite Phobos is criss-crossed by linear grooves and crater chains whose origin is unexplained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anomalous grooves are relatively young, and crosscut tidally predicted stress fields as Phobos spirals towards Mars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report strong correspondence between these anomalous features and reaccretion patterns of sesquinary ejecta from impacts on Phobos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Escaping ejecta persistently imprint Phobos with linear, low-velocity crater chains (catenae) that match the geometry and morphology of prominent features that do not fit the tidal model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We prove that these cannot be older than Phobos current orbit inside Mars Roche limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Distinctive reimpact patterns allow sesquinary craters to be traced back to their source, for the first time across any planetary body, creating a novel way to probe planetary surface characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, we show that catena-producing craters likely formed in the gravity regime, providing constraints on the ejecta velocity field and knowledge of source crater material properties.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Ejecta escaping from an impact on a natural satellite often goes into orbit about the primary and can reimpact the satellite or its companions after an extended period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These sesquinary impacts1 are slower than primary impacts, but faster than the satellite escape velocity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because they spend time in orbit they do not simply radiate from their primary crater as secondary craters do; nonetheless, their close dynamical association with the satellite can give them a unique geometrical distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like secondary craters, sesquinaries are probes of the primary ejection process, but are also bound to the dynamics of the planet-satellite system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike secondaries, to date no sesquinary crater has been traced back to its primary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Phobos, the 26 × 22 × 18 km battered moon of Mars, is covered in parallel linear features whose orientation is, for the most part, aligned with de-orbiting tidal stresses as Phobos spirals closer to Mars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the tidal bulge grows, surface stresses increase and cause striations2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, many of Phobos linear features do not align with any interpretation of tidal stress, giving rise to alternative models such as impact fractures related to the formation of Stickney4, the largest crater on Phobos, ejecta from Mars basin formation5, pitted regolith from bouncing boulders6 and drainages opening up into a fractured substrate7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even with recent improvements incorporating two-layer tidal stresses from orbital decay3, a subset of prominent hemispherical crater chains crosscut predicted stress fields and bear a closer resemblance to distal secondary crater chains on the Moon, except there is no apparent source crater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also resemble the tidal catenae on Ganymede and Callisto that are the result of cometary disruption inside the Roche limit of Jupiter8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose these features on Phobos are a novel kind of structure intermediate between these two phenomena, which we call sesquinary catenae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "We classify four kinds of satellite impacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A primary impact is by a bolide from outside the planets sphere of influence; these are generally the fastest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A secondary impact is by a fragment ejected from a primary crater; these are the slowest cratering events, no faster than a fraction of the satellite's escape velocity vesc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such craters radiate from the primary and form linear chains and clumps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A sesquinary impact is formed by crater ejecta that escapes but remains in orbit in the system; its impact velocity is intermediate between vesc and the orbital velocity vorb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the satellite is far from the planet, sesquinaries can produce primary-like crater morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intermediate between sesquinary and secondary is the so-called dosquinary, where the ejecta reimpacts after spending only a few orbits aloft.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These can be thought of as the slowest possible sesquinaries, but not quite secondaries, since the gravitational influence is primarily that of the planet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are limited to satellites that orbit close to the planet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ", 'Sesquinaries/dosquinaries from Phobos are especially interesting for three reasons: first, the escape velocity vesc is of order 10 m s1, hundreds of times slower than its orbital velocity vorb 2.2 km s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slowest escaping ejecta, which comprise the major mass fraction, cannot stray far from the satellite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the escaping ejecta are subject to powerful orbital and tidal distortion, since the current semimajor axis a2.77RMars is significantly inside the classical Roche limit Rroche3.19RMars (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, as we shall show, the timescale for reaccretion is so short that ejected particles can be reaccreted before they have time to disperse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This leads to the curious geomorphic phenomenon of sesquinary catenae, each linked to a particular source crater on Phobos, and sets these features apart from crater chains on bodies beyond deep planetary gravity wells of planets, such as Eros10, Gaspra and Steins11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analytical formulations have been used to study the dynamics of escaping and reaccreting ejecta12,13,14, but to precisely predict sesquinary reimpact locations we require an ephemerides formulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consider multiple orbital configurations around Mars to evaluate variations in Mars-Phobos orbital geometry and inferior or superior conjunctions with Deimos at the time of the primary ejecta-producing impact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the significant percentage of mass escaping Phobos is ejected slower than 100 m s1 (92%, Methods section), we track in precise detail the component ejected with velocities from vesc11 to 100 m s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Planetocentric latitude and longitude of each impact location is extracted from the evolution model.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Primordial versus modern orbit', 'We find that a majority of the mass ejected from Phobos at low velocity ( less_than 100 m s1) reaccretes; the rest impacts Mars or leaves the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A minor fraction ( less_than 1%) impacts Deimos at randomized locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We characterize Stickney, the largest crater on Phobos, which either formed geologically recently or when Phobos was in a more distant orbit close to the synchronous line15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1a shows the reimpact map for Stickney had it occurred in Phobos present orbit, with a mean reaccretion time of 22 h, where a2.77RMars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Catenae from Stickney are clearly distinguishable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1b shows the reimpact map for a primordial a=6RMars (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, with a mean reaccretion time of 32 years and max of 88 years, individual reaccreted particles have lost their geometrical association due to the much longer flight time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A study of sesquinaries originating from Deimos finds that ejecta particles reaccrete over 500 years and do not form crater chains18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, for Phobos modern orbit inside the Roche limit, reimpacts are not only more frequent than in a primordial orbit but also occur over shorter timescales (days) and are recognizably coherent, forming chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Reaccretion map for the Stickney impact in Phobos modern and primordial orbits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Ejecta from Phobos in its modern orbit, a 2.77RMars;

above 30 m s1, a few times vesc, reimpacts are less correlated to catenae-like structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studying the reimpact velocities (Fig 3), we find that they are correspondingly higher than vesc (refs 19, 20) but sufficiently low that craters produced are expected to morphologically resemble secondary craters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, though the mean reaccretion time for all Phobos-impacting particles is 22 h, the large majority of catena-forming impacts occur in 614 h.', 'Figure 2: The evolution of catenae with increasing velocity of ejection from Phobos.Maps show reimpact locations for sesquinary impactors with ejection velocity greater than Phobos escape velocity and lesser than (a) 20, (b) 25, (c) 30 and (d) 100 m s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Catenae-like formations are evident from particles ejected at lower velocities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As ejection velocity increases past 30 m s1, reimpacts become less correlated to catenae-like structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The source of the catenae is therefore very low-velocity particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primary impact location is Stickney and azimuth  0:/6:2.Full size image', 'Figure 3: Impact versus ejection velocity for sesquinary impactors.Ejecta correspond to simulations in all panels of Fig 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of impacts occur at a velocity comparable to their ejection velocity, that is, between 11 and 30 m s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a small fraction experience acceleration due to greater interactions with Mars gravity (inset); these have a correspondingly longer accretion time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of these results, sesquinary impact craters are largely expected to have an appearance similar to secondary craters noted in image surveys of Phobos.Full size image', 'As such, these are a special case of sesquinary impacts (dosquinaries).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the impactors temporarily escape the gravitational influence of Phobos, they exhibit behaviour that may be best described as intermediate between a secondary and traditional sesquinary impactor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since 80% of the total mass that escapes Phobos during an impact is ejected at speeds of  less_than 30 m s1 (Methods section), this mass influx is a mechanism capable of significant impact to the surface geology; for detailed characterization of catena production we now focus on 1030 m s1 streamlines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Next, we attempt to establish if the catenae are a frequent phenomenon by searching for a lower limit of impact that results in the creation of catenae-like structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We generate  less_than 30 m s1 reimpact maps for ejecta from primary craters of 1, 3 and 5 km in diameter (Stickney: 10 km diameter).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As seen in Supplementary Fig 1, catenae are predicted to form as a byproduct of sesquinaries from primary craters at least as small as 1 km in diameter, and likely smaller.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The saturated (at least down to 300 m craters21) surface of Phobos suggests that the creation of low-velocity, clustered linear impact structures from sesquinary ejecta is a relatively frequent process; catena formation is approximately as frequent as gravity-regime crater formation, where most of the escaping ejecta mass is just barely escaping ( less_than 30 m s1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that linear chains of low-velocity impact structures are a relatively frequent process on modern Phobos, each correlated with a source crater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is interesting to note that a kilometre-sized crater in the strength regime would create faster ejecta, consequently producing less-reaccreting ejecta22 and few (if any) crater chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis therefore allows us to probe the dynamics of crater ejecta in a way not done before, for instance proving that catena-producing craters formed in the gravity regime (in deep regolith) and are likely not much older than Phobos current orbit ( less_than 50 Ma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 4 illustrates how orbital ejecta lingering in the vicinity of the Phobos orbit can be swallowed up in hemispherical patterns that lead to chain or catena-like reaccretion patterns (for example, Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tracing the precise orbital history of multiple particles shows that ejected particles transition from the gravitational influence of Phobos to Mars for a period of between 1 and 5 orbits before subsequent impact, reaccreting before they have time to disperse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean reaccretion time of 22 h is 3 times the orbital period of Phobos; for  less_than 100 m s1 impact velocity events, the mean reaccretion time is 614 h, or 12 times the orbital period of Phobos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Visualization of the orbital history of randomly selected particles.Shown are the trajectories of randomly selected projectiles ejected at 1130 m s1, which impact over a relatively short time in a grouped fashion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As Phobos moves along its orbit (towards the top of the figure, dashed pink line), ejected particles in the vicinity of Phobos orbit (purple, white, green, red and yellow lines) are reaccreted to the satellite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dashed circles represent planetocentric impact points, illustrating how hemispherical catena (Fig 5) may be formed.Full size image', 'The higher the ejection velocity (Fig 3) the higher the corresponding scatter in the locations of reaccretion (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This correlates to longer flight times and greater interactions with Mars-dominated gravity, as opposed to the low-velocity impactors, which escape Phobos-centred gravity but do not stray far from the orbit of the satellite before reimpact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low-velocity impactors creating the catena appear to be dosquinary in nature, that is, intermediate between typical secondary and sesquinary impactor behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given a low-velocity ejection bracket (1130 m s1, Fig 5), we find that the azimuth of ejection controls the length and coherence of the catenae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the ejection azimuths for reaccreting particles, it can be seen that different azimuths result in different sections of the catena being formed (shape legend, Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The formation of an axisymmetric cone, with ejecta along every outbound azimuth, is of course an idealized case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In reality, depending on the geometry of the primary crater formation (and resulting streamlines), catenae may range from highly focused to patchy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If no particle is ejected between the azimuths of (say) 30° and 45°, there will be a corresponding gap in the catena.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The location of this gap can be inferred from the respective shape legends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inversely, given a suspected catena on Phobos, this makes it possible to infer the properties of the primary impact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Catenae orientations change from vertical to horizontal depending on the latitude of the primary impact.Maps show resultant catenae from primary impacts on Phobos at the prime meridian and (a) 0° N, (b) 30° N, (c) 60° N and (d) 85° N.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our results support Grildrigs formation in the gravity regime and in deep regolith.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Grildrig does show raised rims corresponding to gravity-regime production, is reasonably fresh, and of suitable diameter to produce the observed catena.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When loose material is ejected at velocities just exceeding escape velocity, self-gravity of the material becomes a factor and leads to clump formation, as seen from asteroid family and binary formation simulations24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is how an impact to deep regolith can release large ejecta fragments, which would then become sesquinary impactors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is also why the catenae do not have cleanly discriminated crater forms, but rather clumpy streamers of interconnected features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The rim of Grildrig shows craters similar in size to the catena in its vicinity; it is likely that reimpacting ejecta may have formed some of these.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Better image data from a dedicated Phobos mission can enable studies of chronology in the relative sense, that is, evaluate the hypothesis that craters on the rim of Grildrig are coeval with catena craters associated with sesquinary ejecta from Grildrig.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Certainly, if sesquinary ejecta is indeed the source of the indicated crater chain, there is little one can say about crater ages on Phobos from the consideration of sub-kilometre scale crater densities; age estimates from crater counting were previously used26 as an argument against a tidal origin2 for grooves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, catenae on Phobos created by low-velocity sesquinary impactors are persistent across the range of longitudinal, latitudinal, orbital and conjunctive variations, with distinctive resulting geometries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This in turn implies that catena formation is approximately as frequent as gravity-regime crater formation, where most of the escaping ejecta mass is just barely escaping ( less_than 30 m s1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For such events, the fate according to our model is for material to impact in a linear chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of Fig 3, we expect the resulting crater morphology to be similar to secondary craters in nature, consistent with secondary crater chains and catenae noted on the Moon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The direct association of sesquinary catenae with source craters is an important and new kind of planetary data set, leveraging a 1:1 correspondence to constrain the dynamical and geologic history of Phobos in a novel way.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without applying any morphological criterion, we can say if a catena-like feature on Phobos is a good candidate for a sesquinary origin by asking if it follows the distinct trending direction that it must follow if it were sesquinary (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based solely on an inspection of Fig 5, initial guesses may be made at the latitude of that features possible source crater; a grid search similar to that performed for Grildrig would then narrow possibilities down to one source crater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Significant craters without corresponding catenae might need to have formed when Phobos was in a more distant orbit, or in strength-controlled impacts with faster ejecta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, catenae without corresponding source craters may have formed when Phobos was in a different orbital or tidal-locking geometry with respect to Mars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of correlation of major catenae with our predictions for Stickney (Fig 1) suggest that Stickney formed when Phobos was more distant from Mars27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, long flight times for particles reaccreting to Deimos result in many reimpacts but no catenae on that body18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This does not preclude the possibility of impact craters on Phobos that are uncorrelated Stickney sesquinaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Discriminating sesquinary catenae from tidal stress-induced fissures3, or catenae-like features formed from regolith draining into fissures7, is the next step in Phobos surface science.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, sesquinary catenae may exhibit raised rims typical of impact craters, whereas catenae-like features formed by regolith draining would not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the walls of drainage pits would stand at the angle of repose, whereas sesquinary craters might be less steep.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given the generally heterogeneous quality and resolution of Phobos images, and the lack of systematic mapping products (for example, ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28) applied to the Mars Express data sets9, discriminating catenae as sesquinary or otherwise solely on the basis of imaging is an expansive task, rendered further difficult by the fact that there may be multiple mechanisms for linear feature formation at play.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a need for published topographic profiles of Phobos that reliably measure the slopes of Phobos features relative to the satellites effective gravity (which can vary measurably across the surface of the moon), from which the distinct origin of a particular catena might be distinguished.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The creation of these products is ongoing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using this, future work will start with systematic and objective geomorphic measurements of the directions, slopes, depths, and the sizes and spacings of linear pits and craters, to classify linear features on Phobos objectively (for example, into secondary ejecta-like streamers versus fissures and so on), analogous to Morrison et al.28 but applied to modern Phobos data9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These classified features will then be compared with model predictions, especially sesquinary catena predictions from fresh-looking source craters in present and geologically recent orbits, groove predictions from the tidal model3 and any other viable mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study also has potential implications for other closely bound satellite systems, especially Pluto and Charon, whose tidal locking and close proximity leads to the possibility of similar short-timescale reaccretions collecting preferentially onto facing hemispheres.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
