Observational evidence confirms modelling of the long-term integrity of CO2-reservoir caprocks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Storage of anthropogenic CO2 in geological formations relies on a caprock as the primary seal preventing buoyant super-critical CO2 escaping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although natural CO2 reservoirs demonstrate that CO2 may be stored safely for millions of years, uncertainty remains in predicting how caprocks will react with CO2-bearing brines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This uncertainty poses a significant challenge to the risk assessment of geological carbon storage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe mineral reaction fronts in a CO2 reservoir-caprock system exposed to CO2 over a timescale comparable with that needed for geological carbon storage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The propagation of the reaction front is retarded by redox-sensitive mineral dissolution reactions and carbonate precipitation, which reduces its penetration into the caprock to 7 cm in 105 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This distance is an order-of-magnitude smaller than previous predictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results attest to the significance of transport-limited reactions to the long-term integrity of sealing behaviour in caprocks exposed to CO2.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Carbon capture and storage will form an essential part of the technologies needed to reduce anthropogenic CO2 emissions if costly climate change is to be avoided1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CO2, separated at power stations and industrial plants, is compressed and injected into saline geological reservoirs as a supercritical fluid2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CO2 is less dense than the saline brines at typical formation temperatures, driving buoyant migration, and will need to be retained by impermeable caprocks as the primary mechanism for ensuring effective storage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsidiary processes including dissolution of CO2 in formation brines, trapping of CO2 by capillary forces and precipitation of carbonate minerals will aid storage security over the 104 year timescales needed to avoid climate impacts3, but operation of these processes is dependent on the initial retention under the caprock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The caprocks in sedimentary successions suitable for CO2 storage will most commonly comprise clay-rich mudstones or shales that act as barriers to CO2 migration by two mechanisms4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their low permeabilities ( less_than 1019 m2) restrict fluid fluxes to very low rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, capillary entry pressures for CO2 of 0.55 MPa4 will restrict penetration of CO2, allowing transport of CO2 only by sluggish diffusion in the brine phase, which will be further retarded by the complex geometry of the pore networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The addition of CO2 forms acid brines that react with clay-rich caprocks to drive dissolution and precipitation of minerals5,6,7, with consequences for the evolution of porosity and the geomechanical integrity of the seals8, within regions penetrated by the diffusing CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial dissolution of rapidly reacting carbonate and oxy-hydroxide phases will buffer the pH of CO2-saturated brines to 5 followed by the more sluggish dissolution of silicate and phyllosilicate minerals, which further increase pH and cause re-precipitation of carbonate phases5,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is uncertain as to whether these fluidrock reactions may lead to mineral precipitation-induced self-sealing phenomena that limit the pervasion of the CO2, as predicted by some numerical simulations5,9,10,11,12,13, or self-enhancing mineral dissolution and porosity generation, which generate a continuous increase in caprock transport properties, as observed in some laboratory experiments14,15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct observations of caprock materials exposed to CO2 over the timescales requisite for storage are critical to address this uncertainty, where the coupled reactive-transport phenomena are integrated over the appropriate temporal and spatial scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Fundamental uncertainties in the prediction of coupled reactive transport in low permeability clay-rich caprocks include a poor understanding of the relationship between reaction-induced changes in porosity and the pore-network structure, and the consequences for the rates of solute transport18, the uncertain mineral surface areas and kinetics of the mineral reactions in natural settings19, the rates of which may be limited by the intrinsic surface reaction rates of the minerals or by rates of solute transport20, and the reaction pathways in natural settings, including the role of acid redox reactions as a CO2 sink21, which will retard the rates of diffusive CO2 transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We address this fundamental gap in our knowledge of the long-term impacts of CO2-charged fluids on caprock integrity by examining caprock recovered from a natural CO2 reservoir.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this reservoir is at much shallower depths and lower pressures than needed for geological carbon storage, the reactions between minerals and CO2-saturated brines are little affected by pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mineralogical and petrophysical measurements are used to assess the impacts of CO2-promoted reactions on the caprock pore-network transport properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measurements reveal that the CO2-charged mildly reducing brines only removed haematite from the basal 7 cm of the haematite-bearing claystone cap rock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This data is used to constrain analytical and numerical reactiondiffusion models, which confirm that the fluidrock reactions retard CO2 transport by an order of magnitude, and that the timescale of alteration is 105 years, comparable with geochronological constraints on the duration of CO2 storage in the reservoir.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The small but transient increases in porosity generated by the mineral reactions do not significantly enhance reaction front velocities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results attest to the significance of transport-limited reactions to the long-term integrity of sealing behaviour in caprocks exposed to CO2.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mineral reactions and petrophysical changes in the caprock', 'Core and fluid samples were collected from a sequence of CO2-charged reservoirs and intervening caprocks during scientific drilling within the footwall of the Little Grand Wash Fault, Green River, Utah22 (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 325-m deep drillhole transected reservoirs of CO2-charged brine in the Middle Jurassic Entrada and Lower Jurassic Navajo Sandstone, and the intervening Middle Jurassic Carmel Formation caprock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The geochemistry of fluid samples, collected at formation pressures through the Navajo Sandstone reservoir, tracks contemporary filling via artesian flow of CO2 and CO2-saturated brines through the faults23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reservoir fluids are mixtures of Na-Cl-SO4 brine and meteoric groundwater with low pH (5.15.3), reducing (0 to 50 mV), SO4-rich and contain trace quantities of H2S and CH4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The migrating CO2 and CO2-saturated brine are thought to originate from an accumulation of supercritical CO2 within Carboniferous strata at depth24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  U-Th geochronology of carbonate veining in associated faults attests to CO2 out-gassing regionally for ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  400 ka and locally for at least 114 ka, providing an independent constraint of the duration over which the Carmel Formation caprock has been exposed to CO2-charged brines25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cycles in the chemistry of the fault-hosted carbonate veins have been attributed to cyclic charging of the shallow reservoirs with multiple pulses of CO2-rich fluids, which coincide with periods of crustal unloading during regional deglaciations26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Geological setting of the CO2W55 drill hole.The hole was drilled 90 m north of the Little Grand Wash Fault south of Green River, Utah22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It transected the Entrada Formation, the Carmel Formation, a small splay fault related to the Little Grand Wash fault within the Carmel Formation, and entered the Navajo Formation at a depth from surface of 200.11 m. Dissolved CO2 and salinity gradients within fluids sampled from the Navajo Formation indicate that CO2-saturated brines (shaded) migrate (wavy lines) from the fault zones along the base of the aquifers and mix with meteoric groundwaters23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Horizons with similar CO2-charged fluids were encountered in the Entrada and Carmel Formations.Full size image', 'The Carmel Formation

measurements for tortuosity and CO2 effective diffusivities in shales18,36,37,38, and are consistent with the relative high clay content of these samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that our

that there is a non-recoverable impact of mineral dissolution on rock transport properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Modelling reactive transport in the caprock', 'The mineralogical profiles record the propagation of mineralfluid reaction fronts within the caprock lithology, driven by the upward diffusion of CO2 and H2S.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modelling of the reactive transport enables examination of the key processes governing the reactive diffusion of CO2 including the timescale and the ratio of transport rates to mineral reaction rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upward advective transport by fluids must be

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#
