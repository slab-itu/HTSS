Dysferlin-mediated phosphatidylserine sorting engages macrophages in sarcolemma repair  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Failure to repair the sarcolemma leads to muscle cell death, depletion of stem cells and myopathy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, membrane lesions are instantly sealed by a repair patch consisting of lipids and proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has remained elusive how this patch is removed to restore cell membrane integrity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we examine sarcolemmal repair in live zebrafish embryos by real-time imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Macrophages remove the patch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphatidylserine (PS), an eat-me signal for macrophages, is rapidly sorted from adjacent sarcolemma to the repair patch in a Dysferlin (Dysf) dependent process in zebrafish and human cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A previously unrecognized arginine-rich motif in Dysf is crucial for PS accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It carries mutations in patients presenting with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This underscores the relevance of this sequence and uncovers a novel pathophysiological mechanism underlying this class of myopathies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data show that membrane repair is a multi-tiered process involving immediate, cell-intrinsic mechanisms as well as myofiber/macrophage interactions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Skeletal muscle cells are prone to plasma membrane lesions under physiological levels of mechanical stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prevent cell death and to avoid muscle regeneration with concomitant depletion of stem cell pools, lesions are rapidly sealed by a repair patch consisting of proteins and lipids1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transmembrane protein Dysf plays a key role in restoring cell integrity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Humans with mutations in the DYSF gene acquire limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B), Miyoshi myopathy or distal myopathy with anterior tibialis onset3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dysf binds phosphatidylserine (PS) in a Ca2+-dependent manner through its C2-domains5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mini-Dysf generated by Ca2+-dependent calpain proteases and comprising the last two C2-domains of the full length mammalian protein appears to be the isoform of Dysf active in membrane repair6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In zebrafish, deletion of the C2 domains generated an isoform that is still able to accumulate at the site of lesion7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How Dysf precisely acts in membrane repair has remained elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other players in membrane repair are annexins (AnxAs), which associate into multimeric complexes in a Ca2+-dependent manner at the lesion8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These complexes are built by homo and heteromeric interactions of AnxAs and include also Dysf and possibly other repair proteins and lipids7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distinct temporal order of proteins arrival in the repair patch suggests that a specific structure of the protein-lipid matrix is required for its function7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knock-down of Dysf or AnxA6 translation caused a malformed repair patch and double morphants even showed leakage of cytoplasmic components into the extracellular environment7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The origin of the membrane material forming the repair patch is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lysosomes as well as endosomes were suggested to contribute to membrane repair in mammalian cell systems11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, none of the tested intracellular vesicles marked by Laptm4a, Lamp1, Lamp2, Rab1a, Rab5a, Rab6a, Rab7 and Rab27a contribute significantly to repair patch formation in zebrafish myofibers7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although mechanisms like membrane shedding, exocytosis and endocytosis were discussed, a still unresolved issue is how the repair patch is removed to restore the plasma membrane2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have employed live fluorescence imaging including single-molecule based techniques to study membrane repair in muscle cells in real time in zebrafish embryos and human cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide evidence that macrophages remove the repair patch from damaged cells involving selective enrichment of PS at the lesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, Dysf mediates PS transport from adjacent sarcolemma to the repair patch through a five amino acid (AA)-motif close to its transmembrane (TM) domain, harbouring a point mutation in certain LGMD2B patients.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Lesions in the sarcolemma rapidly lead to formation of repair patches, preventing break-down of the sarcolemmal barrier and cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This repair patch has to be removed for restoration of the normal lipid bilayer structure of the sarcolemma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several mechanisms have been previously suggested for patch removal, including membrane shedding, autophagy and endocytosis11,34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show here that macrophages are key players in membrane repair by phagocytosing the repair patch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, macrophages associate with and phagocytose material from the membrane patch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, knock-down of macrophages abolishes repair patch removal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, the repair patch rapidly and selectively accumulates PS a known eat-me signal for macrophages36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PS is presented at the extracellular side of the repair patch, and thus is accessible to macrophages passing by.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, phagocytosis is delayed when PS is masked.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Repair patch removal by macrophages can occur within minutes in some instances, whereas the clog persisted for hours in other cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the repair patch does not seem to produce a long-range attractive signal pointing at the importance of local scanning by macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas small lesions were efficiently repaired, a characteristic sequence of events occurred for larger lesions: formation of a large repair patch, eventually sliding of the repair patch, secondary influx of Ca2+, contraction of the muscle cell, precipitation of AnxAs onto internal membranes, cell death and removal of dead cells by macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, neutrophils were not involved in phagocytosis of repair patches or dead cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed in all cases, however, recruitment of neutrophils to muscle injury by stabbing with a glass needle or tailfin cuts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that inflammatory signals may play additional roles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall much higher inflammatory status may explain the difference to myopathic human skeletal muscle, where neutrophils are heavily engaged37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Among the lipids tested, only PS and cholesterol accumulated rapidly at lesions, whereas enrichment of general membrane markers was not observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data underscore lipid sorting as mechanism for early repair patch assembly and suggest a key involvement of Dysf in PS-recruitment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Myofibers lacking Dysf failed to accumulate PS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-molecule tracking in Dysf morphant and control embryos showed Dysf-dependent, directed movement of PS to the site of lesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of Dysf fragments in HeLa cells and Dysf-depleted embryos causes PS enrichment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, Dysf sorts PS to the repair patch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains to be uncovered whether cholesterol sorting employs the same mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We noted other lipids, even though not as fast as PS and cholesterol, to accumulate gradually over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, PI(3,4)P2 starts to build up in a delayed manner 45 min post lesioning (Supplementary Fig 7e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This likely reflects membrane flowing in from the edges and providing lipid material to eventually seal the sarcolemmal hole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, systemic exocytosis may be involved expanding the membrane surface of a cell in response to membrane lesions2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Binding of PS is mediated by the C2A-domains of Dysf (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that the arginine-rich motif identified here plays an important additional role in PS transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arginine-rich peptides are known to bind PS (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, PS may thus directly interact with the Dysf arginine-rich motif.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mutation of the arginine-rich motif affects localization of Dysf reporters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They appear to be located in the cytoplasm of uninjured myofibers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that Dysf has to be localized correctly to the sarcolemma to allow PS accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our single-molecule tracking data reveal that Dysf moves in the plane of the sarcolemma or immediately adjacent and parallel to it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A potential source of Dysf and PS might be caveolae which unfold on membrane stress and thus rapidly increase membrane surface39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did, however, not observe enrichment of general membrane markers at the lesion excluding overall flux of membrane material towards the lesion as mechanism of PS transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanism how Dysf and PS are transported towards the lesion remains elusive and needs further investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another key question is how PS is incorporated in the repair patch so that it is exposed to the extracellular space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High local Ca2+ concentrations may inactivate flippases at the lesion as previously proposed in a different context40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Zebrafish and human DYSF both contain arginine-rich motifs N-terminally of the TM domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  hWRRFR-TM-C accumulated at the membrane patch and rescued PS accumulation in injured zebrafish myofibers, suggesting that these particular functions of Dysf have been conserved during evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This claim is supported by complementary approaches expressing the zebrafish Dysf reporter in HeLa cells; zfWRRFK-TM-C accumulated and mediated enrichment of PS at the site of lesion in human cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'LGMD2B/MM is correlated with a mutation in the arginine-rich motif (R2042C) in human patients33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance, modelling this mutation in both zebrafish and human DYSF fragments revealed significantly lower accumulation at membrane lesions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A disease causing effect of this mutation in humans is thus in complete agreement with our data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these human genetic data underscore the physiological significance of the mechanism underlying membrane repair that we uncovered.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
