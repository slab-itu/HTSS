A novel Fanconi anaemia subtype associated with a dominant-negative mutation in RAD51  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Fanconi anaemia (FA) is a hereditary disease featuring hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linker-induced chromosomal instability in association with developmental abnormalities, bone marrow failure and a strong predisposition to cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 17 FA disease genes have been reported, all of which act in a recessive mode of inheritance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report on a de novo g.41022153G greater than A; p.Ala293Thr (NM_002875) missense mutation in one allele of the homologous recombination DNA repair gene RAD51 in an FA-like patient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This heterozygous mutation causes a novel FA subtype, FA-R, which appears to be the first subtype of FA caused by a dominant-negative mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The patient, who features microcephaly and mental retardation, has reached adulthood without the typical bone marrow failure and paediatric cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with the recent reports on RAD51-associated congenital mirror movement disorders, our results point to an important role for RAD51-mediated homologous recombination in neurodevelopment, in addition to DNA repair and cancer susceptibility.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Fanconi anaemia (FA) is a rare recessive genetically heterogeneous chromosomal instability disorder with both autosomal and X-linked inheritance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All reported cases so far displayed a recessive mode of inheritance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FA is characterized by multiple congenital abnormalities, haematological defects and a high predisposition to a diversity of cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  including childhood acute myeloid leukaemia and head and neck cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patient-derived cells are extremely sensitive to DNA interstrand cross-linking agents, such as mitomycin C (MMC) or diepoxybutane (DEB)1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Standard FA diagnosis therefore involves the determination of chromosomal breaks and radial formation after exposure to DEB or MMC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'FA is a well-known example of how the study of a rare genetic disease can reveal novel molecular pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FA proteins were found to act together in a distinct genome maintenance pathway referred to as the FA/BRCA pathway, which is involved in the repair of DNADNA cross-links as well as DNA double-strand breaks2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Central in the pathway is the monoubiquitination of the FA proteins FANCD2 and FANCI, which is carried out by a multi-protein complex consisting of FANCA, -B, -C, -E, -F, -G, -L and -M. The FA proteins FANCD1 (BRCA2), -J (BRIP1), -N (PALB2), -O (RAD51C), -P (SLX4) and -Q (XPF) all act downstream of this monoubiquitination step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, also biallelic BRCA1 mutations have been described to cause a FA-like syndrome (FA-S)4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Loss of the DNA repair function is thought to underlie the cancer predisposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FA/BRCA pathway research focused mainly on the different steps in DNA repair through homologous recombination (HR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pathway is essential for accurate repair of double-strand breaks in mammalian cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The key step in HR is homologous strand exchange mediated by the RAD51 protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RAD51 binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent manner to form a nucleoprotein filament able to invade duplex DNA and search for homology; RAD51 directly interacts with the FA protein BRCA2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, RAD51 has not been identified as a FA protein so far.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, despite the extensive work to elucidate the function of FA proteins in response to DNA interstrand cross-link damage, the mechanism by which the FA/BRCA pathway responds to this genotoxic insult is not fully understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we describe an atypical adult male FA patient who had been excluded from all known FA subtypes by standard FA diagnostic DNA mutation analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This patient does not display the typical FA-related bone marrow failure and cancer, but features mental retardation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We sequenced the whole genomes of the patient, a healthy sister and the parents, and identified a de novo mutation in the RAD51 gene of the patient as the disease-causing mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteomics experiments indicate that both the mutant and wild-type RAD51 are expressed in the patient-derived cells, suggesting a dominant-negative mode of action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with this, mutant RAD51 acts as a dominant negative in an inducible cell model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro, the mutation affected crucial steps in HR: formation of a joint molecule between a processed DNA break and the repair template, ATP hydrolysis, DNA binding and filament formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, mutant RAD51 can interfere with binding of wild-type RAD51 to DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, the data indicate that the heterozygous RAD51 mutation causes a novel FA subtype, FA-R, which appears to be the first subtype of FA caused by a dominant-negative mutation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Clinical and cellular phenotype of the FA-like patient', 'The FA-like individual presented at 2.5 years of age with growth retardation, microcephaly, hydrocephalus, skeletal (thumb and radius) abnormalities, imperforate anus and an improperly formed left testicle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A positive DNA cross-linker (DEB)-induced chromosomal breakage test confirmed the suspicion of FA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The patient has now reached adulthood (23 years) lacking the typical FA features such as bone marrow failure and malignancies5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Somewhat atypical for FA was his strong learning disability associated with an intelligence quotient test score of about 70.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cellular tests using blood lymphocytes and SV40-transformed fibroblast cell lines established at age 5 years, confirmed the hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linkers (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following treatment with MMC, immortalized fibroblasts from the patient showed an excessive accumulation in the late SG2 phase of the cell cycle (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using growth inhibition as an end point, patient-derived cell lines were hypersensitive not only to MMC, but also to camptothecin (CPT) and the poly-(adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, KU58948 (Fig 1df), suggesting that the cells are impaired in DNA repair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are consistent with a defect in the downstream branch of the FA/BRCA pathway, as western blot analysis demonstrated a normal level of FANCD2 monoubiquitination in the individuals lymphoblastoid and fibroblastoid cell lines (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: FA-characteristic cellular phenotypes of cells from the proband.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Number of cells (stimulated primary lymphocytes) with chromosomal breaks after addition of 150 and 300 nM MMC, from the proband (VU697) and his healthy sister (VU730); P value=0.0001 (2-test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Spontaneous and MMC-induced chromosomal breakage in SV40-transformed fibroblasts from a healthy individual (LN9SV), a FANCA-deficient individual (GM6914), and the proband (VU697F_SV40); P value=0.005 (2-test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Cell cycle distribution of SV40-transformed fibroblasts from a healthy individual (LN9SV) and from the proband without and with treatment of 50 or 100 nM MMC for 72 h.

mutation(s), we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS)6 on DNA from the proband, his parents and his unaffected sister.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relationship estimation7 based on the parents genomes confirmed paternity and excluded consanguinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we sequenced the exome from the patient to confirm variants identified by WGS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As recessive inheritance is typical for FA, we explored this possibility by examining genes harbouring either homozygous or compound heterozygous potentially disease-causing mutations (Fig 2a; arrow 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The candidate mutations had the following characteristics: very rare (minor allele frequency  less_than 0.01) and scoring positive in at least two out of four pathogenicity-prediction programs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using data from the healthy sister as a negative control, this filtering approach resulted in only one candidate gene: PRR12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested this candidate gene with a prioritization approach tailored for the FA/BRCA pathway8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This tool considers the entire proteome exploiting the basic FA protein properties, proteinprotein interactions (Molecular Interactions workflow of EnVision 2), protein function prediction (FuncNet) and literature mining (Nermal).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this analysis, PRR12 scored only 1 point, while proteins from the top 150 had scores ranging from 8.500 (position 1) to 6.224 (position 150).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In keeping with this, short interfering RNA knockdown experiments did not result in an FA-like phenotype8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, the causal genetic defect underlying the FA-like phenotype in the current patient does not seem to be associated with a recessive mode of inheritance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Genetic

RAD51', 'Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that a de novo mutation in one of the alleles might cause the disease through a dominant-negative mechanism (Fig 2a; arrow 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seven variants in five genes were detected of which two (one in RAD51 and the other in DCHS2) were validated by Sanger sequencing and predicted as possibly damaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then considered three factors for prioritizing these two genes: (i) an apparently relevant gene function, such as DNA interaction/repair, (ii) protein interactions with known FA proteins and (iii) FA protein-like properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering these criteria, RAD51 turned out to be the prime candidate since RAD51 mediates DNA strand exchange, the key step in HR repair9, binds the FA proteins BRCA2 and PALB2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10) and has a high score (ranking 65, scoring 6.377) with the FA-ranking tool8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RAD51 is a member of the RAD51 family of related genes, of which RAD51C had already been recognized as an FA gene11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We furthermore confirmed the RAD51 variant as the top candidate with two independent variant filtering workflows: ingenuity variant analysis and the family genomics workflow12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Stable expression of mutant RAD51 protein', 'The identified RAD51 mutation, g.41022153G greater than A (hg19, chr15; Fig 2b, left panel), is a novel mutation, not previously observed in human DNA, as determined by interrogating the publicly accessible variant databases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutation affects an amino acid (aa) at a highly conserved position, and results in a substitution, p.Ala293Thr (NM_002875), that is predicted to be damaging by three different tools (see Supplementary Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variant was also found in the exome data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent Sanger sequencing was consistent with the WGS and exome data for the patient and family members (Fig 2b, right panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the mutation was also identified in complementary DNA (c.877G greater than A) obtained from proband-derived lymphoblasts and from skin fibroblasts (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter finding excludes the possibility that the mutation was acquired during lymphoblast cell culturing and demonstrates that the mutant allele could be stably expressed at the messenger RNA level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent interrogation of RAD51 protein expression by western blot analysis indicated that patient-derived cells expressed similar levels of total RAD51 as control cells, suggesting that both wild-type and mutant alleles are indeed expressed (Fig 2d; Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, with mass spectrometry we confirmed the presence of RAD51A293T mutant at the protein level in the patient-derived fibroblast cell line (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mutant RAD51 sensitizes to DNA-damaging agents', 'It is striking that exactly the same substitution of the yeast orthologous aa residue (p.Ala351Thr) of RAD51 has been demonstrated to yield a semi-dominant-negative phenotype13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus hypothesized that the human counterpart would have a similar effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this, we generated a fibroblast cell line with inducible expression of the human mutant RAD51, and a cell line with the wild-type gene as control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of the RAD51 mutant gave rise to elevated spontaneous and MMC-induced chromosomal breaks, when compared with the same cell line that overexpressed the wild-type protein (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the induced expression of the variant allele sensitized the cells to killing by the cross-linking agents MMC (Fig 3b,c) and CPT (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although total levels of RAD51 are clearly higher in the induced cell lines, expression of the induced wild-type and mutant RAD51 proteins was in the same range, excluding the possibility that the observed negative effects on cell growth could be attributed to higher expression levels of the mutant protein (Fig 3e; Supplementary Fig 4)14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the data support the notion that the mutant protein is not destabilized by the mutation (see Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Functional assessment of the RAD51 mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Analysis of inducible cell model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

causality of the RAD51 mutation, we generated spontaneous MMC-resistant revertants of the patient-derived fibroblastoid cell line via expanding the cells at a relatively mild selective pressure of 12.5 nM MMC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of 58 isolated clones, in 7 (12%) only the wild-type RAD51 allele could be detected via DNA sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To discriminate between loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and back mutation as the underlying mechanism, we also sequenced the neighbouring genes of RAD51, CASC5 and DNAJ17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data indicated that LOH had occurred with retention of the wild-type RAD51 allele (Fig 3f, left panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, no clones were observed with only the mutant allele.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed direction of LOH under selective pressure reinforces the notion that the RAD51 mutation is indeed causal for the FA-like cellular features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the other potential deleterious mutation, at the DCHS2 locus, was retained in the revertant clones, excluding this candidate gene as causal for the FA cellular phenotype (Fig 3f, right panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus based on the combined data, the RAD51 defect is underlying the DNA repair phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Subcellular localization of RAD51 not affected', 'To determine whether the observed defect in DNA repair could be caused by mislocalization of RAD51 in the mutant cells, we performed subcellular fractionation experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not observe significant differences in RAD51 subcellular localization between wild-type and patient cells (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we were able to detect RAD51 foci upon challenge with DNA-damage-inducing agents MMC and hydroxyurea (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, this suggests that in the presence of both the wild-type and the mutant allele, some residual activity of RAD51 is retained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in line with the observed embryonic lethality associated with Rad51 knockout in mice15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'RAD51A293T impairs D-loop formation', 'To determine the molecular mechanism underlying the DNA repair defect observed in cells

processed DNA break and the repair template.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A biochemical assay reporting on these activities is D-loop formation, which measures homology-dependent joint molecule formation between a single-strand oligonucleotide and a supercoiled plasmid17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The p.Ala293Thr mutation in RAD51 reduced the formation of D-loop intermediates by ninefold (Fig 4a, right panel).

activity and DNA binding by RAD51A293T', 'To uncover the stage of HR that is negatively impacted by the p.Ala293Thr mutation, we tested several functions of RAD51 related to its role in HR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested whether the mutation affected the ATPase activity of RAD51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As previously reported, wild-type RAD51 displayed a low constitutive ATPase activity that is stimulated approximately twofold by ssDNA (Fig 4b)18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, RAD51A293T had a somewhat lower baseline ATPase activity that could not be stimulated by DNA (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of DNA-stimulated ATPase activity of the mutant protein suggests a lower affinity for binding to DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To directly test this possibility, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiments using both double-stranded and ssDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Double-strand DNA-binding affinity of wild-type RAD51 and RAD51A293T was tested under identical conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA binding by wild-type RAD51 resulted in a discrete band in the EMSA (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification revealed that half of the DNA was bound at 0.3 M and binding was saturated at 0.8 M RAD51 (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, RAD51A293T did not produce a discrete band.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead a slight smear was detected, just above the unbound double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), but only at protein concentrations an order of magnitude higher than needed for efficient DNA binding by wild-type RAD51 (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When ssDNA was used, wild-type RAD51 binding was saturated at a concentration of 0.4 M (Fig 4e), while it took a 10-fold higher concentration for RAD51A293T to shift all of the DNA probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, DNA binding by RAD51A293T resulted in a qualitatively different proteinDNA complex with faster mobility than that formed between wild-type RAD51 and ssDNA (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that the p.Ala293Thr

nucleoprotein filaments from which several structural aspects could be reliably quantified (Fig 4f, iv).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Filaments formed with wild-type protein look much the same in the lower- and higher-salt conditions (Fig 4f, compare i with iii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to wild-type RAD51, the RAD51A293T nucleoprotein filaments contain apparent gaps in protein coverage and irregular protein arrangement especially evident at the ends (Fig 4f, iv).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differences in architecture were quantified by measuring the length and the height of the filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding of RAD51 to dsDNA changes the helical pitch such that the DNA molecule extends to 1.5-fold its B-form length22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If filament formation is not complete, DNA will be less extended and the filaments shorter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wild-type RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments on the 3.9-kb DNA were 2,025±67 nm long, while filaments formed on the same-length DNA with RAD51A293T were 1,752±105 nm long.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Discontinuities in the filament are detected in SFM images as a reduction in height from the average of 2.2±0.4 nm to less than 1 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On this

discontinuities were frequent if filaments were formed with the RAD51A293T protein; on average 17.4 locations below 1 nm observed per filament (n=25 filaments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The appearance of the filaments in SFM, their decreased length and more frequent discontinuities, indicate that although RAD51A293T can form filaments on DNA, they are less stable and possibly defective specifically in

RAD51 affected the ratio of different proteinDNA complexes detected in the EMSA (Fig 4g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a concentration of 0.4 M wild-type RAD51, both proteinDNA complexes and unbound DNA were detected (Fig 4g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a ratio of 1:8 mutant to wild-type protein, overall DNA binding increased slightly (Fig 4h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is consistent with RAD51A293T being incorporated in the nucleoprotein filament formed by wild-type RAD51, as it does not bind DNA by itself at that concentration (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a 1:4 ratio, the relative amount of the fully shifted discrete band started to decrease, while proteinDNA complexes causing an intermediate shift were increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a 1:1 ratio, which still represents a protein concentration (0.4 M) at which the RAD51A293T protein by itself did not bind DNA, most of the shifted DNA detected had an intermediate mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, under those conditions all unbound DNA had disappeared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that at a concentration of 0.8 M wild-type RAD51 all DNA is present in a fully shifted discrete band, the disappearance of the fully shifted discrete band and the unbound DNA with the concomitant appearance of DNA with intermediate mobility suggests that mixed complexes containing both wild-type and mutant RAD51 form on DNA and these proteinDNA complexes are less stable than those containing only wild-type RAD51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that the presence of the RAD51A293T protein quantitatively and qualitatively affects DNA binding by wild-type RAD51 supporting a dominant-negative effect of the mutant protein on the wild-type function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The RAD51-ATP-DNA filament catalyses the central DNA strand-exchange step of HR DNA repair by coordinated dynamic changes at multiple RAD51 interfaces (proteinprotein, proteinATP and proteinDNA; see also Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In principle, even small changes at any of these dynamic interfaces could disturb function in a dominant manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our genetic and biochemical characterization now demonstrates that such mutations do exist in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure

addition the L1 and L2 important for DNA binding are shown, as well as the Walker A and Walker B regions, which have been implicated in nucleotide binding; the mutation is directly next to the L2 loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Crystal structures of Methanococcus voltae RADA (MvRadA, archaeal RAD51 homologue) have been solved in complex with the ATP mimic AMPPNP52 (PDB 2F1H) and with ADP53 (PDB 3FYH), providing the greatest structural insight into functionally relevant RAD51 forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AMPPNPa non-hydrolysable ATP analoguebound RAD51 dimer is shown in surface representation with each RAD51 monomer coloured differently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shows that the motif surrounding the probands mutation (magenta) is at the dimer interface (top).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The equivalent residue to Ala293 in MvRadA is a glycine (red), although the surrounding motif is highly conserved (inset sequence alignment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Close-up views of the nucleotide-bound states of MvRadA (right) show that when bound to AMPPNPa high-affinity ssDNA-binding statethe motif that contains the probands mutation forms a small alpha-helix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This helix interacts with the bound nucleotide and the Walker A box (green).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The region also neighbours the L2 loops that bind to ssDNA (spheres at the end of the L2 loops show regions of disorder in the crystal).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, when bound to ADPa low ssDNA-binding statethe probands mutation motif has shifted position away from the nucleotide and Walker A box, and transitioned from an alpha-helix to a partially disordered loop with additional disorder seen in the L2 loops compared with the AMPPNP state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The position of the mutation in the protein supports the notion that mutation affects RAD51 protein dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Cartoon showing the different effects of changes of RAD51 on clinical phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A dominant-negative mutation can give rise to an FA-like disorder, haploinsufficiency (that is, lower levels) of RAD51 can give rise to a neurological disorder, while aberrant RAD51 expression levels in tumours have been associated with therapy response.Full size image', 'RAD51 protein and human diseases', 'The p.Ala293Thr mutation is located in a highly conserved region of RAD51, which is involved in RAD51 monomermonomer interactions24,25 (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutated aa is directly adjacent to the highly conserved so-called L2 loop, which is involved in DNA binding26 (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proteininteraction interface displays different conformations associated with ATP- or ADP-binding status (Fig 5b right panel), which gives rise to high-affinity or low-affinity ssDNA binding, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The region harbouring the mutation is thus implicated in RAD51 protein dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data point to a crucial aa in this region whose alteration results in disturbed dynamic interactions evident as less stable DNA binding, loss of DNA-binding coordinated ATPase and disrupted filament structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of the wild-type protein, apparently some function is retained, which may explain the viability of the FA-like patient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study thus links a RAD51 mutation to a novel clinical phenotype, that is, an FA-like disorder, which implies that the gene name FANCR may be added as a synonym to the official gene symbol, RAD51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different types of mutations in human RAD51 are thus associated with different clinical phenotypes (see Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A dominant-negative mutation gives rise to an FA-like phenotype, whereas haploinsufficiency of RAD51 has been associated with congenital mirror movement disorder27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the FA-like patient has not displayed mirror movements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far, no hereditary disorders have been linked to overexpression of

attention to the potentially clinically relevant finding that cells displaying RAD51 foci may still harbor subtle dominant mutations in RAD51, and could be sensitive to drugs, such as PARP inhibitors.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Until now FA research has primarily focused on malignancies and bone marrow failure, which constitute the prime life-threatening symptoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, not all FA patients acquire bone marrow failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, this phenotype has not been associated with patients affected by biallelic mutations in BRCA2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29) and RAD51C11 who, together with the proband of the current study, seem to compose a distinct subtype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly also the recently described cases of biallelic carriers of BRCA1 mutations4,30, had reached adulthood without bone marrow failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead these two individuals developed breast and serous ovarian cancer as adults, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It could be hypothesized that individuals with a de novo RAD51 mutation also have an increased susceptibility for cancer as adults and thus careful surveillance is warranted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition, our study highlights the association of mental retardation/aberrant neurological functioning as a clinical feature linked to RAD51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In early reviews, a link between FA and mental retardation/central nervous system has been established, albeit at a low frequency31,32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also the two cases with biallelic BRCA1 mutations were found to be associated with developmental delay, while for one of the patients, mental retardation was mentioned explicitly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it could be hypothesized that absence of paediatric bone marrow failure, but presence of mental retardation/brain disorders is preferentially associated with individuals with defects in proteins of the downstream branch of the FA pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, FA cells are also exquisitely sensitive towards acetaldehyde, a metabolite of ethanol linked to fetal alcohol syndrome, which is an important cause of learning disability34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Thus our study seems to warrant further exploration on the role of the FA/BRCA pathway in the (developing) brain and how this pathway may counteract toxic insults, such as exogenous ethanol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, our data emphasize that dominant mutations can be responsible for diseases usually thought of as (autosomal) recessive and that genome-wide sequence data of family members combined with mechanistic studies may be necessary to pinpoint the responsible gene.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
