The origin of carbon isotope vital effects in coccolith calcite  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Calcite microfossils are widely used to study climate and oceanography in Earths geological past.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coccoliths, readily preserved calcite plates produced by a group of single-celled surface-ocean dwelling algae called coccolithophores, have formed a significant fraction of marine sediments since the Late Triassic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, unlike the shells of foraminifera, their zooplankton counterparts, coccoliths remain underused in palaeo-reconstructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Precipitated in an intracellular chemical and isotopic microenvironment, coccolith calcite exhibits large and enigmatic departures from the isotopic composition of abiogenic calcite, known as vital effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that the calcification to carbon fixation ratio determines whether coccolith calcite is isotopically heavier or lighter than abiogenic calcite, and that the size of the deviation is determined by the degree of carbon utilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discuss the theoretical potential for, and current limitations of, coccolith-based CO2 paleobarometry, that may eventually facilitate use of the ubiquitous and geologically extensive sedimentary archive.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The taxonomic delimitation of coccoliths into the isotopically light and heavy groups, where the calcite is respectively depleted and enriched in the heavy isotope of carbon compared with abiogenic calcite, is well established1,2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there have been relatively few studies of carbon isotopes in coccolith calcite6, and fewer still where experiments have been carried out in vivo under closely monitored conditions6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although so-called vital effects are known to vary with growth rate4, and CO2 availability7, the reasons for these isotopic departures from equilibrium remain poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relatively sparse evidence from experimental, cruise, sediment trap10 and down-core1,2,3,11 studies show that members of the light group such as Coccolithus pelagicus and Calcidiscus leptoporus, tend to be large, heavily calcifying, and have a relatively slow division rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrastingly, members of the heavy group such as Emiliania huxleyi are generally small, lightly calcifying and with a rapid division rate4,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The co-variance of parameters across species means that their influence upon coccolith calcite vital effects cannot be decoupled without an explicit mechanistic understanding and a quantitative model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In coccolithophores, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) exists in mutually exchanging intracellular reservoirs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intracellular process responsible for the largest isotopic fractionation in these organisms is the conversion of inorganic carbon dioxide (CO2) to organic matter (carbon fixation), which has isotopic implications for carbon pools elsewhere within the cell, including, in coccolithophores, the site of calcification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rate-limiting step of carbon fixation, catalysed by the enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) proceeds far more rapidly for CO2 containing the light isotope of carbon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Organic matter is therefore significantly depleted in the heavy isotope of carbon relative to the CO2 source12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the kinetic isotopic discrimination effective at the enzymatic level , the overall carbon isotopic offset between the extracellular carbon substrate and the organic matter , is a function of a number of parameters that affect the isotopic composition of CO2 immediately in the vicinity of the RuBisCO enzyme15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These parameters include growth rate (), cell radius (r) and ambient CO2 concentration (CO2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far, experiments and models attempting to understand these processes have dominantly focused on relating  to CO2 in phytoplankton (Table 1)16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26, and the empirically established relationships have been extensively applied to ancient sediments to generate reconstructions of pCO2atm (refs 27, 28, 29, 30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantitatively explain the origin of carbon isotopic vital effects in coccolith calcite, a holistic understanding of carbon isotopes within a coccolithophore cell is required, which considers the bidirectional isotopic effect of intracellular calcification and carbon fixation, and is consistent with the available biological evidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Assumptions and conclusions of significant recent works modelling carbon fluxes in single-celled phytoplankton.Full size table', 'To understand the origin of vital effects in coccolith calcite, we derived a cellular model of carbon isotopic fluxes, whose mechanistic underpinning is based on a consideration of the available literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model presented here is calibrated with new data from in vivo experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the so-called isotopically heavy and light group coccoliths, characterized by respectively positive and negative vital effects, are produced by coccolithophores with respectively low and high calcification to photosynthesis ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vital effects are dominantly the result of competing Rayleigh-type fractionation processes and fluxes between intracellular compartments that alter the isotopic composition of carbon at the site of calcification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the equilibrium limit, and in non-calcifying cells, our model collapses to consistency with the classic literature describing carbon isotopes in phytoplankton16,17,18,21,23,24,25,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our conclusions are compatible with observed trends in oxygen isotopes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, we discuss the potential for coccolith-based CO2 paleobarometry.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Model description', 'We model the coccolithophore cell as consisting of three physical compartments: a chloroplast (where carbon fixation occurs) and a coccolith vesicle (a golgi-body derived compartment where calcification occurs) each contained within a third compartment, the cytosol (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carbon within each compartment exists as CO2,  and .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As  is assumed to be the substrate for calcification (justified at the rates considered here), and as membranes are assumed to be impermeable to , this latter species does not feature in flux balance equations at steady state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dynamics of the system are described entirely by CO2 and .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In every compartment, CO2 and  are constantly being interconverted (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compartmental shapes and sizes relative to the cell are approximated from transition electron microscopy and assumed isomorphic across all strains and experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values for the H+ concentration in each compartment are taken from Anning et al.33 The uncatalysed reacto-diffusive supply rate of CO2 alone to the surface of algal cells larger than a few microns is not high enough to account for the observed rates of photosynthesis, given the low catalytic turnover and poor substrate affinity of RuBisCO14,34,35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transmembrane passive diffusive supply of CO2 is therefore supplemented by bicarbonate (;

it is independent of the cell membrane potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with recent experimental evidence42, transport proteins are assumed to be upregulated when cellular carbon utilization increases, which increases the density of transport proteins in the membrane, and effectively increases the bidirectional permeability of any given membrane to .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The model uses a flexible description of cross-membrane  transport that can account forbut does not prescribefacilitation by cotransporter proteins41,42 (including counter-gradient transport) and upregulation of transport protein density in response to CO2 limitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the results of Bach et al.42, who showed that the transcript abundance of a putative  transport protein increases at low DIC concentration, we here assume the effective membrane permeability to  to be a linear function of utilization (Supplementary Fig 2), which we define as the ratio of carbon use to passive diffusive supply of CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Effective membrane permeability to  includes two constants; a background value, and the utilization coefficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of these constants is explicitly allowed to be zerothat is, representing zero background contribution of  to carbon supply, and no upregulation at high utilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As  transport can be coupled to Na+ symport or Cl antiport via different cotransporter proteins in the SLC4 family, the transmembrane transport of  is potentially dependent on the concentrations of these cotransported species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By describing the flux as a product of mass action (featuring the transport protein, , and any cotransported ion species), we can capture this dependency with an asymmetric  permeability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For simplicity, in the case of cotransporter-facilitated transport, we assume that electroneutral Na+-coupled symport dominates  transport, driven by the large extra-cellular to intra-cellular gradient of Na+, and that intracellular transmembrane gradients of Na+ are small.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the electroneutrality of this process, and thus its independence from the membrane potential, is an assumption, because some Na+-coupled SLC4 transporters are known to have Na+: stoichiometries other than 1:1, and these transporters have not yet been physiologically characterized in coccolithophores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We include a third constant representing the effective extra-cellular to intra-cellular concentration ratio of the cotransported ion species, which allows for, but does not prescribe, up-gradient bicarbonate transport across the cell membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whilst being able to account for  usage as described, the model can fall back completely to passive diffusion of CO2 if warranted by observations used to constrain the universal constants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Through isotopic discrimination at the enzymatic level, carbon fixation in the chloroplast preferentially removes the light isotope of carbon from the CO2 pool, which itself is isotopically lighter than the  pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These effects combine to drive both chloroplast carbon pools towards isotopically heavy values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calcification in the coccolith vesicle meanwhile preferentially removes the heavy isotope of carbon from the  pool in the coccolith vesicle, which itself is isotopically heavier than the CO2 pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus calcification drives the coccolith vesicle pool towards light values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this carbon isotope flux model, steady state is assumed whereby fluxes in and out of any given pool sum to zero, but DIC species within all compartments are allowed to be in chemical and isotopic disequilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extent of disequilibrium is a function of the rates of calcification and carbon fixation relative to those of supply and interconversion of DIC species in a given compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carbonate system reactions in any given system are quantifiable functions of DIC-species-specific concentrations, H+ concentration (pH), and the concentration of carbonic anhydrase (CA), the metalloenzyme responsible for catalysing the otherwise sluggish interconversion of CO2 and  (refs 44, 45, 46) (see Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Modelling and experimental results', 'The model is driven with empirical data for cell size (r), division rate (), the calcification to net carbon fixation ratio (reflected in the particulate inorganic carbon to particulate organic carbon ratio;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Carbon isotopic compositions of coccolith calcite, and of organic matter, can be fully explained via competing Rayleigh-type fractionation processes within the compartmentalised cell (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recently observed vanishing coccolith vital effect at high CO27,9 naturally emerges as a result of the model, as Rayleigh-type fractionation is at a minimum when the rate of supply of carbon far exceeds usage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'There is an evolving consensus that  forms a larger proportion of the carbon entering the cell at low CO226,47,48, a conclusion supported by a transcriptional upregulation of a putative  cotransporter protein at low DIC42, and directly measured CO2 and  uptake rates in E. huxleyi8,37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental and molecular evidence suggests that in coccolithophores, the transmembrane supply of  is facilitated by transporters belonging to the solute carrier 4 (SLC4) family of cotransporter proteins40,49,50,51, which facilitate Cl/ antiport, or Na+/ symport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inside the cell, we assume that the transmembrane concentration gradients of Cl and Na+ ions are negligible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this scenario, transmembrane  fluxes are proportional to the  concentration on the proximal side of the membrane; the concentrations of cotransported ion species are incorporated in the effective permeability to .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at the cell membrane, we allow the extra-cellular to intra-cellular concentration ratio of the cotransported ion species to vary, thus allowing up-gradient movement of .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the concentrations of both Cl and Na+ likely being higher outside the cell than in the cytosol, we assume that symporting proteins dominate  transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Other mechanisms for  transport have been proposed which have implications for the isotopic composition of coccolith calcite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been suggested that negative carbon isotopic vital effects in coccolith calcite are due to an increased pumping of  into the chloroplast at low CO2, at the expense of moving  to the coccolith vesicle with no diffusive efflux of  from any compartment, leaving the cytosolic pool, and thus the coccolith vesicle, isotopically light in carbon2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are aware of no molecular evidence to date of putative primary active transport proteins associated with bicarbonate transport in this group of organisms however.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, prohibiting  efflux from any cellular compartment has significant implications for the isotopic composition of intracellular carbon pools, and imposes an artificially high importance on the ratio of inward fluxes of  to CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although effective membrane permeabilities to CO2 or  have not been measured directly in coccolithophores, the values constrained by our model (permeability to CO2=9.3 × 104 ms1, and to  being 34 orders of magnitude lower) are consistent with those calculated for the closely related group, the diatoms46 (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In some unicellular algae, CA is emitted from the cell to accelerate sluggish kinetics of  dehydration in the boundary layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite reports that E. huxleyi lacks external CA (CAe)37, more recent work argues for the presence52 and possibly upregulation of CAe at low CO241,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CAe was not however detected in either Gephyrocapsa oceanica nor C. pelagicus, even when cells were carbon limited49, though more research on species other than E. huxleyi is required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we assume that CAe is present in high enough concentrations that the external surface of the cell is in chemical and isotopic equilibrium with the bulk seawater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If future work concludes that CAe is absent in one or more species, it may be necessary to allow chemical and isotopic disequilibrium in the cellular boundary layer (for implications of this scenario see Supplementary Fig 4 and Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The model described here does not separately represent the pyrenoid: a compartment of low pH nested within the relatively alkaline chloroplast where CO2 and RuBisCO are thought to be highly concentrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The value of the effective modelled isotopic discrimination factor for RuBisCO, describing the difference between the isotopic compositon of CO2 in the chloroplast and that of organic matter (fe), is therefore effectively a pyrenoid/RuBisCO black-box fractionation for the given set-up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extent to which fe is representative of the enzymatic RuBisCO fractionation, , is a critical question regarding the validity of using in vitro measured values of  in models that do not have a detailed representation of the pyrenoid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The introduction of an additional CO2permeable membrane between the ambient medium and the site of carbon fixation, may allow a further isotopic discrimination to take place by the preferential uptake of CO2 over , which would allow the value of  to be even smaller than the value of fe predicted by our modelthus providing an explanation when there is a discrepancy between low values of  and high values of .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, conversely, if compartmental utilization of the pyrenoid were very high,  may be far higher than the value of fe predicted by the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although isotopic fractionation by RuBisCO has been extensively studied in plants, only two studies to date have estimated the in vitro isotopic fractionation of carbon associated with carbon fixation catalysed by the type of RuBisCO (form ID) found in the red-lineage algae such as the coccolithophores and the diatoms39,53, and these values are surprisingly low (11 and 19 respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this, recent modelling work has continued to use the markedly larger fractionation factors associated with plants and cyanobacteria (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fitted value for fe output by our model is 1415.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The calcite saturation state in the coccolith vesicle (calcite) is controlled by  and Ca2+, and by the solubility product of calcite in seawater (Ksp), which is a function of salinity, temperature and pressure44,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At most CO2 concentrations, the model suggests that the coccolith vesicle is oversaturated with respect to calcite (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at CO2 concentrations below around 30 M, the model predicts that calcite falls below unity, which would usually render calcite thermodynamically unstable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of possibilities may individually, or in combination, lead to a precipitation-promoting calcite inside the CV at this lower CO2 range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, measuring pH in an intracellular compartment is difficult, and is fraught with uncertainties, so the pH in the coccolith vesicle may be significantly higher than the previously measured value of 7.1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33), increasing the fraction of DIC present in the form .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second,  transport to the coccolith vesicle may be enhanced at low CO2 this could be an upregulation of transport proteins42 specific to the coccolith vesicle membrane, or, as suggested elsewhere, an energy-driven net Ca2+/ co-transport mechanism48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, the solubility product (Ksp) of calcite is two orders of magnitude higher (that is, calcite is lower and calcite precipitation is less likely to occur) in water with a salinity typical of seawater compared with distilled water54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the salinity of the CV is likely to be close to that of seawater due to the osmotic pressure that is

bonds to Ca2+ ions in solution, acidic polysaccharides, which are known to be present in the CV, and throughout the coccolith calcite lattice, strongly influence calcification, and may cause the

across an order of magnitude (0.54 mM)47,57,58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The localized calcite precipitation-inducing effect on carbonate chemistry may even allow coccoliths to be built in a mostly calcite under-saturated vesicle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Little work has been undertaken to understand the localized influences of polysaccharides on carbonate chemistry however.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Under the

dehydration of CO2 and  respectively are not known, and theoretical predictions vary widely60,61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, this model cannot currently be fully resolved with respect to oxygen isotopes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional complexity over carbon isotopes arises with oxygen because oxygen in DIC exchanges with oxygen in water, which even at high DIC concentrations is many orders of magnitude more abundant44,62,63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rate of oxygen exchange with water and the residence time of DIC species in a compartment is therefore critical to the preservation of vital effects in calcite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As coccolith calcite exhibits vital effects in oxygen, the cell cannot be in complete isotopic equilibrium with respect to oxygen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Across coccolithophores, a positive correlation is seen between the carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of calcite (Supplementary Fig 6a)9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, although  is isotopically heavier than CO2 in carbon, it is lighter than CO2 in oxygen, so the observed trends in carbon and oxygen isotopes cannot be simultaneously explained solely by a shift in cellular carbon source from dominantly  to CO2 or vice versa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that the increased difference in oxygen isotopic vital effects between large and small cells observed at at low CO22,3,4,5,9 is due to a difference in the oxygen isotopic composition of DIC entering the cell following the increased influx of bicarbonate at high utilization (Supplementary Fig 6b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further hypothesize that this signal may be superimposed on a Rayleigh-type fractionation, which drives the combined / pool in the coccolith vesicle to heavy values at high utilization, as the isotopically lighter (in oxygen)  is taken up into calcite, and by CA-catalysed hydration and dehydration which pushes the system further towards equilibrium at high DIC (Supplementary Fig 6c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The model of vital effects in coccolith calcite presented here not only accounts for previously unexplained variations in isotopic compositions, but also provides the theoretical framework for a new suite of proxies.

contemporaneous coccolithophore physiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coccolithophores include the only family of organisms known to be responsible for producing alkenonesthe most widely used organic molecule

through univariate and empirical relationships27,28,29,30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we have shown that the system is more complicated than this, and the isotopic fractionation of carbon into calcite (and to a lesser degree organic material) is strongly bivariate in PIC:POC and  space even when chemical and isotopic equilibrium can be assumed (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With paired measurements of C and O from analysis of ancient sediments, in theory our model can be used to iteratively search parameter space to minimize the misfit between observed and predicted isotopic compositions, and thus simultaneously predict the most likely values of PIC:POC and  of these ancient organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recently extracted acidic polysaccharides from within the calcite lattice of large ancient coccoliths64, which opens up the possibility of isotopically characterizing non-alkenone producing species, and may, in the future, supersede alkenones as the target molecule for organic carbon isotopic analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If, in addition, an independent estimate of PIC:POC were obtained65, the difference between the carbon isotopic compositions of organic matter and calcite alone could be used to constrain the system, circumventing the need for an independent estimate of the isotopic composition of DIC (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To extract an estimate of CO2 from the constrained value of , growth rate and cell size must be known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in isotopic composition of calcite produced by different sizes of coccolithophore cells growing in the same seawater may also be used to constrain CO2, but independent estimates of PIC:POC, growth rate and cell size for both coccolithophore cell size fractions would be necessary (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For some species of coccolithophore, cell size can be estimated from coccolith size11,65, and PIC:POC can be estimated from the cross-sectional aspect ratio of a coccolith65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strontium/calcium
