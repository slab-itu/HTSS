Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Actinium-225 is a promising isotope for targeted- therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, progress in developing chelators for medicinal applications has been hindered by a limited understanding of actinium chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This knowledge gap is primarily associated with handling actinium, as it is highly radioactive and in short supply.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, AcIII reactivity is often inferred from the lanthanides and minor actinides (that is, Am, Cm), with limited success.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we overcome these challenges and characterize actinium in HCl solutions using X-ray absorption spectroscopy and molecular dynamics density functional theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AcCl and Ac

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Understanding of the chemistry of trivalent actinides has broad-potential impacts on society through diverse areas, including cancer therapy1,2,3, nuclear waste4,5,6, energy and global security7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, with the exception of UIII (refs 6, 7, 8, 9), fundamental understanding of the early-to-mid-actinides in the trivalent oxidation state (An=AcIII, NpIII, PuIII, AmIII, CmIII, BkIII and CfIII) remains substantially less developed than that of the main group, transition metals and lanthanides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant experimental challenges associated with the highly radioactive samples, limited access to material of interest, and the redox instability of some AnIII ions have necessitated numerous heroic efforts to advance AnIII chemistry6,10,11,12,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The 2015 Long Range Plan for the DOE-NP Isotope Program16 highlighted the importance of advancing AcIII chemistry in comparison with the other AnIII ions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this document, 225Ac was identified as a promising anticancer therapeutic agent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The report focused on global interest in exploiting the -emissions from 225Ac and its radioactive daughters to selectively destroy the malignant cells17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To use these -particles therapeutically, the 225Ac isotope must be attached to cancer-selective targeting vectors using a stable chelating agent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, the limited availability of 225Ac t½=10.0(1) d; National Nuclear Data Center (NNDC), or a useful surrogate, has impeded development of actinium chelators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the use of 227Ac, the longest-lived actinium isotope t½=21.772(3) y; NNDC provides the best possible alternative for improving ligand design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the worldwide inventory of 227Ac is currently insufficient for meeting this demand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Historically, these challenges were magnified by the electronic ground state of AcIII (5f0 6d0), which is essentially invisible to common spectroscopies (for example, ultravioletvisible, fluorescence, electron paramagnetic resonance and so on).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, applying alternative characterization methods that account for (1) high radioactivity, (2) small samples sizes (130 g) and (3) closed shell electronic configurations would facilitate innovative chelation designs for delivery of 225Ac through the biological milieu to the targeted tumour site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recent upgrades at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL), such as the new 100-element solid-state Ge detector array on beamline 11-2, have provided new opportunities to overcome the aforementioned challenges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This capability has improved sensitivity for trace-level detection in environmental samples using X-ray absorption fine-structure (XAFS) spectroscopy19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this instrumentation has been used primarily in environmental sciences, here we exploit the capability to conduct the first actinium XAFS study reported to date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this method, 227Ac in concentrated HCl solutions are characterized at the Ac L3-edge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our interpretations of the spectra are guided by molecular dynamics density functional theory (MD-DFT) calculations21,22,23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To establish confidence in the spectroscopic and computational methods, the AcIII results are compared with analogous measurements on AmIII.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ion is selected becauseamong the redox stable trivalent actinidesits ionic radius is most similar to AcIII.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, this approach enables the AcCl and Ac

'X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy', 'To evaluate AcIII and AmIII binding of Cl1 versus H2O, three solution-phase samples were prepared: actinium chloride (AcIII in HCl; 11 M); americium chloride (AmIII in HCl; 11 M); and the americium aquo ion (AmIII in HO3SCF3, 0.11 M), referred to hereafter as Ac-HCl, Am-HCl and Am-Aquo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To mitigate safety concerns associated with the 227Ac isotope, radioactive daughters (primarily 227Th and 223Ra) were removed before the measurements at the SSRL synchrotron, as previously described (see Methods)26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were then returned to Los Alamos National Laboratory before a significant quantity of the daughters re-emerged (10 days).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ac and Am L3-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra from Ac-HCl, Am-HCl and Am-Aquo were background subtracted and normalized (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectra were similar as they contained a pronounced edge-peak superimposed on an absorption threshold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the perspective of the free ion, the edge-feature could be crudely described as originating from electric-dipole allowed transitions from the actinide 2p-orbitals to unoccupied states that contain actinide 6d-character, that is, for AcIII 2p65f0 6d02p55f0 6d1 (refs 28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Solution phase AcIII and AmIII L3-edge XANES.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) XANES spectra for Am-Aquo (0.11 M HO3SCF3) in blue trace.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) XANES spectra for Am-HCl (11 M HCl) in orange trace.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) XANES spectra for Ac-HCl (11 M HCl) in red trace.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The actinium and americium spectra were calibrated in situ to RbCl pellet (15,203.81 eV) and Zr foil (17,998 eV) respectively.Full size image', 'The Ac L3-edge spectrum was of quintessential significance, as it represented the first actinium XANES measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The edge-peak line shape was quite broad and spanned over 30 eV, owing to the short core-hole lifetime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peak maximum and inflection point (where first and second derivatives of the data equalled zero) were determined to be 15,877.3 and 15,873.9 eV, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the americium samples, the inflection point from Am-Aquo was found at 18,514.3 eV, which was consistent with americium in the +3 oxidation state30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changing the solution matrix from HO3SCF3 (0.11 M) to HCl (11 M) shifted the edge-peak inflection point to lower energy by 0.7 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Am L3-edge energy difference was attributed to an electronic change that accompanied Cl1 displacement of H2O in the AmIII inner coordination sphere (vide infra), that is, Am-Aquo versus Am-HCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the relative ease with which the AcIII and AmIII L3-edge XANES measurements were obtainedand in light of the incompatibility of other spectroscopic techniques for probing dilute actinium sampleswe anticipate that these results will provide a foundation for characterizing the coordination chemistry of actinium in other chemical environments in the future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Extended X-ray absorption fine structure', 'Appreciable differences were observed in the solution-phase k3(k) extended X-ray absorption fine-structure (EXAFS) data (room temperature) from solutions containing Ac-HCl, Am-HCl and Am-Aquo (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, a substantial phase shift and change in frequency in the EXAFS oscillations was observed in the spectrum from Ac-HCl in comparison with the americium spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ac-HCl spectrum was comprised of at least two substantial contributions; one characterized by a long frequency and the other by a short frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of two frequencies was most likely associated with a significant number of both Cl1 and H2O molecules in the AcIII inner coordination sphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, for Am-HCl, the frequency of EXAFS oscillations was dominated by one major sinusoidal component, such that the Am-HCl spectrum was almost superimposable on that from Am-Aquo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The similarity between Am-HCl and Am-Aquo suggested that H2O molecules dominated the inner coordination sphere in Am-HCl, with Cl1 content being slight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, this comparison highlighted significant differences in AcIII versus AmIII solution speciation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Solution phase AcIII and AmIII L3-edge EXAFS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) EXAFS k3(k) spectra for Am-Aquo (0.11 M HO3SCF3) in blue trace.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) EXAFS k3(k) spectra for Am-HCl (11 M HCl) in orange trace.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) EXAFS k3(k) spectra for Ac-HCl (11 M HCl) in red trace.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fits to the data have been provided as dashed black traces.Full size image', 'The EXAFS data were fit by allowing the coordination numbers (CN), the DebyeWaller factors (2), and the interatomic distances (R) to converge to reasonable values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Limitations associated with the solution-phase room-temperature EXAFS measurements constrained meaningful data to 10 k (9, 10.5 and 12 k for solutions containing Ac-HCl, Am-HCl and Am-Aquo, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, scattering pathways beyond the first coordination shell (including multiple scattering pathways, for example, ClMH2O) were not considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To most effectively describe how the EXAFS models were obtained, it was instructive to begin with Am-Aquo, then introduce the possibility of Cl1 ligation for Am-HCl, and conclude with the Ac-HCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Before modelling the EXAFS data from Am-Aquo, we initially calculated (FEFF8 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32)) an EXAFS spectrum using atomic coordinates obtained from the Am(H2O)9O3SCF33 single-crystal X-ray diffraction data, previously reported33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculated EXAFS spectrum was composed of two main scattering pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first path originated from six oxygen atoms with an Am

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The experimental and computational results described here represented an exciting leap forward from previous actinium coordination chemistry studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To most effectively communicate to the reader the significance of these results, we found it instructive to summarize the previous AcIII coordination chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of actinium chemistry has been inferred from methodical radio-analytical and extraction studies conducted on trace-level quantities of actinium39,41,42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these previous efforts revealed differences between AcIII and the other trivalent actinide and lanthanide elements, in general, they have been interpreted as suggesting that AcIII is a hard oxophilic tri-cation, in direct analogy to other actinide(III) cations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, there have been a few studies that used macroscopic quantities of AcIII for analysis by ultravioletvisible spectroscopy43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these spectra were essentially featurelessowing to the actinium 5f0 6d0 ground-state electronic configurationand did not provide an insight into the actinium coordination environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of actinium structural data was obtained during the Manhattan project and through the years shortly after World War II.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Fried et al.38 and Zachariasen45,46,47 deduced structures and cell parameters using X-ray diffraction patterns from crystalline powders of nine actinium compounds assumed to be AcF3, AcCl3, AcBr3, Ac2O3, Ac2S3, AcOF, AcOCl, AcOBr and AcPO4·H2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, Farr et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  used X-ray diffraction to characterize microgram quantities of a mixture of actinium metal and actinium hydride48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Years later, an attempt to prepare some inorganic compounds with 10 mg of 227Ac occurred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, radiation damage to samples and the diffraction films limited this effort to generate a single powder pattern of actinium oxalate, Ac2(C2O4)3·10H2O (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Reported here, we overcame some of the challenges associated with spectroscopic analyses of bulk actinium samples using new XAFS capabilities, which have been typically employed in trace-level environmental science studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, we characterized the chemistry of AcIII and AmIII in concentrated HCl (11 M) solutions and compared the results with solution-phase measurements from the americium aquo ion in dilute HO3SCF3 (0.11 M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calculations involving MD-DFT, previously reported single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and previous solution-phase EXAFS results (when possible) were employed to guide our spectral interpretations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These efforts enabled the AcCl and Ac

 distances to be directly measured for the first time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the studies revealed a substantial difference between AcIII and AmIII solution speciation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In concentrated HCl solutions, we observed that AcIII and AmIII were coordinated by approximately nine ligands; however, AcIII preferred approximately six H2O molecules and three Cl1 ions, while AmIII was coordinated by approximately eight H2O and one Cl1 ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is well known that evaluating CN using EXAFS typically provides values with high uncertainty, 20%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In spite of the large errors associated with the AcIII (CNCl=3.2±1.1) and AmIII (CNCl=0.8±0.3) chloride CNs, these values clearly indicated that AcIII had more Cl1- ligands in the inner coordination sphere than AmIII.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results were indeed unexpected, for example, stability constants for AcCl and AmCl were reported to be nearly identical6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Perhaps differences in steric crowding accounted for the varied H2O and Cl1 CNs for the large AcIII versus smaller AmIII ions (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, AcIII electronic structure contributions may also contribute to difference in H2O versus Cl1 binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the generality and origin of these results have yet to be established, they tempt us to revisit the traditional descriptions of AcIII.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, consider the possibility that AcIII is substantially less polarizing than the rest of the f-elements, which are well established as hard and oxophilic ions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this sense, one might crudely compare the changes in chemical hardness from AcIII to AmIII to that of iodine to fluorine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is conceivable that a reclassification could provide insight into previous reports where actinium behaved substantially different than trivalent actinides and lanthanides41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that many AcIII chelators are based on the coordination chemistry of lanthanides and minor actinides, better characterization of the long Acligand bond distances, binding preferences, and speciation has the potential to improve design parameters for actinium chelators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, the results here serve as motivation for future work focused on using XAFS spectroscopy and MD-DFT calculations to advance understanding of actinium reactivity with ligands that are more relevant to -therapy development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Ionic radii of the early to mid-actinides.Scheme showing the ionic radii (Å) of trivalent actinides from actinium to californium drawn to scale for six-coordinate ions40.Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
