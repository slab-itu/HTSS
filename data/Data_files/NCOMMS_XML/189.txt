Non-CG DNA methylation is a biomarker for assessing endodermal differentiation capacity in pluripotent stem cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Non-CG methylation is an unexplored epigenetic hallmark of pluripotent stem cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that a reduction in non-CG methylation is associated with impaired differentiation capacity into endodermal lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome-wide analysis of 2,670 non-CG sites in a discovery cohort of 25 phenotyped human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines revealed unidirectional loss (=13%, P less_than 7.4 × 104) of non-CG methylation that correctly identifies endodermal differentiation capacity in 23 out of 25 (92%) hiPSC lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Translation into a simplified assay of only nine non-CG sites maintains predictive power in the discovery cohort (=23%, P less_than 9.1 × 106) and correctly identifies endodermal differentiation capacity in nine out of ten pluripotent stem cell lines in an independent replication cohort consisting of hiPSCs reprogrammed from different cell types and different delivery systems, as well as human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding infers non-CG methylation at these sites as a biomarker when assessing endodermal differentiation capacity as a readout.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Non-CG DNA methylation is an epigenetic hallmark of mammalian pluripotent stem cells1, which is gradually lost on cell fate specification2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The occurrence of non-CG methylation is predominantly catalysed by DNMT3A and DNMT3B in cooperation with DNMT3L2,3,4 and was first described in embryonic stem cells; however, its prevalence and genomic localization has only been established recently5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike patterns of CG methylation where the majority of cytosines are methylated6,7,8 and have been both extensively studied9,10,11,12 and reviewed13,14,15, cytosines at non-CG dinucleotides in pluripotent stem cell populations are only partially methylated and less well studied4,6,8,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that quantitative variation in non-CG methylation may reflect pluripotent stem cell-specific phenotypes and thus be suitable as a biomarker capable of predicting differentiation capacity, complementing existing methods such as PluriTest17 (which uses gene expression data) and Scorecard9 (which uses CpG methylation and gene expression data).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identification of a biomarker solely based on few non-CG sites would thus constitute an alternative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The importance of discovering robust and easy-to-assay biomarkers is that time-consuming and costly cell-based phenotyping measures can be reduced, while simultaneously offering improvements in large-scale assessment of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines for clinical utility and therapeutic applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using a two-stage design we report here that pluripotent stem cells with an impaired differentiation capacity for endodermal lineages exhibit reduced DNA methylation at non-CG dinucleotides targeted by the Illumina 450K array.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding infers non-CG methylation can be used as a biomarker for assessing endodermal differentiation capacity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Differentiation capacity in pluripotent stem cell lines', 'We used a two-stage design consisting of a discovery cohort of 25 hiPSC lines, and a replication cohort of 7 hiPSC lines from the HipSci study (http://www.hipsci.org) and 3 human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines (see Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the discovery cohort, we analysed hiPSC lines derived from a range of differentiated somatic cells (dermal fibroblasts (N=20), foreskin fibroblasts (N=1), endothelial precursor cells (N=2) and endothelial progenitor cells (N=2)) obtained from seven unrelated individuals and two monozygotic twins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These hiPSC lines were derived using OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC (OSKM) reprogramming factors delivered using two virus-based vectors (retrovirus (N=23) and Sendai virus (N=2)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the replication cohort, we extended the source of pluripotent stem cells to include hESCs as well as diversifying the range of donor cell types and OSKM delivery methods from which hiPSC lines were derived; donor cells included erythroblasts (N=4) and dermal fibroblasts (N=3) obtained from five unrelated individuals, and OSKM delivery systems included a DNA-based vector (episomal (N=3)) in addition to a virus-based vector (Sendai virus (N=4)); confirmation of pluripotency, differentiation protocol and differentiation capacity scoring are detailed in Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the hiPSCs used in the discovery cohort and hESC lines in the replication cohort, we obtained multiple DNA extracts from independent cells of the same plate (median N=6), to control for cell line variation (Supplementary Fig 1); for the hiPSC lines in the replication cohort, we obtained only single DNA extracts per plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All hiPSC lines in the discovery and replication cohorts fulfilled criteria for pluripotency18: this was confirmed by gene expression and immunostaining for the core transcriptional network of pluripotency markers and teratoma formation when introduced into immunocompromised mice (see Methods and Supplementary Figs 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite fulfilling criteria for pluripotency and controlling for uniform cell-plating densities, there were marked differences in their differentiation capacities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, a number of hiPSC lines showed impaired efficiency to differentiate into the endoderm lineage leading us to categorize hiPSC lines as either low or high endodermal differentiation capacity (LDC and HDC, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'DNA methylation age in pluripotent stem cell lines', 'We derived methylation levels (, the methylated fraction of cells analysed) for 2,676 autosomal CpH sites (H=A, T, C) at single base-pair resolution using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips (Illumina 450K BeadChips).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where multiple DNA extracts from independent cells of the same plate were available, -values were averaged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure the abundant non-CG methylation signal in pluripotent stem cells was not due to incomplete bisulfite conversion, we conducted a number of control experiments (see Methods and Supplementary Figs 913).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an additional quality control measure, we computed DNA methylation age (DNAm age) using a subset of CpG probes on the Illumina 450K BeadChip19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As embryonic stem cells are of prenatal origin, we expect pluripotent cells to exhibit negative age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reassuringly, 150 of 161 (93%) pluripotent clones exhibited negative age and none exceeded +0.5 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no significant difference in DNAm age between HDC and LDC pluripotent lines (mean DNAm age: 0.51 (HDC) versus 0.36 (LDC)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNAm age for the available donor cell lines consistently exceeded 18 years, confirming the adult origin of each donor cell line (Supplementary Fig 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Promoter DNA methylation in pluripotent stem cells', 'We also compared promoter methylation of our samples with the Reference Corridor proposed by Bock et al.9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following LiftOver of promoter coordinates from hg18 to hg19, we derived a consensus set of 14,820 promoters where at least one probe of the Illumina 450K BeadChip overlapped; this consensus set of promoters was represented by 109,109 CpG probes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As Reference Corridor estimates were derived using Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS), there was, on average, more than four times the number of CpGs assayed per promoter compared with Illumina 450K BeadChips; for this reason we estimated promoter methylation in this cohort of pluripotent stem cells using the median -value, as the median is less sensitive to outliers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, despite the use of different technologies we found 76.8% of all DNA methylation estimates for this cohort fell within the bounds of the Reference Corridor (Supplementary Fig 15a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Curiously, the Reference Corridors of 1,734 (11.7%) promoters failed to capture any corresponding Illumina 450K BeadChip estimates; Reference Corridors for these promoters were characterized by intermediate methylation and were mainly marked by a shift towards unmethylated status in this cohort (Supplementary Fig 15b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All coefficients of variation (CVs) at each of these promoters were  less_than 1 in this cohort, indicating stable methylation status at each promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, many Illumina 450K BeadChip estimates only narrowly missed being captured in the Reference Corridor: almost a quarter (24%) of methylation estimates were within 10% of a Reference Corridor threshold and nearly half (48%) were  less_than 20%magnitudes possibly attributable to the different technologies being compared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Non-CG methylation in pluripotent stem cell lines', 'To identify methylation variable positions (MVPs) associated with impaired endodermal differentiation capacity, we applied a false discovery rate of 0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As previously defined20, MVPs are referred to as hyper- or hypo-MVPs when directionality towards differential hyper- or hypomethylation has been ascertained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nearly all sites tested (2,564 or 96%) were significantly associated and all were hyper-MVPs in HDC hiPSC lines compared with LDC hiPSC lines; a finding not due to technical confounders (Supplementary Fig 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aggregating DNA methylation across all non-CG sites (mean), we found LDC and HDC hiPSC lines were characterized by 37% (95% confidence interval (CI)=3143%) and 50% (95% CI=4752%) non-CG DNA methylation, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean levels of non-CG DNA methylation were not associated with passage number (Pearsons r=0.52, P=0.28; Supplementary Fig 17), whereas correlations of non-CG DNA methylation profiles between pluripotent stem cell lines were high (average r=0.903) and CVs across cell lines at individual loci were low (average CV=0.49), leading us to infer that the stability of non-CG methylation is actively maintained at this subset of non-CG loci tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the difference in mean non-CG methylation levels between LDC and HDC hiPSC lines (mean=13% (95% CI=619%); Fig 1) was significant using both conventional statistical tests (P less_than 7.4 × 104, two sample t-test) and permutation testing (empirical P=1.5 × 104).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether overall CpG methylation levels were affected in the same way, we performed 100,000 Monte Carlo simulations using 2,676 randomly sampled CpG probes: we found mean between HDC and LDC groups never exceeded 0.005, which intensifies the importance of non-CG DNA methylation loss in LDC hiPSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the lack of a global CpG methylation difference between HDC and LDC groups was observed when solely methylated (that is,  greater than 80%) CpG probes were randomly sampled, which more accurately reflects the true genomic distribution of CpG methylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, the direction and magnitude of the non-CG effect was independent of 6-bp sequence motif surrounding the non-CG locus (Supplementary Fig 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Non-CG methylation is prevalent but reduced in LDC hiPSCs.Density plot illustrating the difference in non-CG methylation profiles between low-differentiation capacity (LDC;

for example, predicated by non-CG methylation differences at the donor cell level, we focused our analysis on hiPSCs with matched donor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, donor cells giving rise to both LDC and HDC hiPSC lines (subsequently referred to as LDC donors and HDC donors) were characterized by notably low and equal levels of non-CG methylation (mean: 8% (95% CI=610%); mean=NS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Non-CG methylation in donors is not at or close to 0%, because the dynamic range of the array is reduced rather than issues of incomplete bisulfite conversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, there were no significant MVPs between LDC and HDC donors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, mean between donors and hiPSC lines were notably higher for the HDC group compared with the LDC group (mean: 42% versus 29%, respectively), indicating that LDC hiPSCs are more refractory to the acquisition of non-CG methylation (Supplementary Fig 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, LDC hiPSCs are characterized by hypomethylation at the majority of non-CG sites assayed on the Illumina 450K BeadChip, which is not predicted by the baseline non-CG profile of the donor cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Polymorphism analyses', 'We next investigated whether the observed differences in non-CG methylation between LDC and HDC hiPSCs were due to the presence of polymorphisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We mapped all non-CG sites to data from the 1,000 Genomes Project21 and found evidence of genetic variation at just four (0.1%) loci, which confirms that a reduction in non-CG methylation in LDC samples is not due to the loss of methylatable cytosines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next searched for polymorphisms in the entire probe and found only 61 (2.3%) non-CG probes were potentially affected by polymorphism within 10 bp of the 3-end of the probe, which rules out confounding by technical factors22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Non-CG methylation as a biomarker', 'Unsupervised hierarchical clustering using all 2,564 significant non-CG probes revealed a largely unequivocal separation of LDC, HDC and donor cell lines (Fig 2 and Supplementary Fig 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous findings9,23, donor cells and hiPSCs formed separate clades, in our case, illustrating a clear influence of non-CG methylation in the pluripotency phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, more profound was the correct classification of hiPSC lines (23 of 25, or 92%) into LDC and HDC clades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Non-CG DNA methylation profiles can separate LDC from HDC hiPSCs.Unsupervised hierarchical clustering using non-CG methylation data revealed distinct separation of LDC from HDC hiPSCs, as well as from donor cell lines (top annotation bar).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heatmap shows the range of non-CG -values for each sample and illustrates the tendency towards hypermethylation in HDC hiPSCs compared with that in LDC hiPSCs;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The derivation of hiPSCs from easily accessible tissue sources has far reaching implications for the fields of drug screening and development, as well as regenerative medicine24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a number of challenges remain25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One pressing issue is the identification of molecular surrogates that predict the differentiation capacity of an hiPSC to form all three embryonic germ layers26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although variability in differentiation capacity has been attributed to tissue of origin effects9,23,27 and reprogramming technologies28, variability still remains even when these variables are kept constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our results are not immune to some degree of overfitting (our study design used more samples in the discovery cohort than the replication cohort), we do show that levels of DNA methylation at a subset of non-CG dinucleotides can serve as a powerful unidirectional biomarker capable of distinguishing pluripotent lines of high and low endodermal differentiation capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Whether this finding extends to predict differentiation capacity in other lineages remains an important question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tried exploring non-CG DNA methylation in eight pluripotent cell lines (four ES lines and four hiPSC lines) with RRBS data4 and corresponding lineage differentiation capacity information9; however, we were unable to establish a positive correlation, presumably because of insufficient overlap between 450K- and RRBS-derived non-CG data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only ten non-CG loci overlap, none of which encompass the biomarker proposed here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is important because genomic localization matters: although de novo methyltransferase activity in pluripotent stem cells is widespread, it has been proposed to be recruited to specific loci, in particular those exhibiting high levels of methylation4; of particular note, the non-CG loci assayed on the Illumina 450K array are enriched for regions of H3K36me3 compared with the RRBS loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, unlike Ziller et al.4 who found only modest correlations (average r=0.35) between pluripotent stem cell lines and high CVs at non-CG loci (average CV=3.0), we found high correlations (average r=0.903) and low CVs (average CV=0.49)values that are more akin to those measured at CpGs4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore feasible that the loci assayed in this study represent putatively more functional non-CG targets with respect to differentiation capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the different phenotyping methods employed in Bock et al.9 further complicates a direct comparison with our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The functional consequence of non-CG methylation is currently unclear but its presence can directly inhibit the binding of specificity protein 1 (Sp1)29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sp1 contributes to the maintenance of methylation-free CpG islands30 and can increase promoter activity31, as well as regulating a variety of cellular processes including tissue-specific transcriptional activity32, cell differentiation and chromatin remodelling33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments carried out by Clark et al.29 have shown that methylation of the internal CpG site at the consensus Sp1-binding site core (5- CCGCCC -3) was able to inhibit Sp1 binding by up to 20% and when the 5-non-CG site was methylated, Sp1 binding was inhibited by up to 40%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when both sites were methylated, Sp1 binding was virtually blocked (95% inhibition)29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of Sp1, it is therefore feasible that non-CG methylation may act as a pluripotent stem cell-specific mechanism to keep some constitutively unmethylated genomic regions (for example, CpG islands) methylated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although the mechanistic actions of non-CG DNA methylation on differentiation are unknown, our results offer a novel, fast and economic approach for large-scale assessment of hiPSC lines for clinical utility and therapeutic applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, future work should include data mining for other putative regulatory sites affected by non-CG DNA methylation and testing the functional effect of occluded DNA-binding proteins in quantitative knockdown paradigms to simulate the intermediately methylated states seen at non-CG loci in pluripotent stem cells.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
