Osteoclasts control reactivation of dormant myeloma cells by remodelling the endosteal niche  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Multiple myeloma is largely incurable, despite development of therapies that target myeloma cell-intrinsic pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disease relapse is thought to originate from dormant myeloma cells, localized in specialized niches, which resist therapy and repopulate the tumour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, little is known about the niche, and how it exerts cell-extrinsic control over myeloma cell dormancy and reactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we track individual myeloma cells by intravital imaging as they colonize the endosteal niche, enter a dormant state and subsequently become activated to form colonies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that dormancy is a reversible state that is switched on by engagement with bone-lining cells or osteoblasts, and switched off by osteoclasts remodelling the endosteal niche.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dormant myeloma cells are resistant to chemotherapy that targets dividing cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The demonstration that the endosteal niche is pivotal in controlling myeloma cell dormancy highlights the potential for targeting cell-extrinsic mechanisms to overcome cell-intrinsic drug resistance and prevent disease relapse.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cancer cell dormancy is a poorly understood and often neglected stage in the evolution of many cancers, where extrinsic signals from the tumour microenvironment suppress active growth and proliferation, until more favourable conditions arise1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a major clinical problem, as dormant cancer cells may disseminate at an early stage in the disease3, become resistant to conventional therapies that target dividing cells1 and persist as minimal residual disease (MRD), which can be reactivated to promote disease relapse long after treatment cessation4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the skeleton, dormant cells may co-exist in equilibrium with the bone microenvironment for years before reactivation and clinical relapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, multiple myeloma, a primary haematological malignancy arising in bone, exemplifies the major therapeutic challenges posed by cancer cell dormancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While novel therapies that selectively target cell intrinsic cancer properties have improved survival5, patients continue to relapse and myeloma remains largely incurable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, understanding the extrinsic environmental factors that regulate myeloma cell dormancy is required to deliver complementary treatment strategies to overcome drug resistance and achieve complete remission and cure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recently, whole-genome sequencing has identified key driver mutations and complex mutation patterns during the natural history of myeloma within individual patients6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These longitudinal analyses have revealed marked intra-clonal heterogeneity and shifting clonal dominance during disease progression and in response to drug treatments7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The waxing and waning of different myeloma clones (clonal tides) suggests that cancer cell growth and proliferation are not fixed genetic programmes8,9 that follow a linear model, but rather a branching and parallel, Darwinian, model of clonal evolution that is subject to external selective pressures6,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that myeloma cell clones are able to reversibly switch on or off depending on the presence of favourable or unfavourable environmental signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A critical component of this tumour microenvironment is the bone niche where myeloma cells initially colonize and are believed to reside11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the nature of this niche and mechanisms that control myeloma cell occupancy are poorly defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have long been known to occupy unique niches within the bone marrow microenvironment and this controls HSC dormancy, self-renewal and mobilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These specialized microenvironments contain cells of the osteogenic lineage, perivascular cells and/or endothelial cells, and remodelling of these niches by osteoclasts regulates niche occupancy12,13,14,15,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, leukaemic cells and other cancer cells, including prostate cancer cells, have been shown to engraft in the HSC niche19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, despite the importance of the niche in controlling tumour cell engraftment, the dynamic interactions between colonizing cancer cells and components of these specialized niches, and the impact of these interactions on the long-term fate of these cells, is poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Studying the dynamic interactions between dormant myeloma cells and the bone niche is particularly challenging, because it requires high-resolution deep-tissue imaging through intact bone in a live animal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, intravital microscopy of the bone marrow space beneath the bregma in the calvarium22 has been successfully used to study haematopoiesis23 and the HSC niche24,25,26,27, and has recently been applied to study the colonization of bone by leukaemic and myeloma cells20,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to date, non-destructive microscopic imaging over periods of weeks to months is yet to be performed to longitudinally track the fate of the same individual myeloma cells as they become activated and escape dormancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would be a significant advance on longitudinal imaging by bioluminescence, which lacks the image resolution and potential for simultaneous visualization of the cells and structures that make up the bone niche.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it would have distinct advantages over cross-sectional intravital microscopy, which may not capture the heterogeneity within and between different animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, to image dormant myeloma cells in vivo, a robust method is required to discriminate resting from actively dividing cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intravital dyes such as carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester, which label intracellular proteins, have relatively short half-lives and are unsuitable for the study of long-term cancer cell dormancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescent stem cell markers have been used to track HSCs and study the epithelial stem cell niche, but these reporters may lack specificity when used in isolation29,30,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To address this, here we have developed a method for dynamic longitudinal imaging of dormant myeloma cells within intact long bones of mice using intravital two-photon microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Myeloma cells are double-labelled with both fixed genetic reporters and lipophilic membrane dyes, which are retained by non-dividing myeloma cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intravital microscopy is used to resolve single tumour cells as they arrive in bone and engage in the bone niche, to track the transition from dormancy to active growth, and to follow the serial growth of tumour colonies by repeated imaging of the same mouse at weekly intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies show that myeloma cells can be held in a dormant state by osteoblast-like cells in the endosteal niche, and this state confers dormant cells with drug resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, direct activation of osteoclasts can remodel the endosteal surface to release dormant myeloma cells from the niche and stochastically facilitate their reactivation to repopulate the tumour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, myeloma cell dormancy is a reversible state controlled by the extrinsic bone microenvironment, which can be manipulated to change the course of the disease.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

significant increase in the number of GFP+DiDneg cells, confirming escape from therapeutic control and mimicking disease relapse (Fig 7e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, unlike in the treatment setting, dormant GFP+DiDhi cell numbers decreased following treatment withdrawal, consistent with their reactivation and their role in repopulating the tumour (Fig 7e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this,

#@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Bone resorption activates dormant myeloma cells', 'To directly test the impact of manipulating the bone microenvironment on disease activity, we treated disease-bearing mice with a soluble form of the ligand for the receptor activator of NFB (sRANKL), which is expressed by osteoblasts and osteocytes and is critical for osteoclast formation and bone resorption39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Daily treatment with sRANKL for 3 days in naive BKAL mice resulted in a significant reduction in trabecular bone volume and bone surface (Fig 8a,b), along with a significant decrease in trabecular number and an increase in trabecular separation (data not shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These structural changes in bone were associated with an increase in osteoclasts within trabecular bone regions and on endocortical bone surfaces (Fig 8c,d) and an increase in serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, a marker of osteoclast activity (Fig 8d, bottom panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, FACS analysis demonstrated that manipulation of the bone microenvironment resulted in a significant decrease in the number of dormant GFP+DiDhi cells in the bone marrow, as anticipated (Fig 8e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, although there was also a modest reduction in myeloma burden, there were fewer GFP+DiDhi cells as a proportion of the GFP+ tumour burden (Fig 8e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, sRANKL treatment had no effect on myeloma cells in the spleen (Fig 8f), confirming that the effect on GFP+DiDhi cells was a myeloma cell-extrinsic effect mediated by osteoclasts in the bone, with osteoclast activation associated with the release of GFP+DiDhi cells from the endosteal niche.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative assessment of GFP+DiD+ and GFP+DiDneg cells by two-photon microscopy confirmed the decrease in numbers of GFP+DiD+ cells relative to both bone marrow volume and GFP+DiDneg tumour (Fig 8g,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, intravital imaging did not demonstrate a decrease in GFP+DiDneg tumour burden, which may reflect the smaller sample volume or a differential distribution of tumour, compared with analysis by FACS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, sRANKL induces osteoclastic bone resorption and can release dormant myeloma cells from osteoblastic or bone-lining-cell suppression, making them available to contribute to disease progression and/or relapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To establish whether bone resorption is associated with myeloma burden, we examined serum levels of C-terminal telopeptide (CTX), a biochemical marker of bone resorption, and 2-microglobulin (2m) as a

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cancer cell dormancy is increasingly recognized as an important clinical problem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite improved outcomes from new, targeted therapies, patients continue to suffer from relapse and metastases, which are major causes of morbidity and mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, there is an increasing need to understand cancer cell dormancy to prevent drug resistance and disease relapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is particularly true in multiple myeloma where patients now achieve complete responses to state-of-the-art combination therapy, yet still harbour drug-resistant dormant myeloma cells as MRD and go on to progress at a later time point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, understanding the extrinsic control of dormant myeloma cells by the bone microenvironment has the potential to uncover novel therapeutic approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These may be used in combination with current treatments to either completely eradicate myeloma cells, or to maintain MRD in a dormant state and achieve long-term remission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we developed a unique, non-destructive, method to track the fate of individual myeloma cells, longitudinally, as they colonize the endosteal niche and form tumour colonies over weeks or months, in live mice by intravital two-photon microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By imaging through a natural optical window in the tibia, we have overcome the long-held misconception that non-destructive intravital microscopy of bone can only be performed in the calvaria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the tibia has different developmental origins from the calvaria and may also contain distinct anatomical and functional compartments that constitute the specialized microenvironments required for myeloma cell colonization, retention of dormancy and growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this novel approach, we demonstrated that myeloma cells entered the bone marrow, left the vasculature and migrated directly towards endosteal surfaces where they arrested in sites containing type-I collagen-expressing osteoblasts or bone-lining cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the immunohistochemical studies reporting the presence of leukaemic cells and primary myeloma cells adjacent to bone surfaces11,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our intravital studies of myeloma cell dormancy were facilitated by the use of a lipophilic membrane dye, DiD, to identify dormant GFP-expressing myeloma cells that had not undergone cell division.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was supported by the detection of stable numbers of these cells throughout the duration of the experimental time course following initial equilibration, indicating that they are long-lived dormant cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, analysis of Ki67 expression and DAPI staining showed that the majority of GFP+DiDhi cells were in the resting G0 phase when compared with the GFP+DiDneg population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, transcriptional analysis demonstrated that the GFP+DiDhi population maintained this long-lived persistent dormant phenotype by downregulating genes that control the cell cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, a limited number of the GFP+DiDhi cells were also Ki67 positive, suggesting that, in certain niches, dormant cells may have recently been activated to divide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This challenges the notion that dormancy is a synchronized period of inactivity and supports the idea that dormancy may instead result from the dynamic interplay between myeloma cells in the multiple heterogeneous niches and may exist in different states of activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To establish whether dormancy was a fixed or reversible state, we removed dormant GFP+DiDhi cells from their bone niche, relabelled them with DiD and reinoculated them into naive mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed that some of the GFP+DiDhi cells remained dormant while others were released from dormancy in their new microenvironment and became activated to form GFP+DiDneg colonies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, in the reciprocal experiment, when we removed proliferating GFP+DiDneg cells and labelled them with CMDiL before reinoculation, these cells not only formed colonies but could also be induced to enter a dormant state in their naive host bone environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations infer that cancer cell dormancy is a reversible state that can be switched on or off by microenvironmental signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we also showed that of the many dormant tumour cells that locate to the endosteal niche, only limited numbers become reactivated to form overt myeloma colonies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is reminiscent of the clonal tides and altering clonal dominance that is observed in patients exposed to different drug regimens6,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the plasticity of the 5TGM1 cells under these experimental conditions and the fact that 89% of GFP+DiDhi cells are CD138+ suggests that dormant myeloma cells are distinct from cancer stem cells, which are thought to be poorly differentiated cancer cell precursors41, and the myeloma stem cell, which have been reported to be CD138neg (refs 42, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Crucially, the proportion of dormant GFP+DiDhi and proliferating GFP+DiDneg myeloma cells that form colonies or became dormant after secondary transplantation were comparable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicated that stochastic engagement with the relevant bone niche was more important than an intrinsic developmental programme in determining the fate of the transplanted myeloma cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, osteoblast-conditioned media and co-culture with MC3T3 osteoblast-like cells maintained dormancy and suppressed proliferation, whereas osteoclast-like cell-conditioned media stimulated myeloma cell growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with studies in vitro, which show that growth of patient-derived multiple myeloma cells is suppressed when cultured with patient-derived osteoblasts and inhibition of myeloma growth when patient-derived MSCs are delivered systemically or directly into bones of SCID-hu MM-bearing mice44,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the mechanisms responsible for suppression of multiple myeloma cell growth and holding MM cells in a dormant state are poorly defined, they may include release of bone morphogenic proteins46 or secretion of Wnt proteins and Wnt antagonists47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our gene expression analysis has identified a number of cellular adhesion molecules and membrane receptors, including Vcam1 and Axl, that could also play a role in interactions between dormant myeloma cells and cells in the endosteal niche.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, expression of these molecules may be used as biomarkers to help identify dormant myeloma cells in bone and may also provide new therapeutic targets to aid in the erradication of these cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data suggest that the extrinsic bone microenvironment, and likely an endosteal niche, plays a critical role in controlling myeloma cell dormancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Dormant GFP+DiDhi cells were more resistant than proliferating GFP+DiDneg cells to melphalan treatment, but not to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may argue that dormant cells are intrinsically resistant to chemotherapeutic agents that target dividing cells by virtue of their dormant state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, even in mice with  greater than 99% reduction in tumour burden, GFP+DiDhi cells were still detectable and contributed to the re-establishment of myeloma growth following melphalan treatment withdrawal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This awakening of dormant cells during recovery may be a result of alterations in the local environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that direct manipulation of the bone microenvironment itself would impact on dormancy and provide a mechanism for reactivating dormant cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Short-term treatment with sRANKL increased osteoclast numbers, resorption activity and decreased the bone surface containing endosteal niches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This osteoclastic activity released GFP+DiDhi cells from dormancy and resulted in a specific reduction of GFP+DiDhi cells in the bone, but not in the spleen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, serum CTX levels were found to correlate with serum 2m, a marker of tumour burden, in a large cohort of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that bone resorption, simply by remodelling the endosteal niche as part of normal physiological function, may inadvertently activate dormant tumour cells, arguing that activation of dormant cells is an environmentally controlled stochastic event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, despite the increased osteoclast activity following RANKL treatment, not all of the bone surface undergoes resorption and as a result dormant cells are still present, suggesting mobilization events are a localized phenomena.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reason why mobilization of dormant cells was associated with a reduction in myeloma burden is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could reflect a difference in the rate of growth of mobilized cells following treatment or alternatively that, dormant cells that were mobilized by sRANKL died without undergoing cell division; however, the latter is not consistent with our studies, showing these cells have the capacity to grow in vitro and in vivo (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, these data suggest that stimulation of bone resorption may result in synchronized activation of dormant cells, thereby rendering them more susceptible to targeted therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Or that inhibition of bone resorption by anti-resorptive agents, such as bisphosphonates, may enforce cellular dormancy and prevent myeloma cell activation and relapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These data therefore have significant clinical implications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We already know inhibitors of bone resorption, including bisphosphonates and strategies to block RANKL, reduce myeloma burden in experimental models49,50,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, bisphosphonate treatment is associated with improvements in survival that may be independent of the development of skeletal-related events52; however, the mechanisms responsible remain unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data may provide at least one explanation for these observations, that is, that bisphosphonate treatment may prevent reactivation of dormant myeloma cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It could also argue that consideration needs to be given to very early anti-resorptive treatment to prevent activation of dormant tumour cells to sustain long-term remission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is certainly supported by studies in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, which show that patients with increased bone resorption are more likely to develop overt myeloma53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The experimental data presented here provide the basis for developing novel approaches to prevent disease progression in myeloma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could include repurposing bone-active drugs as frontline therapies, to be used in combination with targeted therapies, to prevent the reactivation of dormant myeloma cells and sustain long-term remission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, the promotion of bone resorption to release tumour cells from dormancy may facilitate their targeting by the existing armamentarium of drugs to eliminate MRD and achieve long-term remission or even cure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, further studies of the molecular mechanisms that regulate dormancy within the endosteal niche may reveal druggable targets that control myeloma reactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this new knowledge of the extrinsic control of cancer cell dormancy has implications for understanding cancer pathogenesis and the potential to unlock opportunities for developing innovative treatment strategies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
