Quantum vertex model for reversible classical computing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mappings of classical computation onto statistical mechanics models have led to remarkable successes in addressing some complex computational problems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, such mappings display thermodynamic phase transitions that may prevent reaching solution even for easy problems known to be solvable in polynomial time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we map universal reversible classical computations onto a planar vertex model that exhibits no bulk classical thermodynamic phase transition, independent of the computational circuit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within our approach the solution of the computation is encoded in the ground state of the vertex model and its complexity is reflected in the dynamics of the relaxation of the system to its ground state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use thermal annealing with and without learning to explore typical computational problems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also construct a mapping of the vertex model into the Chimera architecture of the D-Wave machine, initiating an approach to reversible classical computation based on state-of-the-art implementations of quantum annealing.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Throughout the past few decades, problems of computer science have become subjects of intense interest to theoretical physicists as paradigms of complex systems that could benefit from theoretical approaches and insights inspired by statistical physics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include neural networks, Boltzmann machines and deep learning, compressed sensing, satisfiability problems and a host of other approaches to data mining and machine learning1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interest in the constraints on computation and information processing placed by physical laws is even older and dates to work by Landauer and Bennett5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the holy grails at the interface between physics and computer science is the physical realization of a large-scale quantum computer in which the processing of information makes use of quantum-mechanical concepts such as superposition and entanglement8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, building a quantum computer remains a challenging task because of the practical difficulty associated with maintaining coherence over the duration of the computation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This paper aims at bringing a new class of problems to the physicscomputer science interface by introducing a two-dimensional (2D) representation of a generic reversible classical computation, the result of which is encoded in the ground state of a statistical mechanics vertex model with appropriate boundary conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vertex model is defined in terms of Boolean variables (or spins degrees of freedom) placed on the bonds or links of an anisotropic 2D lattice with vertices representing logic gates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding gate constraints are implemented through short-ranged one- and two-body interactions involving the spins of the vertex (as we show, this construction can be realized in physical programmable machines, such as the D-Wave machine.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One direction of the lattice represents computational (rather than real) time, as introduced by Feynman in the history representation of quantum computation10, but here used for classical reversible circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two boundaries of the lattice transverse to the time direction contain the input and output bits of the computation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to stress that we are not limiting ourselves to forward computations with fixed inputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More interesting are problems in which only partial information about both inputs and outputs is known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In that case, reaching the ground state requires flow of information both forwards and backwards across the lattice, processes that are naturally built into our approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The idea of encoding classical computation in the ground state of a many body spin model was introduced earlier for irreversible computation in refs 11, 12, 13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we focus on reversible rather than irreversible computation to address problems with both fixed-input and mixed-boundary conditions on inputs and outputs, as explained above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mapping onto a regular 2D lattice as opposed to an arbitrary graph allows us to use intuitive ideas from equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, especially of classical and quantum phase transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, while in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12 an error correction scheme was required to implement fault tolerant computation, in our approach accurate computation without error correction is possible below moderate temperatures that scale only as the inverse of the logarithm of the system size, a consequence of the exponential scaling of the static correlation length with inverse temperature (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Most importantly, the mapping proposed here defines statistical mechanics vertex models that, irrespective of the computation they represent, display no bulk thermodynamic transition down to zero temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus our work emphasizes that the dynamics of relaxation to the ground state rather than the thermodynamics of the model is essential for understanding the complexity of ground-state computation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The absence of a thermodynamical phase transition removes an obvious impediment to reaching the ground state of the vertex model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, a suboptimal mapping from a computational problem into a physical system may place the solution within a glassy phase, even in the case of easy computational problems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mapping of XORSAT (a problem in P) into a diluted p-spin model is such an example14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that our vertex model is free of thermodynamic transitions does not mean that the ground state can be reached easily.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This remains true even for problems with unique solutions which are encoded by vertex models with unique ground states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such problems are in the complexity class UNIQUE-SAT, which under randomized reduction is as hard as SAT15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, even in the absence of a thermodynamic transition finding the unique ground state of vertex models encoding problems with a single solution is a problem in NP-complete16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of course, this does not mean that one cannot benefit from speed-ups allowed by either physics inspired heuristics or by special-purpose physical hardware, such as quantum annealers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This paper focuses on the study of vertex-model representations of random circuits for which the complexity of the computation is reflected in the concentration of TOFFOLI gates, the length of the input and output boundaries L and the depth of the circuit W. We concentrate on computational problems with a single solutionor problems for which one can discern among an (1) number of solutions with a small overheada class of problems that encompass factoring of semi-primes, an important and nontrivial example that we shall explore in a future publication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In our discussion of dynamics we deploy thermal annealing as well as introduce a more efficient annealing with learning protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter translates into an algorithm for solving classical problems for which, as expected, forward computation from a fixed-input boundary reaches solution in a time linear in the depth of the computational circuit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we note that reaching the ground state of the vertex model could be accelerated by replacing classical annealing with quantum annealing19,20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While approaching computational problems through quantum annealing is left for future investigations, the current paper includes the formal derivation of the quantum version of the statistical mechanics model of reversible classical computation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provides the background for an explicit mapping of our lattice model onto the Chimera architecture of the D-Wave machine, a development that points to the potential usefulness of the vertex model as a programming platform for special purpose quantum annealers.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The results of this paper were motivated by an attempt to use our statistical mechanics intuition about lattice models of spin systems to uncover some of the salient features of universal classical reversible computation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are questions posed and open problems raised by these studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we list four that we find most important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'First, one should understand the scaling of time-to-solution of the various schemes discussed here, including those that utilize learning, as a function of input size and depth for specific computational problems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under a trivial reduction scheme, one can solve problems with two solutions using similar annealing with learning techniques that we deployed for problems with a unique solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an important application we are already investigating the problem of the factorization of semi-primes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scaling properties of the time-to-solution in the context of this concrete and relevant problem should be contrasted to that obtained in the random circuit with the same concentration of TOFFOLI gates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A second question raised by our work is the nature of the zero-temperature quantum phase transition encountered in the quantum vertex model, as depicted in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated that, in the limit of the trivial computational circuit with no TOFFOLI gates, this transition is second order, in direct analogy to the case of the one-dimensional Ising model in a transverse magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether the transition remains second order or becomes first order for realistic computations (corresponding to a finite concentration of TOFFOLIs) has very important consequences for solutions of computational problems via quantum annealing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Third, the computational problems discussed here should also be studied directly in a bona fide quantum annealer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important result of this paper is the programming of generic reversible computational circuits into the Chimera architecture of the D-Wave machine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This paves the way for using this type of hardware to study annealing protocols along the  axis, as well as arbitrary directions in the T plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach should also be used as a guide to the development of alternative machine architectures optimized for direct implementations of the vertex model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, we close with a brief discussion of the broader implications of the mapping of reversible classical computation onto the vertex model on the individual disciplines of computer science and physics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As already mentioned earlier, the line of argumentation in this paper follows a physics perspective, namely, it concentrates on typical behaviour based on heuristic approach to explicit instantiations of the vertex model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Computer science could benefit from further work on more sophisticated theoretical and computational heuristic approaches, special purpose hardware (that is, quantum annealers), and new formal proofs that rely on statistical mechanics representations of computational problems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time there are lessons to be learned from computer science that we believe may have interesting implications for physics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, if NPP, the vertex model representing the hardest problems in UNIQUE-SAT can be also viewed as describing a physical glassy system that displays slow dynamics even though the model involves no frustrating interactions, has a unique non-degenerate ground state, and displays no bulk thermodynamic transitions down to zero temperature!  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are known examples of systems with glassy dynamics in the absence of a thermodynamic phase transition, such as the kinetically constrained models discussed in refs 30, 31, 32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the non-Arrhenius relaxation characteristic of these models only translate into a quasi-polynomial time-to-solution of a computational problem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, within the vertex model approach, the existence of hard UNIQUE-SAT problems with exponential or sub-exponential behaviour of the time-to-solution would suggest the existence of a novel family of glassy physical systems without a thermodynamic transition but with exponentially large barriers and corresponding astronomically long relaxation times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This example underscores the richness of the possibilities opened by explorations of the vertex model of classical computation and more generally, of problems at the interface between physics and computer science.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
