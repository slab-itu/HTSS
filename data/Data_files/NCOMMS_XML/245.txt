Therapeutic targeting and rapid mobilization of endosteal HSC using a small molecule integrin antagonist  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The inherent disadvantages of using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) mobilization have driven efforts to identify alternate strategies based on single doses of small molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show targeting 91/41 integrins with a single dose of a small molecule antagonist (BOP (N-(benzenesulfonyl)-L-prolyl-L-O-(1-pyrrolidinylcarbonyl)tyrosine)) rapidly mobilizes long-term multi-lineage reconstituting HSC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synergistic engraftment augmentation is observed when BOP is co-administered with AMD3100.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Impressively, HSC in equal volumes of peripheral blood (PB) mobilized with this combination effectively out-competes PB mobilized with G-CSF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enhanced mobilization observed using BOP and AMD3100 is recapitulated in a humanized NODSCIDIL2R/ model, demonstrated by a significant increase in PB CD34+ cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a related fluorescent analogue of BOP (R-BC154), we show that this class of antagonists preferentially bind human and mouse HSC and progenitors via endogenously primed/activated 91/41 within the endosteal niche.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results support using dual 91/41 inhibitors as effective, rapid and transient mobilization agents with promising clinical applications.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The transplant of mobilized peripheral blood (PB) hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) into patients undergoing treatment for blood diseases has essentially replaced traditional bone marrow (BM) transplants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current clinical practice for HSC mobilization is achieved with an extended course of recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which stimulates the production of proteases that cleave many interactions including CXCR4/SDF-1 (refs 1, 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, G-CSF-based mobilization requires multiple doses over a number of days, is known to alter the function of the HSC niche as well as bone formation3, can cause bone pain and spleen enlargement and on rare occasions G-CSF results in splenic rupture, myocardial infarction or cerebral ischaemia (reviewed in refs 4, 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These inherent disadvantages of G-CSF have driven efforts to identify alternate mobilization strategies based on the use of single doses of small molecules6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) antagonist AMD3100 (Plerixafor; MozobilTM) has been shown to rapidly mobilize HSC with limited toxicity issues8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, clinical mobilization with AMD3100 is only effective in combination with G-CSF and the search for rapid, selective and G-CSF-independent mobilization regimes remains a topic of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'HSC regulation and retention within the BM stem cell niche is mediated through multiple interactions between HSC surface receptors and their respective ligands expressed or secreted by surrounding cells: including osteoblasts, sinusoidal endothelial cells and perivascular cells (reviewed in refs 10, 11, 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional analysis of BM HSC demonstrate those with the greatest hematopoietic potential, which preferentially localize in the endosteal region (12 cell diameters from the bone surface13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, HSC identical for the classic LinSca-1+ckit+CD150+CD48 phenotype, but isolated from endosteal BM have greater homing potential and enhanced long-term, multi-lineage hematopoietic reconstitution relative to HSC isolated from the central medullary cavity14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the therapeutic targeting of endosteal HSC for mobilization should provide better transplant outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Both 41 (VLA-4) and 91 expressed by HSC have been implicated in niche retention through binding to thrombin-cleaved osteopontin (trOpn) in the endosteal region15,16 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) expressed by BM stromal cells17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the role of 91 in HSC mobilization is unknown, the down regulation of Opn using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as well as targeting 4 (for example, 41 antagonist BIO5192) with or without AMD3100 or G-CSF have validated trOpn/VCAM-1 binding to integrins as effective targets for HSC mobilization6,18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the lack of suitable blocking antibodies and selective small molecules directed towards 91 has hindered our understanding of 91-dependent HSC mobilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the specific cell types targeted for mobilization, as well as their location in BM have not previously been investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We recently developed a fluorescent integrin antagonist, R-BC154 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21) based on the small molecule N-(benzenesulfonyl)-L-prolyl-L-O-(1-pyrrolidinylcarbonyl)tyrosine22 (BOP), which we previously demonstrated to bind effectively to 91 and 41 integrins in the presence of divalent metal cations21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the interaction between 91/41 and trOpn being restricted to endosteal BM, we postulated that this family of compounds would target potent endosteal HSC for mobilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, we show that R-BC154 and BOP preferentially bind endosteally located human and murine BM HSC and progenitors in vitro and in vivo and this binding is highly dependent on 91.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, administration of a single dose of BOP results in the rapid and preferential mobilization of HSC and progenitors in mice and humanized mouse models, and is synergistically augmented when used in combination with AMD3100.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When BOP is co-administered with AMD3100, greater mobilization is observed relative to AMD3100 in combination with the selective 41 antagonist BIO5192, identifying an active role for 91 in small molecule-mediated mobilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single dose of BOP and AMD3100 is also shown to mobilize HSC with greater long-term repopulation potential than HSC following a 4-day G-CSF regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our results show therapeutic targeting of BM HSC using 91/41 inhibitors either alone or in combination with AMD3100 offers promising alternatives to current mobilization strategies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'R-BC154 and BIO5192 reveals specific binding to HSC 91', 'To assess the specific targeting of 91 on HSC by small molecule antagonists, we developed an in vitro assay using the selective and potent (Kd less_than 10 pM) 41 antagonist BIO5192 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23), the dual 91/41 antagonist BOP and its fluorescent analogue R-BC154 (Fig 1a); which we have demonstrated to efficiently bind to both human21 and murine (Supplementary Fig 1a) 91 and 41 integrins in a divalent metal cation-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in contrast to BIO5192, which binds 41 in the presence and absence of divalent metal cations23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The co-labelling of both human and murine 91/41 with R-BC154 and excess BIO5192 allowed the specific detection of binding to 91 (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, R-BC154 labelling in combination with excess BOP completely inhibited R-BC154 binding to both human and murine 91/41 integrins (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the ubiquitous expression of 41 on all hematopoietic cells, the combination of R-BC154 with BIO5192 provides a convenient method of measuring specific binding to 91 on hematopoietic stem and progenitors.

quiescence16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether dual 91/41 antagonists bind human HSC via 91, R-BC154 binding to cord blood (CB) mononuclear cells (MNC) was assessed and shown to be divalent cation and dose dependent, and saturable (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of CB HSC (CD34+CD38), progenitors (CD34+CD38+) and lineage-committed cells (CD34CD38+) (Fig 1e) revealed high R-BC154 binding to HSC and progenitors, but only modest binding to committed cells in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+/Mg2+ (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, co-incubation of these populations with R-BC154 in combination with BIO5192 demonstrated partial inhibition of R-BC154 binding to HSC and progenitors (reflective of binding via both 91 and 41) and complete inhibition of binding to lineage-committed cells (reflective of binding only via 41) (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, as BOP effectively binds both 91 and 41, its addition resulted in complete inhibition of R-BC154 binding to all cell populations (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data demonstrate a significant proportion of R-BC154 binding to HSC and progenitors via 91, while binding to committed cells is mediated exclusively through 41 (Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition, R-BC154 efficiently bound HSC and progenitors isolated from human BM in the presence of Ca2+/Mg2+(Fig 1h) and similarly to that evident with CB cells, the majority of this binding was via 91 compared with committed cells that primarily bound via 41 (Fig 1i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are consistent with the high 91 expression evident on human BM HSC and progenitors (Fig 1j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'R-BC154 binding to human HSC was further evaluated using humanized NODSCIDIL2R/ (huNSG) mice (Supplementary Fig 1b)24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  R-BC154-bound human BM-committed cells, progenitors and HSC in the presence of Ca2+/Mg2+ (Fig 1k), but significant binding through 91 only occurred on HSC (Fig 1l), which is consistent with 91 expression being restricted to HSC (Fig 1m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, 41 was highly expressed on all three populations (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The ubiquitous expression of 41 on hematopoietic cells, together with the restricted expression of 91 on HSC resulted in an additive R-BC154 binding to HSC relative to progenitors and committed cells (Supplementary Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, single-cell correlation analysis of scaled fluorescence intensity values for both R-BC154 binding to 91 in the presence of BIO5192 (to prevent any binding to 41) and 91 expression (Supplementary Fig 1e) shows a positive correlation in specific binding of BOP to 91 on CB HSC with the expression of 91.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together these data highlight the potential for human HSC and/or progenitors to be targeted in preference to lineage-committed cells using selective 91 antagonists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Consistent with their human counterparts, analysis of R-BC154 binding to murine BM progenitors and HSC (Supplementary Fig 1f; Fig 1n) revealed this to be cation (Supplementary Fig 1g) and 4/9 (Supplementary Fig 1h) dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly to their human counterparts, a significant proportion of R-BC154 binding to murine HSC was via 91 whereas binding to lineage-committed cells was mediated primarily through 41 (Fig 1o).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'R-BC154 binding to murine BM progenitors and HSC was confirmed in vivo following subcutaneous administration of R-BC154, with similar levels of binding to that observed in the presence of exogenous Ca2+/Mg2+ in vitro (Supplementary Fig 1i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specific and reversible nature of R-BC154 binding in vivo was confirmed by efficient displacement of in situ-bound R-BC154 with the addition of excess competing BOP in vitro (Supplementary Fig 1j,k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Endosteal HSC 91/41 are endogenously activated', 'To date, a number of studies have demonstrated integrins adopt three conformational states: (1) inactive or low affinity; (2) activated (primed) or high affinity; and (3) ligand occupied (reviewed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This integrin activity is regulated via both inside-out activation or outside-in activation26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the BM stem cell niche, the regulation of integrins on HSC is complex and has not been accurately mimicked or recapitulated in vitro28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we have previously shown that the region in which BM HSC reside has a profound influence on their function, with HSC isolated from the endosteal region having higher hematopoietic potential than their central counterparts14,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whilst the mechanisms of these differences remain poorly understood, significant differences in cellular and extracellular matrix molecules have been described in different BM regions, many of which are likely to play a role30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To determine whether 91/41 integrins expressed by HSC and progenitors within different regions of BM are differentially primed/activated in situ, R-BC154 binding to endosteal and central human BM HSC in huNSG mice was assessed (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Endosteal huCD34+ cells isolated from huNSG mice injected subcutaneously with R-BC154 exhibited significantly greater binding than their central counterparts (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, when huNSG BM cells from either endosteal or central regions were labelled with R-BC154 in vitro in the absence of exogenous cations, only binding to endosteal progenitors and HSC was detected (Fig 2c,d) although no differences in the expression of 91 or 41 was evident on cells from the central or endosteal BM regions (Supplementary Fig 1l).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, R-BC154 binding in the absence of exogenous cations was also restricted to murine HSC and progenitors harvested from endosteal BM (Fig 2e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data demonstrate that integrins expressed by endosteal stem and progenitors are endogenously activated or primed and remain in this ligand-binding receptive conformational state post harvest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: R-BC154

endosteal BM region, differences in 91/41 activation states may in part be due to the binding of their ligands, such as trOpn, which we have previously demonstrated to be restricted to this region16.

#@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, bone is elastichigh/Comptonhigh/calciumhigh while marrow cells are elasticlow/Comptonhigh/calciumlow (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurement of calcium in BM demonstrated a distinct concentration gradient, emanating from the endosteal bone/BM interface and decreasing towards the central BM and central vein (Fig 2g,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  XFM was unable to distinguish magnesium due to strong absorption of Mg K shell fluorescence by the air path and the intense Fe K shell fluorescence severely limited sensitivity to manganese.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition, BM magnesium, manganese and calcium content were assessed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), which revealed a greater abundance of calcium and manganese in endosteal extracellular fluid relative to central BM (Fig 2i) as well calcium, magnesium and manganese bound to the cellular membranes of endosteal cells relative to central BM cells (Fig 2j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure the accuracy of these measurements, the proportion of each cation that was mechanically released by grinding the bone to isolate the endosteal cells was measured and subtracted from the raw extracellular measurements (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the ability of the combination of these mechanically released cation concentrations to activate integrins on central BM cells was assessed by measuring the binding of R-BC154 to progenitors and HSC after treatment with the endosteal extracellular fluid (as assessed in Fig 2i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a further control, the measured concentrations of mechanically released cations were added to central marrow cells and their ability to activate integrins resulting in the binding of R-BC154 assessed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No evidence of R-BC154 was detected under any of these conditions (Supplementary Fig 2b) confirming the endogenous activation of integrins before cell isolation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In contrast, the concentrations of these three cations located intracellularly was equivalent in cells located in the endosteal and central BM regions (Fig 2k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data demonstrate higher concentrations of divalent metal cations required for integrin function within endosteal BM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with extracellular matrix (ECM) ligands such as trOpn or VCAM-1 and other cytokines, this would result in integrins on endosteal HSC being maintained in an activated/primed/ligand-occupied conformational binding state, thus potentially forming the mechanism underpinning

significant increases in total WBC (Supplementary Fig 2h) but only a moderate 2.4-fold increase in progenitors and 1.4-fold increase in HSC compared with BIO5192 alone (Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in stark contrast to the combination of BOP and AMD3100, which mobilized significantly greater numbers of progenitors and HSC (Fig 3f) despite inducing similar PB WBC counts (Supplementary Fig 2h).

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mobilization of HSC and progenitors for PB stem cell transplants has been clinically adopted for over 30 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In normal healthy donors, HSC mobilization is used in over three-quarters of allogeneic transplants and is predominantly achieved using standard multi-dose G-CSF over several days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In recent times, significant advances have been made to address the shortcomings of G-CSF (reviewed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  45) such as the development of CXCR4 antagonists including the FDA-approved AMD3100 (refs 8, 9) and experimental agents such as ALT-1188 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38) and TG-0054 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For mobilizing healthy donors, identifying novel agents that effectively, safely, rapidly and selectively mobilize HSC in a single dose remains clinically important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'HSC are known to express a large number of integrins including 41 and 91, which have critical roles in HSC regulation in BM16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have confirmed that the inhibition of integrin 41 and VCAM-1 interactions using neutralizing antibodies or specific small molecule inhibitors effectively mobilize HSC in both mice and primates6,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the role of the related 91 in this context is unexplored, in large part due to the lack of effective anti-9-blocking antibodies that target HSC in vivo or specific 9-targeting small molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given the role 41 plays in HSC mobilization and the fact that 9 and 4 share several ligands including VCAM-1 and trOpn, a role for 91 in HSC mobilization would not be unexpected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously, in vitro studies using 9-blocking antibodies were found to inhibit CD34+ cell proliferation, differentiation and adhesion to primary osteoblasts47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we demonstrated 91/trOpn interactions are potently chemotactic for HSC and blocking antibodies directed to 91 completely inhibits the migration of HSC in vitro16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  91 has also been reported to mediate G-CSF receptor signalling pathways and contribute to granulopoiesis, as mice lacking 9 have reduced BM granulocyte precursors as well as impaired neutrophil development in response to G-CSF48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we demonstrate targeting of 91/41 using a single dose of BOP22, induces rapid mobilization of long-term repopulating HSC through inhibiting integrin-dependent binding, most likely to trOpn15,16 and VCAM-1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the fluorescent BOP analogue, R-BC154, we demonstrate a significant proportion of binding to human and murine HSC occurs through 91, whereas binding to lineage-committed cells is almost exclusively through 41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, inhibition of 91 was found to provide an added advantage to HSC mobilization yields over inhibition of 41 alone as demonstrated by the significantly greater mobilization of HSC and progenitors using BOP in comparison to the selective 41 antagonist BIO5192; particularly when used in combination with AMD3100.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduced synergism in HSC mobilization, but not WBC mobilization using BIO5192 in combination with AMD3100 compared with BOP in combination with AMD3100 supports targeting 4 biases towards progenitor mobilization whereas targeting 9 preferentially mobilizes HSC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pronounced increase in AMD3100-mediated mobilization using BOP relative to BIO5192 suggests the role of integrin 91 in HSC mobilization is magnified with concomitant targeting of CXCR4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As expected, with the distinct mechanisms of action between BOP, AMD3100 and G-CSF, the combination of these three agents resulted in the greatest increase in LSK and LSKSLAM mobilization when compared with any other combination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, BOP in combination with G-CSF and AMD3100 is likely to have significant advantages over mobilization using the combination of G-CSF and AMD3100; although further research is required to define the functional capacity of these mobilized blood products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, the combination of G-CSF and AMD3100 is most commonly used in autologous transplants, as the combination is effective and superior to G-CSF alone49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in a clinical context, the use of AMD3100 has advantages compared with G-CSF, as it directly targets HSC, without altering the function of the HSC niche, or bone formation3, which is especially important for the mobilization of normal donors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, the use of BOP, which also directly targets HSC, will be most advantageous in combination with AMD3100 as opposed to BOP alone, as a potential rapid, single dose alternative to G-CSF for the specific targeting of HSC in the mobilization of normal donors for allogeneic transplants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have previously shown BM HSC residing within the endosteal region exhibit greater hematopoietic potential than HSC isolated from the central medullary region14,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The functional characteristics of the endosteal BM have been a topic of great interest since the concept of a stem cell niche was originally postulated by Schofield50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies highlighted the endosteal niche as a hypoxic environment51 where cells such as osteoblasts52,53, endothelial cells54, perivascular cells12, megakaryocytes55 as well as their associated ECM proteins are important regulators of HSC maintenance and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, we show HSC and progenitors isolated from the endosteal region express 91/41 that are in a higher affinity, ligand-primed binding conformation relative to cells from the central compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the physiological relevance of this differential integrin activity remains unknown, these observations are consistent with previous reports that HSC-dependent binding between trOpn and 41 and 91 is restricted to endosteal BM15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One possible explanation for the enhanced priming/activation of integrins on HSC in endosteal BM are their close proximity to bone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bone has a very high mineral content and is the primary storage site of the inorganic salts of calcium and magnesium as well as trace metals such as manganese56,57: all of which are known to play a role in 91 and 41 adopting the conformational changes required for ligand binding21,22,58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using XFM and quantitative ICP-MS, we demonstrate that endosteal BM harbours a significantly greater concentration of elemental calcium, magnesium and manganese relative to the central medullary region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data strongly suggest this high divalent metal ion content plays a previously unrecognized role in differential integrin priming/activation within BM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although direct evidence of divalent metal concentration gradients in BM have not been reported until now, the concept has previously been invoked to rationalize the preferential localization of HSC within endosteal BM via recognition of extracellular Ca2+ through the G protein-coupled calcium-sensing receptor59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these observations further define the unique nature of the endosteal niche, the differential influence it confers in seemingly phenotypically identical cells and provides validation for therapeutic targeting of the endosteal stem cell niche for stem cell therapies60,61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'G-CSF induces the mobilization of BM HSC and progenitors by causing a cytokine storm that results in the cleavage of key retentive HSC interactions such as CXCR4/SDF-1 (refs 1, 2) and VCAM-1/41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, evidence supports G-CSF and/or chemotherapy treatment causing a reduction in the homing and engraftment potential of mobilized PB compared with BM HSC, which has been suggested to be due to disruption of the HSC microenvironment62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, previous studies in mice showed G-CSF-mobilized PB LSK cells have reduced colony-forming capacity and long-term reconstitution potential compared with their untreated BM counterparts43,63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in healthy human donors mobilized using G-CSF, apheresis products contained reduced frequencies of NOD/SCID repopulating cells compared with AMD3100-mobilized PB from the same donors64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current study adds to these findings, demonstrating G-CSF mobilizes proportionally more phenotypic LSK progenitors than LSKSLAM HSC and following a transplant of equal volumes of mobilized PB, the use of G-CSF resulted in a reduced capacity to sustain long-term hematopoiesis relative to mobilized PB using the combination of BOP and AMD3100.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results support previous findings that G-CSF-mobilized HSC and progenitors have reduced in vitro and in vivo capacity relative to their well-defined BM counterparts in steady state43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Variability observed with HSC mobilization following G-CSF is well documented, both within patients and in different mouse strains65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, BALB/c mice are effectively mobilized by G-CSF, whereas C57BL/6 mice are considered poor mobilizers39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the NODSCIDIL2R/ mouse model has routinely and successfully been used to assess the hematopoietic potential of human HSC and progenitors24, previous studies have not assessed the ability of G-CSF to effectively mobilize CD34+ cells in humanized NODSCIDIL2R/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current data demonstrate significant impairment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the combination of BOP and AMD3100 resulted in significant mobilization of human CD34+ cells, suggesting the use of this strategy may be effective in clinical mobilization of human donors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we demonstrate that a single dose of BOP, a small molecule targeting 41 and 91 integrins, effectively and rapidly mobilizes HSC with long-term multi-lineage engraftment potential, identifying a previously unrecognized role for 91 in HSC mobilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When used in combination with CXCR4 inhibitors such as AMD3100, significantly enhanced mobilization of long-term repopulating HSC was observed relative to G-CSF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The efficacy of HSC mobilization using the BOP and AMD3100 combination was recapitulated in the mobilization of CD34+ cells in humanized NODSCIDIL2R/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the related fluorescently labelled integrin antagonist R-BC154, we show that this class of compounds bind murine and human HSC and progenitors via endogenously activated/primed 41 and 91 within the endosteal niche.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we show that the majority of R-BC154/BOP binding to human HSC occurs via 91, which is absent on lineage-committed cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results highlight an effective and convenient strategy of therapeutically targeting endosteal HSC which address many of the shortcomings associated with G-CSF and paves the way for the development of additional selective small molecule 91 integrin antagonists for preferential HSC mobilization.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
