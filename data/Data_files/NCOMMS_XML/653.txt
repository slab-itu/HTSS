Quantum enhanced feedback cooling of a mechanical oscillator using nonclassical light  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Laser cooling is a fundamental technique used in primary atomic frequency standards, quantum computers, quantum condensed matter physics and tests of fundamental physics, among other areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been known since the early 1990s that laser cooling can, in principle, be improved by using squeezed light as an electromagnetic reservoir; while quantum feedback control using a squeezed light probe is also predicted to allow improved cooling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show the implementation of quantum feedback control of a micro-mechanical oscillator using squeezed probe light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allows quantum-enhanced feedback cooling with a measurement rate greater than it is possible with classical light, and a consequent reduction in the final oscillator temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results have significance for future applications in areas ranging from quantum information networks, to quantum-enhanced force and displacement measurements and fundamental tests of macroscopic quantum mechanics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Real-time quantum feedback control1 often involves time-continuous measurements of a quantum state followed by control of a physical system with the aim of steering that system into a desired state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such control has been demonstrated in numerous experiments, including the preparation of microwave Fock states2 and the generation of deterministic entanglement in quantum superconducting circuits3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantum feedback control also allows the control of motional states via continuous measurements of a probe field followed by actuation back on the motional degree of freedom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been used to steer single trapped atoms4, levitated microspheres5, micromechanical oscillators6,7 and suspended kilogram-scale mirrors8 towards their motional ground states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, quantum feedback control was proposed as a means to prepare both mechanical Fock9 and superposition states10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to-date, all such experiments have used a classical probe field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The use of a nonclassical probe field for quantum control can both increase the effectiveness of steering to the desired quantum state and introduce new functionalities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, it can be used to prepare a mechanical oscillator in a non-Gaussian quantum state even in the linear coupling regime11,12,13, thereby circumventing the usual requirement to reach the single-photon strong coupling regime14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, quantum feedback control using squeezed light can enable an efficient interface for quantum information networks15,16, and allow the standard quantum limit of force measurements to be surpassed via squeezing-enhanced measurements17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate the first critical step towards such functionalities by realising a quantum-enhanced cooling rate using a squeezed probe field and real-time feedback control of a mechanical mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The basic idea is to continuously monitor the position of the mechanical oscillator and subsequently use the measurement record to steer the oscillator towards the ground state with real-time feedback18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cooling rate is limited by the precision with which the position of the oscillator can be monitored, which in turn is often limited by the noise of the tracking laser beam19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, by engineering the quantum state of the laser beam to reduce the measurement noise, an enhanced cooling rate can be expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using squeezed light with variance Vsqz to continuously monitor the mechanical motion, a feedback loop with signal detection efficiency , an overall detection efficiency d for the squeezed light, and feedback gain GFb, can lower the temperature to', '', 'where Vd is the detected variance dVsqz+(1d)/2, T0 is the equilibrium temperature of the mechanical oscillator before feedback cooling, nth the corresponding mean phonon occupancy and we have neglected radiation pressure induced heating due to the measurement process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering a cavity optomechanical system with cavity energy decay rate  and mechanical dissipation rate m, the linearized interaction is characterized by the cooperativity , where g0 is the single-photon optomechanical coupling strength and Nc the mean intra-cavity photon number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the feedback gain is increased, the temperature drops, reaching a minimum for .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At higher gain, the oscillator begins to heat up due to the imparted measurement noise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In essence, the application of squeezed measurement noise acts to shift this onset of heating to higher gain values, thereby allowing cooling to temperatures below the shot noise imposed limit, as illustrated in Fig 1d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, the improved cooling efficiency can be appreciated as a consequence of an increased measurement rate , resulting from the squeezing-enhanced signal-to-noise ratio of the transduced mechanical motion20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison to a coherent state probe, the improvement is directly given by the degree of squeezing as sqz/coh=(2Vd)1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the measurement rate is intimately related to the ability to achieve ground state cooling, requiring thmnth, squeezing-enhanced feedback cooling can greatly relax the structural requirements for the mechanical oscillator and thereby facilitate the preparation of macroscopic oscillators in their motional ground state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that improved cooling can be also realised by increasing the power of the probe beam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is challenging, in practice, to achieve cooling rates sufficient for ground state cooling due to localized bulk heating introduced by absorption of the probe field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Experimental and conceptual details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Sketch of the experimental setup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanical motion in a microtoroid was sensed using a squeezed or coherent state coupled evanescently to the microtoroid via a tapered fibre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrical output of a homodyne detector was bandpass filtered around the mechanical resonance frequency, delayed, amplified and fed back to the mechanical resonator via an electrical actuator.

'Implementation of the optomechanical system', 'The experimental setup for squeezed light enhanced feedback cooling is shown in Fig 1a and a scanning electron micrograph of the optomechanical systema microtoroidal resonatoris displayed in Fig 1b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To demonstrate the principle of quantum-enhanced feedback cooling, we chose to work with the fundamental flexural mode of the microtoroid, highlighted in Fig 1c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanical resonance frequency of the mode was m/2=6.13 MHz, well within the 9 MHz bandwidth of our feedback loop, and its effective mass was determined to be 10 g via finite element modelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the optically read out position power spectral density, shown in Fig 1c the damping rate was characterized to be m/2=13 kHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the predominantly vertical motion (shown in the finite element model in Fig 1c) of the fundamental flexural mode reduces the strength with which it couples to the optical field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the coupling is sufficient for our proof-of-principle demonstration, stronger couplingsufficient to enter the quantum-coherent coupling regime21can be achieved using a radial breathing mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was precluded in our case, since the resonance frequency 50 MHz of this mode laid outside of our available control bandwidth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cooling with a coherent- or squeezed probe', 'In the first experiment, we implemented feedback cooling using coherent states of light with a power of 8.5 W. The results are illustrated in Fig 2a (left), where we cooled from a temperature of 295 K down to the limit set by the imprecision noise corresponding to the quantum noise of a coherent state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We carefully characterized the noise floor through attenuation measurements and balanced detection to verify that it is of true quantum origin, that is, pure vacuum noise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the feedback gain is increased, the temperature of the mechanical mode is decreased to 149 K. Increasing the gain further leads to heating of the oscillator as the shot noise of the probing field dominates the control22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Experimental data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Evolution of the resonance under different gain settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Left: Coherent state probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Right: Squeezed state probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spectra are corrected for detector dark noise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The grey plane represents the optical shot noise level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectra are arranged proportional to the electronic gain that was set for the recording.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solid black lines stem from fits to a Lorentzian distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Phase space trajectory of the mechanical oscillators position, normalized to shot noise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the bandwidth of the detector was much larger than the mechanical dissipation rate, it was possible to monitor the thermal evolution of the oscillator in real-time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  | and | refer to the coherent- and squeezed-state probe, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thin red circles represent the standard deviation of the distribution recorded with |, green circles visualize the same quantity when the mechanical mode is probed with |.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presented signals are low-pass filtered around the resonance frequency m with a bandwidth equal to mechanical dissipation rate m.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The absolute cooling achieved in the present demonstration is only modest compared with state-of-the-art7, the main limitations being the relatively poor optomechanical cooperativity provided by the flexural mode and the requirement for operating in the under-coupled regime to preserve squeezing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Considerable improvements in cooling performance can be expected by using an optomechanical system with enhanced cooperativity, and realising higher coupling and detection efficiencies for the squeezed mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, operating the system of Wilson et al.7 in the under-coupled regime (C/nc=0.62 at a coupling efficiency of 0.028, where nc is the intra-cavity photon number of 104) so that the injected squeezed light reflects from the cavity with high efficiency, with unity detection efficiency, and starting from 650 mK, enables cooling to an occupation number nth=1.7 phonons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a squeezed probe with an input squeezing of 9 dB, the occupation number could be lowered to nth=0.4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that achieving close to unity detection efficiency is challenging for current quantum optomechanics experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This presents a serious constraint for quantum feedback control experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, with the experimentally realised efficiency reported by Wilson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of =23%, even when achieving a cooperativity Cnth, the minimum mechanical occupancy that could be achieved with coherent light20 is .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, while squeezed light is degraded by inefficiencies, it also provides a mechanism to mitigate them in feedback control experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If amplitude- rather than phase squeezing is used, the contribution of vacuum noise entering the phase quadrature due to inefficiencies is suppressed relative to the amplified noise of the phase quadrature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This results in a higher effective efficiency for feedback control experiments of eff=(1+(1)/(2Vsqz)1), where we assume a minimum uncertainty state with squeezing variance Vsqz (Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We see that when Vsqz(1)/(2), eff approaches unity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an example, assuming an intra-cavity phase anti-squeezing variance 9 dB above shot noise, the effective feedback cooling efficiency of Wilson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  could be increased to eff=0.7, allowing, in principle, feedback cooling to an occupancy of nmin=0.1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We anticipate that the full benefit of squeezing-enhanced feedback cooling could be harnessed using recently developed tethered membrane mechanical oscillators24 in conjunction with a high-quality optical cavity, or alternatively, by implementation in state-of-the-art optomechanical systems in the microwave regime25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our demonstration of enhanced real-time quantum feedback exploiting squeezed-state enables a number of improvements in the field of quantum optomechanics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides the demonstrated cooling effect, it lays the foundation for more advanced schemes including squeezing-enhanced quantum back-action evasion which in turn can be used to prepare mechanically squeezed states in the weak coupling regime and for generation of non-Gaussian mechanical quantum states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an example, combining 10 dB of squeezing with active feedback in a pulsed backaction evading scheme13, it is possible to squeeze the mechanical oscillator by 10 dB for an interaction strength of , while for a coherent state input,  is required to squeeze the mechanics by the same amount.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, supplementing the scheme with photon-subtraction, the mechanics can be driven into a quantum non-Gaussian state even for a modest interaction strength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The control of nonclassical mechanical states will also allow for tests of quantum decoherence models and lead to new sensing technologies such as quantum magnetometry26, inertial sensing27 and force microscopy28.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
