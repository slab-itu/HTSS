Defective mitochondrial DNA homeostasis in the substantia nigra in Parkinson disease  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Increased somatic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutagenesis causes premature aging in mice, and mtDNA damage accumulates in the human brain with aging and neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson disease (PD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we study the complete spectrum of mtDNA changes, including deletions, copy-number variation and point mutations, in single neurons from the dopaminergic substantia nigra and other brain areas of individuals with Parkinson disease and neurologically healthy controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that in dopaminergic substantia nigra neurons of healthy individuals, mtDNA copy number increases with age, maintaining the pool of wild-type mtDNA population in spite of accumulating deletions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This upregulation fails to occur in individuals with Parkinson disease, however, resulting in depletion of the wild-type mtDNA population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, neuronal mtDNA point mutational load is not increased in Parkinson disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that dysregulation of mtDNA homeostasis is a key process in the pathogenesis of neuronal loss in Parkinson disease.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Somatic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage has been associated with both normal aging and neurodegeneration1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accelerated mtDNA mutagenesis causes a premature aging phenotype in mice2 and somatic mtDNA deletions have been shown to accumulate with advancing age in post-mitotic tissues including the brain, heart and skeletal muscle3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the brain, the dopaminergic substantia nigra is particularly susceptible to somatic mtDNA deletions, which accumulate there at substantially higher levels compared with other brainstem nuclei, deep grey structures, or the cerebral and cerebellar cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This predilection has led to the hypothesis that mtDNA damage plays a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease (PD)4,5, where neurodegeneration of the substantia nigra is the main pathological hallmark and widely accepted as the cause of the cardinal clinical features6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mtDNA deletions were shown to accumulate at similar levels in both individuals with PD and healthy controls however4, and therefore do not provide a sufficient explanation for the specific vulnerability of the substantia nigra in PD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice accumulating high levels of mtDNA deletion due to an error-prone mtDNA-polymerase (POLG) show a concomitant increase in mtDNA copy number which is associated with nigrostriatal survival and even resistance to mitochondrial respiratory chain complex-I inhibition7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a similar protective mechanism has not yet been identified in humans, the importance of mtDNA copy-number regulation is highlighted by the vulnerability of the substantia nigra in inherited mtDNA-depletion disorders8,9 and the increased risk of PD associated with genetic variation in genes encoding key factors of mtDNA maintenance, such as the mtDNA polymerase  (POLG) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM)10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the precise mechanism by which mtDNA copy-number loss contributes to brain aging and neurodegeneration remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We hypothesized that dopaminergic substantia nigra neurons in PD are rendered vulnerable to the effects of age-dependent mitochondrial mutagenesis due to an underlying dysregulation of mtDNA homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test our hypothesis, we employed an integrative approach to study the complete spectrum of mtDNA changes in individual neurons from individuals with PD and controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our sample was derived from a population-based, prospectively collected and extensively characterized cohort12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure our sample was homogenous and representative for sporadic PD, we excluded known monogenic causes of PD by whole-exome sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neuropathological examination confirmed Lewy-body disease in all PD samples, whereas control samples were negative for neurodegenerative markers (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results show that dopaminergic substantia nigra neurons of individuals with PD accumulate higher levels of somatic mtDNA deletions, but not point mutations, compared with age-matched controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in healthy individuals, mtDNA copy number increases with age, thus maintaining the pool of wild-type mtDNA population in spite of accumulating deletions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, mtDNA copy number does not increase in individuals with PD, resulting in depletion of the wild-type mtDNA population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that mtDNA homeostasis is impaired in the substantia nigra of individuals with PD.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'mtDNA copy number upregulation in aging substantia nigra', 'First we characterized age-dependent mtDNA changes in different neuronal populations from 21 controls aged 1187 years (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We studied single dopaminergic neurons from the ventrolateral tier (area A9) of the substantia nigra pars compacta, pyramidal neurons from the frontal cortex and Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion of mtDNA molecules harbouring major arc deletions showed a significant positive correlation with age in nigral neurons (r=0.39, P=1 × 106; Fig 2a), which is in line with previous reports4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total mtDNA copy number also increased with age (r=0.29, P=4 × 104; Fig 2b) and, strikingly, showed a significant positive correlation with the level of deletion in each neuron (r=0.40, P=2 × 106; Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to this concomitant copy number increase, absolute levels of wild-type (non-deleted) mtDNA did not decrease over time (r=0.03, P=0.3) in spite of progressively increasing proportion of deletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas both deletion and age appeared to correlate with mtDNA copy number, using a multiple linear regression model, we found that only deletion was a statistically significant predictor of copy number (model: r=0.40, R2=0.18, P=6.3 × 107; deletion: =0.34, P=6 × 105; age: =0.16,

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this work, we characterize the complete spectrum of neuronal mtDNA changes in aging and PD, and measure the range of mtDNA damage in the same neuron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that deletions and copy-number regulation, but not point mutations, are the main determinants of somatic, neuronal mtDNA damage in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we show that dynamic regulation of mtDNA copy number occurs in aging substantia nigra neurons allowing them to maintain their pool of wild-type mtDNA in spite of accumulating somatic deletions, similar to what was shown in the POLG mutator mouse7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, this compensation appears to be blunted in the context of PD resulting in depletion of the wild-type mtDNA pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe this may contribute to the respiratory deficiency observed in these neurons16, thus playing an important role in the cascade of neurodegeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The mechanism underlying the apparent impairment of mtDNA upregulation in PD could reflect a defect of overall mitochondrial biogenesis or mtDNA homeostasis specifically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our immunohistochemistry experiments in the substantia nigra detected no measurable difference in the neuronal protein levels of mitochondrial marker porin, or master activator of mitochondrial biogenesis PGC-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One limitation of these experiments is that immunohistochemistry has limited sensitivity and would not detect subtle changes of expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, these results suggest that there is no major impairment in overall mitochondrial biogenesis in PD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore more likely that the observed lack of mtDNA increase we found in PD reflects a defect in mtDNA homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in line with inherited disorders of mtDNA maintenance due to POLG or helicase Twinkle mutations, where the combination of mtDNA depletion and deletion without an overall change in mitochondrial mass leads to respiratory failure and severe substantia nigra degeneration8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Impaired mtDNA maintenance has indeed been shown to be particularly deleterious for the substantia nigra and more likely to cause nigrostriatal degeneration compared with other mitochondrial defects17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'mtDNA maintenance is mediated via a complex interaction of several molecular processes including mtDNA replication and repair, mitochondrial nucleotide pool maintenance, mitochondrial dynamics and quality control18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that impairment of one or more of these processes occurs in PD due to genetic variation and/or epigenetically mediated altered transcriptional regulation of the factors involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further research is warranted to uncover the mechanisms underlying abnormal mtDNA maintenance in the substantia nigra of individuals with PD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our findings appear to contradict recent reports of total mtDNA depletion20 and higher point mutational load21 in the brain of individuals with PD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since those studies were performed in tissue homogenate and not individual neurons, however, they are likely to be confounded by the substantial neuronal loss and gliosis in the PD samples, rather than reflect true changes in dopaminergic neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown that accurate determination of mtDNA quantity in neurodegeneration requires experiments in isolated neurons, and that measurements in homogenate can lead to substantially over- or underestimation of mtDNA quantity depending on underlying tissue pathology22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Another important advantage of our study over previous experiments is the ultra-deep coverage of our sequencing experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our high sequencing depth allowed the detection of variants down to a frequency of 0.1%, which, with an average of 30,000 mtDNA molecules per neuron, corresponds to as few as 30 mtDNA molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus we were able to confidently assess point mutations at heteroplasmic frequencies below 1%, where we show that the vast majority (96%) of somatic mtDNA point mutations occurs in neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This spectrum of mtDNA variation had been unexplored by previous studies due to insufficient sequencing depth limiting their lower detection threshold to 1% heteroplasmy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, by selecting our amplification and sequencing target outside of the commonly deleted mtDNA region, our sequence data reflects the entire mtDNA population of each neuron, comprising both structurally intact and deleted molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, our findings have important implications for therapy-oriented research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pharmacological upregulation of mtDNA levels may rescue neuronal respiration and exert a neuroprotective effect in PD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Administration of agents promoting mitochondrial biogenesis via the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma pathway have indeed been associated with a significantly lower risk for PD (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe that this effect may be at least partly due to compensation for somatic mtDNA damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While further studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying mtDNA copy-number regulation in aging and neurodegeneration, we believe that these may be exploited to design novel neuroprotective therapies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

DCTN1, CHCHD2, PARK2, PINK1, PARK7, ATP13A2, PLA2G6, FBXO7, COQ2 and SLC6A3) were extracted and screened with no evidence of known pathogenic mutations (data available on request).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, coverage analysis of the SNCA exons showed no evidence of copy-number variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Controls had no known neurological disease and were matched for age (t test; P=0.16) and gender (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individuals with PD and controls had no history of mitochondrial disorder or use of antiretroviral medication which may affect mtDNA homeostasis.

One hemisphere was fixed whole in formaldehyde and the other coronally sectioned in 1 cm slices which were individually snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no significant difference in post-mortem or fixation time between individuals with PD and controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neuropathological examination was performed on the following brain areas from all samples of individuals with PD and controls who were above the age of 40 years: frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum (nucleus lentiformis) cerebellum and mesencephalon (containing the substantia nigra) at the level of the third cranial nerve and pons at the level of the locus coeruleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Serial sections (3 m) of formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissue were stained with haematoxylin and eosin using a standard protocol and immunohistochemistry with antibodies against alpha-synuclein (Leica, NCL-L-ASYN, dilution 1:20), tau (DAKO, A0024, dilution 1:1,000), -amyloid (DAKO, M0872, dilution 1:50), PGC-1 (Abcam, ab54481, dilution 1:100) and the mitochondrial membrane marker porin (Abcam, ab14734, dilution 1:10,000).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Staining was performed in an automated stainer (Ventana Benchmark Ultra Stainer) and visualization using Ventana 760-500 Ultra View Universal DAB detection kit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibodies were diluted in Ventana Antibody Diluent (Ventana 251-018).

in mitochondrial staining and histopathology (C.T.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and I.F.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, we performed a more standardized assessment independent of surrounding tissue morphology, which may affect contrast perception and suggest disease status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-resolution microphotographs were taken at × 400 magnification using a light microscope (Leica) equipped with a Zeiss AxioCam MRc5 camera and Zen 2011 software (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Jena, Germany) under standardized conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Randomly picked dopaminergic single neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta were cut from each photograph and stacked on a uniform black background using Fiji v2.0.0 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the presence of neuromelanin,

dehydrated in graded ethanol series (75, 90 and 100%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LMD was performed on a PALM Laser microdissection microscope (Zeiss).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the substantia nigra, the pars compacta was identified based on localization, morphology and neuromelanin pigmentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neuromelanin positive (dopaminergic) neurons were collected from the ventrolateral tier (A9 area), which is consistently and severely affected by neurodegeneration in PD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pyramidal neurons and Purkinje cells were collected from the frontal cortex and cerebellar cortex, respectively.

sequencing for assessing the load of point mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, all three types of mtDNA changes were determined in the same single neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'mtDNA copy number and deletion analysis', 'Total mtDNA copy number and the fraction of major arc deletion were determined in 810 single neurons per brain region from each of 10 individuals with PD and 21 controls: substantia nigra pars compacta (PD, n=74; control: n=147), frontal cortex (PD, n=73; control, n=188) and cerebellar Purkinje cells (PD, n=76; control, n=150).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our assay detected specifically deletions of the mtDNA major arc, that is, the region between the origins of replication for the light and heavy strand (Fig 6a), where the vast majority of single and nearly all multiple deletions are known to occur27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Copy number and deletion analysis were performed simultaneously in the same neuron, using a duplex real-time PCR assay to detect a commonly deleted (MTND4) and rarely deleted (MTND1) targets on the mitochondrial genome27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following primers, probes and conditions were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MTND1: forward primer:

from a serial dilution containing equal amounts of PCR-generated and purified full-length MTND1 and MTND4 template (102106 copies per l).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MTND1 is rarely deleted and reflects total mtDNA copy number whereas MTND4 only amplifies molecules not harbouring major arc deletions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentage of deletion was calculated from the difference of the two as previously described27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genomic blood-DNA from two healthy individuals was used as an internal control in each experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Single-neuron ultra-deep mtDNA sequencing', 'To assess mtDNA SNVs down to very-low heteroplasmy levels, we performed PCR amplification and ultra-deep sequencing of a 4,767 bp mtDNA fragment (rCRS 1157-5924) spanning two rRNA (MT-RNR1, MT-RNR2), 10 tRNA (MT-TV, L1, I, Q, M, W, A, N, C, Y) and two peptide (MT-ND1, MT-ND2) genes (Figs 7a,c and 8c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mtDNA sequencing was performed in 184 individual dopaminergic substantia nigra neurons, comprising 810 neurons from each of the individuals with PD (n=10) and age-matched controls (n=10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of high levels of mtDNA deletions could introduce substantial selection bias in the amplification process towards specific mtDNA populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mtDNA molecules harbouring deletions between the primer binding sites would be selectively overamplified due to their small size and therefore overrepresented in the sequencing results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, deletions spanning at least one primer binding site would prevent amplification of these molecules skewing towards non-deleted populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid this potentially substantial selection bias, we chose the size and location of the amplicon to be away from the major arc region where the vast majority of large deletions occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus our sequencing data are representative for the entire mtDNA population in each neuron tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',
