Tomographic active optical trapping of arbitrarily shaped objects by exploiting 3D refractive index maps  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Optical trapping can manipulate the three-dimensional (3D) motion of spherical particles based on the simple prediction of optical forces and the responding motion of samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, controlling the 3D behaviour of non-spherical particles with arbitrary orientations is extremely challenging, due to experimental difficulties and extensive computations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we achieve the real-time optical control of arbitrarily shaped particles by combining the wavefront shaping of a trapping beam and measurements of the 3D refractive index distribution of samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Engineering the 3D light field distribution of a trapping beam based on the measured 3D refractive index map of samples generates a light mould, which can manipulate colloidal and biological samples with arbitrary orientations and/or shapes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present method provides stable control of the orientation and assembly of arbitrarily shaped particles without knowing a priori information about the sample geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proposed method can be directly applied in biophotonics and soft matter physics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Optical tweezers have been an invaluable tool for trapping and manipulating micrometre-sized spherical particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In optical tweezers, a tightly focused laser beam generates a gradient force that attracts colloidal particles and biological cells near the optical focus1 (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the past two decades, the development of wavefront shaping techniques has facilitated the invention of holographic optical tweezers which can simultaneously generate multiple optical foci in three dimensions by displaying engineered holograms on a variety of diffraction optical elements2,3 (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Schematic diagrams of various optical tweezers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Single-beam optical tweezers, (b) holographic optical tweezers and (c) TOMOTRAP employing real-time 3D refractive index tomography and wavefront shaping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 3D beam intensity generated by each of the optical tweezers is depicted on the top, and the phase component of the complex optical field of the trapping beam is shown on the bottom.Full size image', 'The optical forces exerted on a spherical particle can be analytically calculated using Mie theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To predict the optical forces on particles with low symmetry, however, requires extensive numerical calculations, such as the T-matrix method4 and the discrete dipole approximation5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous works have shown that non-spherical particles can be aligned along a limited equilibrium orientation when trapped with a Gaussian beam6,7 and their position and orientation were measured by holographic microscopy techniques8,9, and have exhibited unstable motion, depending on the sample geometry and optical properties10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since optical trapping is an example of lightmatter interaction, methods of controlling the stable orientation of arbitrarily shaped particles can be explored either by modifying sample shapes or by engineering the wavefront of light12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent advances in two-photon polymerization now enable the fabrication of arbitrarily shaped samples with trapping handles for stable orientation control13,14, and iterative optimization of phase-only holograms using the T-matrix calculation have provided enhanced trap stiffness for spherical particles15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, controlling the stable orientation of arbitrarily shaped particles using wavefront shaping based on sample geometry has yet to be explored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we present a novel technique, called a tomographic mould for optical trapping (TOMOTRAP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TOMOTRAP provides the stable control of the orientation and shape of arbitrarily shaped samples including colloidal particles, red blood cells and eukaryotic cells (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TOMOTRAP measures the 3D refractive index (RI) maps of samples in real-time and generates 3D light field distributions, whose 3D intensity distribution corresponds to the 3D RI distribution of desired sample shape and orientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure minimizes the electromagnetic energy of the dielectric particles by maximizing the overlap volume between the light and the arbitrarily orientated sample, as explained in previous works7,14,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, arbitrarily shaped particles are stably trapped in the generated 3D light field distribution, and the orientation and shape of the trapped particles can be controlled by updating the 3D light field distribution with corresponding 3D RI distribution of a desired sample shape and orientation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In summary, we proposed and experimentally demonstrated TOMOTRAP for stably controlling the orientation and shape of arbitrarily shaped particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exploiting the electromagnetic variational principle, we theoretically predicted that dielectric samples will be aligned to the 3D beam intensity of a desired shape and orientation, which acts as a tomographic mould for optical manipulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Employing an optical setup that combines ODT and holographic optical tweezers, we experimentally demonstrated that the proposed idea can control the orientation and/or shape of arbitrarily shaped particles, including PMMA ellipsoidal dimers, RBCs and HT-29 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The translational and rotational trap stiffness of TOMOTRAP trapping a PMMA dimer suggested that TOMOTRAP can control the position and orientation of arbitrarily shaped particles in a stable manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present technique, so far, can be utilized for optical manipulation of weakly scattering particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Highly scattering samples may violate the weak scattering assumption for measuring the 3D RI distribution and induce an additional scattering force from radiation pressure of the trapping beam, which can affect the trap stability25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we expect that TOMOTRAP, which employs a counter-propagating trapping beam geometry, can overcome this problem because the scattering forces from each direction cancel each other26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous optical manipulation techniques for controlling the position and orientation of nonspherical samples have exploited a priori information about the sample geometry and optical properties, and have been used to enhance the trap stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, placing multiple Gaussian beams at each end of microrods27 and complex-shaped probes28 showed enhancement in translational and rotational trap stiffness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, iterative optimization of phase-only holograms using the T-matrix calculation has provided significant enhancement of trap stiffness in one axis for spherical particles by generating focused beams at the rim of spherical particles15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results for enhancing trap stiffness originate from the maximization of the overlap volume between dielectric samples and the trapping beam intensity, which share the same perception presented in TOMOTRAP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, we believe that TOMOTRAP also has a capability for the increase of the optical trap stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, as shown in Supplementary Figs 6 and 7, the translational trap stiffness along the x- and y-axis of various types of spherical particles having diameters ranging from 2 to 8â€‰m are enhanced up to twice when trapped by TOMOTRAP compared with a Gaussian trap (Supplementary Note 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The present method provides stable control of the orientation and assembly of arbitrarily shaped particles without knowing a priori information about the sample geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work can be applied readily to various fields such as the 3D assembly of arbitrarily shaped microscopic particles, including colloidal particles29,30, bacteria31 and stem cells32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also worth noting that the present method can be used to induce a desired shape in samples by mechanical deformation, which permits the 3D optical sculpting of various materials33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also anticipate that TOMOTRAP could benefit studies in biomechanics, and can be used to investigate the active microrheology of the fluctuating membranes of biological samples34,35 with global optical deformationas well as the 3D optical guiding of cellular migration36.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
