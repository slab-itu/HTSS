Induced sensorimotor brain plasticity controls pain in phantom limb patients  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The cause of pain in a phantom limb after partial or complete deafferentation is an important problem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A popular but increasingly controversial theory is that it results from maladaptive reorganization of the sensorimotor cortex, suggesting that experimental induction of further reorganization should affect the pain, especially if it results in functional restoration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use a brainmachine interface (BMI) based on real-time magnetoencephalography signals to reconstruct affected hand movements with a robotic hand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BMI training induces significant plasticity in the sensorimotor cortex, manifested as improved discriminability of movement information and enhanced prosthetic control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to our expectation that functional restoration would reduce pain, the BMI training with the phantom hand intensifies the pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, BMI training designed to dissociate the prosthetic and phantom hands actually reduces pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results reveal a functional relevance between sensorimotor cortical plasticity and pain, and may provide a novel treatment with BMI neurofeedback.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Phantom limb pain describes the intractable chronic pain1 that frequently occurs in a partially or completely deafferented body part after severe peripheral nerve injury2 or amputation3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A prominent theory is that the underlying cause of the pain is maladaptive plasticity of the sensorimotor cortex3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The key evidence supporting this is the correlation between pain and topographic reorganization of sensorimotor cortical maps, as revealed by several methods6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, rehabilitative therapies inspired by the theory, such as discrimination training, myoelectric prosthesis use, nerve replantation and mirror therapy, reduce pain and show a corresponding correlation with topographic reorganization5,9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This underlies a widely held guiding principle that restoration of function reduces pain3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'However, recent evidence has caused researchers to question the maladaptive sensorimotor reorganization model, especially in terms of the motor representation of the phantom limb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, it has been shown that when using unfolded brain maps to study anatomical reorganization of the phantom hand, shifts in the peaks of lip representations are local, do not invade the hand area and are not correlated with pain13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, functional brain activity in the area of missing hands of amputees does not increase during lip movements14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the phantom symptoms associated with nerve loss in carpal tunnel syndrome, sensorimotor reorganization is correlated with paraesthesia, but not pain15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even the efficacy of behavioural therapies designed to target reorganization has been questioned11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Critically, however, both sides of this argument lack any direct experimental manipulation of sensorimotor plasticity that, in principle, could be used to support or refute a causative link between sensorimotor cortical plasticity and pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recently, it has been shown that brainmachine interfaces (BMIs) can not only reconstruct motor function in severely paralysed patients16 but also induce plastic changes in cortical activity17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A BMI works by first decoding neural activity of the mental action to move the affected hand, for example, and then by converting the decoded phantom hand movement into that of a robotic neuroprosthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BMIs based on magnetoencephalography (MEG) sensorimotor cortex signals have been shown to be sufficient to precisely decode hand movements in real time20,21, even in severely paralysed patients simply intending to move the affected hands22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, training to use BMIs induces plastic changes in cortical activity24,25 and, potentially, associated clinical symptoms26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we apply the BMI training of a neuroprosthetic (robotic) hand using real-time MEG signals in phantom limb patients, whose symptoms are primarily caused by nerve avulsion, and evaluate the association between changes in their symptomatic pain and in cortical currents during phantom hand movements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the patients partially restore the function of the affected hand by using the prosthetic hand in its place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the principle of restoration of function, it is initially hypothesized that successful BMI training using decoded phantom hand movements should reduce pain with concurrent plastic changes in cortical activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our results show that, although BMI training leads to a significant increase of movement information in the sensorimotor cortex, the training significantly increases pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, BMI training to associate the prosthetic hand with the intact hand representation reduces pain with decreased information about phantom hand movements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest a causative relationship between sensorimotor cortical plasticity and pain.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our data show that MEG-based BMI training to control a neuroprosthetic hand induces significant changes in pain, and this was directly associated with plasticity of the cortical representation of phantom movements in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we found that the induced changes in the motor information content (movement discriminability) of the sensorimotor cortex underlaid the effect on the pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pain increased significantly in direct proportion to the decoded information content of phantom hand movements; in turn, subsequent training of phantom hand movements based on the intact hand disrupted the information content of the contralateral sensorimotor cortex and led to an improvement in pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with a probable causal relationship between cortical sensorimotor plasticity and phantom limb pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Notably, our results demonstrated that pain was not reduced by the reconstruction of motor function; instead, it was changed by plastic changes in the cortical representation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reconstruction of motor function does not necessarily reverse a putatively maladaptive cortical representation, which was expected from the naive hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By selecting the decoded information to control the BMI neuroprosthesis, we induced plasticity in the cortical information representation of phantom hand movements (as opposed to simple topographic plasticity) and explored the relationship with pain30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is well established that cortical activity representing phantom hand movements is preserved in the sensorimotor cortex14,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it has remained unclear whether and how pain might depend on altered representations within this region11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most previous studies examined the topography of sensorimotor function, for instance, showing that cortical representations of phantom hand movements overlap the adjacent cortical representation of mouth movements7, with a larger overlap corresponding to greater pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recent data have contradicted this13 and are not completely consistent with other evidence showing that greater pain is associated with higher cortical activation representing phantom hand movements14,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These seemingly conflicting results have left open the question of whether and how phantom pain might depend on the cortical plasticity of phantom hand representations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our approach provides an interventional method to induce localized changes in cortical representations and to directly and reversibly study the relationship with pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MEG signals during the offline task were decoded with accuracy comparable to that of previous work, demonstrating the successful online control of a robotic hand with accuracy greater than that of chance23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BMI training with the robotic hand was shown to induce robust changes in cortical activity and pain according to the type of the decoder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cortical plasticity was demonstrated by two different analysis approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Univariate analysis showed that alterations in pain were significantly correlated with alterations in discriminability of cortical currents between movement types, as opposed to the mean (absolute) cortical current magnitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multivariate analysis based on motor decoding showed clear modulation of information content pertaining to phantom hand movements, which was shown to be strongly correlated with the modulation of pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the proportional relations were significant both with VAS and the total SF-MPQ2 scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the increases in total SF-MPQ2 scores were not significant after training with the phantom decoder, the VAS presumably more sensitively captured moment-by-moment pain than the SF-MPQ2 did.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is likely that it is primarily the functional information content of cortical phantom limb representations that is causally related to pain: pain increases with the enhancement of information about phantom hand movements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As the patients were unaware of the experimental manipulation in each case, it is unlikely that placebo effects were dominant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other potential aspects of BMI neuroprosthetic control, such as a nonspecific training effect or emotional pain modulation by perceived task difficulty9,32, are not likely confounders because these were broadly equivalent across task conditions (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, although mismatches between expected and actual movements of the robotic hand were different among task conditions, the mismatches did not explain the alterations among the task conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The random decoder should be the most difficult and cause the largest mismatches; however, this did not change pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our results strongly suggest that the induced plasticity on the phantom limb representation could be the cause of the alteration in pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted, however, that the training with the real hand decoder was performed as the last experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One limitation of this study is that the order of three experiments was not counterbalanced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The estimation of cortical currents from the MEG signals and the decoding method applied to the estimated cortical currents revealed that the information about hand movements was evaluated differentially in both hemispheres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The information of the phantom hand was significantly lateralized to the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the affected hand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the alteration of information due to the BMI training was significant only in the contralateral hemisphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, for the same contralateral hemisphere, the information of the hand movements was significantly different among the phantom hand and intact hand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The information of intact hand movement was not significantly different after training with the real hand decoder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results strongly suggest that the BMI training in this study altered the information of the phantom hand movement in the contralateral hemisphere significantly enough to change the pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a recent study suggested the that ipsilateral hemisphere may affect the pain33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the real hand decoder might affect the contralateral hemisphere through some plastic changes in the ipsilateral hemisphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, further investigation is necessary to reveal the relationship between both hemispheres to control the pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Researchers have proposed an incongruence hypothesis of pain34 based on prediction errors between actual and predicted somatosensory feedback estimated by an internal model in the brain35,36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A mismatch between the actual experience and the predicted experience might be a causative component of chronic pain38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis was proposed as a mechanism for the noted success of mirror therapy to reduce pain (that is, by restoring consistency between motor intention and visual input).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our experiment, BMI training with a phantom decoder might have increased pain by enhancing the cortical representation that was associated with the internal model generating inconsistency in sensorimotor functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, BMI training with the real hand decoder might have dissociated the intention to move the phantom hand and the cortical representation, resulting in deteriorated information of phantom representation and reducing pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results show that BMI training may be useful as a novel interventional tool to study functional anatomy in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It induces functionally specific plastic changes in the targeted cortex based on the information represented in the activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, this method can be easily applied to patients in non-invasive, randomized and blinded studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These features distinguish this method from other non-invasive interventional tools, such as transcranial direct current stimulation39 and transcranial magnetic stimulation40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these modalities change cortical activity and excitability to relieve pain41, it is difficult to control the information represented in the patterns of cortical activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, if the information of the phantom hand is the cause of the phantom limb pain, then the simple application of the transcranial direct current stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation might not be enough for full recovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, cortical stimulations have been demonstrated to modulate cortical activities to relieve pain41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this in mind, it is potentially interesting to combine cortical stimulation and online neural decoding42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The novel neurofeedback of cortical stimulation based on the neural information might reveal the cause of phantom limb pain and allow a full recovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'BMI neurofeedback might be a potential novel therapy for phantom limb pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A previous study showed that the effective rate of mirror therapy was limited43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five patients in this study had some experience with mirror therapy (Table 1), but the treatment was effective for only one patient during the limited period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we observed that appropriate BMI training reduced pain even in these patients (Supplementary Table 3), suggesting that it could be an alternative to mirror therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, some patients in this study had also undergone lesioning of the dorsal root entry zone (DREZotomy)44 and reported residual pain after surgery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BMI training significantly reduced the scores for continuous pain in the residual pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By combining decoding45 and neurofeedback, BMI could be applied to other chronic pain conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition, the results clearly indicate that we should consider pain as a potential complication when using BMIs for paralysed patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, we must consider the fact that true decoding that increases pain creates a problem for those patients using BMI-controlled robotic prostheses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possible solution, according to the incongruence hypothesis, would be BMI training accompanied by sensory feedback (for example, artificialreal nerve coupling46), which might mitigate pain by providing an intact sensorimotor loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, neurofeedback training using MEG-based BMI provides a novel method to directly change the information content of motor representations by induced plasticity in the sensorimotor cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we showed that BMI training to enhance phantom limb representation was associated with increased pain, and that BMI training to deteriorate the representation reduced pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests a direct and causative link between sensorimotor cortical plasticity and pain in phantom limb patients, and that BMI training may be a novel and clinically useful treatment.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Subjects', 'Nine brachial plexus root avulsion (BPRA) patients and one amputee (all males; mean age, 51.7 years; range, 3860 years) all of whom had pain in their phantom limb participated in this study (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We had 12 patients with pain in their phantom limb at the Department of Neurosurgery at Osaka University Hospital from January 2012 to July 2015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these patients, we selected 10 who met all of the following inclusion criteria: (1) pain and phantom sensation in the upper limb; (2) no hand or no sensation in the residual hand; (3) severe paresis with manual muscle testing score 01; and (4) normal comprehension and intellectual capacity according to the Japanese Adult Reading Test25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total number of patients was chosen to be comparable to that of previous studies and was based on our preliminary results for healthy controls trained by the same BMI prosthesis6,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, 9 of the 10 were the same patients who also took part in our previous study23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki and was performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Ethics Committee of Osaka University Clinical Trial Center (no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12107, UMIN000010180).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All patients were informed of the purpose and possible consequences of this study, and written informed consent was obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In figures, the photo of the patient was used with the patients permission for publication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our patient group included one amputee and nine BPRA patients with complete avulsion of roots from C5 to Th2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to Flor et al.3, phantom limb pain belongs to a group of neuropathic pain syndromes that is characterized by pain in the amputated limb or pain that follows partial or complete deafferentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the amputation and the BPRA were largely different regarding the existence of the residual arms, we included them as phantom limb pain when the patient met all the aforementioned criteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the affected hands of all the BPRA patients had no sensation and were plegic because of the complete avulsion of their roots (as definitively confirmed through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography with myelogram).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although some of them were able to slightly contract the muscles in their upper arms because of intercostal nerve transplantation, they were not aware of the contraction without observing the arm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, without observing the physical hand, they complained of the existence of their hand, which they felt was slightly movable in their mind, and suffered from intractable pain in the insensible hand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These properties are the same as those described for the phantom limb due to amputation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it should be also noted that the pain after BPRA may not be precisely the same as the phantom limb pain after amputation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pain after BPRA is caused by several factors, as is the pain after amputation3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the paroxysmal pain after BPRA is hypothesized to originate from the affected spinal cord and is often relieved by DREZotomy44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in BPRA patients, some motor and sensory functions of the arm partially remain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, not all pain after BPRA are necessarily phantom limb pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that a part of the pain in the insensible and plegic hand of BPRA patient originated from the same mechanism causing a part of the pain in the amputee, which was affected by the cortical plasticity in the sensorimotor cortex representing the phantom hand movements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To characterize the properties of the pain, we analysed the subscores of SF-MPQ2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'MEG recording', 'For the MEG recording, subjects were in the supine position with the head centred in the gantry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A projection screen in front of the face presented visual stimuli using a visual stimulus presentation system (Presentation;
