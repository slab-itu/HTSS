Comparative genomics reveals convergent rates of evolution in antplant mutualisms  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Symbiosisthe close and often long-term interaction of speciesis predicted to drive genome evolution in a variety of ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, parasitic interactions have been shown to increase rates of molecular evolution, a trend generally attributed to the Red Queen Hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is much less clear how mutualisms impact the genome, as both increased and reduced rates of change have been predicted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we sequence the genomes of seven species of ants, three that have convergently evolved obligate plantant mutualism and four closely related species of non-mutualists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing these sequences, we investigate how genome evolution is shaped by mutualistic behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that rates of molecular evolution are higher in the mutualists genome wide, a characteristic apparently not the result of demography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that the intimate relationships of obligate mutualists may lead to selective pressures similar to those seen in parasites, thereby increasing rates of evolution.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mutualisms are ubiquitous in nature and profoundly influence the structure of ecosystems1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to influencing the ecology of the organisms involved, these intimate interactions can have radical consequences on genome evolution3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Van Valen5 predicted increased rates of molecular evolution in antagonistically coevolving species with his Red Queen Hypothesis, a theory that has gained much support, particularly in studies of loci involved in disease and resistance6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Far less research has examined the influence of mutualisms on rates of evolution; however, some theory has suggested an advantage for mutualists to evolve more slowly than their partners8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This Red King effect8 results from selection for greater concessions from at least one of the two members of a mutualism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although both are initially selected to forfeit additional resources to their partner, the more slowly evolving species maintains selfish behaviour for longer, gaining an advantage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This outcome is highly dependent on the starting conditions of the relationship and in a more limited subset of conditions higher rates of change are instead predicted to be advantageous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, verbal models also predict selection to favour the more slowly evolving species: each member of the mutualism is adapted to draw maximum benefit from the most common of its partners phenotypes, thereby selecting against changes9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Antplant mutualisms, wherein ants nest obligately in chambers provided by their host plants while protecting them from herbivores, have evolved in a number of antplant pairs11,12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ant genus Pseudomyrmex includes mutualistic acaciaants11,14 as well as two other clades that nest not in the hollow thorns of acacias but in the trunks and leaf petioles of distantly related plants in the genera Triplaris and Tachigali, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These three clades of ants have evolved mutualism convergently, despite a remarkable similarity in behaviour12,13; all Pseudomyrmex plantant mutualists are incredibly aggressive, actively patrolling and attacking herbivores and invaders11,12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Non-mutualistic species of Pseudomyrmex, the generalists, live in the same environments, yet have starkly different behaviour, fleeing from aggressors even when their own nests are at risk11,12,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Leveraging these three evolutionarily independent clades of closely related mutualists (the entire clade diverged  less_than 10 Mya16 and shows  less_than 5% sequence divergence13,16), we sought to understand the evolution of this behavioural difference through full genome sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first de novo sequenced the genome of a single species of Pseudomyrmex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then used this reference to assemble and align the genomes of six other species: three mutualists and three generalists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These full genome sequences reveal that mutualists have higher rates of molecular evolution than generalists genome wide, revealing unexpected consequences of beneficial symbioses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we identify a number of genes showing convergent signatures of positive selection in mutualists, many of which are involved in neurological processes, a probable target of selection for mutualistic behaviours.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Pseudomyrmex gracilis genome assembly', 'The most closely related species for which genomic resources exist are separated from Pseudomyrmex by 100 million years16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we developed a novel reference by de novo sequencing the genome of a single haploid male of the widespread generalist P. gracilis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paired-end 100 base Illumina HiSeq sequencing yielded 358 million reads with overlap between paired reads of 52±15 (mean±s.d.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained 318 million reads from a mate-pair library separated by 2,453±344 bases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We assembled the P. gracilis genome with ALLPATHS-LG (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17) and our final assembly consists of 24,064 contigs on 6,556 scaffolds with a total coverage of 89X.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total contig and scaffold lengths are 261 and 282 Mb, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contig N50 is 30 kb and scaffold N50 is 350 kb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ALLPATHS-LG k-mer spectrum analysis estimated the genome size to be 392 Mb and, at a k-mer size of 25, genome repetitiveness to be 47%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Repetitive elements are abundant', 'A total of 2,519 repetitive elements were initially identified in the P. gracilis genome assembly (563 from PILER-DF (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18), 1,956 RepeatModeler (http://www.repeatmasker.org)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After redundant sequences were removed, 1,607 repetitive elements remained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these, 42 sequences were below the length cutoff ( less_than 80 bases) and 77 more were removed due to similarity with known proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final set of transposable elements (TEs) was composed of 1,488 sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, 6.0% (16 Mb) of the assembled contigs are composed of simple repeats and 20.5% (53 Mb) are TEs (Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that overall genome repetitiveness was estimated to be nearly 50% and genome size was estimated to be more than 100 Mb longer than the assembly, most of the unassembled sequence is likely composed of repetitive elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Pervasive introgression of mitochondrial genome', 'Introgressions of mitochondrial genes into the nuclear genome are common in P. gracilis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified at least one copy of 11 mitochondrial genes and a total of 228 mitochondrial-like genes in the P. gracilis assembly compared with 173 in the ant Atta cephalotes and 97 or fewer in six other ant genomes (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Linkage mapping places scaffolds on chromosomes', 'We created a linkage map by genotyping 47 workers and the queen from a single colony using reduced representation Genotyping-By-Sequencing (GBS)19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this library, between 836,984 and 6,115,576 reads were assigned to each sample (Supplementary Data 2) for a total of 167 million usable reads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these, 134 million (80%) reads passed quality filtering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clustering at 90% similarity yielded between 120,262 and 231,138 clusters per sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean within sample cluster depth ranged from 5.0 to 13.3 (24.4±3.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean error and heterozygosity rates as calculated by pyRAD20 were 0.15% and 0.88%, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recovered a total of 31,371 loci with data for at least 24 samples after between sample clustering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each sample had data for between 3,952 and 30,442 (26,362±4,448) loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The individual with the smallest number of loci was a distinct outlier and was excluded from further analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At least one site in which a single-nucleotide polymorphism was represented by at least two samples was present in 5,216 loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our stringent quality filtering reduced this number to 565 loci used in linkage mapping analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'After determining the correct phase21, MSTmap22 produced 38 syntenic linkage groups with at least three loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous karyotype analyses have shown the presence of 35 chromosomes in P. gracilis23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our linkage groups therefore probably correspond broadly to chromosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No scaffold appeared in more than one linkage group; thus, we were able to confidently assign 185 scaffolds to our 38 linkage groups (Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Coding sequence annotation', 'We sequenced messenger RNA from a variety of life stages of P. gracilis to assist with gene annotation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a 100 base paired-end Illumina RNA sequencing library, we obtained 204 million reads and 174 million of these passed quality filtering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assembled the transcriptome from these data resulting in 204,150 transcripts at least 200 bp long.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarity clustering reduced the number of sequences to 176,795.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our final annotation using the automated pipeline MAKER24 consisted of 16,069 genes,

ants26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Of the 248 ultra-conserved CEGMA27 genes, 247 were at least partially present in the assembly and 244 (98%) of these were complete.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found evidence for 77 of the 79 (98%) minimum expected cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins in our final gene set, suggesting that the annotation was relatively complete.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two missing CRPs are both quite short (RPL29: 76 AAs in Drosophila and RPL39: 51 AAs) and may have been missed partly for this reason.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did find signs of these two genes in the genome assembly, indicating a limitation of the annotation rather than the assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Enrichment for ATP synthesis genes in P. gracilis', 'There are 5,697 P. gracilis genes without clear orthologues in any other species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative to the 10,372 genes with orthologues, these genes are enriched in a number of ontology terms related to ATP synthesis (Supplementary Data 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the clear presence of NuMts in the P. gracilis genome, we were concerned that the apparent increased number of cellular respiration related genes was the result of spurious annotation of pseudogenes with mitochondrial origins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed that these genes were, at least, transcriptionally active by comparing the set of genes classified in enriched categories with the independently assembled transcriptome using BLASTN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 713 genes classified to enriched categories, 367 (52%) are 99% identical to assembled transcripts across at least 25% of the length of both the gene and the transcript.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparison, 11,349 of the 16,069 (71%) total genes show the same pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the genes unique to P. gracilis that do not correspond directly to assembled transcripts could still be functional genes, this difference in well-supported genes was concerning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore re-ran the analysis with only those genes directly supported by transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the genes unique to P. gracilis, 2,953 (52%) were directly supported by transcripts and no Gene Ontology (GO) terms were found to be enriched in this reduced set of genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is, therefore, unclear whether the genes classified in the enriched GO categories are functional.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, they could certainly be transcribed at low levels and not picked up by our RNA sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enriched GO categories found by comparing P. gracilis to the other Hymenopteran species are similar to those enriched within P. gracilis (Supplementary Data 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Majority of ingroup genomes recovered by reference mapping', 'We used our P. gracilis genome as a reference to assemble the genomes of a representative species from each of the three clades of Pseudomyrmex mutualists (P. concolor, P. dendroicus and P. flavicornis) and three of the most closely related generalists (P. pallidus, P. elongatus and the undescribed species P. sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PSW-54) (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this approach, we were able to assemble aligned sequence for approximately two-thirds

the 40 resulting phylogenetic topologies showed the three mutualistic lineages as the most closely related.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that parallel evolution of particular alleles related to mutualistic behaviour from an ancestral population is unlikely to be responsible for the convergence of behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, none of the phylogenies reconstructed from sliding windows had monophyletic clades of all three mutualists and no generalists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Rates of molecular evolution are higher in mutualists', 'We find that all three mutualists have significantly higher rates of molecular evolution than the most closely related generalists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern is persistent in both coding and non-coding regions across the genome (Figs 1b

evolutionary history.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the clear trends between pairs of related mutualists and generalists when using this framework, there is substantial variation in rates of change within each group and each individual mutualist does not have higher rates of change than every generalist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, although the mutualist P. dendroicus has greater average dS than the most closely related generalist P. elongatus, it has lower average dS than the generalist P. pallidus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern exhibits the power of our approach; comparing closely related taxa reduces the confounding effects of independent evolutionary history.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the variation in rates within behavioural groups, our findings could not be identified without examining behaviourally convergent taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Differences in evolutionary rate are not due to demography', 'Differences in rates of molecular evolution have been reported in a few other groups29,30,31,32, but these findings are usually attributable to the differential action of genetic drift resulting from short generation times and small effective population sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in plantants, molecular evolution will, if anything, be slowed by generation time, because these species establish large colonies over several years before producing reproductive individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, generalists tend to live in small, transient nests and begin reproducing soon after colony founding, several-fold faster than mutualists14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Population size differences are less obvious, but we used G-PhoCS33 to estimate population sizes using whole genome data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained a total of 8,482 neutral loci with sequences from

the other two pairs of mutualists and generalists show either the opposite pattern or are equivocal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lower overall dN/dS ratios in mutualists also suggest larger population sizes (Fig 1b and Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Population size is, therefore, unlikely to be responsible for the differences in rates of molecular evolution in these species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Relaxed selection may contribute to higher rates', 'The higher rates of molecular evolution in mutualists are, therefore, most likely to be due to a combination of relaxed purifying and positive selection rather than demography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relaxed selection is responsible for rapid changes in the genomes of other obligate symbionts3,4, although, unlike these intracellular bacteria, plantants must maintain most of their genomic integrity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the lower average dN/dS ratios in mutualists suggest that relaxed selection is not solely responsible for their elevated rates of evolution (Fig 1b and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4), this observation must be tempered by the potential confounding effects of higher dS in mutualists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We, therefore, used repetitiveness as an additional proxy for relaxed selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'If the higher rates of change in mutualistic genomes are due simply to large-scale relaxed selection across the genome, repetitiveness and TEs would also be expected to spread, as their small cost would be selected against less efficiently34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we also evaluated the degree of relaxed selection by examining genomic repetitiveness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  K-mer spectrum analysis shows that mutualists tend to have lower overall repetitiveness than generalists, although there is no consistent trend (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the diversity of TEs is consistently lower in mutualists with a higher maximum abundance of individual TE families.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequently dramatic deleterious consequences of ectopic recombination predict stronger selection against TE insertions from more abundant TE families35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TE landscape in Pseudomyrmex mutualists is, therefore, suggestive of a slight relaxation of selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'DNA-repair protein changes may affect mutation rate', 'We attempted to identify genes that might be directly responsible for the elevated rates of molecular evolution in mutualists by searching for signs of relaxed selection and convergence in genes associated with DNA replication and repair.

DNA repair protein (PG04199: gluon) and two DNA replication proteins (PG00508: mutagen-sensitive 205 and PG08332: mitochondrial DNA helicase) have consistently higher dN/dS ratios in mutualists,

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Elevated rates of molecular evolution appear to be typical in obligately symbiotic organisms including parasitic plants30 and lice31, suggesting the existence of a general evolutionary force on this type of life history strategy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanisms causing these differences are often enigmatic but demography and other non-selective forces are typically invoked30,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rate changes resulting from selective forces are known from parasitic interactions6 but have yet to be reported in mutualists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most genomic studies of mutualisms have focused on intracellular bacterial endosymbionts and, though these organisms have some of the highest known rates of genomic evolution3,4, the precipitous drop in population size and relaxed selection inherent in intracellular living make the separation of molecular mechanisms leading to rate changes difficult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only other study to explore rates of molecular evolution among eukaryotic mutualists (lichenized fungi) also found evidence for increased rates among symbionts, though only 1,550 bp of ribosomal DNA were examined32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case the hypothesized explanation for the observed differences in rates is entirely non-biological: the increased exposure to solar radiation may increase mutation rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Theoretical models of interacting mutualistic species clearly show the existence of Red King effects8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet these models are simplified, focusing on the resources exchanged between two focal partners and do not include any influences from species external to the mutualism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We do not doubt the validity of these results in such an isolated system, but our study suggests influential additional factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Firstly, though the degree of relaxation experienced by intracellular symbionts3,4 is unlikely to occur in less intimate interactions such as those explored here, it is likely be a common symptom of mutualism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the elevated rates of synonymous change and higher abundance of individual TE families in mutualist ants suggest that they experience some degree of genome-wide relaxed selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondly, widespread positive selection is likely also involved, as suggested by the rates of change in nervous system-associated genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once locked into a mutualism, species must adapt not only to their own changing environments, but to those of their symbionts as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, selection on the plants from outside the mutualistic system likely requires reciprocal adaptations from resident ant species and vice versa, a process much like what is seen in Red Queen interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, acacia trees produce sucrose-free nectar, making them less attractive to the majority of Pseudomyrmex species and, thereby, deterring exploitation by non-protective ants40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutualistic Pseudomyrmex have, in turn, lost their ability to digest sucrose40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reciprocal adaptations such as these are likely common in mutualisms, as the number of interactions to which a mutualist must adapt is drastically increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Life histories must also be considered further.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we are confident that the most frequent mechanisms causing higher rates of molecular evolution (i.e., generation time and population size) are not responsible for the differences in mutualistic plant-ants, several other processes are worth considering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanism may be similar to that outlined abovethat the interactions between ants and their hosts induce high rates of changebut rather than the continual changes throughout the evolutionary history of the relationship, these high rates may be due to the many changes required for the initial invasion into a new niche.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, aggressive defense of their host plants is only one aspect of the convergent behavior of mutualists; they also have all evolved to feed predominantly on resources provided by their hosts, particularly the acacia-ants40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, these host-derived diets may themselves lead to higher rates of molecular evolution by requiring energy intensive digestive processes that produce reactive molecules or may contain secondary metabolites that induce mutations at a higher rate than a less limited diet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the larger number of offspring produced by the mutualistic species, their longer lifespans, and the accompanying elevated number of germline DNA replications could lead to a higher rate of substitution42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work has excluded this mechanism in social insects43 generally, though only a small amount of DNA sequence in relatively few advanced eusocial taxa was examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By sequencing and comparing seven ant genomes, we find that mutualistic plant-ants have higher rates of molecular evolution than closely related non-symbiotic species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference in rates has occurred in three different taxa that have convergently evolved mutualism and appears common among obligate symbionts3,4,30,31,32, suggesting that symbiosis is tied to evolutionary rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though we cannot, here, positively disentangle all potential mechanisms underlying the observed differences in rates of substitution between taxa, we expect that genomic analyses of additional, diverse mutualisms will show similar accelerations in evolutionary rates.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

used the cleandata setting to remove ambiguous codons from sequences and used the topology recovered in this study as the species tree with the branch lengths from the total evidence whole-genome phylogeny as the initial estimate (fix_blength=1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For the branch-site test, we first fit a model that allowed the mutualistic lineages to have a proportion of sites with dN/dS1, whereas the generalists had dN/dS1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model was then compared with a second model that did not allow dN/dS to exceed one at any sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two models were compared using likelihood ratio tests and the resulting P-values were corrected to a 5% false discovery rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the branch-site test sometimes falsely identified genes under positive selection when they simply had high rates of substitution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To remedy this issue, we tested those genes that were found to be significant again, setting the non-mutualistic lineages as the foreground branches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those that were detected to be under positive selection in both tests were discarded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For the branch test, we again fit two models to the sequence data, setting the mutualistic lineages as the foreground branches and either allowing for the mutualists and non-mutualists to differ in estimated dN/dS ratios or fitting a model with just a single ratio across the tree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting models were again compared with likelihood ratio tests and false discovery rate corrected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When possible, those genes found to be of interest were modelled structurally with Phyre2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36) to determine the active sites of the proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Examining rates of molecular evolution', 'We assessed rates of molecular evolution of each sequenced species using a number of approaches, all of which were based on pairs of most closely related mutualists and generalists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that we considered P. concolor and P. pallidus to be a pair of mutualist and generalist for all analyses, although, given our phylogenetic findings, other taxa were equally closely related.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most basically, we calculated genetic distance of each species from P. gracilis using the same sliding windows used to create phylogenies from across the genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assessed the statistical significance of differences in genetic distances using paired t-tests, pairing distances from the same windows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also counted the number of windows for which mutualists had consistently greater genetic distances from P. gracilis than the most closely related generalists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a similar approach with the branch lengths recovered from the inferred phylogenies of each window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We also estimated rates of non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions in all genes using the free-ratios model implemented in PAML.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, we used the species tree from this study and used cleandata=1 to mask ambiguous data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only those genes with dN/dS ratios  less_than 10 were examined as larger values were very likely to be due to assembly or annotation errors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare overall rates of change between species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed the quality of our overall estimates of dN/dS by summing all dN and dS estimates within each species and calculating the ratio based on these sums, thus reducing the influence of outliers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Classifying and quantifying repetitive elements', 'We randomly subsampled 100,000 paired-end sequences from the raw data for each species using seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then ran Transposome68 on these data with a merge threshold of 0.0001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All other parameters were defaults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clustered sequences were classified by Transposome using the repeat database built from the P. gracilis genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Codon usage', 'Codon usage bias can be a result of selection, in particular when genes are highly expressed and translation efficiency is influential to their production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured codon usage bias by estimating effective codon number with ENCprime69 using the 2,000 bases flanking each end of a given gene to estimate background nucleotide composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to examining correlations between effective number of codons and the rates of non-synonymous and synonymous changes in each genome estimated by PAML, we also estimated the same parameters using HyPhy38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested for differences in genome-wide codon bias between taxa using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Duplications', 'To determine whether particular genes have been duplicated in mutualistic lineages, we mapped reads from each species to the P. gracilis genome using mrFAST version 2.6.0 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  70) allowing 6% edit distance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genome was first repeat-masked using RepeatMasker version 4.0.1 (http://www.repeatmasker.org).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined the resulting mappings with mrCaNaVaR version 0.51 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then looked for regions where estimated sequence copy number was at least 1.5 and all of the species with each life history were consistently at least 1.5 × higher than all species with the other life history.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we focused on coding regions that showed these patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Signatures of parallel evolution', 'We used Saguaro version 0.1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28) with default settings to search for signatures of parallel evolution within the mutualistic lineages, first filtering for those sites where non-gap calls had been made in at least two mutualists and two generalists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also examined the topologies resulting from our sliding window analyses of phylogenetic relationships to determine whether any parts of the mutualistic genomes appeared more closely related to each other than to any generalists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Estimating population sizes', 'We estimated  for each of the ingroup species using G-PhoCS33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genomic regions found to be repetitive by RepeatMasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org) in the P. gracilis reference genome were masked from the alignment, as were all coding sequences and the flanking 5,000 bases, to increase the odds of obtaining neutrally evolving sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then sampled all loci of length 500 at least 15 kb apart with sequence data for at least four of the six in-group species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence was not considered present in a given species if  greater than 20% of the total length consisted of undetermined sequence or gaps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The first 1,000,000 iterations of the G-PhoCS MCMC run were discarded as burn-in and values were sampled for 2,000,000 iterations every 100 iterations thereafter for a distribution of 20,001 samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These distributions were manually inspected for convergence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Expression levels of fast-evolving genes', 'We determined the set of genes with consistently higher rates of molecular evolution in mutualistic lineages using the phylogenetic framework outlined above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those genes for which all three mutualistic lineages in each pair of species (P. concolor versus P. pallidus, P. flavicornis versus P. sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PSW-54 and P. dendroicus versus P. elongatus) had greater rates of molecular evolution were considered to be fast-evolving in mutualists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those genes that showed the opposite pattern, with rates of change consistently higher in generalists, were used for comparison, as were the genes with no consistent pattern between mutualists and generalists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used modENCODEs library of Drosophila tissue gene expression data to determine whether these fast-evolving genes are expressed at different levels in particular tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are 29 tissue types included in the modENCODE data set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all genes for which a Drosophila orthologue was found using OrthoMCL, modENCODE expression levels were standardized to one across all tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within each tissue, the level of expression of the fast-evolving genes was compared with standardized expression of all other genes using t-tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Selection on aggression genes', 'We expected genes known to be involved in aggression in other social Hymenoptera to be over-represented in the genes we identified as being under convergent selection or evolving at higher rates in mutualists due to their highly aggressive behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we assembled lists of genes putatively involved in aggression in honey bees39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first list consists of 51 genes confidently determined to be involved in aggression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second list includes 1,922 genes, all of which were implicated in aggression in some way.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified orthologues in Pseudomyrmex and looked for over-representation of fast-evolving genes among these aggressiveness genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'All of the raw sequence data that support the findings of this study have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Informations Whole Genome Shotgun database under BioProject PRJNA268384 along with the P. gracilis assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pseudomyrmex gracilis annotations and aligned reference-based assemblies for all species are available from the Dryad Digital Repository at http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.q530s as well as at http://benrubin.science/data/.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All other data necessary to obtain our results were
