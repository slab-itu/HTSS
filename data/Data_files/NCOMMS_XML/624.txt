Contribution of Arctic seabird-colony ammonia to atmospheric particles and cloud-albedo radiative effect  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The Arctic region is vulnerable to climate change and able to affect global climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The summertime Arctic atmosphere is pristine and strongly influenced by natural regional emissions, which have poorly understood climate impacts related to atmospheric particles and clouds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that ammonia from seabird-colony guano is a key factor contributing to bursts of newly formed particles, which are observed every summer in the near-surface atmosphere at Alert, Nunavut, Canada.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our chemical-transport model simulations indicate that the pan-Arctic seabird-influenced particles can grow by sulfuric acid and organic vapour condensation to diameters sufficiently large to promote pan-Arctic cloud-droplet formation in the clean Arctic summertime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculate that the resultant cooling tendencies could be large (about 0.5 W m2 pan-Arctic-mean cooling), exceeding 1 W m2 near the largest seabird colonies due to the effects of seabird-influenced particles on cloud albedo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These coupled ecologicalchemical processes may be susceptible to Arctic warming and industrialization.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Over the past 50 years, the Arctic has been warming more rapidly than the global-mean rate for the Earth1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atmospheric particles, clouds and their interactions play key, but complex, roles in offsetting a substantial portion of the Earths global-mean radiative forcing from greenhouse gases2, yet contribute the largest uncertainty to the total radiative forcing estimate1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the Arctic climate system there are many delicately balanced inter-connections between processes related to the land, ice, ocean and atmosphere2,3,4,5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Arctic is a challenging region to model6, although skill and process understanding is progressing3,5,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we present and investigate a previously unknown coupling between migratory Arctic seabirds and cloud radiative effects (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This climate coupling occurs through changes in atmospheric particle number in response to seabird-colony ammonia (NH3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Seabirdclimate coupling.Schematic summary of processes that couple Arctic seabird-colony ammonia emissions with climate.Full size image', 'Together with gas-phase sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and water, NH3 can form new particles in the atmosphere with diameters of 12 nm (refs 8, 9, 10) that can continue to grow to sizes that affect climate11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This particle formation process is widely accepted as a key contributor to particle number in the Earths troposphere, with particle formation rates being highly sensitive to NH3 mixing ratios between about 1 and 100 p.p.t.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (parts per trillion by volume; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If newly formed particles grow by condensation of sulfuric acid, organic vapours and/or other compounds to diameters larger than 5080 nm, they could influence climate indirectly by acting as the seeds for cloud-droplet formation, modifying the reflectance of solar radiation by clouds11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More abundant particles form more-numerous and smaller cloud droplets for a fixed cloud liquid-water content, that in turn increase cloud reflection of solar radiation; a cooling effect12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The impact of NH3 emissions from Arctic summertime seabird guano on particle formation and cloud radiative effects has not been previously identified or quantified, and despite the known importance of NH3 for particle formation, there are few NH3 measurements in the Arctic14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the summertime Arctic, the precursor vapours for particle formation arise from natural local sources3,17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Natural H2SO4 arises from oxidation of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) that is produced by marine biological activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wind facilitates the transfer of DMS from the ocean into the atmosphere, where oxidation produces sulfur dioxide (SO2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultimately, H2SO4 is produced either through SO2 aqueous oxidation in clouds or in the gas phase by reaction of SO2 with atmospheric oxidants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only the latter of these oxidation pathways leads directly to particle formation that increases particle number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Bacterial hydrolysis of seabird guano produces NH3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20), previously linked to particle formation in remote regions downwind of penguin colonies21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Arctic and near-Arctic regions north of 50° N, recent emission inventories suggest that migratory seabird colonies emit about 40 Gg of NH3 each year18,19, primarily between May and September when some tens of millions of breeding pairs are nesting in the region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several recent global chemical-transport model (CTM) studies have implemented these or similar seabird-colony NH3 emissions7,14,22, although none have investigated the impact of these emissions on size-resolved particle number concentrations, clouds and climate as depicted in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oceans contribute a relatively smaller amount to Arctic summertime NH3 emissions22 and have been identified as a net sink of NH3 in the summertime Canadian Arctic Archipelago14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other particle-precursor vapours of natural origin, which we consider later in our discussion, include extremely low-volatility organic compounds (EL-VOCs), amines and iodine23,24,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Wentworth et al.14 recently measured summertime atmospheric surface-layer NH3 mixing ratios during a 2014 shipboard campaign in the Arctic as part of a multi-year research project (NETCARE, NETwork on Climate and Aerosols: addressing key uncertainties in Remote Canadian Environments; Methods section) and presented evidence that seabird colonies are significant sources of NH3 in the summertime Arctic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wentworth et al.14 also showed that observed summertime PM1.0 (particulate matter with diameters smaller than 1.0 m) in the high Arctic at Alert, Nunavut, Canada are significantly more neutralized (indicating the availability of gas-phase NH3) than during the rest of the year, when previous aircraft measurements have also indicated Arctic aerosol to be highly acidic27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the influence of seabird-colony NH3 on particle formation, particle number concentrations and cloud-albedo radiative forcing (Fig 1) has not yet been examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we quantify particle-number changes and the particle-induced cloud-albedo radiative effect in response to Arctic seabird-colony ammonia emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use the GEOS-Chem-TOMAS (GCT) CTM7,28,29 with online aerosol physics and chemistry (Methods section and Supplementary Methods) to quantify the impact of seabird-colony NH3 emissions on Arctic atmospheric surface-layer reduced nitrogen (gas-phase NH3 and particulate ammonium (NH4+)), particle formation, growth and subsequent radiative impacts of particle-induced modification of cloud properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GCT is a state-of-the-science model for this application as it includes the chemical and physical pathways that connect NH3 emissions to climate through particle formation and condensational growth, balanced by losses due to gas and particle scavenging, both in and below clouds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that ammonia from Arctic seabird-colony guano makes a key contribution to bursts of newly formed particles that are observed in the summertime Arctic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our simulations indicate that growth of these seabird-influenced particles yield pan-Arctic-mean cooling tendencies that could be large (about 0.5 W m2) due to particle-induced changes in cloud albedo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This climate-relevant coupling between Arctic seabirds and cloud radiative effects is explored in the following sections.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Atmospheric reduced nitrogen from Arctic seabird guano', 'Figure 2a shows the geographic distribution of total annual Arctic seabird-colony NH3 emissions from recent inventories18,19,30 that were implemented in our GEOS-Chem-TOMAS simulations between the months of May and September.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further details about these NH3 emissions are provided in the Methods section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2b shows that in the majority of the ice-free Arctic, the seabird-colony emissions yield a 50500% increase in the simulated summertime atmospheric surface-layer total reduced nitrogen (gas-phase NH3 and particulate NH4+) relative to a simulation without the seabird-colony NH3 emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these simulations, 61% of the Arctic atmospheric surface layer pole-ward of 66° N increases in NH3 by more than 50%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This highlights the pan-Arctic potential for seabird-guano NH3 to increase particle formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The seabird-colony-reduced nitrogen source accounts for about 40% of the simulated summertime surface-layer total reduced nitrogen and 90% of the NH3 in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago region north of 70° N. Wentworth et al.14 found that GEOS-Chem-simulated NH3 near Alert was at the lower limit of the range of shipboard measurements, suggesting the Arctic seabird source may be even larger or there may be other unidentified sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model-measurement comparisons along the NETCARE ship track in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago region indicates that Arctic seabird-colony emissions can produce NH3 mixing ratios of 10 to 1,000 p.p.t.v., whereas without those emissions, NH3 mixing ratios are underestimated by two to three orders of magnitude in the GEOS-Chem CTM14 (Supplementary Figs 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Arctic seabird-colony NH3(g) emissions and impacts on atmospheric surface-layer NH3(g) and NH4 +(p) mixing ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Locations and annual

evidence of ammonia levels', 'We consider the weekly aerosol neutralization measurements14 conducted using filter samples at Alert, Nunavut, Canada as evidence of NH3 levels since there are no ongoing NH3 measurements at Alert.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conduct thermodynamic calculations to estimate the summertime NH3 mixing ratios indicated by the ion concentrations in the Alert aerosol filter measurements (Methods section and Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our thermodynamic calculations indicate that NH3 mixing ratios above 1 p.p.t.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (and plausibly as high as 1 p.p.b.v.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  are consistent with the summertime measurements at Alert that show the aerosol neutralization ratio typically exceeds 0.7 (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These levels of NH3 are consistent with the NH3 mixing ratios measured during the 2014 NETCARE-shipboard campaign14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GEOS-Chem simulations indicate that Arctic seabird-colony NH3 emissions provide sufficient NH3 to contribute the majority of these NH3 levels14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Outside of summer, the aerosol neutralization ratio based on Alert filter measurements is typically less than 0.4, and our calculations indicate that this corresponds to NH3 levels of less than 1 p.p.t.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This annual cycle in the particle neutralization state occurs each year and also suggests that seabird-colony emissions are a key source of the NH3 since the timing of the greatest neutralization in the observations coincides with the period of the migratory seabird-colony emissions.

particles with diameters smaller than 20 nm, rather than larger accumulation-mode particles that are often associated with long-range transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the summertime, the Arctic atmosphere reaches its most pristine state owing to efficient cleaning by precipitation5,6,7,32,33,34, which favours particle formation since available vapours are more likely to form new particles

observed summertime N10 bursts at Alert.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a state-of-the-science ternary (NH3+H2SO4+H2O) particle formation scheme35,36 (Methods section), the GCT model more-closely simulates these N10 bursts when the seabird-colony NH3 source is implemented relative to an otherwise similar simulation without this NH3 source (Fig 4), reducing the mean-fractional bias31 relative to measurements from 0.86 to 0.47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The timing and magnitude of the N10 bursts is reasonably well represented with the GCT model, but inconsistencies may arise because the seabird-colony emissions are emitted uniformly between May and September and potential sub-grid scale effects related to plume dispersion of seabird-colony NH3 are not considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous studies have found a variety of trace gases including amines9,37, EL-VOCs23,24,25 and iodine26 that could also stabilize nascent particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We considered whether they could contribute to additional particle formation near Alert.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the NETCARE 2014 summertime shipboard campaign near Alert, gas-phase amines were consistently below the instrument detection limit of 0.5 p.p.t.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Methods section and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These low concentrations of amines might enhance particle formation9, but in contrast, gas-phase ammonia observations during NETCARE 2014 ranged from 40 to 870 p.p.t.v., which are levels typically associated with significant particle formation and early growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If amines did participate in particle formation, this would need to be very close to their source, before the gas-phase amines condense on pre-existing particles or react with gas-phase oxidants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies indicate lower concentrations of EL-VOCs in the Arctic than needed to fully support the observed particle formation24,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conducted calculations of the expected contribution from EL-VOC-related particle formation in this region based on current knowledge of EL-VOC sources (Methods section) and found a low contribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Iodine oxides have also been linked to particle formation in Arctic coastal regions26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spatial extent of this influence is not well established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have no observational constraints on the gas-phase iodine oxides near Alert, so we cannot rule out their additional contributions (Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary marine aerosols can also contribute to the number of ultrafine particles in certain regions of the Arctic39,40,41,42, which could regionally reduce the relative contribution of seabird-colony emissions to ultrafine particle number concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, MSA can contribute to particle formation if a base exists for the nascent clusters43,44, and as a result could increase the relative contribution of seabird-colony emissions to the number of ultrafine particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recent evidence by Giamarelou et al.15 suggests that ammonium sulfate is the dominant constituent in sub-12 nm particles near the high-Arctic site Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This supports our use of the particle-formation scheme based on ammonia, sulfuric acid and water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that current knowledge about particle-formation processes is limited, possibly NH3 may act along with other co-emitted trace gases and in concert with MSA in yielding the observed N10-particle bursts at Alert.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consider all of the above together as compelling evidence for the key role of seabird-colony emissions in Arctic particle formation and early growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Seabird-influenced particle growth to cloud-relevant size', 'To influence clouds and radiation, the nascent particles must grow to sizes larger than 5080 nm; sizes that act as the seeds for cloud-droplet formation in summertime Arctic clouds4,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our GCT simulations indicate sufficient growth of the seabird-colony-influenced particles that the number of particles larger than 80 nm (N80) increases throughout the summertime Arctic surface layer by 1050% over most of the Arctic Ocean, with the largest changes near the major seabird colonies, particularly in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago region, and also along the eastern coast of Greenland, towards Iceland (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulated pan-Arctic-mean surface-layer N80 for August increased from 40.4 to 49.5 cm3 with the implementation of seabird-colony NH3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, there is sufficient growth of the newly formed particles associated with the extra NH3 from seabird colonies to yield pan-Arctic changes in the number of particles that are large enough to potentially act as the seeds for the formation of cloud droplets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As well, with the seabird-colony ammonia implemented, the simulated regional-mean surface-layer number of cloud-condensation nuclei (CCN) at 0.2% supersaturation (CCN0.2) over the pack ice of the inner Arctic Basin for August is about 18 cm3, which is within the range of measurements from the region3 (1530 cm3; Methods section and Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without this ammonia source and for the same region, the simulated regional-mean surface-layer CCN0.2 for August is 12 cm3 and the CCN0.2 is less than 10 cm3 over much of the pack ice region of the inner Arctic, which underestimates the measurements3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the inner Arctic (north of 80 °N), the simulated summertime regional-mean CCN0.2 concentrations are most sensitive to the extra ammonia source at altitudes below about 1.2 km (changes of about 2030%; Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the greatest impacts of the seabird-colony ammonia are on clouds in the lower troposphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulated CCN0.2 concentrations decrease from 500 m to the surface layer (Supplementary Fig 7), as do measurement vertical profiles from this region45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This decrease towards the surface is thought to be due to efficient particle removal in and below low-level clouds combined with limited mixing into the stable surface layer of air that originates near particle sources (open water, land), rises and is transported into the inner Arctic above the surface layers3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Condensation of sulfuric-acid and low-volatility organic vapours contributes to particle growth in our simulations.

uncertainty about primary organic aerosol and low-volatility organic-vapour precursor emissions from the oceans17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our simulations, while exhibiting skill in representing Arctic particle number and size distributions7, may miss additional particles and vapours that could enhance particle number and growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Seabird-influenced cloud-droplet number

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our findings suggest that the pristine summertime Arctic is an environment where changes in particle formation can have a noteworthy impact on cloud radiative effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we have investigated the contribution of seabird-colony ammonia emissions to Arctic particle-number concentrations and identified a resultant substantial cloud-albedo radiative effect in response to changes in cloud-droplet number for fixed cloud liquid-water content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The evidence that migratory seabirds are a major source of NH3 in the Arctic and a key contributor to Arctic particle formation draws attention to the connections between the fauna, nitrogen cycle, atmospheric aerosol and aerosolcloud interactions in the Arctic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study highlights the need for multi-disciplinary research, ongoing measurements of NH3, particles and clouds in the Arctic region, and detailed study of the natural Arctic fauna to better understand the details of the related processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the accelerated rate of Arctic warming1,2,51, seabird numbers and migratory patterns may change, altering the seabird-guano NH3 emissions in the Arctic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Climate warming may also change other particle sources in the Arctic through oceanic emissions52,53, ship traffic54 and other anthropogenic pollution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the relative importance of NH3 from seabird guano to the Arctic climate may be susceptible to future change.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Shipboard trace-gas measurements', 'Measurements of gas-phase NH3 were taken in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago region aboard the Canadian Coast Guard Ship (CCGS) Amundsen during a NETCARE (NETwork on Climate and Aerosols: addressing key uncertainties in the Remote Canadian Environments) campaign from 13 July 2014 to 7 August 2014 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measurements were conducted in Baffin Bay, Lancaster Sound and Nares Strait.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NH3 was quantified using the Ambient Ion Monitor-Ion Chromatograph (AIM-IC) system (Model 9000D, URG Corp.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AIM-IC is a semi-continuous, on-line instrument that provides hourly measurements of both water-soluble gases and ions in particulate matter with a diameter smaller than 2.5 m (PM2.5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ambient air is pulled through a parallel plate wet denuder, which scavenges water-soluble gases, whereas PM2.5 are collected downstream in a supersaturation chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

aqueous standards, and a system background was determined by overflowing the inlet with zero air (AI 0.0 UZ-T, PraxAir).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An NH3 detection limit of 38 p.p.t.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  was calculated by taking 3 of the background signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prevent influence from activities aboard the ship, NH3 measurements are only reported if the following conditions were met: ship speed  greater than 4 knots, apparent hourly wind direction ±90° of the bow (where the inlet box containing the denuder and supersaturation chamber was located), and standard deviation of apparent wind direction  less_than 36°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Detection limits for six different amines during this study are given in Supplementary Table 1 and were determined in a similar manner to NH3.
