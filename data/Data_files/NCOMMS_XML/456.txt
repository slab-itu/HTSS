Shape-shifting colloids via stimulated dewetting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The ability to reconfigure elementary building blocks from one structure to another is key to many biological systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bringing the intrinsic adaptability of biological systems to traditional synthetic materials is currently one of the biggest scientific challenges in material engineering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we introduce a new design concept for the experimental realization of self-assembling systems with built-in shape-shifting elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that dewetting forces between an oil phase and solid colloidal substrates can be exploited to engineer shape-shifting particles whose geometry can be changed on demand by a chemical or optical signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find this approach to be quite general and applicable to a broad spectrum of materials, including polymers, semiconductors and magnetic materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This synthetic methodology can be further adopted as a new experimental platform for designing and rapidly prototyping functional colloids, such as reconfigurable micro swimmers, colloidal surfactants and switchable building blocks for self-assembly.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'At all length scales, shape alone can set the path for the spontaneous self-organization of elementary units into remarkably complex architectures1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The programmed structural rearrangements of proteins, for instance, drive a broad range of important functions from molecular recognition, sensing and reporting, to macroscopic changes in the optical and mechanical bulk properties of biomaterials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Minute morphological variations in the shape of the building blocks can tip the balance towards a desired structure or random aggregate2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the nano- and micron-scale, this concept is particularly intriguing since the self-assembly of rationally designed colloidal building blocks could lead to the next generation of functional materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This realization has given rise to a new and rapidly growing form of material engineering that aims at using self-assembly of colloidal matter as a nano-fabrication process3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An enormous theoretical and computational effort has taken place to determine the optimal attributes of building blocks for target structures and to extract general design principles for self-assembly5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, advances in synthetic colloidal chemistry have enabled us to shape particles into new geometries8,9, and to tailor their interactions by means of entropic10,11, chemical12,13 and non-equilibrium forces14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, extensive colloidal architectures, with increasing structural complexity, are shown to emerge spontaneously from Browninan suspensions of elementary building blocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to biological matter, however, the majority of these self-assembled materials are intrinsically static, which limits the control over structural changes to externally applied fields or variations in the interaction potential between the constituent building blocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Currently, the main strategy to impart shape-changing abilities to colloidal particles is to utilize stimuli responsive polymers (typically thermo- or pH-responsive).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These materials have been cleverly used to cause anisotropic swelling in colloidal particles, thus yielding spheroids with adjustable aspect ratios16,17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this work, we describe a new approach based on dewetting forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that solid particles engulfed in oil droplets can be controllably and reproducibly dewetted by chemically reducing the oils affinity towards the substrate, thus yielding new colloidal morphologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this principle, we create a whole new class of shape-shifting particles whose geometries can be dynamically changed using chemical or light stimuli.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Homogeneous nucleation of reactive emulsions', 'Our synthetic methodology can be summarized in a few basic steps: we start with a suspension of hydrophilic solid particles (the seeds); we then covalently attach silane molecules to the seeds surface to create an hydrophobe monolayer; next the hydrophobized seeds are engulfed in oil droplets; and finally the hydrophobe layer is chemically degraded to allow a controllable dewetting of the seed towards new equilibrium morphologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We will now describe each step in detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nucleation of monodispersed oil droplets from a homogeneous aqueous solution can be achieved via the base-catalysed condensation of alkoxysilanes into insoluble silsesquioxane oligomers20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This emulsification mechanism can be rationalized as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially, a tri-alkoxysilane (the oil precursor) is added to an aqueous solution containing ammonia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this chemical environment, the labile alkoxy groups of the silane monomer are hydrolyzed to form water-soluble silanols, which rapidly condense into silsesquioxane oligomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As these oligomers grow larger, their solubility in the water phase decreases and they eventually phase separate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, however, instead of two macroscopic phases, this phase separation leads to highly monodispersed oil droplets, which form via a classic nucleation and growth mechanism (Supplementary Fig 1 and Supplementary Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be understood by considering that the newly formed oil phase contains silanol moieties that can undergo deprotonation at the oilwater interface, thus providing electrostatic stabilization for the growing oil droplets, which prevents their coalescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This surface charge manifests itself with a negative -potential of about 30 mV at a pH of 7, which monotonically decreases to a value of about 80 mV at a pH of 12 (Supplementary Fig 2 and Supplementary Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Heterogeneous nucleation', 'When solid impurities are present, the formation of the oil phase occurs via heterogeneous nucleation, generating nano- and micron-sized oil-in-water droplets carrying a single solid inclusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We illustrate this point in Fig 1a by using monodispersed polystyrene spheres as model impurities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each polystyrene seed particle triggers the nucleation of an oil droplet, which partiality wets the seed with a well-defined contact angle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, when haematite (-Fe2O3) colloids are used as the seeds, we observe an unexpectedly high wettability, which results in the seeds being fully encapsulated in the oil droplets (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the marked hydrophilicity of the haematite seeds at the reaction conditions (40 mV at pH=9), this result seems, at first, rather unusual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, one must consider that the silanols produced during the initial stages of the oil nucleation are highly reactive and readily form covalent bonds with hydroxyl-containing substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This leads to the formation of a silane hydrophobe layer where the Si moiety of the oil is bound to deprotonated oxygen atoms on the seed particles, effectively making their surface hydrophobic (Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm this hypothesis, encapsulated seeds were recovered from the oil phase by a repeated washing treatment in ethanol (in which the oil is highly soluble), and then brought back to water to assess their colloidal stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even after several washing steps, the recovered seeds are no longer stable in the aqueous medium, but instead they rapidly aggregate into macroscopic sediments (Supplementary Fig 3 and Supplementary Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A gentle etching treatment using hydrochloric acid, however, is sufficient to erode a thin surface layer of the substrate and the corresponding silane molecules bound to it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, this treatment fully restores the original particles hydrophilicity and yields a stable suspension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Heterogeneous nucleation of silicon oil on different solid seed particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) When the TPM oil precursor is added to a colloidal suspension of negatively charged polystyrene spheres, the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of oil droplets occurs on the solid seed particles, resulting in a well-defined contact angle between the seed particle and the oil phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) However, when the TPM oil precursor is added to a suspension of haematite cubes, we observe the complete encapsulation of the seeds inside the oil phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inserts show SEM images of the polymerized hybrid particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars, 800 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We explain this behaviour with the formation of a hydrophobic layer of silane molecules that condense and covalently bind to the haematite substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c,d) Schematics showing the haematite surface chemistry before and after the formation of the hydrophobizing silane layer.Full size image', 'Reconfigurability via stimulated dewetting', 'Next, we exploit this encapsulation mechanism for producing reconfigurable hybrid emulsions, as well as colloidal building blocks with shapes that were previously inaccessible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The idea, schematized in Fig 2a, is to induce the dewetting of the oil droplets from the seeds by chemically etching the oil-substrate siloxane linkages that are responsible for the formation of the passivating hydrophobic layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we demonstrate several viable methods that can be used to achieve this goal, depending on the nature of the seed particles used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For haematite substrates, the most obvious way to stimulate the dewetting of the oil, is to simply repeat the same etching treatment in HCl that we used previously to restore the particles hydophilicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is shown in Fig 2b, where we lowered the pH of the emulsion to about 2 to observe a radical change in the particles morphology (Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we noticed that the dewetting pathways strongly depend on the geometry of the seeds, and for identically shaped seeds our dewetting scheme yields highly reproducible shapes as we illustrate in Figs 2c and 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Larger field of views are shown in Supplementary Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: pH- and

#@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on the type of substrate, the dewetting can be triggered by NaOH, HCl or light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two different silane-based oil phases were used in our experiments: TPM, which can be hardened via radical polymerization, and 3-(chloropropyl)trimethoxysilane, which self-hardens in the presence of NH3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b,c) Optical microscopy images showing the practical realization of shape-shifting particles using the mechanism described in a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In b we used colloidal cubes as substrates and we triggered the dewetting by a pH change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In

general chemical trigger for dewetting is the addition of NaOH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Suspending encapsulated seeds in a solution of 60 mM NaOH and gently raising the temperature to 65 °C, in fact, causes the siloxane bridges to undergo to a rapid hydrolytic decomposition independently from the substrate used during encapsulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This, once again, weakens the adhesion force between the oil and the substrate and prompts the dewetting of the seeds in a similar fashion as for the HCl treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we show in Fig 3, we have applied this base-triggered dewetting process to haematite, silica and titania seeds, obtaining nearly identical results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Photo-stimulated dewetting', 'A third and most intriguing dewetting mechanism is offered by a modified photo-Fenton reaction21, which takes advantage of the photocatalytic properties of the colloidal substrate to degrade the silane hydrophobe layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this mechanism only works with photo-active substrates, we found it particularly interesting as the particles can remain in their native aqueous medium at a neutral pH and be dewetted by simply exposing them to light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For haematite seeds, light-stimulated dewetting was realized by irradiating the sample with green or blue light (560 nm) in the presence of a small amount of hydrogen peroxide (typically 2.5% wt).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The irradiation promotes the formation of hydroxyl radicals (OH·), which readily degrade the hydrophobe layer, revealing the bare haematite surface to the oil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is demonstrated by the time-lapse shown in Fig 2c, where initially spherical particles respond to the light input by rapidly reconfiguring into new equilibrium morphologies (Supplementary Movie 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on the experimental conditions, such as light intensity and H2O2 concentration, this reconfiguration can take from a few seconds to minutes to complete.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, at high light intensities the oil droplets can be completely detached from the seeds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Generalization of the mechanism', 'Because alkoxysilanes can form stable condensation products with many different oxides such as those of titanium, aluminum, zirconium, tin, iron and nickel, we expect this reconfiguration mechanism to be quite easily extended to many other colloidal systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have tested seeds of various shapes and compositions, including haematite, titania and silica, and have observed nearly identical dewetting dynamics; some of these results are summarized in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3 also illustrates an interesting feature of one of the silane compounds utilized in this study, namely its ability to be chemically hardened via a free radical polymerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (TPM) is used as the oil phase, a radical initiator can cause the crosslinking of the silsesquioxane oligomers through their methacrylate moieties, thus effectively solidifying the oil into an organo-silica hybrid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This polymerization enables us to study the reconfiguration dynamics in great detail by rapidly fixing the intermediate morphologies throughout the dewetting process, and subsequently imaging these states by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After polymerization, the final solid product can be dried, resuspended and further processed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the process of oil nucleation, dewetting and polymerization can be repeated to rationally install multiple reconfigurable lobes on the same seed particle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is demonstrated in Fig 4, where the anisotropic particles shown in Fig 3c are reutilized as seeds in a second oil-nucleation step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the newly nucleated oil wets the exposed haematite, avoiding the preexisting lobe due to its stronger surface charge and hydrophilic character (Supplementary Figs 5 and 6 and Supplementary Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This particles new geometry can now be fixed by a second free radical polymerization or further reconfigured by a subsequent dewetting step to obtain the shape shown in Fig 4e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The versatility of this synthetic scheme relies on the fact that the colloidal design is here reduced to a wetting problem, thus allowing the a priori engineering of complex colloidal shapes by a rational choice of the solid substrate and the oil phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Reconfigurable colloidal architectures', 'While shape alone has been frequently used to drive self-assembly to generate complex organization, the use of building blocks with dynamically reconfigurable geometries is yet to be experimentally explored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe that this new family of shape-shifting colloids might provide unique opportunities for the topological control of structures in a dynamic manner, with ordered, quasi-ordered and network-like morphologies that can be switched on demand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the incorporation of shape-shifting building blocks into self-assembled colloidal architectures could be used to induce local structural rearrangements, bulk phase changes or to engineer switchable lattice defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We explore this idea with two experiments that we summarize in Fig 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first experiment (Fig 5a) we assembled a colloidal crystal doped with a small amount of reconfigurable colloids acting as substitutional impurities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially, the odd shape of the substitutional particles causes a visible distortion in the host lattice, however, as the particles reconfigure into their new geometry the lattice rearranges and the strain disappears (Supplementary Movie 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This idea could be further developed to engineer switchable line- or dislocation-like defects within microstructured materials, to enable, for example, healing or controlled failures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Reconfigurable materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Timelapse

reconfiguration of an entire colloidal crystal can lead to architectures that would normally be inaccessible via direct self-assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The timelapse of Fig 5b (taken from Supplementary Movie 4) shows a crystallite assembled by depletion forces that, on exposure to blue light, reconfigures into a striped phase consisting of alternating oil droplets (light spheres) and elongated iron-oxide particles (black particles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This striped microstructure would normally be inaccessible because of the magnetic attraction between the iron oxide particles that would segregate them into a dense cluster.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have demonstrated that chemically triggered wettingdewetting phenomena can be utilized to engineer shape-shifting colloids with addressable geometries and compositions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This synthetic concept allowed us to design unusually complex colloidal shapes and reproducibly synthesize them in bulk amounts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the method is general and applicable to broad spectrum of materials, it can serve as a fast prototyping platform for the preparation of the next generation of non-spherical light-activated swimmers, active Janus surfactants and shape-shifting particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reconfigurability, in particular, can open new avenues for fabricating bulk microstructured materials from self-assembled colloidal crystals and enable us to find new rules for geometry-driven assembly processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An interesting challenge for the future is to engineer smarter hydrophobe layers that could be set on or off on demand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would allow for the reversibility of the shape shifting and enable, for example, the assembly of switchable devices.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#
