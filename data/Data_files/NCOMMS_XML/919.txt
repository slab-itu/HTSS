Sansanmycin natural product analogues as potent and selective anti-mycobacterials that inhibit lipid I biosynthesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Tuberculosis (TB) is responsible for enormous global morbidity and mortality, and current treatment regimens rely on the use of drugs that have been in use for more than 40 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to widespread resistance to these therapies, new drugs are desperately needed to control the TB disease burden.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, we describe the rapid synthesis of analogues of the sansanmycin uridylpeptide natural products that represent promising new TB drug leads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The compounds exhibit potent and selective inhibition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the etiological agent of TB, both in vitro and intracellularly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The natural product analogues are nanomolar inhibitors of Mtb phospho-MurNAc-pentapeptide translocase, the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of lipid I in mycobacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work lays the foundation for the development of uridylpeptide natural product analogues as new TB drug candidates that operate through the inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by infection with the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and, according to the World Health Organization, was responsible for 1.5 million deaths and the emergence of 9.6 million new cases of the disease in 2014 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current treatment for TB relies on a 6-month quadruple therapy comprising rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol and pyrazinamide2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite achieving a cure rate of 95% for drug-sensitive TB, this regimen is not effective against multi-drug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) TB infections, which are emerging at an alarming rate globally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While MDR infections can be treated with second-line antibiotics for extended periods, XDR infections are virtually untreatable as exemplified by a 98% mortality rate in a recent outbreak in South Africa3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To effectively combat these drug resistant cases, new TB drugs with novel modes of action are desperately needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two compounds, bedaquiline and delamanid, were recently approved for drug resistant TB; however these are only used as drugs of last resort owing to reported toxicity issues4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is well established that natural products provide a rich resource for the discovery of new drug leads5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 65% of antibacterials approved for use between 1981 and 2010 were natural products or natural product derivatives5,6, including currently employed TB drugs for example, rifampicin and the aminoglycosides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sansanmycins belong to the uridylpeptide natural product family, a sub-class of the structurally diverse nucleoside antibiotics7,8 that include the liposidomycins9, caprazamycins10, capuramycins11,12 and muraymycins13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sansanmycins are produced by the soil bacterium Streptomyces sp.14,15,16 and have a number of interesting structural features that are unique to the uridylpeptide natural product family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include a 3-deoxyuridine motif appended to N-methyl-2,3-diaminobutyric acid (DABA) via an unusual cis-4,5-enamide linkage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DABA moiety is found within a pseudo-tetrapeptide chain which possesses the sites of variation in the family7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to these fascinating structural features, the natural products have been shown to possess significant activity against Mtb, including MDR strains14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these reasons we became interested in the sansanmycin scaffold as a privileged starting point for the discovery of novel TB drug leads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this manuscript we describe the rapid synthesis of a library of sansanmycin analogues that exhibit potent and selective activity against the virulent H37Rv strain of Mtb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that these natural product analogues disrupt the activity of Mtb phospho-MurNAc-pentapeptide translocase (variously designated as MurX in mycobacteria, MraY or translocase I in the literature), the integral membrane enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of lipid I, a key intermediate in mycobacterial peptidoglycan synthesis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Anti-mycobacterial activity of dihydrosansanmycin AC', 'Our initial goal focused on gaining access to structural analogues of the sansanmycin uridylpeptide natural product family (for example, analogues of sansanmycin AC 13 (refs 14, 15), Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, several derivatives of uridylpeptide natural products have been generated through engineering of the organisms that produce the natural products or through semi-synthetic approaches and, as such, feature limited structural variation17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of synthetic studies have also been reported on uridylpeptide natural products and analogues26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33, some of which have been shown to possess antimicrobial activity7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The focus of the present study was to develop a rapid and divergent synthetic strategy to access a diverse library of sansanmycin analogues that would enable the determination of key structure-activity relationships specifically against Mtb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In previous studies it has been shown that dihydropacidamycin analogues, lacking the enamide linkage maintained activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the potential metabolic lability of the enamide, we chose to target dihydrosansanmycin analogues in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the preparation of the first targets (Supplementary Methods) dihydrosansanmycins AC (46), screening against the virulent H37Rv strain of Mtb was conducted using a resazurin assay34 (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These compounds were also counter-screened against HEK293 cells to gauge selectivity (Supplementary Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were pleased to find that sansanmycin analogues 46 exhibited significant inhibitory activity against Mtb, with dihydrosansanmycin A (4) and B (5) possessing nanomolar MIC50 values (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crucially, the stereochemistry at C-4 of the ribose moiety was shown to be essential for anti-mycobacterial activity, with S-configuration in a dihydrosansanmycin B analogue leading to complete loss of activity (Supplementary Fig 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the importance of stereochemistry at C-4 has also been reported for dihydropacidamycin, whereby analogues with S-stereochemistry at this position exhibited reduced activity against P. aeruginosa compared with the corresponding R-epimer23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Structures of sansanmycins A-C (13), synthetic dihydrosansanmycins AC (46) and inhibitory activity against Mtb H37Rv.MIC values of isolated sansanmycins AC (13) were previously reported by Xie et al.14,15 MIC50 values of 46 represent the average of two independent experiments, each performed in triplicate;

Given the promising activity of the natural product analogues against Mtb, we were next interested to assess the antimicrobial activity against other pathogenic bacteria to gauge whether there was any selectivity in activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Towards this end, we counter-screened 417 against a panel of 15 pathogenic Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial strains using a high throughput screen, including several ESKAPE pathogens of clinical relevance35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The organisms in the screen included: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria ivanovii, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Providencia alcalifaciens, Ochrobactrum anthropi, Enterobacter aerogenes, Acinetobacter baumannii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, while a small number of compounds exhibited modest activity against E. coli and P. aeruginosa (MIC50s: 12.5100 M), most did not inhibit the growth of other strains up to concentrations of 100 M (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This selective anti-mycobacterial activity is an important criterion for the development of a TB drug lead and, as such, was a particularly encouraging observation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Second-generation dihydrosansanmycin analogues', 'Because substitution of the synthetically challenging m-Tyr residue in 5 with a Gly residue in 12 did not lead to a substantial drop in anti-mycobacterial activity, we chose to maintain Gly at this position, and modify the Leu residue within the peptide chain (R in Fig 1), in a second generation compound library.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, a number of alkyl, heteroalkyl, aryl and heteroaryl substituents were proposed in analogues 2136 with a view to interrogating further SARs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dihydrosansanmycin analogues 2136 were synthesized using the divergent solid-phase strategy described above (Supplementary Methods) and assessed for anti-mycobacterial activity against Mtb H37Rv (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Substitution of the isopropyl sidechain in 12 with different alkyl side chains in 2124 did not lead to substantial differences in activity with MIC50 values ranging from 510 to 930 nM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, extension of the cyclohexyl Gly side chain in 24 with a cyclohexyl Ala moiety led to a substantial increase in potency with analogue 25 exhibiting an MIC50 of 80 nM against Mtb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The introduction of more polar substituents, for example, a Thr side chain in 26 or an Asp residue in 27 led to a significant drop in activity (MIC50=2.80 M and 6.25 M, respectively) when compared with original lead 12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar drop in activity was not observed when a Lys residue was introduced in 28 which was equipotent to 12 (MIC50=700 nM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incorporation of aryl and heteroaryl groups in 2936 in place of the Leu residue in 12 generally gave rise to improved anti-mycobacterial activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, introduction of a Phe residue in 29 or a p-CF3 Phe residue in 30 led to a two-fold improvement in activity compared with 12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Substitution with Tyr (31), 3-pyridyl Ala (32) and Trp (33) residues led to a modest drop in activity against Mtb compared with 29 (MIC50=0.440.98 M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shortening the side chain of Phe derivative 29 with a phenyl Gly side chain in 34 resulted in a dramatic drop in activity (MIC506.25 M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in line with the reduced activity observed when shortening the side chain in the homologous analogues 24 and 25 with saturated cyclohexyl functionalities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extending the Phe side chain in 29 by a further methylene unit in homo-Phe derivative 35 led to a four-fold loss in activity, while the incorporation of a naphthyl Ala side chain in 36 provided the most potent compound in the aryl substituted series with an MIC50 of 180 nM against Mtb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with the first generation series of dihydrosansanmycin analogues, 2136 did not show any activity (up to 200 M) against HEK293 cells, and exhibited poor or no activity against the 15 pathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Synthesis of 2nd generation sansanmycin analogues 2137 with inhibitory activities against Mtb H37Rv.MIC50 values represent average of two independent experiments, each performed in triplicate; positive controls RIF:

on the DABA unit was m-Tyr (found natively in the sansanmycins), whilst in the second generation library (2136, Fig 3), a cyclohexyl Ala residue provided the most potent anti-mycobacterial activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this in mind, analogue 37 was designed and synthesized that incorporated both of these functionalities (Fig 3, Supplementary Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gratifyingly, this analogue possessed the most potent activity against Mtb of all the natural product analogues synthesized with an MIC50 of 37 nM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mechanism of action of sansanmycin analogues', 'It has been hypothesized that the antibacterial mechanism of action of the nucleoside antibiotic family is via inhibition of translocase I (MraY), an integral membrane protein that transfers UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide to polyisoprenylphosphate phosphate to afford lipid I, thereby catalysing the first membrane-associated step of peptidoglycan biosynthesis (Fig 4a)7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whilst inhibition of MraY has been unequivocally determined for some members of the family8,25,28,36,37,38, including a recently published structure of a complex of muraymycin D2 with the Aquifex aeolicus enzyme25, the antibacterial activity of other nucleoside antibiotics, including the sansanmycins, have only been predicted to be caused by inhibition of this enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, structural analogues of the nucleoside antibiotics have, on several occasions, been shown not to inhibit MraY, but to target other essential enzymes, suggesting that structural changes to the natural product can attenuate and even switch activity to other bacterial enzymes39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were therefore interested in assessing the inhibitory activity of dihydrosansanmycin analogues 717 and 2137 against Mtb translocase I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that while the translocase I enzyme is dubbed MraY in most organisms, in mycobacteria this enzyme is encoded by the murX gene and is therefore referred to as MurX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An assay was developed to assess the inhibitory activity of the natural product analogues against Mtb MurX in an initial screen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with prior work on MraY orthologues of Mtb MurX (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  41), we were unable to overexpress the enzyme and therefore opted to assay the native enzyme in mycobacterial membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, Mtb mc2 6230 membrane protein preparations were generated that contained MurX, along with other membrane proteins (including MurG, the enzyme that generates lipid II from lipid I, Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inhibition of MurX was assessed in a MurXMurG coupled assay whereby a decrease in lipid II formation was monitored by radiochemical means.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the nucleoside antibiotics have only been demonstrated to inhibit MurX, we made the assumption that, despite the coupled nature of the assay, it would serve to effectively measure the inhibition of MurX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The assay was initially performed by the addition of a 200 nM concentration of a given sansanmycin analogue together with UDP-14CGlcNAc and UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide (Parks nucleotide).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following quenching of the enzymatic reactions and an extraction-based work up, thin layer chromatography (TLC) and phosphorimaging were used to measure the degree of inhibition of MurX by measuring a decrease in the formation of lipid II that incorporated the 14C label on the GlcNAc moiety (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were pleased to observe that all the natural products inhibited MurX to varying degrees in this assay (9100% MurX inhibition at 200 nM, Supplementary Tables 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the most potent analogues against Mtb growth were also the most active MurX inhibitors in this screen (Supplementary Figs 38 and 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a recent report by Ishizaki et al., CPZEN-45, an analogue of the caprazamycin family of nucleoside antibiotics was shown not to inhibit MurX in M. smegmatis, but rather inhibited WecA, an enzyme involved in arabinogalactan biosynthesis in mycobacteria40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WecA also uses UDP-GlcNAc as a substrate but, unlike MurX, does not utilize Parks nucleotide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, we also assessed inhibition of WecA by the sansanmycin analogues in our assay40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we did not observe inhibition of WecA by any of the compounds and, as such, the natural product analogues appear to be selective inhibitors of lipid I formation in peptidoglycan biosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Inhibition studies of the synthetic sansanmycin analogues against Mtb MurX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Reactions catalysed by Mtb MurX to generate lipid I and Mtb

'Having established inhibition of Mtb MurX by the dihydrosansanmycins at a single concentration, we next focused on three analogues which showed the most potent inhibition of Mtb and Mtb MurX in vitro (compounds 25, 36 and 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TLC-based assay developed above was employed using a range of concentrations of a given analogue and IC50 values of 54, 48 and 41 nM were determined for 25, 36 and 37, respectively (see Fig 4b for assay plate for compound 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, there was significant correlation between the IC50 against Mtb MurX and the activity against Mtb H37Rv in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To unequivocally determine that our lead sansanmycin analogues were inhibiting Mtb MurX exclusively (and not a combination of MurX and MurG), we established a complementary fluorescence-enhancement assay which measured the incorporation of an N-dansylated UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide (dansylated on the diaminopimelic acid moiety) using a modification to an assay reported for the E. coli orthologue by Bugg and co-workers42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, Mtb mc2 6230 membranes were incubated with one of the lead analogues (compounds 25, 36 or 37) and the

(IC50=30 nM), 36 (IC50=14 nM) or 37 (IC50=16 nM) demonstrated similar inhibitory potencies to those determined via the radiochemical assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, these data verify that the compounds are selective inhibitors of Mtb MurX and that this is likely the mechanism of anti-mycobacterial activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the development of this fluorescence assay now provides a higher throughput means to screen future Mtb MurX inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Intracellular anti-mycobacterial activity of lead analogues', 'Having established that the three lead analogues were potent inhibitors of Mtb MurX, they were next assessed for their anti-mycobacterial activity in an intracellular assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, THP-1 macrophages were infected

anti-mycobacterial activity intracellularly with IC50s of 1.57, 4.33 and 0.11 M for 25, 36 and 37, respectively (Supplementary Figs 3133).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This data provides encouragement that these compounds may serve as bonafide leads for future TB drug discovery efforts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Stability studies', 'We finally assessed the stability of 25, 36 and 37 in mouse and human plasma and mouse and human liver microsomes with each of the compounds showing excellent stability, with degradation half-lives of 7 h for human and mouse plasma and 160 min for human and mouse liver microsomes (Supplementary Tables 6 and 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the potent inhibition of Mtb (both in vitro and intracellularly) and the promising stability data, these compounds now serve as exciting leads for the development of a further generation of sansanmycin derivatives with a view to developing a TB drug lead which operates through the inhibition of lipid I synthesis in Mtb.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In summary, we have described the development of a robust divergent solid-phase synthetic strategy to rapidly access a library of dihydrosansanmycin natural product analogues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of potent inhibitors of Mtb were elucidated that possess activity both in vitro and in macrophages infected with the organism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The compounds were shown to potently inhibit the enzyme MurX, responsible for lipid I synthesis, a key intermediate en route to peptidoglycan in Mtb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this mechanism of action, the natural product analogues possess selective activity against Mtb, with little to no activity against other pathogenic bacteria that also synthesize peptidoglycan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This selectivity provides a practical advantage for the potential use of these compounds as TB drugs as well as MurX as a TB drug target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work in our laboratories will focus on understanding the mechanism of this selectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the compounds were stable in plasma and against the action of liver microsomes which, together with the potent and selective activity against Mtb, lays the foundation for the development of TB drug leads based around this natural product scaffold in the future.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
