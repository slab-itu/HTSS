A kagome map of spin liquids from XXZ to DzyaloshinskiiMoriya ferromagnet  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Despite its deceptive simplicity, few concepts have more fundamental implications than chirality, from the therapeutic activity of drugs to the fundamental forces of nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In magnetic materials, chirality gives rise to unconventional phenomena such as the anomalous Hall effect and multiferroicity, taking an enhanced flavour in the so-called spin-liquid phases where magnetic disorder prevails.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kagome systems sit at the crossroad of these ideas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Motivated by the recent synthesis of rare-earth kagome materials and the progresses in optical-lattice experiments, we bring together an entire network of spin liquids with anisotropic and DzyaloshinskiiMoriya interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This network revolves around the Ising antiferromagnet and ends on (ferromagnetic) chiral spin liquids with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As for the celebrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet, it now belongs to a triad of equivalently disordered phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present work provides a unifying theory of kagome spin liquids with time-reversal invariant nearest-neighbour Hamiltonians.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In condensed matter, competing interactions have proven able to stabilize extended phases where chirality could be encoded in the spin texture, that is, coming from the collective behaviour of spins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This spin-chirality is responsible for phenomena as varied as the anomalous Hall effect1,2,3, multiferroicity4 and possibly high transition temperature superconductivity5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, kagome systems are fertile soil for exotic spin textures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Motivated by a growing number of materials6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13, the kagome lattice, whose name comes from a traditional Japanese woven bamboo pattern, has attracted the attention of chemists, experimentalists and theorists alike.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The classical Heisenberg antiferromagnet (HAF) is a canonical example of order-by-disorder14, a counter-intuitive mechanism where order is induced by fluctuations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As for its quantum counterpart, it is one of the few models that has been confirmed to be a quantum spin liquid by a gamut of complementary approaches15,16,17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, the kagome lattice has also been shown to support examples of the long-sought KalmeyerLaughlin chiral spin liquid20,21,22,23,24,25,26, a bosonic analogue of the fractional quantum Hall effect with anyonic excitations27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our present work sits at the frontier of these ideas of unconventional phenomena, spin liquids and chiral phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We unveil a threefold mapping between kagome spin liquids, which is exact both at the classical and quantum level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mapping brings into a general framework the well-known Heisenberg and XXZ antiferromagnets, together with a continuously connected network of models with DzyaloshinskiiMoriya (DM) and anisotropic ferromagnetic (FM) couplings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All interactions are time-reversal  invariant and between nearest neighbours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the end points of this connected network,  symmetry can be spontaneously broken in the classical ground state, giving rise to finite scalar chirality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HAF maps onto a pair of systems characterized by FM pinch points in their structure factors, a signature of algebraic correlations constrained by an effective local flux conservation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly for quantum spin-1/2, the present work puts the Ising antiferromagnet at the centre of this connected network of quantum spin liquids, shedding a new light on the reluctance of this model to order28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the experimental front, our phase diagram includes the Herbertsmithite compound ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2, which sits at the tip of an extended region of quantum disorder within linear spin wave theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work is also motivated by the experimental possibility to explore a broad range of anisotropic interactions in the recently synthesized rare-earth kagome materials Dy3Ru4Al12 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12) and Yb3Ru4Al12 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13) and in optical lattices29,30.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

re-written in the same form, while conserving the kagome symmetry and the spin unit-length, without imposing any spurious constraints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To ensure the spin unit-length , we consider local transformations  acting on each spin independently, that is, transformations from the global basis to a local one, :  with .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then for the transformation to be non-trivialthat is,

very peculiar signatures when probed magnetically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The ground-state of the HAF, that is, the manifold of configurations with minimum energy, supports algebraic spin

pedagogical review by Henley).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As depicted in Fig 2, pinch-point singularities are clearly visible in the structure factors of the  ground-state manifolds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The striking similarity of the HAF and  structure factors is actually a quantitative illustration of their underlying equivalence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because the planar spin components are, respectively,

tune the Hamiltonians and induce scalar chirality spontaneously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Since our threefold mapping does not affect the z-axis (see Fig 1), decreasing Jz has the same influence on the HAF and  Hamiltonians: it tunes the HAF into the XXZ model', '', 'which is mapped onto what we name the XXZ± models', '', '', '', 'with J greater than 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mapping is valid for all  but

three-colouring problem up to a global O(2) symmetry35, whose degeneracy is countable and extensive36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As illustrated in Fig 3, the system is entirely paved with only two kinds of triangular configurations, A and , with opposite vector chirality35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The noticeable consequence of our mapping is that in the XXZ and XXZ+ ground states, the A or  configurations are respectively replaced by a collinear state F with zero chirality; the resulting imbalance ensures finite and opposite vector chirality between the two XXZ± ground states, while preserving their extensive degeneracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this point of view, it is interesting to think of the XXZ ground state as coming from the cancelation of positive and negative DM terms, once ferromagnetism

A or  configurations in favour of a collinear state (F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same scenario holds for the XXZ0 and FDM± ground states where the spontaneous out-of-plane magnetization makes the chirality scalar (see equation (8)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An example of spin configuration with finite scalar chirality is given in c: the planar projection of the spins corresponds to configuration A.Full

unconventional phenomena.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the interplay between a chiral spin liquid and itinerant electrons is an up-and-coming topic21,37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the FDM± ground state is neither fully ordered like a solid or paramagnetic like a gas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a pictorial way it is a magnetic liquid where strong correlations and fluctuations co-exist, which can then couple via double-exchange to another fluid made of itinerant electrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While hopping on the scalar-chiral spin texture, the itinerant electrons pick up a Berry phase that might not only induce anomalous Hall conductivity1,21,39, but at the same time feedback into the strongly correlated spin texture to induce exotic magnetic order21,40,41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This feedback actually does not require scalar chirality and would also be pertinent to the XXZ± lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It should be noted that given the large value of , an experimental realization of the FDM± models per se would arguably be difficult in solid state physics, but on the other hand, particularly promising for optical lattices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the kagome geometry29 and spin anisotropy30 have been experimentally realized with ultracold atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is also good hope that the active research on synthetic gauge fields might be able to produce synthetic DM interactions43,44,45, with the caveat that the DM vector should be out-of-plane here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Last but not least, FM insulators with DM coupling have been studied in the context of magnon
