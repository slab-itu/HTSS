Dynamics of extinction debt across five taxonomic groups  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Species extinction following habitat loss is well documented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these extinctions do not happen immediately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biodiversity surplus (extinction debt) declines with some delay through the process of relaxation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Estimating the time constants of relaxation, mainly the expected time to first extinction and the commonly used time for half the extinction debt to be paid off (half-life), is crucial for conservation purposes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, there is no agreement on the rate of relaxation and the factors that it depends on.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we find that half-life increases with area for all groups examined in a large meta-analysis of extinction data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A common pattern emerges if we use average number of individuals per species before habitat loss as an area index: for mammals, birds, reptiles and plants, the relationship has an exponent close to a half.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also find that the time to first determined extinction is short and increases slowly with area.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Loss of natural habitats is one of the major environmental problems of our time and with it comes the danger of irreversible loss of biodiversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to human activities, many previously continuous habitats have now been reduced to fragments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These habitat remnants are left with levels of biodiversity unsustainable in the long run.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extinctions follow but not immediately1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biodiversity surplus or extinction debt4,5,6 is lost with some delay7,8 through the process of relaxation1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rate, at which it happens, and the factors that it primarily depends on, are still controversial issues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, it is crucial for conservation2,3,6 to estimate the time constants of relaxation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Since extinction is difficult to observe, theoretical approaches have an important role to play.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To describe relaxation, a negative exponential decay has frequently been assumed1,2,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In such a model, species are effectively independent of each other and extinction is associated with the environmental factors rather than community interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternative form is the negative hyperbolic decay9,10,11,12, which can be associated with various ecological mechanisms, such as competition9 or neutrality12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this model, species density plays a role, so that extinction rate slows markedly once most of the extinction debt has been paid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a relaxation curve may also be derived from the neutral model12, which assumes all individuals from all species to be equivalent, and demographic stochasticity to be the only force at work in a fixed and finite environment13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of these non-biologically grounded assumptions, the neutral model has been criticized14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, it yields an explicit relationship of half-life (t50) with area, population density, generation time and initial species richness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has also provided reasonable predictions when applied to birds12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More comprehensive comparisons of theoretical estimations with real data can determine which of these models gives the best fit and which ecological factors affect the relaxation process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A considerable number of studies have examined relaxation time, which is the time required for the extinction debt to be paid off.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The timescales for this to happen have been reported to range from a few years3,16 to thousands of years1,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is still no consensus on the determinants of relaxation time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several factors are at work: population size, metapopulation processes as well as the ongoing patterns of habitat loss17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most argue that extinction debt is paid faster in smaller habitat remnants1,2,9,12,18, but others argue that the relaxation time is insensitive to area, except at extremely small sizes6,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There have even been claims that diversity declines faster on larger islands16 or that extinction debt may be entirely absent for certain community types20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'From a conservation perspective, the delay of extinction following habitat loss offers a critical opportunity for action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If habitat restoration is accomplished before species start to disappear, irreversible damage to the community can be forestalled2,6,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is of paramount importance to know how large the delay is, the shape of the decay curve (Fig 1) and the factors they depend on.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Relaxation process assumed for a habitat remnant.At time t=0, an area B is lost (a) leaving only the area A (top, inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following this, the species richness (b) relaxes to a new lower equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The area loss is assumed to be total and permanent.Full size image', 'Here we carry out an extensive meta-analysis of published data on extinction debt to interpret existing observations and predict patterns of response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We explore the dependence of the relaxation rate on fragment area, species richness and population abundance and we refine the existing models of biodiversity decay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We do this separately for different taxonomic groups and we find that the half-life of extinction debt increases with area for all groups examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we use average number of individuals per species before habitat loss as an area index, the relationship has an exponent close to a half, irrespective of large taxonomic differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also find that the time to first determined extinction is short and increases only slowly with area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of the best-fitting model, the species decay in time is not exponential but a power law, suggesting that species loss occurs over a wide range of timescales.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Theoretical predictions for relaxation rates', 'For the rate of biodiversity decay, we develop a model that combines an existing model for extinction9,10,11 with the neutral model12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important measure of the vulnerability to extinction is the average number of individuals per species before habitat loss:', '', 'Here A is the area of the habitat remnant,  the density of individuals over all species of the community studied and S0 the initial species richness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this paper, we use n0 as a proxy for area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this rescaling of area, the solution of the model, equation (6) (see Methods;

Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Estimation of parameters of the best-fitting models.Full size table', 'We find extinction debt to be a universal phenomenon; in almost every case, we observe a delay in the extinctions following loss of habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all groups (Fig 2), we find a significant increase of half-life, t50, with area index n0 (and also with area alone), so the estimated exponent  is always positive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also fairly close to =1/2, with the exception of invertebrates, for which a weaker relationship (=0.31) is found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strength of this pattern is underlined by our sensitivity analysis (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intercept in Fig 2 (value at n0=1) can be understood as the average number of generations to extinction, when n0=1, that is, when the average area per species can only support one individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, when initial populations are this small, we expect extinction within a small number of generations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, this is what we see for all taxonomic groups except invertebrates, for which the intercept is substantially higher.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Invertebrates would seem to constitute an outlier to the pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we assign less confidence to the parameters that we used for our model from the invertebrate studies for a number of reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, some studies look only at the most common species while others employ morphospecies as a surrogate for species (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we combine the results for all taxa except invertebrates the result is:', 'Figure 2: Dependence of half-life on habitat remnant area.Each point represents the estimated half-life for a single fragment using the formula for the neutral-community half-life, equation (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each solid line is a direct regression fit to these points while the dotted lines are the best-fitting models using the full nonlinear regression approach (Supplementry Equation 14).These figures are equivalent to Fig 3b in Halley and Iwasa12;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Because of its central role in the dynamics of biodiversity loss, the time for half of the extinction debt to be paid off, t50, is the natural unit through which to parameterize the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in conservation biology, the time until first determined extinction, tF, is also of importance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because it represents the time before relaxation commences, whereas at t50 the relaxation process is already half-completed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given this, the time until first determined extinction marks an important threshold for conservation action6 to forestall extinctions by re-establishing connectivity among habitat remnants and restoring degraded land.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The expected time to first determined extinction is also very useful in the design of surveys related to extinction debt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the example on birds used in Fig 3, the first extinction happens in 10 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, a search for biodiversity loss is not likely to give a signal before this time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, if the habitat remnant has been isolated for thousands of years, the current species richness will say nothing about the isolation event because all extinctions caused by that event will have been completed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a survey to yield useful information about the relaxation process, we should have tF less_than t less_than tL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For the trajectory of species loss in time, negative exponential1,2,6 and power-law forms9,10,11 have commonly been used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A direct comparison of these two forms would require observations of relaxation trajectories, which are not available, apart from a very few studies (for example, Ferraz et al.3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our assumed general form of Supplementary Equation 4 allows for both power-law and exponential solutions for the dynamics of relaxation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If  greater than 0, the solution approaches a power-law form when t is large.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An exponential pattern of relaxation can result in cases where =0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for all taxonomic groups, the values of  that we estimate from the data lie well above zero and so our results strongly suggest a power law rather than an exponential pattern of decay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When relaxation follows a power law, it is initially rapid but becomes much slower thereafter; extinctions are distributed more evenly across timescales rather than dominated by a single timescale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The results of our approach underline the widely appreciated fact that habitat loss is a key factor in species extinction22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also demonstrate that, regardless of differing ecological histories, different taxonomic groups can respond similarly to a reduction in population size associated with reduction of their habitat area and that we can assign characteristic rates of biodiversity decline using only area, initial species richness, average per species population density and average generation time.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
