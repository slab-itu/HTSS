Evolution of form in metalorganic frameworks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Self-assembly has proven to be a widely successful synthetic strategy for functional materials, especially for metalorganic materials (MOMs), an emerging class of porous materials consisting of metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) and metalorganic polyhedra (MOPs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there are areas in MOM synthesis in which such self-assembly has not been fully utilized, such as controlling the interior of MOM crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate sequential self-assembly strategy for synthesizing various forms of MOM crystals, including double-shell hollow MOMs, based on single-crystal to single-crystal transformation from MOP to MOF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, this synthetic strategy also yields other forms, such as solid, core-shell, double and triple matryoshka, and single-shell hollow MOMs, thereby exhibiting form evolution in MOMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We anticipate that this synthetic approach might open up a new direction for the development of diverse forms in MOMs, with highly advanced areas such as sequential drug delivery/release and heterogeneous cascade catalysis targeted in the foreseeable future.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'For the past few decades, a main theme of materials chemistry has been to control the exterior and interior of solid-state materials to meet the rising demand for new, high-performance functional materials1,2,3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, controlling the interior of the particles and thereby transforming solid particles into more sophisticated forms, such as core-shell, hollow, matryoshka (for example, Russian doll), yolk-shell and multi-shell hollow particles, has been an important synthetic challenge for materials chemists because these exotic materials could exhibit advanced functional properties in catalysis7,8,9,10, chemical sensing11,12,13, energy14,15,16,17 and biomedical applications18,19,20,21 (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, similar synthetic efforts have been applied to metalorganic frameworks (MOFs), an emerging class of porous materials22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, unlike other micro-/nanostructures reported in metal/metal oxide systems, those in MOFs are still in their infancy, as evidenced by the fact that the vast majority of these materials have hollow forms, an early stage of form evolution (Fig 1)37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The synthetic strategies identified for hollow MOFs include templating methods (using polystyrene beads25,26, emulsion droplets27, CO2 bubbles28, MOFs29 and metalorganic polyhedron (MOP) crystals30), interfacial growing methods31, spray-drying techniques32 and surface-driven mechanisms33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent notable example from Lah group utilizes MOP crystals as a sacrificial template to synthesize hollow MOFs30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these efforts, making further sophisticated forms in MOFs is significantly hampered by a lack of rational synthetic strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Schematic representation of various forms of micro-/nanostructures.Solid, core-shell, hollow, matryoshka, yolk-shell and multi-shell hollow structures (from I to VI, respectively).Full size image', 'Here, we first demonstrate a synthetic strategy for double-shell hollow MOF via sequential self-assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequential steps involved in creating double-shell hollow MOF are shown in Fig 2: (1) single-crystal to single-crystal transformation from MOP to MOF through postsynthetic linker insertion (I-a), (2) epitaxial growth of MOP on the MOF surface (I-b), (3) insertion of another linker to form double to triple-matryoshka metalorganic materials (MOMs) (I-c), and finally (4) elimination of MOP by chemical etching (I-d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through this stepwise synthetic procedure, we successfully complete form evolution from a parent MOP to various MOMs, including solid, core-shell, double and triple matryoshka, and hollow single- and double-shell structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Schematic illustration of form evolution.The process of synthesizing various forms of MOMs, including UMOM-1-a, UMOM-1-b, UMOM-1-b, UMOM-1-c and UMOM-1-d from UMOM-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stage I-a, UMOM-1 (MOP)UMOM-1-a (core-shell) by partial postsynthetic linker insertion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stage I-b, UMOM-1-aUMOM-1-b (single-shell hollow) by etching process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stage I-b, UMOM-1-aUMOM-1-b (double matryoshka) by epitaxial growth of UMOM-1 on the surface of UMOM-1-a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stage I-c, UMOM-1-bUMOM-1-c (triple matryoshka) by partial postsynthetic linker insertion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stage I-d, UMOM-1-cUMOM-1-d (double-shell hollow) by etching process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blue sphere represents cuo-MOP and yellow rod represents dabco linker.Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Synthesis of cuboctahedron MOP and its solid-state structure', 'Our journey to form evolution in MOMs begins with cuboctahedron MOPs (hereafter, cuo-MOPs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These MOPs are composed of 12 Cu2(COO)4 paddlewheel nodes and 24 5-R-1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid (R-mBDC, R=H, OH, NO2, SO3 and so on)38,39 (Fig 3a), and some of these MOPs prefer face-centered cubic (fcc) packing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As reported by Eddaudi and Lah40,41, there is a striking structural similarity between such fcc-packed cuo-MOPs and their corresponding linker-inserted MOFs with ubt topology (Fig 3b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ubt-MOFs can be obtained by connecting the axial position of paddlewheel nodes in cuo-MOPs with linear linkers, such as 1,4-diazabicyclo2.2.2octane (dabco) and 4,4-bipyridyl (bpy) through conventional solvothermal synthesis (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Chun et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  reported ubt-MOFs by connecting the twelve Zn(II) paddlewheel nodes of a MOP cage with their neighbouring MOPs via dabco,42 while Wang group synthesized Cu(II) paddlewheel-based ubt-MOFs using amino-functionalized cuo-MOPs and bpy linkers43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there is no report demonstrating single-crystal to single-crystal transformation from cuo-MOP to ubt-MOF, we hypothesize that by careful choice of cuo-MOP, a structural transformation from fcc-packed cuo-MOP to ubt-MOF might be possible via postsynthetic insertion of dabco linkers44,45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Structural similarity between ubt-MOF and fcc-packed cuo-MOP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The

paddlewheel nodes is estimated as 6.67.5 Å based on a Cambridge Structure Database search (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A new member of the fcc-packed cuo-MOP family, UMOM-1 Cu24(OH-mBDC)24(DMSO)8(H2O)16 has been synthesized and characterized by X-ray single-crystal diffraction, exhibiting a CuCu distance of 7.58.2 Å, which is slightly longer than the ideal distance for dabco insertion (Supplementary Figs 14 and Supplementary Data 1) due to a slight rotation of the MOP cages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the cages are not perfectly aligned for dabco insertion, the packing of the MOP cages are close to ideal fcc packing, which is a desired feature for the planned structural transformation (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Single-crystal to single-crystal transformation of MOP to MOF', 'When we soaked the crystals of UMOM-1 in a N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution (v/v=1:1) containing dabco, after 12 h, we noticed a crystal colour change from blue to green without any visual cracks in the optical microscopic images (Fig 3e and Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent X-ray single-crystal analysis confirmed that this is indeed a single-crystal to single-crystal transformation from MOP (UMOM-1) to MOF (UMOM-2) (Supplementary Fig 6, Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we compared the structures of UMOM-1 and UMOM-2, the space group was changed from I4/m to Fm-3m with 0.87% cell volume reduction (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In UMOM-2, as expected, the cofacial paddlewheel nodes are connected by dabco with a CuCu distance of 7.0 Å (Supplementary Figs 7 and 8), which is a significant decrease from those of 7.5 and 8.2 Å in the parent MOP, UMOM-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1H NMR spectra was obtained from digested solution of UMOM-2 to confirm the insertion of dabco (Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio of OH-mBDC to dabco is 4.00:1.02, which agrees well with the ratio found in the X-ray single-crystal analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'When the structural transformation from UMOM-1 to UMOM-2 was monitored by X-ray synchrotron powder diffraction (Fig 3f and Supplementary Fig 10) at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) in the Republic of Korea, noticeable 2 changes could be seen at 9.6°, 9.8° and 10.7°, which correspond to (213), (222) and (312) reflections, respectively, for the parent UMOM-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the transformation, the intensity of the (213) reflection decreased, while the intensity of the (222) reflection increased with a slight shift toward higher 2 values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to cell parameter changes, the (312) reflection shifted to lower 2 values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results clearly indicate that there is a progressive change from UMOM-1 to UMOM-2 during the linker insertion reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To propose a plausible mechanism for structural change, the transformation can be simulated using both the rotation and translation of MOP cages (Supplementary Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When compared with the experimental X-ray synchrotron powder diffraction patterns, a 8.9° clockwise rotation can occur along the c-axis, together with a 0.18 Å translation inward (Supplementary Figs 12 and 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these results, we conclude that both rotation and translation of MOP cages are necessary to accommodate dabco molecules inside UMOM-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The resulting MOF, UMOM-2, is a porous material, as confirmed by the N2 sorption isotherm at 77 K (Supplementary Figs 14 and 15) with BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET) and Langmuir surface areas of 2,540 and 2,820 m2 g1, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculated surface area (Connolly surface) is 3,030 m2 g1, as determined with a 1.4 Å van der Waals scale factor and 1.84 Å Connolly radius using Material Studio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pore size distribution of UMOM-2 from the N2 isotherm using the oxide surface cylindrical model shows three different types of pores: 10.9, 15.6 and 18.8 Å, corresponding to the pore diameters of three types of cages (truncated tetrahedron, cuboctahedron and truncated octahedron, respectively, as identified in single-crystal structures) (Supplementary Fig 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CO2 adsorption-desorption isotherm was also obtained, and the maximum adsorbed amount of CO2 is 3.4 mmol g1 at 298 K and 6.8 mmol g1 at 273 K (Supplementary Fig 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values are comparable to those of rht-MOF-7 (4.0 mmol g1 at 298 K and 6.5 mmol g1 at 273 K)47, also known as Cu-TDPAT48, a leading MOF for CO2 capture with rht topology, which has structural similarity with ubt topology41,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The X-ray powder diffraction patterns show that the sample does not undergo any phase changes after activation (Supplementary Fig 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peak positions of as-synthesized UMOM-2 and activated UMOM-2 match exactly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thermogravimetric analysis shows that UMOM-2 is thermally stable up to 250 °C (Supplementary Fig 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The kinetic profile of the transformation procedure was obtained using 1H NMR analysis (Supplementary Fig 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The kinetic profile shows that the process becomes slower over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Synthesis of single-crystal single-shell hollow MOF', 'While synthesizing UMOM-2, instead of making a solid MOF, we quenched the reaction during linker insertion, resulting in a core-shell system of MOF@MOP (from shell to core), which we call UMOM-1-a (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such hybrid core-shell systems between MOP and MOF have not been established previously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we note that UMOM-2 is not soluble in methanol while UMOM-1 is.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is due to a drastic solubility change as a result of forming an extended solid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This drastic difference in solubility makes methanol an ideal solvent for chemical etching to create a hollow crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, methanol can dissolve only MOP in the core-shell system of UMOM-1-a, leaving MOF in the outer shell untouched.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we treated UMOM-1-a with methanol, single-shell hollow crystals formed (UMOM-1-b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 4 and Supplementary Movies 1 and 2 clearly show the formation of single-shell hollow crystals of UMOM-1-b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the thickness of the shell could be controlled by the reaction time (t) for linker insertion (Fig 5ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average shell thickness is 10, 26 and 40 m at t=30, 90, and 120 min, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optical microscopic images and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images clearly show the hollow interior of UMOM-1-b (Fig 4af and Supplementary Fig 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultravioletvisible absorbance spectra show that the copper ions are released from the crystals to the methanol solution during UMOM-1-b synthesis and etching reaction is completed in 200 min (Supplementary Figs 22 and 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1H NMR analysis of the digested methanol solution shows that only OH-mBDC of MOP is released but dabco is not (Supplementary Fig 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All these results pinpoint that dissolved MOP is released from the crystals during the etching process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4:

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In summary, we successfully demonstrated the first example of double-shell hollow MOF, UMOM-1-d, via sequential self-assembly, followed by self-disassembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, this strategy leads to complete form evolution from a parent MOP to various MOMs, including solid, core-shell, double and triple matryoshka, and hollow single- and double-shell forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another marked difference between these and other hollow MOF crystals is single crystallinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While other hollow MOFs often consist of aggregates of small crystals, the hollow MOFs presented here are the first case where single crystallinity is demonstrated by X-ray single-crystal diffraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect that such examples of extreme self-assembly might open up new avenues to various forms of MOFs for synthesizing single crystalline multi-shelled hollow MOF with hierarchical porous materials with trimodal (for example, micro-/meso-/macro porous structures) pore system and highly advanced applications such as sequential drug delivery/release and biomimetic cascade catalysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A good case for the latter can be found in nature, as exemplified by native pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH2), a multifunctional catalytic machine with an icosahedral double-hollow structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PDH2 is composed of three different enzymes that are distributed individually in two shells50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This spatial separation is known to be crucial for the overall function of PDH2 and plays a key role in its catalytic behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mimicking such multi-component, macromolecular machines through surface modification or postsynthetic modification is a synthetic challenge for next-generation MOMs, and will further push the limit of self-assembly.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
