Single-photon test of hyper-complex quantum theories using a metamaterial  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In standard quantum mechanics, complex numbers are used to describe the wavefunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this has so far proven sufficient to predict experimental results, there is no theoretical reason to choose them over real numbers or generalizations of complex numbers, that is, hyper-complex numbers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments performed to date have proven that real numbers are insufficient, but the need for hyper-complex numbers remains an open question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we experimentally probe hyper-complex quantum theories, studying one of their deviations from complex quantum theory: the non-commutativity of phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We do so by passing single photons through a Sagnac interferometer containing both a metamaterial with a negative refractive index, and a positive phase shifter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To accomplish this we engineered a fishnet metamaterial to have a negative refractive index at 780 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the metamaterial phase commutes with other phases with high precision, allowing us to place limits on a particular prediction of hyper-complex quantum theories.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Quantum mechanics is an extremely well-established scientific theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it has been contested since its inception, beginning with the famous BohrEinstein debates1, quantum mechanics has stood its ground against competing theories and experimental tests for almost 100 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Especially in the past decades, quantum mechanics has been challenged by a variety of alternative theories, including various hidden-variable models2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11, non-linear modifications of quantum dynamics12,13,14,15,16,17, spontaneous localization models18,19,20,21,22,23 and generalized probabilistic theories24,25,26,27,28,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In generalized probabilistic theories, sometimes also called post-quantum theories, quantum mechanics is just one particular theory in a vast sea of possibilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One important class within this sea are the so-called hyper-complex theories26,27,28,29,30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They differ from standard quantum theory in the nature of superposition coefficients (probability amplitudes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether nature prefers a quantum theory based on real, complex, quaternionic or general hyper-complex amplitudes is an experimental issue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excitingly, some predictions of hyper-complex are experimentally testable, since basing the superposition principle on hyper-complex probability amplitudes leads to a version of quantum mechanics wherein simple phases are not guaranteed to commute32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this prediction has experimentally been studied in the past with massive, non-relativistic particles33, in that regime the quaternionic amplitudes are known to be exponentially suppressed27,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus it is difficult to place bounds on genuine post-quantum effects in these experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, new theoretical calculations have shown that this result does not necessarily apply to relativistic particles, such as single photons35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, any discrepancies between standard complex quantum theory and its hyper-complex generalization may be experimentally accessible in the relativistic regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The superposition principle states that linear combinations of wavefunctions are also valid wavefunctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In textbook quantum mechanics these weighting coefficients are complex numbers, but there is no immediate theoretical requirement for this restriction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, it was shown by Birkhoff and von Neumann in 1936 that a mathematically consistent quantum theory can be constructed using only real numbers36, but such a theory cannot correctly predict the results of certain experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One well-known example of this failure is that complex numbers are required to model all physically-realizable two-level systems, such as the polarization state of a photon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far complex quantum mechanics (CQM) has proven necessary to describe most quantum phenomena, but it is not known if it will remain sufficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Just as one can use real numbers, one can use hyper-complex numberssuch as quaternions37to construct a quantum theory26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A quaternion is a mathematical generalization of the complex number with three, rather than one, imaginary components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quaternionic quantum mechanics (QQM) has attracted much attention, in part because it is a natural and elegant extension of standard quantum theory26,27,28,29,30,32,33,38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike many other post-quantum theories, QQM does not necessarily modify the postulates of quantum mechanics24,25,40,41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, QQM makes certain experimental predictions which are different from the predictions of complex quantum mechanicsjust as the predictions of a real quantum theory disagree with those of a complex theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One disagreement between CQM and QQM is the (non) commutativity of phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In CQM phases commute, since they are described by complex numbers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in QQM phases are generally described by quaternions, which do not necessarily commute; thus, in QQM phases will not necessarily commute.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of this idea, in 1979 Asher Peres proposed several experimental tests to search for quaternions in quantum mechanics32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of technological limitations at the time, only a single neutron experiment has tested his ideas33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work found a null result, which may not be surprising as it was later shown that quaternionic effects are likely to decay exponentially for massive particles27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus that experiment did not actually probe a prediction of quaternionic quantum theories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there is strong theoretical evidence that quaternionic effects will persist for relativistic particles, such as single photons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, we recently showed that for relativistic KleinGordon scattering quaternionic effects do indeed persist35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inspired by this and Peres proposal, here we present an experiment using relativistic particles, that allows us to precisely search for the phase non-commutativity predicted by relativistic QQM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To carry out our search for a hyper-complex effect we combine photonic quantum technologies, which provide a proven platform for foundational tests6,7,8,9,10,11,43,44,45,46, with metamaterials47,48,49,50 engineered to obtain a negative refractive index at 780 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We apply two different phases to single photons in a Sagnac interferometer, and perform a high-precision measurement to study their commutativity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We induce the two phases by very different optical media to enhance any potential non-commutativity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One phase is a standard optical phase (induced with a liquid-crystal), and the other is a negative phase which is induced by an artificial nanostructured metamaterial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the phase is negative, in the sense that the Poynting vector points opposite to the propagation vector51, see Supplementary Notes 2 and 3 for more details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of a broadband, negative-index metamaterial with single-photon technology at optical wavelengths is a technological achievement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our experiment we find that the net phase when applying the two phases in either order (meta-material before liquid crystal or vice versa) is equivalent to within at least 0.03°, meaning that complex quantum mechanics suffices to describe our experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To the best of our knowledge, our work places the most precise bounds on the commutativity of phases within hyper-complex quantum theories to date.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Experimental proposal', 'Our experiment is based on a Sagnac interferometer containing different phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As illustrated in Fig 1a, a perfectly balanced Sagnac interferometer, with an even number of reflections, results in all of the photons exiting through the same port that they entered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This results in a bright port and a dark port.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this

phases, PD is', '', 'where v is the visibility of Sagnac interferometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equation (2) is in fact a special case of the general equation presented in the Methods section (equation (14)), assuming that two phases commute with the reflection phase of the beamsplitter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since we expect any deviation from CQM to be small, we expect PD to be small.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we measure an amplified signal by interfering the bright and dark ports of the Sagnac interferometer in a MachZehnderlike interferometer (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (This visibility is amplified,

Sagnac interferometer, and use this information to draw conclusions about the commutativity of the phases in our experiment via .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we will see, if we perform two different measurements, each with different phases in the interferometer (two different values of ), we can altogether avoid needing to know v the visibility of the Sagnac interferometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To be clear, to use this fact one must ensure that the visibility of the Sagnac interferometer is unchanged by the addition of the phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The choice of test phases is important for discovering potential quanternionic phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In his proposal, Peres suggested an interferometry experiment using materials with complex scattering amplitudes, arguing that such materials would be more likely to have a quaternionic component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this vein, we choose two optical materials with very different phase responses: one material with a positive refractive index, and one with a negative refractive index.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use a standard liquid-crystal phase retarder to provide a uniform, low-optical-loss phase shift as our first positive phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For our second phase we use an artificial nanostructured metamaterial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These materials have recently been used to probe several exciting quantum phenomena52,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We designed our metamaterial to have a negative refractive index, and thus apply a negative phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Achieving this requires both the real part of permittivity and permeability to be negative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtain this at optical frequencies with a fishnet optical metamaterial which integrates two types of structures togetherone with a negative permittivity, and one with a negative permeability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Supplementary Note 1 for more details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interferometer performance', 'A sketch of our experimental implementation is presented in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We send heralded single photons (see the Methods section) into a Sagnac interferometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Sagnac interferometer has two output modes, labelled B and D in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CQM predicts that B is the bright port, and D is the dark port.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After exiting the Sagnac interferometer, photons in mode B reflect off of BS1, and those in mode D reflect off of BS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beamsplitter BS2 is used to reflect mode D so that both modes experience the same attenuation, as this yields the highest visibility interference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two modes then interfere at BS4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure high-visibility interference, the input light is polarized with polarizer P1, and two final polarizers P2

of the phases', 'After characterizing our setup with no additional internal phases in the Sagnac interferometer we must characterize the individual effect of each of the two phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first turn on liquid-crystal phase retarder (LC) by applying a voltage that results in an effective phase of  rad (see Fig 1d for the details of our LC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A resulting interference signal, when  the phase of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer is scanned, is shown in Fig 3b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On a single run, turning the LC on does not introduce any measurable effects: the visibility

the NIM marginally decreases the visibility of the Sagnac interferometer, leading to an increased MachZehnder visibility of VNIM=0.042±0.002.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This visibility increase occurs because inserting the NIM slightly degrades or shifts the spatial modes inside the Sagnac interferometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe that this increase in visibility is rather a systematic error (that is, a decrease in the visibility of the Sagnac interferometer), and not the quaternionic effect that we are interested in.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data with both phases', 'To observe an effect due to potential non-commutativity we only need study how visibilities change in response to different phases in the interferometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the systematic error of the LC phase is much smaller than the error caused by inserting the NIM, we leave the NIM inserted and compare the visibility when the LC phase is set to 0 rad and  rad.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allows us to neglect the larger systematic error of inserting the NIM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data with both the NIM inserted and LC phase set to  are shown in Fig 3d, and have a visibility of VBOTH=0.040±0.002.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We need to compare

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'As a final step we convert our visibility change into a different figure of merit to provide physical insight into our results: namely, a net phase difference when the NIM phase is applied before or after the LC phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To start this conversion, we extract the ratio of  when both phases are activated to  when only the NIM is inside the Sagnac, BOTH/NIM, from the following definition', '', 'Here, BOTH is defined in equation (17), and NIM is defined in equation (19) of the Methods section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If this ratio deviates from 1, then there must be some non-commutativity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can further convert this ratio into a phase shift between the clockwise and counter-clockwise modes of the the Sagnac interferometer simply as .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See the Methods section for more details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use equation (4) to compute BOTH/NIM for every data point, the resulting distribution is shown in the inset of Fig 4b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the mean of this distribution we find BOTH/NIM=1 with a precision of 2 × 107, that is, BOTH/NIM=0.99999999±2 × 107.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Converting this a phase shift yields a bound of =0.03°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In light of this analysis, our result can be seen as an extremely high-precision measurement of a phase shift between the two modes of the Sagnac interferometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In principle, such a phase shift could arise from other effects, even in a common-path Sagnac interferometer such as ours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in our estimation, all of these potential phase shifts are orders of magnitude smaller than our null result.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, given the geometry of our interferometer, the rotation of the Earth could lead to a phase shift of at most 104 degrees; Faraday effects caused by the Earths magnetic field would be even smaller.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, since they would be constant, all such phase shifts would present themselves as a reduced visibility of the Sagnac interferometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our experiment, the visibility of the Sagnac interferometer is not perfect; we attribute this to a slight mismatch between the spatial modes of the Sagnac interferometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the polarizers before and after the interferometer, polarization mismatch between the two modes, although possible, is very small.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that any effect of the polarization mismatch is smaller than the spatial mismatch of the two modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, these effects lead to a systematic decrease in the visibility of the Sagnac interferometer, and our data analysis accounts for this.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The phase shift derived here also allows us to compare our result to a previous neutron interferometry experiment33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we should point out that the deviation from CQM could be different for neutrons and photons, and thus such tests must be carried out in a variety of physical systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, quaternionic effects would likely decay exponentially for neutrons27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the neutron experiment it was found that two interference patterns (each created with two phases shifters inserted in either order) were shifted by less than 0.3°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, since each phase shifter imparted a phase on the order of 10,000°, they concluded that any quaternionic contribution must be  less_than 1 part in 30,000.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this assumes that the quaterionic phase is linearly proportional to total phasethere is no such requirement in QQM (see the Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the quaternionic phase could be completely independent of the standard quantum phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus only the absolute deviation from CQMs predictions is relevant to the quaternionic non-commutativity, and relevant bound from the previous work is 0.3°our bound is one order of magnitude tighter than this.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In our work we directly probe quaternionic quantum mechanics using relativistic particles38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A previous experiment used neutron interferometry, but it has been theoretically predicted that non-trivial quaternionic effects are exponentially suppressed for non-relativistic particles (such as neutrons).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this has not been proven for relativistic particles, such as single photons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, it was shown that quaternionic effects for relativistic Klein-Gordon scattering can persist35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This motivates our work, wherein we directly search for quaternionic effects within a relativistic framework.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work was enabled by the combination of a novel negative-index metamaterial with standard optical photonic technology, but further tests of QQM could be performed within optics using other methods to apply phases, or in other regimes (using, for example, near-field measurements).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further tests with other massive particles (that is, using molecular, electron, or other matter-wave interferometers) could also prove fruitful, but therein the measurements must be made extremely carefully to probe for exponentially decaying effects27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless of the physical system, it is essential to continue to search for effects predicted by post-quantum theories, as such tests may one day point towards a future theory, supplanting quantum mechanics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
