Mucosal immunoglobulins at respiratory surfaces mark an ancient association that predates the emergence of tetrapods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Gas-exchange structures are critical for acquiring oxygen, but they also represent portals for pathogen entry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Local mucosal immunoglobulin responses against pathogens in specialized respiratory organs have only been described in tetrapods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since fish gills are considered a mucosal surface, we hypothesized that a dedicated mucosal immunoglobulin response would be generated within its mucosa on microbial exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supporting this hypothesis, here we demonstrate that following pathogen exposure, IgT+ B cells proliferate and generate pathogen-specific IgT within the gills of fish, thus providing the first example of locally induced immunoglobulin in the mucosa of a cold-blooded species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we demonstrate that gill microbiota is predominantly coated with IgT, thus providing previously unappreciated evidence that the microbiota present at a respiratory surface of a vertebrate is recognized by a mucosal immunoglobulin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings indicate that respiratory surfaces and mucosal immunoglobulins are part of an ancient association that predates the emergence of tetrapods.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Individual vertebrate species have faced unique evolutionary pressures to continuously acquire oxygen from the environment, which has led to the development of diverse gas-exchange structures (that is, respiratory organs)1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most vertebrates, respiration occurs through specialized gas-exchange surfaces (that is, gill, lungs), although a small percentage of gas exchange may also occur through the skin (that is, cutaneous respiration)2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Design of specialized respiratory organs has evolved in response to several factors, most critically the environment where the organism lives, but also the size and phylogenetic position of the organism1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, vertebrates living in aqueous media have evolved evaginated gas-exchanges structures (that is, gills) while those acquiring oxygen from air have developed invaginated structures (that is, lungs) to prevent desiccation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An effective gas-exchange organ needs to maximize the efficiency with which oxygen from the external media (water/air) comes in contact with blood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of teleost fish this is accomplished by four pairs of vascularized gill arches composed of hundreds of gill filaments, which increase their contact surface by folding into the secondary lamella.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to respiration, gills perform other functions including osmoregulation, pH balance, ammonia excretion, hormone regulation, detoxification and immune defense1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gills are in direct contact with the water and therefore are continuously exposed to environmental toxins and pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, there is an evident need for the fish to defend such a large and delicate surface from pathogenic attack.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While little is known about how gill immunity operates, it has been reported that gill tissue contains a significant number of innate and adaptive immune cells and that several innate and adaptive immune molecules and pathways operate in the gill3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Teleost fish contain three immunoglobulin classes IgM, IgD and IgT/Z7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While IgM represents the most abundant class, strong IgM immune responses to infection or vaccination are mainly detected in plasma, whereas IgM titres in mucosal tissues such as gut, skin or gills remain low7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, IgM has been shown to coat a significant portion of the trout skin, gut and nasal microbiota8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secreted IgD has been identified in catfish and trout plasma11,12, although its function in teleosts still remains undetermined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As opposed to trout secretory IgD, the secreted form of catfish IgD lacks a V region and it has been suggested that this immunoglobulin may function as an innate pattern recognition molecule11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to IgM and IgD, teleosts contain a third immunoglobulin class, IgT (also called IgZ), first identified at the genome level in 2005 (refs 13, 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Except catfish and medaka, all other teleost species studied express this immunoglobulin15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously reported that teleost IgT is an immunoglobulin specialized for gut and skin mucosal immunity8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, we showed that IgT is the main immunoglobulin induced in the gut and skin mucosa on pathogenic challenge, and we also demonstrated that IgT plays a prevalent role in the coating of the microbiota found in these surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we discovered a novel B-cell lineage uniquely expressing surface IgT which represents the predominant B-cell subset in the trout gut-, skin- and nasal-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT, SALT and NALT)8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, fish IgT represents the most ancient mucosal immunoglobulin found in a vertebrate species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the newly attributed role of IgT in mucosal immunity has challenged the previous paradigm that specialization of immunoglobulin isotypes into mucosal and systemic responses arose during tetrapod evolution8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Three B-cell subsets have been identified in catfish11: IgM+IgD, IgM+IgD+, IgMIgD+, while generally two B-cell subsets can be identified in all other species that contain IgT/IgZ, including the IgM+IgD+IgT and the IgMIgDIgT+ (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, one study has recently described a new population of trout IgD+ B cells devoid of surface IgM expression (IgD+IgM B cells), which was shown to represent a major B-cell subset in gill16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the same antibodies used in the aforementioned study had failed to detect these IgD+IgM B cells in a previous study12, it was suggested that this B-cell subset might only be present in an European trout line16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Gills are considered a mucosal surface, and through convergent evolution they have evolved structures and components similar to those of the mammalian respiratory mucosa1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, the epithelia of gill primary and secondary lamella is covered by one to four layers of cuboidal or squamous cell epithelia17, similar to what it is found in the upper respiratory tract of mammals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another similarity between these surfaces is the existence of local mucus-secreting cells (that is, goblet cells), which are characteristic of type I mucosal epithelia18, and represent the first line of defense and cell protection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the lungs, which represent a type I mammalian mucosal surface, secretory IgA (sIgA) is produced locally and is a key immunoglobulin involved in mucosal respiratory immunological responses19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of reports have described the induction of gill pathogen-specific IgM titres on pathogenic challenge or vaccination22,23,24,25, while antigen-specific responses mediated by other teleost immunoglobulins are thus far unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since IgT in fish plays a key role in mucosal immunity in the gut and skin, it is conceivable that IgT plays a pivotal role in gill immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it has recently been suggested that trout IgD may play an important function in gill immune responses12,16,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the role of the different teleost immunoglobulins in the gill remains to be clearly delineated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Thus far, local mucosal immunoglobulin responses in specialized respiratory surfaces have only been described in tetrapods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study was therefore undertaken to examine whether a primordial association between gas-exchange structures and specialized mucosal immunoglobulin responses exists in species preceding the tetrapods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, here we examined whether dedicated mucosal B-cell and immunoglobulin responses were present in the gills of the rainbow trout, a model species in the field of evolutionary and comparative immunology26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The findings here support our hypothesis that IgT is the main gill immunoglobulin involved in pathogen-specific immune responses while we found no evidence of a gill IgD+IgM B-cell subset or pathogen-specific IgD responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the first time in a vertebrate species we show that the microbiota associated with a respiratory organ is recognized by a mucosal immunoglobulin, as evidenced here by the prevalent coating of gill microbiota with IgT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we demonstrate the local generation of IgT and proliferation of IgT+ B cells on pathogenic challenge, thus providing the first demonstration that dedicated mucosal immunoglobulins are locally induced at the mucosal surface of a non-mammalian species.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Immunoglobulins and B cells in the gill of trout', 'Using an anti-IgT antibody, we detected by western blotting a protein in gill mucus consistent with the reported molecular mass of IgT8,9,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify this immunoreactive band, the protein was purified using an anti-IgT affinity column and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MSMS) confirmed that the purified protein corresponded to IgT (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gel-filtration analysis showed that a majority of gill mucus IgT are present in polymeric form, as it eluted at a fraction similar to that of trout mucosal IgM, a tetrameric immunoglobulin (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, a portion of gill mucus IgT consistently eluted in monomeric form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As opposed to polymeric IgT, IgD eluted as a monomer at the molecular weight range previously reported for serum IgD12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gill mucus polymeric IgT migrated as a monomer by SDSPAGE under non-reducing conditions, indicating that polymeric IgT is associated by non-covalent interactions (Fig 1b, right panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, mucosal IgD and IgM migrated as a monomer and a polymer, respectively, under the same SDSPAGE conditions (Fig 1b, left and middle panels).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we found that although the protein concentration of IgT was 13- and 581-fold lower than that of IgM in gill mucus and serum, respectively, (Fig 1c,d), the ratio IgT/IgM was 124-fold higher in the gill mucus when compared with that of serum (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar situation occurs with IgD, which displayed the same concentration as IgT in mucus, while its serum concentration was 4 times more than that of IgT and 155 times less than that of IgM (Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio IgD/IgM was 10-fold greater in gill mucus than in serum (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The abundance of B cells in the gills was analysed by flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two main B-cell subsets were detected in the gills (Fig 1g), one expressing only surface IgT (IgT+ B cells), and the second one expressing both surface IgD and IgM (IgD+IgM+ B cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these two populations, IgT+ B cells were more abundant in gills (52.5% of all B cells) (Fig 1h), suggesting a role of this subset in gill immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, the same B-cell subsets were found in the trout NALT and spleen (Supplementary Fig 2), where IgT+ and IgM+ B cells are the predominant NALT and spleen B-cell subset, respectively, as previously reported10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Protein characterization of gill mucus immunoglobulins and identification of B cells in the gill of trout.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Fractionation of gill mucus (0.5 ml) by gel filtration (upper) followed by immunoblot analysis of the fractions with anti-trout IgM, anti-trout IgD and anti-trout IgT-specific mAbs (lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A280, absorbance at 280 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) SDSPAGE of gel-filtration fractions (415%) corresponding to elution volumes of 8.5 and 11.5 ml under non-reducing conditions followed by immunoblot analysis with mAbs to trout IgM, IgD or IgT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c,d) Immunoblot and densitometric analysis of the concentration of IgT, IgM and IgD in gill mucus (c) and serum (d) (n=15 fish).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e,f) Ratio of IgT to IgM concentration (e) and IgD to IgM concentration (f) in gill mucus and serum, calculated from the values shown in c,d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (g) Dot plots of leucocytes from gills.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numbers adjacent to outlined areas indicate percentage IgT+ B cells, IgM+ B cells or IgD+ B cells in the lymphocyte gate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (h) Frequency of IgT+ and IgM+IgD+ B cells among total B cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results in ce and h are expressed as mean and s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  obtained from 15 individual fishes.Full size image', 'IgT constitutes the main Ig isotype coating the gill microbiota', 'Similar to the situation in mammals for sIgA28,29, we have previously reported that a large fraction of the gut and skin bacterial microbiota are coated with IgT, and to a lesser extent with IgM8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we adapted the methodology, which we had used to assess immunoglobulin coating of trout gut and skin bacteria8,9, to the gill mucosa, and we extended it to the analysis of IgD coating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By flow cytometry, we detected that a large fraction of gill microbiota were coated with IgT (51%), whereas a smaller proportion stained for IgM (31%) or IgD (10%) (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we found that 4.23% of gill microbiota were double-coated with IgT and IgM and to a much lesser extent were double-coated with IgT and IgD (1.09%), IgM and IgD (0.91%) or triple-coated with the three immunoglobulins (0.19%) (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig 2d;

isotype-matched control antibodies, Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we could never detect parasites coated by IgD (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunofluorescent micrographs of gill samples showed very few IgT+ and IgM+ B cells in the gill filaments of control fish (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, 25 days post infection, a moderate (3.1-fold) but significant increase of IgT+ B cells was observed in the gills of infected fish (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, survivor fish (3 months post infection) contained large accumulations of IgT+ B cells in the gill filaments when compared with those of control fish (Fig 4c; isotype-matched control antibodies, Supplementary Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth mentioning that IgT+ B cells were noticeably accumulated in the primary lamella, while a few were present in the secondary lamella of survivor fish (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the number of IgM+ B cells did not change in the infected and survivor fish when compared with the controls (Fig 4ac; isotype-matched control antibodies, Supplementary Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we observed that some IgT+ B cells appeared to be secreting IgT (Fig 4c, white arrows) and we noted an increase in cell size within the IgT+ population (Supplementary Fig 6), which suggested the presence of IgT-producing plasmablasts- or plasma-like cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results from flow cytometry of B-cell populations in gills from control, infected and survivor fish mirrored those obtained by immunofluorescence microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it was observed that 6.9±2.4% of cells from the lymphocyte gate were IgT+ B cells in the gills of control fish whereas a significant increase of IgT+ B cells was found in infected (10.5±2.5%) and survivor fish (15.2±3.7%) (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the percentage of IgM+ B cells did not change in any fish group (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along with this increment of IgT+ B cells observed in gills of infected and survivor fish, the IgT protein concentration in the gill mucus of these fish groups increased by 7- and 10-fold, respectively, when compared with control fish, while the levels of IgM and IgD remained unchanged (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In serum, only approximately two and threefold increase of IgT concentration was detected in infected and survivor fish, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentration of serum IgM increased approximately three and twofold in infected and survivor fish, respectively, when compared with control fish (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the concentration of IgD did not change significantly either in the gill mucus or serum of the same fish groups (Fig 4e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Parasites are mainly coated by IgT in the gill of infected trout.Four different microscope images (ad) of slides showing immunofluorescence staining of Ich parasites in gill cryosections from trout infected with Ich after 25 days (n=6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From left to right: Ich (magenta), IgM (red) and IgT (green) with nuclei stained with DAPI (blue);

#@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Local proliferative and immunoglobulin responses', 'The substantial increase of IgT+ B cells observed in the gill of survivor fish could be due to an infiltration of these cells from systemic lymphoid organs or to a process of local IgT+ B proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To clarify this point, we assessed the in vivo proliferative responses of B cells on treatment of control and survivor fish with fluorescent EdU (5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine, Alexa Fluor 488), a thymidine analogue that incorporates into DNA during cell division31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By flow cytometry, we detected an overall increase in proliferation (2.6-fold) within the whole gill leucocyte population of survivor fish when compared with that of control animals (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly the largest increase in proliferation occurred within the B-cell population (8.8-fold), followed by the large cells (2.6-fold) and the non-B-lymphocyte (2.4-fold) subsets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the B-lymphocyte population, we detected a significant increase in the percentage of proliferating IgT+ B cells (EdU+IgT+ B cells) in the gills of survivor fish (8.1±1.8% of all IgT+ B cells) when compared with that of control animals (2.5±0.77% of all IgT+ B cells) (Fig 6a,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no differences were detected in the percentage of EdU+IgM+ B cells between control and survivor fish (Fig 6b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunofluorescent microscopic analysis of gills from EdU-injected fish yielded results very similar to those obtained by flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we found an approximately fourfold increase in the number of EdU+IgT+ B cells in survivor fish when compared with that of control fish, while no differences in proliferating IgM+ B cells were detected between these two groups (Fig 6df).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Systemic lymphoid tissues of survivor fish, however, did not show increased IgT+ B-cell proliferative responses when compared with control animals, while a rise of EdU+IgM+ B cells was detected in head kidney of survivors (Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggested that the parasite-specific IgT responses shown in Fig 5 were locally generated in the gills rather than being produced and transported from systemic lymphoid organs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we analysed parasite-specific immunoglobulin titres from medium derived of cultured gill, head kidney and spleen explants obtained from control and survivor fish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supporting our prediction, we found that the highest parasite-specific

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Specialized gas-exchange structures are constantly exposed to the environment and the pathogens therein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both invaginated (that is, lungs) and exvaginated (that is, gills) respiratory organs are separated from their environment by a mucosal epithelium, which is likely to have been subjected to comparable selective forces throughout evolutionary time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we hypothesized that respiratory mucosal tissues in both primeval and modern bony vertebrates evolved similar molecular mechanisms for mucosal adaptive immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study was therefore undertaken to examine which B-cell and immunoglobulin responses play a key role in controlling pathogens and the microbiota in the gill of rainbow trout, a teleost fish model representing one of the oldest living bony vertebrate species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we provide the first structural and functional characterization of all teleost immunoglobulins, including secreted IgD (sIgD), IgM (sIgM) and IgT (sIgT) at a mucosal surface of a teleost fish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that sIgT is mainly polymeric in the gill mucus, as previously shown for gut and skin sIgT8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, sIgD was in monomeric form as previously reported for serum IgD12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the amount of sIgT in gill mucus was found to be approximately fivefold higher and approximately fourfold lower than that reported in the skin and gut mucus, respectively8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, as in mammals33,34,35, mucosal immunoglobulin concentrations vary at individual mucosal surfaces in fish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we found that the ratios of IgD/IgM and IgT/IgM in gill mucus were 10-fold and 100-fold higher, respectively, than those found in trout serum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significantly higher IgT/IgM ratio in the gill mucus suggested a potential role for IgT in gill immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The presence of all three trout immunoglobulins in the gill mucus implied a transport mechanism from the epithelium into the gill luminal area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to sIgA and sIgM in the mammalian respiratory tract36, we observed that the putative tSC was associated with sIgT, sIgM and sIgD in gill mucus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we found that tpIgR was mainly expressed in the epithelial cells at the wall of the gill primary lamella, thus implying a role for gill tpIgR in the transport of all three immunoglobulins into the gill mucus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, this is the first description of a pIgR implicated in IgD secretion in a vertebrate respiratory tract, since in mammals the receptor responsible for IgD secretion in the lung lumen is still unknown37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the lack of a J chain in mammalian IgD suggested that it would not be transported by the pIgR, all trout immunoglobulin classes as well as amphibian IgX (a dedicated mucosal immunoglobulin that is secreted into the gut lumen) also do not associate with J chain38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In light of this data, it is tempting to hypothesize that mammalian IgD may use pIgR for its transport into the lung lumen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the mechanisms of interaction of trout mucosal IgM, IgD or IgT with tpIgR in the absence of J chain are currently unclear, a recent theoretical model predicts that interaction of IgT to tpIgR can occur in the absence of a J chain and would be mediated by the binding of domains 1 and 5 of tpIgR with the constant domain 3 of the IgT heavy chain39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to being required for the transport of sIgA and sIgM into the lung lumen, the SC is also implicated in anchoring mucosal antibodies in mucus, ensuring immune exclusion at mucosal surfaces40,41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, sIgA plays a key role in immune exclusion, as sIgA-coated bacteria are prevented from translocating from the luminal mucus into the epithelium, thereby avoiding potential systemic infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if mucosal immunoglobulins mediated immune exclusion in the teleost gills, we analysed the capacity of each gill immunoglobulin to associate with microbiota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, a large population of bacteria in the gill mucus was predominantly coated by sIgT and, to a much lesser degree also by sIgM and sIgD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data parallel that reported for trout gut, skin and nose microbiota8,9,10, thus further highlighting that sIgT is the main immunoglobulin interacting with microbiota at all teleost mucosal surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While at a significantly lower level than that of sIgT, we also demonstrate that teleost sIgD can coat microbiota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether this capacity is conserved in sIgD from mammals or other vertebrates, remains to be investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our findings represent the first identification of microbiota recognition by a specialized mucosal immunoglobulin in the gas-exchange surface of a vertebrate species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the lungs of mammals were thought to be sterile and devoid of microbiota43, the presence of a diverse microbiota has recently been confirmed in the lungs of human44 and mice45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our findings suggesting a key role for sIgT in microbiota homeostasis in the gills of teleosts, it seems reasonable to predict that sIgA may also play a key role in the homeostasis of the lung microbiota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, we propose that since the gill is an evaginated respiratory surface, it offers an excellent model to study the role of mucosal immunoglobulins with regard to respiratory microbiota homeostasis, since it allows for easy and clean evaluations of both the microbiota and IgT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in mammals, studies of the lung microbiome are often confounded by potential contamination/carry-over of the upper airway microbiome into the lower airways44,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To date, gill immunoglobulin and B-cell responses have been poorly studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus far, the only reported pathogen- or antigen-specific antibody responses in the gill pertain to the IgM class.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the catfish, Ich-specific IgM responses have clearly been shown30,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly catfish is a teleost species that appears to lack IgT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In rainbow trout, IgT- and IgM-coated Ich trophonts have been observed in the gills of immune fish, and IgT and IgM transcript levels were moderately increased in the gills of immune fish after challenge with Ich48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggested that IgT and IgM responses against the parasite may occur in the gills.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these data, we chose this parasite to evaluate the specific contribution of fish immunoglobulin isotypes in mediating mucosal responses against the parasite in the gills.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, our study has addressed for the first time the detection of pathogen-specific titres of all three existing teleost immunoglobulins in a mucosal tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, we found that strong specific IgT immune responses against the parasite were specifically detected in the gill mucus, while parasite-specific IgM responses were almost exclusively detected in the serum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, studies performed with a bacterial pathogen (F. colmunare) supported the results obtained with the parasite, thus establishing further the prevalent induction of pathogen-specific IgT and IgM responses in the gill mucus and serum, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, similar to what we have previously reported for the skin and gut mucosa8,9, these findings demonstrate that IgT responses are confined to mucosal surfaces while IgM responses are systemic (that is, serum responses).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, it is worth noting that this represents the first study in which a bacterial pathogen is shown to induce dominant IgT responses in a fish mucosal site, thus suggesting that IgT is probably induced by a variety of pathogens in addition to parasites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to recent reports hypothesizing a role for IgD in the gills12,16,24, our findings suggest that this antibody is not involved in pathogen-specific immunity in the gill mucosa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we were unable to detect a recently reported B-cell subset expressing surface IgD, but devoid of surface IgM16 in either naive, infected or survivor fish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it would appear that the only role of IgD in the gill mucosa is the recognition and coating of a small percentage of the microbiota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at this point we cannot exclude the possibility that different pathogens or stimulation routes from the ones used here may induce relevant IgD responses in the gill or other mucosal or systemic compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the gill IgT responses to pathogens and microbiota described here recapitulate those found in the skin and gut mucosa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we detect both the highest pathogen-specific IgT titres and the greatest percentages of microbiota coated by IgT in the gut8 and gills.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the skin, the lower mucosal IgT titres and lower percentage of coated microbiota correlate with the lower percentages of IgT+ B cells and lower concentrations of skin IgT in naive fish when compared with what was found in gill and gut8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may indicate that potency of the IgT responses in fish mucosal areas is related to the relative abundance of IgT+ B cells in those sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the steady-state levels of IgT+ B cells in these mucosal tissues may depend on the composition and/or abundance of their microbiota since in mammals it is well-known that the production of IgA and number of IgA+ B cells in the gut is dependent on the abundance of microbiota50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, important differences exist in the diversity and composition of the microbiota of trout mucosal surfaces, including the gut, gills, nose and skin51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, it is conceivable that differences in the microbiota in the different mucosal surfaces may drive the steady-state abundance of IgT+ B cells, which in turn may modulate the potency and repertoire of IgT responses in that mucosal area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further work is clearly warranted to confirm this hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The overwhelming prevalence of IgT versus IgM titres detected in the gill mucus was reflected in the degree of IgT coating on the gill parasites, which was much higher than that seen for IgM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, previous studies in the skin and gut mucosa showed that pathogens were selectively coated by IgT with negligible IgM8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The minor but consistent staining of many parasites by IgM is probably due to the low but detectable local production of parasite-specific IgM in the gill of survivor fish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, it is possible that microlesions produced by the parasite may result in leakage of plasma from damaged microvessels, thus enabling specific IgM from plasma to bind the parasite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly in mammals, both IgA and IgG play an important role in the lung mucosal immune responses, whereas in the upper respiratory tract and all other inductive sites, IgA is the main player52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The high titres of pathogen-specific IgT detected in gill correlated with large accumulations of IgT+ B cells in the same animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously shown similar increases in IgT+ B cells in the skin and gut of fish that have survived Ich and Ceratonova Shasta infections, respectively8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether such IgT+ B-cell accumulations are the result of local B-cell proliferation or migration from other lymphoid organs remains a critical question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if the Ich-specific IgT+ B-cell response occurred locally, we developed innovative in vivo proliferation assays and gill explant cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show for the first time potent local proliferative IgT+ B-cell responses and pathogen-specific IgT production in the mucosal-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT) of a fish species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such responses strongly suggest that accumulation of IgT+ B cells in the gills is due to their local proliferation, rather than migration from other organs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In further support of localized proliferation, IgT+ B-cell proliferative responses were not detected in the head kidney or the spleen of the same fish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since mucosal B cells proliferate at the inductive sites in mammals, our results imply that the gills are inductive sites for the generation of IgT mucosal immune responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the production of high titres of Ich-specific IgT in gill explant cultures, confirmed the local production of Ich-specific IgT in gill tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In which specific area of the gill the immune response develops, remains to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In recent years a novel gill tissue, the interbranchial lymphoid tissue (ILT) has been described and shown to be a rich T-cell area, although low transcripts levels of IgM and IgT have also been detected within this tissue53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the high likelihood that the pathogen-specific gill IgT responses observed in this study are T-cell dependent, it is conceivable that at least a portion of local BT-cell interactions involved in this response may have occurred within or nearby the ILT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these BT-cell interactions may also occur in other areas where IgT+ B cells proliferate, as shown in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies are warranted to determine the importance of the ILT in pathogen-specific IgT responses in the gill.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Together, our data support a model in which on parasite infection, antigen-presentation, as well as B-cell activation and proliferation occurs within the gills, leading to the production of parasite-specific IgT (Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this point, we cannot exclude the possibility that on gill infection, parasite antigens are taken up by gill antigen-presenting cells (APCs) which then migrate into systemic lymphoid tissues (that is, head kidney and/or spleen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At that point, activated IgT+ B cells generated systemically would be imprinted to migrate into the gill where they would proliferate and turn into plasmablast or plasma cells to produce parasite-specific IgT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, since gills are highly vascularized, antigens from parasite debris could travel from the gills into the lymphoid tissues through the vascular system, where they could be taken up by systemic APCs to initiate an immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work is warranted to address further the detailed mechanisms underlying the local production of IgT-specific responses in the gill.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, it is worth noting that proliferating IgT+ B cells in the gills appear to be randomly distributed either alone or in small groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would suggest the absence of organized lymphoid structures in this tissue (that is, lymph nodes), which is in agreement with the already well-known lack of organized lymphoid structures in teleost fish7,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 9: Proposed model of local IgT and IgT+ B-cell induction in the gills.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Scheme of a typical teleost gill filament displaying the primary (PL) and secondary (SL) lamellae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Induction of local IgT responses in the gill based on our findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On Ich infection, Ich antigen (Ag) are taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APC) and presented to naive CD4-T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  B cells are then activated by Ag-specific CD4-T cells and start proliferating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activated B cells may differentiate further into plasmablasts or plasma cells to produce large amounts of parasite-specific IgT that recognize Ich within the gill PLs or the Ich present in the mucus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We cannot rule out the possibility that on antigen uptake, loaded gill APCs may migrate into central secondary lymphoid organs (that is, spleen or head kidney) where the resulting activated IgT+ B cells may then home into the gill.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, since gills are highly vascularized, antigens from parasite debris may travel from the gills into the lymphoid tissues through the vascular system, where they could be taken up by systemic APCs to initiate an immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the potential scenarios (as indicated by a ?)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  where immune responses develop in the spleen or head kidney, we propose that IgT+ B-cell proliferation does not occur in the spleen or head kidney because in Supplementary Fig 9 we do not detect differences in IgT+ B-cell proliferative responses between control and survivor fish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would suggest that if activated IgT+ B cells are generated in the spleen or head kidney, then they are probably imprinted to home into the gills

to pathogens and microbiota in the gill of a teleost fish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More critically, we show the generation of local IgT+ B-cell proliferative and pathogen-specific IgT responses in the gills, thus providing the first demonstration of locally induced B-cell and secretory immunoglobulin responses in the mucosa of a non-tetrapod species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we show for the first time that the microbiota present within the main respiratory organ of a vertebrate is recognized by a dedicated mucosal antibody class.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our findings indicate that the recognition of pathogens and microbiota by specific mucosal immunoglobulins in specialized respiratory surfaces forms part of a conserved immune strategy that predates the emergence of tetrapod species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, our results reinforce the formerly stated view26 that specialized mucosal immunoglobulins (that is, IgA, IgT) of all vertebrate MALTs function under the guidance of primordially conserved principles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since many fish pathogens enter the host through the gill mucosa, our findings also have special relevance from an applied perspective as they may lead to the development of fish vaccines that have the capacity to induce gill IgT mucosal immune responses.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
