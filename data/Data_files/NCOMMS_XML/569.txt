Coordinated integrin activation by actin-dependent force during T-cell migration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'For a cell to move forward it must convert chemical energy into mechanical propulsion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Force produced by actin polymerization can generate traction across the plasma membrane by transmission through integrins to their ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the role this force plays in integrin activation is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that integrin activity and cytoskeletal dynamics are reciprocally linked, where actin-dependent force itself appears to regulate integrin activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We generated fluorescent tension-sensing constructs of integrin L2 (LFA-1) to visualize intramolecular tension during cell migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using quantitative imaging of migrating T cells, we correlate tension in the L or 2 subunit with cell and actin dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that actin engagement produces tension within the 2 subunit to induce and stabilize an active integrin conformational state and that this requires intact talin and kindlin motifs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This supports a general mechanism where localized actin polymerization can coordinate activation of the complex machinery required for cell migration.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Integrins function by integrating the extracellular and intracellular environments in a bidirectional manner, with their extracellular domains binding to ligands while their cytoplasmic domains engage the cytoskeleton1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) is composed of the L and 2 subunits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LFA-1 is expressed on all leukocyte subsets and binds specifically to the intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their interactions mediate antigen-specific and innate immune cell interactions, firm adhesion, transendothelial migration of leukocytes in diapedesis and migration in tissues2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Integrins have three distinct overall conformations: bent with a closed headpiece, extended with a closed headpiece, and extended with an open headpiece (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Headpiece opening is intimately associated with rearrangements at the ligand binding site and converts integrins to their high affinity, extended-open active conformation4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Integrins have long been known to mediate transmembrane force transmission6,7, and must be connected to the actin cytoskeleton to achieve this.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In focal adhesions, which are widely studied because of their highly organized structures, talin and vinculin make up the force transduction layer by linking actin filaments to integrins8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, whether force itself could directly regulate integrin activity is still an open question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Tensile force is transmitted through the integrin -subunit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Integrin structure and conformational states60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Current model of actin-dependent integrin activation and illustration of the tension sensor module.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same conformations are shown as in a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tension sensor (TS) consists of two FRET-compatible fluorescent proteins, monomeric teal (mTFP) and venus (mVenus), linked together with a repeating sequence that can be elongated by tensile force (GPGGA)8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Black arrows represent force applied by the actin cytoskeleton and resisted by bound ligand15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c,d) Tension sensor insertion positions where the preceding 4-residue sequences (XXXX) are being repeated except for the C-terminal constructs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Important interaction sites are highlighted in magenta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Linker details are in d.

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Tensile force is transmitted through the integrin -subunit', 'To test the cytoskeletal force model for integrin activation, we created tension-sensing integrins by inserting a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based tension sensor module at different positions along the cytoplasmic tails of the integrin L and 2 subunits (Fig 1bd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The insert points were chosen by analysis of conserved regions across integrin  cytoplasmic tails (CT; Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The module, developed by Schwartz and colleagues to measure intramolecular forces in vinculin, consists of monomeric teal fluorescent protein (mTFP1) and monomeric Venus (mVenus) joined by a 40 amino-acid elastic linker16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calibration with single molecule measurements demonstrated elastic linker elongation upon tensile force application, providing sensitivity in the range from 01 pN (high FRET) to 6 pN (low FRET) (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such forces are in the ideal range of the 2 pN talin-dependent rupture force exerted by the cytoskeleton on integrin molecules17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We validated the principle of measuring tensile force in the integrin -subunit cytoplasmic domain and tested whether the tension-sensor constructs remained functional using 2-TS3 and 2-cTerm tension sensors stably expressed in Jurkat T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2-TS3 sensor is N-terminal to most of the 2 CT, including talin and kindlin motifs, and should be able to respond to force if functional; 2-cTerm, being at the C-terminus, should not be force responsive (Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2-cTerm also serves as an ideal internal control as it will most likely experience similar local environment as the other sensors, including potential forces and conformational changes unrelated to tension but which could affect the FRET pair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2-TS3 cells imaged live with total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF)-FRET migrated well and exhibited a wide range of highly dynamic FRET efficiency clustersor patchesacross the whole cell surface (Supplementary Movie 1); the range of corresponding intramolecular forces spanned from 0 to 6+ pN (Fig 1e,f; Supplementary Fig 2ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, cells with the 2 control sensor (2-cTerm), show high FRET (low force) across the whole-cell while still migrating normally (Supplementary Movie 1; Fig 1e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acceptor photobleaching experiments validated that our constructs exhibit true FRET, as can be seen by the increase in donor intensity after bleaching (Fig 1g; Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these results show that several integrins with inserted tension sensors still allow normal cell migration, and that we can measure intramolecular forces on integrins in migrating cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The cytoskeletal force model predicts that mechanochemical force should be selectively transduced through the  subunit rather than the  subunit (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this, we employed the same design principle for L as for 2, inserting the tension-sensor in three distinct positions (Fig 1c), and expressed them in Jurkat T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Live FRET images of migrating cells show that none of the L tension sensor constructs exhibit tension, or any other significant FRET changes; the signal appears to be very similar to the negative control, 2-cTerm (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the highly dynamic nature of the FRET signal and the rapidly changing morphodynamics of the migrating cells, we quantitatively compared the L and 2 sensor data by averaging whole cell FRET levels in multiple migrating cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both of the L-TS constructs and the control L-cTerm and 2-cTerm constructs exhibited FRET efficiencies in a range corresponding to zero force, whereas the 2-TS3 sensor showed whole-cell FRET levels corresponding to an average force per integrin of 1.4±0.8 pN (mean±s.d, N=28) (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results clearly show that in migrating cells, force acts on integrins through the -subunit and not the -subunit, in accordance with the cytoskeletal force model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', '2 sensors placed N-terminal to NPxF motifs respond to force', 'We investigated the impact on expression and migration of sensors placed in different positions in the CT.

the majority of the surface 2 still being wild-type allowed our probes to serve as passive observers of force, while minimally altering migratory function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed in a separate experiment that our sensor-bearing integrins were indeed functional by rescuing cell adhesion and cell migration in leukocyte adhesion deficiency patient cells deficient in 2 expression, although the rescue was less complete than with the wild-type 2 subunit (Supplementary Fig 5d-e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Migratory ability was measured through live differential interference contrast (DIC) imaging and automatic tracking of cells18 migrating on ICAM-1±SDF-1; as seen in studies with primary T cells19, the addition of this chemokine20 improved the overall migratory phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells bearing the 2 sensor TS6 were the most affected, with elongated uropods suggesting inhibition of uropod detachment, while the 2-TS3, -TS5 and -cTerm were overall minimally affected as compared with regular Jurkat E6 controls (Fig 2bd; Supplementary Fig 5ac; Supplementary Movie 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These sensors were therefore used in the majority of experiments in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The cytoskeletal force model predicts that a fully active integrin couples to the underlying actin cytoskeleton via integrin -subunit-associated adaptor molecules21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are several potential molecules that could act as a molecular bridge from 2 CT to actin, including filamin22,23, talin24 and kindlin25, all of which have binding sites in the 2 CT (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By looking at force in the integrin at each 2 sensor position, it should be possible to pinpoint the general location of the force-generating adaptor sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To more easily screen the different sensors, we measured intramolecular force on the integrin TS over whole cells, which were fixed during migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Jurkat T cells express enough integrin 41 and 51 to support migration on fibronectin26, and fibronectin was used as control when comparing FRET levels for different sensor positions (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sensors TS6, TS7 and cTerm showed comparable FRET intensity, which corresponds to zero force, on both ICAM-1 and fibronectin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TS6 and TS7 are inserted just N-terminal to the talin and kindlin binding sites, respectively, and might have disrupted binding to these sites, consistent with their effects on migration shown in Fig 2b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, all 2 tension sensors placed N-terminal of TS6 showed higher force levels on ICAM-1 as compared with the cTerm control (Fig 2e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This points to LFA-1 specific FRET activity for both of the sensors (TS3 and TS5) that were chosen for more detailed analysis, and demonstrates that these constructs in most cases both express and function well in a migrating cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Integrin tension depends on interaction with specific ligand', 'To investigate the dependence of integrin tension on the specific bound ligand, 2-TS5 and 2-cTerm Jurkat T cells were imaged during migration on ICAM-1, fibronectin, and anti-CD43 (for non-integrin based adhesion) substrates, and overall force was measured (Fig 3a,b; Supplementary Movie 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the results in fixed cells with multiple TS constructs (Fig 2), force was exerted on TS5 on the specific ligand ICAM-1, but not on the control ligand fibronectin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FRET with TS5 on anti-CD43 was low and in the range corresponding to no force, but the FRET efficiency was higher than seen with cTerm on anti-CD43 or with TS5 or cTerm on fibronectin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding might suggest weak coupling between LFA-1 and CD43 during migration on anti-CD43 substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Integrin tension depends on interaction with specific ligand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Representative FRET images over 60 s of migrating Jurkat T cells expressing indicated tension sensor constructs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images are corrected for photobleaching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images are from three independent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Whole-cell FRET levels in migrating Jurkat T cells with 100 ng ml1 SDF-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Circles represent individual cells from three independent experiments with median shown as a line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KruskalWallis with Dunns multiple comparison test of differences between indicated conditions yielded P-values: ****P less_than 0.0001, ***P0.001, **P0.01.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Representative images of focal plane in TIRF z-stacks (50 nm step) of Lifeact-mCherry and TS-mVenus with distribution of fluorescence variance and Gaussian fits with indicated relative difference of the whole-cell distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dotted lines across the submicron bead (100 nm) images are shown as side views at the top.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 5 m.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The mechanism of integrin activation has been investigated for many years and by many labs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While force from actin has been previously assumed to be responsible for activation, direct evidence was lacking, and the effect of force on integrins could easily have been mediated by intermediate biochemical or biophysical cues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we provide evidence that for migrating T cells, actin-derived tension is required for LFA-1 activation, and that furthermore this activation requires the correct ligand and intact talin- and kindlin-associated binding motifs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only when all these requirements were satisfied was LFA-1 able to bind to the ICAM-1 substrate, demonstrating that integrin activation is stabilized by cytoskeletal force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of these findings, we propose an updated model for actin-dependent integrin activation during cell migration (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 8: Model for actin-dependent integrin activation in cell migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (1) Inactive LFA-1 is neither bound to ICAM-1 on the extracellular side nor linked to actin on the cytoplasmic side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2) Talin and kindlin link actin to the cytoplasmic tail of the 2 subunit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (3) When LFA-1 binds ICAM-1 and the actin cytoskeleton simultaneously, tensile force exerted across LFA-1 stabilizes the high-affinity conformation of the I domain bound through its internal ligand to the I domain with the open headpiece conformation and the hybrid domain swung out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (45) When the intracellular link to actin is lost, the open headpiece conformation is no longer stabilized, and the integrin returns to its lower energy, bent-closed conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stability of the states is likely more relevant than the order of binding and conformational change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work has shown that LFA-1 has 1,000-fold lower affinity for ICAM-1 in the bent-closed and extended-closed conformations than in the extended-open conformation4,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bent-closed conformation is more populated on the cell surface than the other states under resting conditions4,39, but rapid kinetic exchange between the three conformational states at thermal equilibrium likely results in significant population of extended-closed and extended-open states in basal conditions41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under basal conditions, individual integrin molecules may exchange thousands of times per second between conformational states, enabling them to sample CT binding to adapters and ectodomain binding to ICAM-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These processes would enable a pre-existing extended integrin conformation to bind ICAM-1 and actin adaptors at the same time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once pulling on the integrin by the cytoskeleton meets resistance from ICAM-1 anchored on the surface of another cell, tensile force exerted on the integrin between the ligand anchor point and polymerized actin stabilizes the open, high-affinity integrin conformation41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecules in the model are not drawn to scale.Full size image', 'Critical to the results presented in this study is the functionality of the integrin tension sensor constructs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A range of different controls or experimental results support their functionality: acceptor photobleaching FRET validation experiments; surface expression in L2-lacking cells and co-expression in L2-containing cells; dominant negative effects on integrin function by some sensor constructs but not those used in this study; rescue of adhesion and migration in 2-deficient leukocytes; three-dimensional localization of integrin sensors reflecting that of regular 2-integrins; changing substrate yields consistent changes in both FRET, actin flow and ligand proximity; introducing point mutations in the NPxF motifs yields consistent changes in both FRET, actin flow and ligand proximity; confirmation of many results by two independent 2 integrin sensor constructs; 2-cTerm, an ideal control for any cell-specific or assay-dependent effects on both FRET and integrin behaviour, is present across the experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These integrin tension sensors will likely serve as valuable tools for studies of other aspects of integrin activation and force transduction, and given that multiple constructs appear to work well, indicates that the design principles could be applied to create other -integrin biosensors as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'From studies on X2 and L2, we know that headpiece opening with hybrid domain swing-out is required for cell adhesion and high affinity for ligand4,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This swing-out step was suggested by molecular dynamics simulations to be mediated by a lateral pulling force on the -subunit cytoplasmic tail15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Necessary counter force comes from an immobilized ligand, which is a requirement for LFA-1 headpiece opening and adhesiveness4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far, to our knowledge, there has been no successful reconstitution of inside-out signalling-induced integrin headpiece opening in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extension of integrins in lipid nanodiscs can be induced by talin alone (22% extension38); however, the integrins all had a closed headpiece and thus lacked high affinity for ligand5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus the question of whether force is required for integrin activationin the sense of stabilizing integrin binding to ligandhas heretofore remained unanswered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Crystal and EM structures of the 2 integrins X2 and L2 allow us to describe the pathway through which tensile force flows34,39,40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tensile force is exerted though the L-subunit I domain from its ligand-binding metal ion dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) to its internal ligand, crosses to the 2-subunit where the I MIDAS binds the I internal ligand, is transmitted from the I domain to the hybrid domain, and is then transmitted down the  leg and through the plasma membrane to the cytoplasmic tail, which in turn connects through adaptors to the actin cytoskeleton (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Force passing through the junction between the I and hybrid domains favours the open conformation of the integrin headpiece, with its longer path for force transmission, which stabilizes the high affinity state by F·x (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, force favours integrin extension owing to the much greater distance between the I domain and the -subunit TM domain in the extended than bent conformations (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the findings presented here confirm the predicted force-bearing axis through the integrin -subunit to its cytoplasmic domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the previous structural studies and predictions fit our demonstration here that active integrins bear force, and strongly suggest that the active state interrogated here is the extended, open integrin conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conclusion was further strengthened using conformation-specific mAbs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By showing that kindlin- and talin-binding NPxF motifs are simultaneously required for force transduction, we have not only validated this molecular biophysical model in actively migrating cells, but provided new insight into the force transduction pathway and its key players.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is essential for a cell to be able to control when and where it will move in a certain direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple signalling pathways, especially those that regulate actin polymerization, actin reorganization and integrin activation, must be coordinated for migration to take place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate a need for intracellular actin-generated force to facilitate efficient integrin-ligand engagement on the extracellular side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By connecting extracellular ligand binding to actin engagement in a positive-feedback loop, the cell can control its migration by coordinating actin activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since propulsive force is a prerequisite for migration, this feedback makes that force locally adaptive, allowing the cell to fine-tune where it needs tractionprovided by the integrinswhich then become active as force is applied by the cytoskeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternative mechanisms for a forceactivation relationship that require biochemical intermediates would also imply complex centralized regulatory networks to control integrin activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, direct regulation by tension reinforces the idea that localized actin polymerization can act as a coordinator for activation of the complex machinery required for moving a eukaryotic cell in a certain direction, simplifying the necessary regulation and relaxing the requirement for centralized control of the multiple pathways involved.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

 #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mask is then used to find and subtract the average background intensity on a frame-by-frame basis; for all FRET calculations the data is pre-filtred with a 3 × 3 pixel Gaussian filtre; since the tension sensor module is a single-chain construct, FRET can be calculated by dividing FRET channel (donor excitation with acceptor emission) with mTFP channel (donor excitation with donor emission); to minimize artifacts from division of small integers, only pixels that have a value above three times the background standard deviation of the current frame were used; FRET data was visualized using an inverted heat map.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photobleach correction was performed similarly as described46 by fitting a single or double exponential to the ratio of average FRET/donor signal in each cell over the time-course.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This exponential fit was then used to adjust the FRET signal over the time-course in relation to the initial time point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MATLAB functions for dark current correction, shading correction, background segmentation, background correction, FRET calculations and photobleach correction are available upon request.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The resulting FRET ratio (R) is only comparable for data with the same microscope and settings, whereas FRET efficiency (E) is comparable between systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To estimate force (f) we use FRET efficiency measurements made by the Schwartz group for the tension sensor module (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fitting their data to a fourth-order polynomial, we determined the relationship:', '', 'To calculate the efficiency of our system we collected the data using constructs with known efficiencies for the same fluorescent protein pair, mTFP-5aa-mVenus (E=55%) and mTFP-TRAF-mVenus (E=11% (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  47), Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the Förster distance of our FRET pair, 6.0 nm, the relationship between FRET efficiency and ratio within the range (E=11 to 55%) is approximately linear48, so we used linear regression on the measured ratios in Supplementary Fig 2b to find the equation:', '', 'Force is estimated for FRET ratios measured in our system by numerically solving for f in the equality of equations (1) and (2) at 1,000 points along the curve from equation (1) (Supplementary Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By fitting that data to a fourth-order polynomial, we determined the relationship:', '', 'No simple analytical solution was found for expressing f as the dependent variable in either equations (1) or (3),.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Image analysis', 'All processed images for FRET analysis were segmented using either the actin channel or the combined TFP and FRET channels to identify and track individual cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For quantification, an individual background noise estimation was applied (by fitting the portion of a Gaussian function below its mean to the left shoulder of the image intensity histogram) and only pixels with intensities at least three s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  above that level were included as cellular segments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For FRET efficiency quantification, only the first frame was used unless indicated, to ensure no potential artifacts were introduced by photobleach correction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Morphodynamic and windowing analysis was performed as described previously, with windows of 5 × 5 pixels using the constant number propagation method36,37,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For morphodynamics analysis, automatic cell selection was used; cells had to be segmented for at least 10 consecutive frames, without touching the frame edge or other cells, and had to have a signal-to-noise ratio (calculated as mean intensity above background divided by the background standard deviation) of at least five in their protrusive regions, which were defined as having a positive difference between frames for at least five frames and a total pixel increase over all frames in the protrusion of  greater than 1,000.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For migration analysis, a modified version of CellTracker18 was used, with added visualization and statistics options.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For actin flow measurements, manual line selections in Fiji were used together with the Kymograph plugin50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To measure the velocity of actin flow, the manual line selections were drawn perpendicular to the direction of migration and the quantification was done by taking the slope of linear kymograph features at the outermost section of the cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At least 20 cells were analysed for each condition, and multiple measurements per cell were taken.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify that this estimate could be reproduced by a different method, we also analysed a subset of data with a local gradient-based analysis method51, where the outermost section just behind the cell edge of the kymographs were analysed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This yielded very similar results (data not shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cell segmentation', 'Since multiple cells could be present in the same image and at different intensities, the background masking described above was used to initialize cell segmentation independently for each cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Either active contour segmentation or intensity distribution-based threshold segmentation was used to produce an initial cell mask.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mathematical morphology (a closure operation with a radius of 1 pixel, small object removal, and filling of holes) was applied to further refine these masks, producing accurate cell outlines for morphodynamic analysis and whole-cell FRET calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify leading edges for the quantification in Fig 6, edge masks were first created by taking the difference of our cell masks before and after a 10-pixel erosion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protrusions were identified by finding mask increases between frames, checking for connectivity in the time dimension, a minimum empirically determined size (typically space-time volume of 1,000), and lasting at least 3 (for leading edge analysis) or 5 (for morphodynamics analysis) consecutive frames.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, these protrusion masks were combined with the previously generated edge masks to find leading edge regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Acceptor photobleaching', 'For acceptor photobleaching experiments five images were acquired before a 60 s 515 nm bleaching at 100% laser power, and then all channels were acquired again (Fig 1g; Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As additional control of the system we imaged single-fluorophore-expressing cells as well (Supplementary Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are reports that acceptor fluorescent proteins can photoconvert during acceptor photobleaching experiments52, including mVenus used in this study53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This appears to be a concentration-dependent effect that is only present at high fluorophore concentrations, and is reduced for 1:1 stoichiometry of donor:acceptor and is 10-fold lower with mVenus compared with YFP54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, this will not be a factor at all for our FRET measurements as we only imaged using double donor excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, we did not use acceptor photobleaching to quantify FRET efficiency, instead using the well characterized mTFP-5aa-mVenus and mTFP-TRAF-mVenus constructs47 for that purpose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Antibody staining and analysis', 'Monoclonal antibodies used were TS1/18, KIM127 and m24 and they have been previously characterized55,56,57.

analysis', 'TIRF z-stacks were collected using either a 25 or 50 nm step size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The z-stack range included regions clearly out of focus both above and below the regular focus.
