January 2016 extensive summer melt in West Antarctica favoured by strong El Niño  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Over the past two decades the primary driver of mass loss from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) has been warm ocean water underneath coastal ice shelves, not a warmer atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, surface melt occurs sporadically over low-lying areas of the WAIS and is not fully understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report on an episode of extensive and prolonged surface melting observed in the Ross Sea sector of the WAIS in January 2016.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comprehensive cloud and radiation experiment at the WAIS ice divide, downwind of the melt region, provided detailed insight into the physical processes at play during the event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unusual extent and duration of the melting are linked to strong and sustained advection of warm marine air toward the area, likely favoured by the concurrent strong El Niño event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in the number of extreme El Niño events projected for the twenty-first century could expose the WAIS to more frequent major melt events.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Episodes of widespread summer melt have been sporadic in West Antarctica since the phenomenon started being monitored from space in the late 1970s (refs 1, 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their infrequent occurrence and a lack of robust field measurements to supplement satellite observations leave these melt events insufficiently understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, both the geography and climate of West Antarctica conspire to make such events more likely to occur under relatively modest atmospheric warming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, by virtue of relatively low elevations and frequent intrusions of warm (and moist) marine air3, West Antarctica experiences a milder climate than neighboring East Antarctica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the peak of austral summer (DecemberJanuary), it is relatively common for surface melt to occur over the fringe of ice shelves bordering the Amundsen Sea2,4, and for surface temperatures over low-lying inland areas to approach 0 °C (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the West Antarctic climate is subject to the influence of large-scale modes of climate variability such as the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO)6,7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These modes and their mutual interactions are responsible for important disruptions of the regional atmospheric circulation that can sustain warm air advection towards the continent for extended periods3,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we document a prominent surface melt event that occurred in January 2016 and affected a large portion of the Ross Ice Shelf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This event happened while an important field campaign, the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement West Antarctic Radiation Experiment (AWARE), was ongoing in central West Antarctica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observations collected during this campaign provided unique insight into some of the physical mechanisms governing surface melting in this otherwise data-sparse region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, these observations highlighted the presence of low-level liquid-water clouds, which may have aided the radiative heating of the snow surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we explore the large-scale atmospheric factors behind the melt event, namely the role played by the strong 20152016 El Niño event and the positive SAM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Building on existing literature and new idealized climate model simulations, we show that the El Niño event is likely responsible for setting up the atmospheric circulation pattern that steered warm air towards the Ross Ice Shelf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show that the positive SAM counteracted to some extent the El Niño influence and thus likely mitigated the overall magnitude of the melt event.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Melt event captured by satellite and surface observations', 'Passive microwave satellite observations (Fig 1a) indicate that surface melt occurred during one or more days over a broad sector of West Antarctica (termed Ross sector hereafter) in January 2016, with up to 15 melt days over parts of the eastern Ross Ice Shelf and Siple Coast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assess the significance of this event in the context of the entire satellite record (19782016) using two common melt indicators1: the melt extent (area of all grid cells with at least one day of melting) and the melt index (MI) (melt area weighted by duration of the melting), both calculated for the Ross sector (red outline in Fig 1a inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bearing in mind that the results are sensitive to the choice of indicator and melt algorithm2, we estimate that January 2016 was one of the three largest melt events in the Ross sector since 1978 (second behind 199192 for MI, and a virtual tie for first with January 2005 for melt extent).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: The January 2016 melt event captured by satellite and surface observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Map of West Antarctica showing the number of melt days in January 2016 estimated from passive microwave satellite observations overlaid on a MODIS mosaic image62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The white crosses denote the locations of the automatic weather stations (AWSs) shown in c.

near-surface temperatures near or above 0 °C for several consecutive days during 1021 January (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The onset of the melt event on 10 January was accompanied by an abrupt temperature increase at WAIS Divide and Byrd, in central West Antarctica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temperature time series from these two sites highlight roughly two phases: Phase 1 (1014 January), during which the temperatures were at their warmest; and Phase 2 (1521 January), during which the temperatures gradually decreased towards their pre-event levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2 is characterized by a shift of the melt pattern towards the Transantarctic Mountains apparent in the AWS temperature time series and in the sequence of daily melt maps (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The January 2016 melt event also coincided with the AWARE field campaign11, during which comprehensive upper-air, cloud and surface radiation observations were carried out at the WAIS Divide Field Camp (star symbol in Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This site was just downwind and upslope (1,801 m above sea level) of the main melting region and was thus exposed to some of the same weather conditions, as evidenced by the large-scale atmospheric circulation pattern during the melt event (see Fig 2a and results section Regional atmospheric circulation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AWARE campaign was also notable in and of itself for providing the first routine upper-air observations from West Antarctica since 1967, when the radiosonde program ended at Byrd Station.

the ice sheets surface temperature (Ts) up to the melting point (through exchange of sensible heat), especially at low elevations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Ts is ultimately controlled by the full surface energy budget (SEB), being the net of radiative (short- and longwave) and turbulent (sensible and latent) heat fluxes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clouds exert an important influence on the SEB by modulating the radiative fluxes12,13,14, primarily by enhancing downwelling longwave radiation and attenuating incoming solar radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, low-level liquid-bearing clouds can have a determinant role in either causing or prolonging melting conditions over ice sheets15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Model estimates from the ERA-Interim Reanalysis and satellite-based cloud phase retrievals from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) mission for 12 January 2016 (Fig 2 and Supplementary Fig 2 and Supplementary Fig 3) indicate that liquid-bearing clouds were widespread over West Antarctica during the early stage of the melt event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that part of the differences between ERA-Interim (Fig 2a) and CALIPSO (Fig 2b,c), such as over portions of the Ross Ice Shelf, can be ascribed to complete attenuation of the CALIPSO lidar signal through thick upper-level ice cloud layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of warm (that is, liquid-bearing) low-level clouds over the Ross Ice Shelf is also apparent in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations from 11 January 2016 (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The close match between the pattern of ERA-Interim cloud liquid water path (CLWP) and the contours of the melt area on the Ross Ice Shelf highlights the potentially important role of this type of cloud in maintaining melt-prone conditions (compare Supplementary Fig 1, Supplementary Fig 2, and Supplementary Fig 3 for 1112 January 2016).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the tongue of CLWP stretching from the eastern Ross Ice Shelf to the region of WAIS Divide in Fig 2a further indicates that AWARE observations may provide insight into the cloud microphysical properties at lower elevation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The radiosonde profiles (Fig 3a,b) from AWARE at WAIS Divide captured the large and vertically deep temperature and moisture perturbations associated with the marine air intrusion on 1013 January.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Micropulse lidar measurements (Fig 3d,e) yielded periods of high attenuated backscatter ( greater than 10 dB) and low depolarization ratios ( less_than 10%) below 1 km, indicating high cloud liquid water content and low ice water content17 (mixed-phase clouds).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed CLWP (Fig 3c) was frequently within 1040 g m2, that is, the range where the cloud radiative enhancement effect previously observed over Greenland15 occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this range, the clouds are thick enough to enhance the downwelling longwave radiation (Fig 4a) but thin enough to also allow shortwave radiation to reach the surface (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CLWP was within this range 3040% of the time during 1013 January, suggesting that this enhancement mechanism contributed to the melt event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is further supported by the frequent and widespread occurrence of clouds with CLWP within 1040 g m2 simulated by ERA-Interim during the same period (Supplementary Fig 3 and Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we also notice a significant frequency of CLWP  greater than  40 g m2 (Fig 3c), under which shortwave flux is attenuated and longwave flux is similar to blackbody radiation at the cloud effective temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These optically thicker clouds represent a contrast to the Greenland cloud radiative enhancement effect in that they signify a more prominent role of thermal blanketing as a consequence of the warm air advection (Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total SEB (Fig 4e) shows a marked increase in the net energy input into the snowpack (up to 40 W m2), mainly attributable to enhanced downwelling longwave radiation (Fig 4a,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This additional energy input is also apparent in the satellite brightness temperatures (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Cloud, moisture and temperature observations at WAIS Divide during January 2016.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b)

immediate causes of the melt event to the presence of an amplified high-pressure ridge (blocking high) over the 90120°W sector of the Southern Ocean (Fig 5ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By creating a prominent dent in the circumpolar westerly flow, this ridge generated a strong north-south advection of warm marine air towards West Antarctica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ridge was strongest during 1013 January (Phase 1) but persisted through 20 January (Fig 5c), maintaining warm conditions favourable to surface melt in the Ross sector (Phase 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positive sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies of  greater than 2 °C near 50°S, 120°W (Fig 5b) may have also provided additional heat to the air travelling south (note that the positive geopotential height anomalies near 60°S, 90°W favour anticlockwise motion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data from ERA-Interim suggest that rain fell over parts of the Ross Ice Shelf at the beginning of the event (Supplementary Fig 6), which may have preconditioned the snow surface for prolonged melting18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the reanalysis data should be treated with caution, drizzle was observed at WAIS Divide on 11 January (Supplementary

(anticyclonic) geopotential height anomalies in the South Pacific, such as those observed in January 2016 (Fig 5b), are a typical signature of El Niño teleconnections, as seen both in observations6,19 and climate model simulations20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This type of atmospheric pattern promotes warm air advection to the Ross sector6, which explains why surface melt in this area tends to be associated with El Niño-like conditions22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the prominent melt events of December 1982 and December 1991January 1992 (see Fig 1b) both occurred in conjunction with El Niño conditions, characterized by a negative Equatorial Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) in Fig 6b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conceptually, the fact that a circulation pattern resembling the El Niño teleconnection was present during the melt event and that this pattern is favourable to warm conditions over the Ross Ice Shelf points towards a causal link between the 20152016 El Niño and the January 2016 melt event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in practice (based on observations available since 1979), the relationship between the two phenomena remains complex (see Fig 7 and related discussion below).

#@NEW_LINE#@#  This is reflected in the negative geopotential height anomalies over Antarctica in Fig 5b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conjunction of a strong El Niño and a positive SAM phase was unusual since, in austral summer, the latter is most often associated with La Niña-like conditions8,23 (conversely, a negative SAM phase most often occurs in conjunction with El Niño-like conditions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a positive SAM phase hampers meridional heat exchange between middle and high latitudes7, and is thus generally not conducive to surface melt in West Antarctica22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, if anything, the positive SAM phase that prevailed before and during the melt event should have favoured colder-than-normal, not warmer-than-normal, conditions in West Antarctica.

relationships between West Antarctic summer melt, the SAM, and the ENSO phenomenon (represented by the Equatorial SOI) since 1979.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that, in this figure, the two melt indices are calculated for DecemberJanuary, and the two climate indices are NovemberJanuary averages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 7 shows that, in general, less melt tends to occur during La Niña-like conditions (SOI  greater than  0) and a positive SAM phase, whereas more melt tends to occur during El Niño-like conditions (SOI  less_than  0) and a negative SAM phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This qualitative assessment is confirmed by tallying positive and negative melt anomalies depending on the sign of the two climate indices (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth noting that the directions of the relationships are similar to those previously found between Antarctic-wide melt and the SAM Index and SOI22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These relationships are by no means simple.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, not all major El Niño events are accompanied by widespread surface melt in West Antarctica (for example, 199798); not all prominent West Antarctic melt events coincide with strong El Niño events (for example, 2005); and the magnitude of West Antarctic melt does not scale with the intensity of El Niño events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, it is not possible to establish with certainty whether the 20152016 El Niño caused (in a deterministic sense) the January 2016 melt event, a problem inherent to weather and climate phenomena24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not uncommon for the polar jet around Antarctica to exhibit large meanders, giving rise to warm marine air intrusions3, even in the absence of an El Niño event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following a probabilistic approach, we seek rather to assess the likelihood of the January 2016 melt event occurring given the concurrent strong El Niño and positive SAM conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The statistically small number of El Niño events (especially of strong events such as 198283, 199798 and 201516) observed since 1979 does not permit robust statistical analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, climate model simulations can alleviate this

events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fourth simulation was forced with annually repeating climatological SSTs to serve as control run.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A model SAM index was calculated for each simulation based

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Further research is needed to better understand the various mechanisms behind major West Antarctic melt events and to accurately predict their future occurrence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accurate prediction is contingent on the ability of climate models to resolve the broad range of factors responsible for these events, from the large-scale climate drivers to the regional atmospheric circulation to the microphysical and radiative processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among them, the simulation of ENSO and its teleconnections, and the representation of high-latitude mixed-phase clouds (such as those observed at WAIS Divide in January 2016) are two key areas in need of improvement in climate models15,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Future changes in the intensity of ENSO events are currently estimated with greater confidence than ENSO-related long-distance climate changes, owing in large part to model difficulties in simulating the present-day mean state climate32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequency of extreme El Niño events is projected to increase over the course of the twenty-first century32,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the role of El Niño-related atmospheric circulation in promoting warm air advection to the Ross sector, a greater number of extreme El Niño events could foster more frequent major melt events in this area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One source of uncertainty lies in the modulating effect of the SAM on this teleconnection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect has become less clear after January 2016.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the conjunction of a strong El Niño/strong teleconnection on the one hand, and strong westerlies on the other hand was at odds with known tropical-high latitude interactions7,8,10,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, this scenario may grow more likely in the future35 as anthropogenic forcings are expected to continue favouring positive SAM conditions in austral summer36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, the January 2016 melt event demonstrates that the present-day climate of West Antarctica already allows for extensive surface melt to occur occasionally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, two recent modelling studies37,38 have come to rather different conclusions about the future evolution of surface melt over the Ross Ice Shelf and its impact on the WAIS mass balance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One study37 suggests that the phenomenon will remain minimal throughout the twenty-first century, and is, therefore, unlikely to contribute significantly to the destabilization of the WAIS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other study38 projects that the Ross Ice Shelf will experience extensive surface melt and retreat substantially by 2100, thereby accelerating the disintegration of the WAIS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, the extent to which the January 2016 event is a precursor of the climate of West Antarctica in the coming decades is uncertain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But our study highlights some of the key mechanisms that need to be resolved to address this question.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

the gaps in the SMMR data (available only every other day) by linearly interpolating the data from the two adjacent days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We filled the gaps in the SSM/ISSMIS data only if they did not exceed one day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure consistency between the different sensors, we adjusted all SMMR and SSM/I Tb data to SSMIS F-17 using the regression coefficients derived by refs 40, 41, 42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only exception was for the adjustment between SSM/I F-13 and SSMIS F-17, for which we derived our own coefficients (see Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All coefficients used in our adjustment procedure (along with their references) are listed in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For a given grid cell and a given day, we determined that melt was occurring as soon as one of the two daily Tb observations exceeded a threshold value (Tbmelt) defined as Tbmelt=Tbref + T, where T=30 K and Tbref is a reference temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tbref was calculated as the 12-month average from 1 April31 March after filtering out all melt days as in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When Tbref could not be calculated (for example, at the beginning/end of a satellite record), we used the Tbref value from the previous or following year (whichever matched the sensor/satellite).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This overall algorithm was shown to be particularly well suited for detecting melt in dry-snow areas2, such as found in the West Antarctic interior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MI shown in Fig 1b was calculated as follows:', '', 'Here, A is the area of a pixel, mi is the number of melt days during a month for pixel i, and N is the number of pixels inside the Ross sector (red outline in Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Observations from West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide',

#@NEW_LINE#@#  Three simulations were forced with cyclic, annually repeating 12-month global SSTs based, respectively, on the major El Niño events of 198283, 199798, and a scaled composite of other historical El Niño events (see details in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fourth simulation (used as control) was forced with annually repeating SSTs based on climatological monthly mean SSTs for the period 19812010.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SAM was defined in each simulation using the first principal component of monthly mean 500 hPa geopotential height anomalies poleward of 10°S (these
