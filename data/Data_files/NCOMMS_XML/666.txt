Long-term coding of personal and universal associations underlying the memory web in the human brain  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Neurons in the medial temporal lobe (MTL), a critical area for declarative memory, have been shown to change their tuning in associative learning tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, it is unclear how durable these neuronal representations are and if they outlast the execution of the task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this issue, we studied the responses of MTL neurons in neurosurgical patients to known concepts (people and places).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using association scores provided by the patients and a web-based metric, here we show that whenever MTL neurons respond to more than one concept, these concepts are typically related.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the degree of association between concepts could be successfully predicted based on the neurons response patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide evidence for a long-term involvement of MTL neurons in the representation of durable associations, a hallmark of human declarative memory.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'It has long been recognized that the hippocampus and its neighbouring structures in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) play an essential role in declarative memory1,2,3,4, involving, in particular, the encoding of associations between items3,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies in animals have shown the engagement of MTL neurons in associative learning6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these findings, we have recently shown that MTL neurons in humans rapidly change their tuning to encode new associations14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in all of these studies, recordings were done while subjects performed associative learning tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is not clear whether the MTL provides a transient encoding during learning that is created afresh for each new memory and then consolidates in cortex2, or a more stable representation that persists after task execution1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidence in favour of one or the other model has been based on lesion or imaging studies15, but there is so far no direct evidence of neurons coding (or not) previously acquired and not task-related associations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To address this issue, following a previous observation of neurons responding to well-known and allegedly associated concepts (for example, two co-stars in a television show)16,17, we designed a systematic study to determine if these co-activations were just random coincidences or if there is a consistent tendency for MTL neurons to encode meaningful associations, independent of the execution of an associative learning task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, we evaluated the neurons responses to presented images and, in 24 experimental sessions performed by 12 patients, we asked the subjects to rate how much they related a subset of 1015 images (including those eliciting responses) with each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complementing these results, we then used a web-based metric of universal associations to study an eventual encoding of associated items with a larger number of experimental sessions (N=99) in 49 patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We found that MTL neurons tend to fire to associated concepts, an effect that cannot be attributed to visual similarity between the stimuli, familiarity effects, recall of associated items or broad semantic categorizations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we show a non-topographically organized distribution of responses, which is ideal for the fast formation of new associations.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Personal association metric', 'In the 24 experimental sessions for which we obtained the patients personal association scores, we found 32 units (19 single units and 13 multi-units) that responded to more than 1 of the presented pictures (mean: 3.1 pictures per neuron; s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  : 4.8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of units used for this and the following analyses is displayed in Supplementary Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1a shows one of these neurons, which significantly responded (see Methods) to the pictures of 3 relatives of the patient and 2 celebrities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of the patients association scores (Fig 1b) the relatives were clearly related to each other and the two celebrities were related to one of the relatives (stimulus 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the neuron did not fire to all family members (for example, it did not fire to stimulus 7) or celebrities, but only to a subset of the people that the patient considered to be related.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the patients entries, for each unit we calculated a mean association score between the pairs of stimuli eliciting responses (ASR-R) and between the pairs of stimuli, where one of them elicited a response but not the other one (ASR-NR) (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the example of Fig 1, the mean association score between pairs of stimuli eliciting responses (ASR-R=0.89) was larger than the one for the other pairs (ASR-NR=0.12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with this observation, ASR-R values were significantly larger than ASR-NR ones when considering the population of 19 single units with more than 1 response (P less_than 0.005; Wilcoxon signed-rank test; n=19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same tendency was observed for the population of 13 multi-units, although in this case the difference was not significant (which can be attributed to the fact that some of the response pairs may correspond to the firing of different neurons).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Exemplary neuron encoding long-term associations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) A single neuron in the hippocampus that fired to pictures of the patients relatives (pictures covered for confidentiality reasons) and to two celebrities that were related, according to the patients report, to one of the relatives (stimulus 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The red frame marks significant responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Time zero marks the onset of picture presentations, shown for 1 s. (b) Personal association matrix filled by the patient with a z-score normalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The association scores for the pictures to which the neuron fired (mean: 0.889) were higher than the scores obtained for other pictures (mean: 0.122).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to copyright issues, the images depicting people are replaced by their names.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the original figures see https://www2.le.ac.uk/centres/csn/publications-1/2016/longtermcoding.Full size image', 'Web-based association metric', 'Given that it is not, in practice, possible to ask subjects to rate all of the few thousand pairwise associations between the about 100 images shown in an experimental session, we defined a web-based association score that we applied to a database of 99 experimental sessions (recorded in 49 patients), in which we had identified 261 units (129 single units and 132 multi-units; Supplementary Fig 1) with more than one picture eliciting a response (mean: 3.0 pictures per neuron; s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  : 3.9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The web-based score rates the degree of association between two images based on the number of hits given by a joint search, normalized by the number of hits of the individual searches (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2a displays the matrix of web-association scores for the pictures used in all the experimental sessions, where we observe a clustering of values according to the broad categories of the images (actors, sportsmen and so on).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The category labels shown in the figure were manually assigned for each stimulus, but a similar classification was also obtained using a clustering algorithm (see Methods; Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scores shown in Fig 2a reflect universal associations between items, given by the shared inputs of billions of internet users, whereas the inputs by the patients reflect not just universal associations but also relationships given by the subjects preferences and personal experiences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2b shows the correlation between the personal and the web-based association scores (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, we observe a strong correlation for highly associated items (for example, Bill Clinton and Hilary Clinton are associated both for the patients and for the web) and more variability for those that are less associated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The personal and web-association scores were significantly correlated for 11 out of 12 subjects (rank test with P less_than 0.05; 1,000 surrogates; see Methods) and, considering the data of all subjects, the correlation between both association scores was significantly higher than chance (P less_than 103; Wilcoxon signed-rank test; n=12; see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of these results, we took the universal web-association scores as a proxy for the personal scores by the patients, which, in spite of individual differences, gave a reasonable approximation on average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Web-association matrix and correlation with personal scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Web-association values between the 611 stimuli presented in the screening sessions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note the clustering of values according to the broad categories of the images (manually assigned categories are shown on the left/bottom).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The colour bar on the right shows the strength of association values in arbitrary units.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Correlation between the personal and the web-based association scores (see text for details;

Fig 3), both for the single units (P less_than 107; Wilcoxon signed-rank test; n=129) and the multi-units (P less_than 105; Wilcoxon signed-rank test; n=132).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Performing a visual similarity analysis, we found that this effect cannot be trivially attributed to the perceptual similarity between the images: three different visual similarity metrics gave significantly lower differences between the R-R and the R-NR values compared with the ones obtained with the web-based association scores (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in agreement with the fact that MTL neurons do not represent visual features, as they show visual invariance (that is, they respond to completely different pictures of the same person)16 and their firing can be triggered by different sensory modalities (responding to the persons written and spoken name)17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another potential confound is given by the familiarity of the images: since familiar pictures are represented by more neurons18, there is in principle a higher chance of finding neurons firing to pairs of familiar pictures compared with non-familiar ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To rule out this possibility, we performed two control analyses (see Methods: Effect of the relative number of hits).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we found that joint familiarity scores (equation (6)) for pairs of pictures to which the neurons fired were not statistically different than the ones for the other pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we divided the image set into highly familiar and less familiar pictures, and found that results were statistically the same when considering association scores for pairs of responses where both pictures were highly familiar, where both pictures were less familiar and where one was highly familiar and the other was not (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Mean association values with personal and web-based scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Mean association score for the pairs of pictures to which the neuron fired (ASR-R;

Wilcoxon rank-sum test; n=129 and 19, respectivelythe difference was not significant for the multi-units), in line with the fact that the web-based scores reflect universal associations and not the unique relationships made by each subject.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Response latencies', 'It is in principle possible that the responses to associated pictures are due to the fact that the neurons encode only one of the pictures, and the responses to the other ones are due to cue-recallthat is, the associated picture acts as a cue to evoke the one encoded by the neuron, thus making it fire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note, however, that the subjects saw about 100 images per session without doing any associative learning task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So, with such large number of images it seems unlikely that the subjects will spontaneously and consistently recall specific relationships that could explain the responses to associated items.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To give further support, we estimated the latency of the responses using the same latency estimation method of Kreiman et al.19 (see Methods), who studied human MTL single-neuron responses in a cue-recall paradigm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They report that the mean latency of human MTL responses obtained by evoking an image from a cue was of 409 ms (s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  : 291 ms)about 130 ms longer than the one they found for the visual responses (triggered by the picture presentations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our case the mean latency of the responses was 253 ms (s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  : 129 ms), which is well below the one reported by Kreiman et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  for cue-recall responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the mean latency difference of the responses to different stimuli (in the same neurons) was of 78 ms (s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  : 89 ms), whereas the latency difference reported by Kreiman et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  for recall responses was more than 60% larger.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Topographic organization', 'Using similar calculations, we also studied whether there is a topographic organization of responses in the MTL, namely, that nearby neurons tend to respond to associated concepts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, we focused on the responses from 72 electrodes that had more than one unit (single- or multi-unit) separated after spike sorting, with at least one significant response each.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then quantified the degree of association between these pairs of responses and compared them with the ones for the other pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with previous evidence from studies in the rodent hippocampus20, as well as from illustrative cases showing that neighbouring human MTL neurons tend to fire to completely unrelated things21, the mean association score between the stimuli eliciting responses in these close-by units was not significantly different from the one for the other stimuli pairs (Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Fig 4a), both when considering only the single units (N=49) or all units together (N=159), thus arguing against a topographic organization of responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Topographic analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Mean association scores ASR-R (green) and ASR-NR (grey) between pictures eliciting responses in nearby neurons, which were recorded from the same electrode and separated after spike sorting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case N indicates the number of electrodes with at least two responsive units separated after spike sorting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Mean association score for the pairs of images eliciting responses for the different MTL areas.Full size image', 'More broadly, to compare the tendency of neurons to fire to associated concepts across the different MTL areas, we pulled together all units (given that results with the web-based scores were similar for single- and multi-units).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all areas, the association scores for the pairs of responsive stimuli ASR-R were significantly larger than the ones to other pairs (ASR-NR) (in all cases P less_than 0.05; Wilcoxon signed-rank test; for sample sizes see Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference between association scores for response pairs and other pairs (ASR-RASR-NR) across MTL areas showed a tendency, being largest in the hippocampus and lowest in the parahippocampal cortex (Fig 4b), which, however, did not reach statistical significance (P=0.07; analysis of variance, n=129 and 132).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Probability of responses to associated concepts', 'With the web-based scores, we also assessed how the probability of neurons responding to a pair of items depends on the degree of association between the items.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That means, given a neuron that responds to a picture, we quantified the probability that the neuron responds to a second picture as a function on its association with the first one (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 5 shows the population average, where we observe a psychometric-like nonlinear increase of the probability of pair responses with the degree of association between the items.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the probability of neurons responding to highly associated items saturated at about 4%, going down to about 1% for weakly associated ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference might, however, be larger considering that certain items, which were not associated according to the web metric, may have had a particular relationship for the patient, whereas there is more consistency between the subjective and web-metric scores for the highly associated items (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Probability of responses to associated concepts.Probability of responses to a pair of pictures as a function of their degree of association (see text for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars show s.e.m.Full size image', 'Cell-by-cell and decoding analysis', 'For each responsive neuron we performed a cell-by-cell analysis by correlating the matrix of joint-neural responsesthat is for each pair of pictures (i,j), the product of the responses to pictures i and jwith the matrix of web-association values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To illustrate this, Fig 6a shows a neuron that fired to a few basketball players and to other sportsmen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 6b,c shows the corresponding joint-neural and web-association matrices between all 86 stimuli shown in this experimental session.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe a clustering in the joint-neural responses, which partially matches the clustering present in the matrix of web-association scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As described beforethat is, consistent with the fact that the maximum probability of pair responses is about 4%the neural responses encode relatively few of the associations between the stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This partial matching was, however, enough to give a significant correlation between the neural and the web-association matrices, as assessed with a permutation test (Fig 6d; see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 7 shows another example of a neuron firing to two researchers performing experiments with the patient, which are very much related according to the web-based metric.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the neuron did not fire to a third experimenter (stimulus 3) that was also related to the first two.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in the previous case, the correlation between web-association and joint-neural matrices was significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More examples are shown in the Supplementary Information (Supplementary Figs 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repeating this analysis with the 399 responsive units (174 single- and 225 multi-units) with a non-zero joint-neural response matrix (Supplementary Table 1), we obtained a significant correlation between the neural and web-association matrices in 19% of the cases (38 single- and 38 multi-units; rank test with P less_than 0.05; 1,000 surrogates).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This relatively low number of significant correlations is, again, due to the fact that neurons encode relatively few of the associations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the neuron in Fig 8 responded to two clearly associated concepts (Superman and Mr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incredible), but the correlation between the joint-neural and the web-association matrices was not significant due to the sparseness of the joint-neural matrix (see Supplementary Fig 7 for a similar example).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, considering the population of 399 neurons, the correlation values were significantly larger than chance (P less_than 106 Wilcoxon signed-rank test; n=399).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with this result, the correlation between the average joint-neural and web-association matrices obtained when considering all responses and pictures (that is, the matrices of Supplementary Fig 3 and Fig 2a, respectively) was also significantly larger than chance (P less_than 0.01, rank test, 1,000 surrogates).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Correlation analysis with a neuron in the hippocampus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) A single neuron in the hippocampus that fired to pictures of basketball players and to other sportsman.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b,c) Web-association and joint-neural response matrices (see text for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colour bars on the right denote association and join-response strength, respectively, in arbitrary units.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Correlation between the web-association and joint-response matrices (red dotted line) and for a distribution of 1,000 surrogates, which were obtained by randomly shuffling the responses (see text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The original correlation value was significantly larger than chance (rank test compared with the population of the 1,000 surrogates) with P less_than 0.005.Full size image', 'Figure 7: Correlation analysis with a neuron in the parahippocampal cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) A single neuron in the parahippocampal cortex that fired to pictures of two researchers performing the experiments with the patient, but not to the picture of a third researcher also working with the patient (stimulus 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b,c) Web-association and joint-neural response matrices (see text for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colour bars on the right denote association and joint-response strength, respectively, in arbitrary units.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Correlation between the web-association and joint-response matrices (red dotted line) and for a distribution of 1,000 surrogates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case the correlation between the web-association and joint-response matrices was significantly larger than chance (P less_than 0.05, rank test, 1,000 surrogates).Full size image', 'Figure 8: Correlation analysis with a neuron in the entorhinal cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) A single neuron in the entorhinal cortex that fired to pictures of two cartoons, Superman and Mr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incredible, but not to other cartoons, like Homer Simpson (stimulus 106).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b,c) Web-association and joint-neural response matrices (see text for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colour bars on the right denote association and join-response strength, respectively, in arbitrary units.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Correlation between the web-association and joint-response matrices (red dotted line) and for a distribution of 1,000 surrogates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, the correlation between the web-association and the joint-response matrices was not significant (P=0.13, rank test, 1,000 surrogates) due to the fact that the neuron encoded relatively few of the associations in the web-association matrix.Full size image', 'We also used the neural responses to predict the degree of association between items (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied this analysis to 345 units (136 single- and 209 multi-units) with at least two non-zero entries in the joint-response matrix (Supplementary Table 1) and found that predictions were significantly larger than chance for 62 (18%) of these units (27 single- and 35 multi-units), using a rank test with P less_than 0.05 and 1,000 surrogates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reason for this relatively low rate of success is, again, due to the fact that MTL neurons encode relatively few of the associations between the stimuli (see examples in Fig 8 and Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with this observation, we found a significant correlation (P less_than 0.005; Spearman rank correlation test; n=345) between the prediction error obtained for each neuron (minus the prediction error for the 5-percentile of the surrogates; see Methods) and the number of non-zero responses (which gives the number of non-zero entries in the joint-neural response matrix and eventually the number of associations coded by the neuron).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, considering the whole population of neurons, predictions were larger than chance with P less_than 0.05 (Wilcoxon signed-rank test;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'By analysing the association scores given by the subjects and by using a web-based association metric with a much larger database of responses, we demonstrated that whenever MTL neurons fire to more than one concept, these concepts tend to be associated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This claim is supported by three different analyses: first, the association scores for pairs of pictures to which neurons fired were significantly larger than the ones for other pairs of pictures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, a cell-by-cell analysis showed a correlation above chance between the neural responses and the association matrices (without using a criterion to define a response).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, based on the neurons responses we could predict the degree of association between pictures significantly better than chance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we have shown that these results could not be trivially attributed to an effect given by the visual similarity of the images, their relative familiarity or the recall of a single picture triggered by associated ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Following on from these results, we also showed that the responses to associated items were more correlated to the subjects scores, determined by their own personal experiences, than to universal web-association values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line, the neurons responses reflected specific relationships between individual items and cannot be merely attributed to broad semantic categorieswhich is in contrast to findings in the monkey hippocampus22, although in this case, category responses were argued to arise to optimally perform a delay match to sample task involving large number of images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, MTL neurons tended to fire to some, but not all of the pictures in a categoryfor example, the neuron shown in Fig 1 fired only to some of the family members presented; the neuron in Fig 7 fired to two of the experimenters, but not to another one and so on.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify this observation at the population level, we showed that first, when the items that a given MTL neuron fired to belonged to the same category (for example, two actors), the association scores for these items were, on average, significantly larger than the ones for other items in the same category (other actors); second, MTL neurons also responded to pairs of pictures belonging to different semantic categories (for example, an actor and a place) and in this case the association scores for the specific items the neuron fired to were, on average, significantly larger than the association scores for other items across the same categories (other actors and places).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In terms of regional organization, there was a close to significant statistical tendency for a non-homogeneous coding of associations within the MTL areas, being largest in the hippocampus and lowest in the parahippocampal cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, as reported in the rodent hippocampus20, and in contrast to findings in (monkey) cortical areas23, close-by neurons did not fire to related items.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such non-topographically organized representation is indeed ideal for the fast creation of associations between arbitrary (that is, not related) concepts21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with this observation, we have recently shown that human MTL neurons can rapidly encode newly learned associations between (at first) unrelated items14 and another recent work24 has reported that MTL neurons encode associations between contiguous items shown in a sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have previously postulated that associations in the MTL are encoded via partially overlapping assemblies; this means that a proportion of neurons firing to a certain concept may also fire to related ones21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This way, the neural representation corresponding to different instances of the same concept will have a relatively large overlapfor example, different pictures of Luke Skywalker, as well as his written or spoken name, will trigger the firing of a similar set of neuronswhereas the neural representation of associated concepts will have a much lower overlap, as the Luke Skywalker assembly may trigger the firing of the one representing Yoda, but also the one representing Darth Vader, Han Solo and so on.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this model in mind, an intriguing finding from our previous study was the relatively large proportion of neurons (about 40%) that encoded newly learned associations14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this respect, we now show that the long-term probability of joint responses to picture pairs is an order of magnitude lower (about 4% for highly related concepts and  less_than 1% for non-related ones).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we can argue that from a relatively high proportion of neurons initially encoding new associations, only a small fraction of these will consolidate this information into long-lasting representations in the MTL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'There is a long ongoing debate about the specific role of the MTL in the consolidation of declarative memory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One view, the standard consolidation model2, is that the MTL has only a temporary role during learning and then memories consolidate into stable representations in cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternative view, the memory trace theory1, is that the MTL provides a long-lasting representation that continues to play a critical role for declarative (and particularly episodic) memory after learning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidence in support of one or the other model has been largely based on lesion studies and the investigation of human amnesic patients2,15,25,26,27,28,29, and has provided mixed results, which can be attributed to the varying degrees of the lesions and the presence of compensatory mechanisms that can be used to perform the behaviour at test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct evidence from neurons recordings is scarce.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, about 15% of place cells in the rodent hippocampus have been shown to maintain their tuning for up to 30 days in a familiar environment30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result supports the idea of a long-term coding in the hippocampus, but it is an open issue whether, and to what extent, rodent place cells can be taken as a model of declarative memory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Miyashita and colleagues used a pair learning task and showed that perirhinal cortex activations preceded the ones in visual cortical areas, thus suggesting a long-term involvement of the MTL in encoding associations and giving feedback to visual areas31, in line with their previous finding of a disruption of pair coding neurons in visual cortical areas on lesions in the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Closer to our study, selective responses to well-learned associations were described in the monkey11 and the rat hippocampus12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, using an eye-blink conditioning paradigm, neurons in the rabbit CA1 were shown to be active at the recall of remotely acquired associations13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with these findings, we have shown, in humans, the presence of a long-term coding of associations between known concepts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that our results do not rule out the possibility that these type of associations (beyond semantic category relationships) might be also encoded in cortex, but the fact that MTL neurons code previously existing, and not task related, associationsthat is, independent of the specific task performed by the subjectsshows a long-term representation that goes beyond a temporary and malleable coding and offers new insights to our understanding of the role of the MTL in memory coding, its stability and capacity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
