Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Leveraging the unrivalled performance of optical clocks as key tools for geo-science, for astronomy and for fundamental physics beyond the standard model requires comparing the frequency of distant optical clocks faithfully.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report on the comparison and agreement of two strontium optical clocks at an uncertainty of 5 × 1017 via a newly established phase-coherent frequency link connecting Paris and Braunschweig using 1,415 km of telecom fibre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remote comparison is limited only by the instability and uncertainty of the strontium lattice clocks themselves, with negligible contributions from the optical frequency transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A fractional precision of 3 × 1017 is reached after only 1,000 s averaging time, which is already 10 times better and more than four orders of magnitude faster than any previous long-distance clock comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The capability of performing high resolution international clock comparisons paves the way for a redefinition of the unit of time and an all-optical dissemination of the SI-second.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Time and frequency are the most precisely measured physical quantities thanks to atomic clocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optical clocks aredue to their orders of magnitude better precision1 and accuracy2,3,4 than their microwave counterparts realizing the definition of the SI-secondnew sensors with highest resolving power to, for example, test the temporal stability of fundamental constants5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complemented by phase-coherent telecom fibre links9,10,11,12 as extremely powerful tools for frequency dissemination on a continental scale, new scenarios for fundamental and applied science will become realizable through large-scale fibre-based optical clock networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A prominent example is the search for dark matter13 by monitoring the local time scale jitter when the Earth moves through cosmic domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accurate mapping of the relative gravitational shift of clocks will enhance redshift tests14 performed with clocks in space (Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space (ACES)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Highly accurate clock networks can also perform tests of the Einstein equivalence principle15 by searching for frequency modulation between clocks in a network moving in the Suns gravitational potential, or can provide a better synchronization between very long baseline interferometers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, new geodetic reference frames based on relativistic geodesy16,17,18 or a quantum network of clocks19 can be established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The traditional means to compare remote optical clocks are using microwave signals: the optical clocks frequencies are measured against primary caesium microwave clocks and the frequency values measured locally are compared, or satellite-based methods transferring the frequency are applied20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The accuracy of the former method is limited by the caesium microwave clocks with the most stringent bound set by our groups5,21,22,23 at an agreement within 4 × 1016; satellite link techniques do not reach significantly better performance either.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the capabilities of distant optical clocks could so far neither be fully tested nor exploited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we overcome these limitations by a direct, all-optical frequency comparison between two optical clocks via a telecom fibre link and demonstrate a remote optical clock comparison with one order of magnitude better accuracy and orders of magnitude shorter averaging time than with microwave clocks or satellite links.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work not only enables the above mentioned applications, but also clears the path towards a redefinition of the unit of time, the SI second24,25 through regular and practical international comparisons of optical clocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are of utmost importance for an evolution of the international time scale temps atomique international (TAI), which delivers the accuracy of primary frequency standards to a wide range of users in science and society.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

global long-wavelength and eventually temporal gravity field variations, especially the local spatial influence of the Earths gravity potential (see Methods) on the clock frequency needs to be considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The determination of the gravity potential involved a combination of global positioning system (GPS) based height measurements, spirit levelling and a geoid model refined by local gravity measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For our clock comparisons, the applied average correction is (247.4±0.4) × 1017.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differential temporal variation of the gravity potential by tides will become relevant in the mid-1018 range of uncertainty for clocks separated as in the experiment here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absolute variation of the gravity potential can,

other present-day means of remote frequency comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This international all-optical clock measurement surpasses the accuracy of the best possible comparison achievable by

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Comparing optical clocks is essential for their development and evaluation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For building confidence in them, using clocks of the same type is especially appealing, since the true ratio is known to be unity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The clocks have to fulfil this requirement within their combined uncertainty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For state-of-the-art optical clocks it is especially difficult to obtain highest quality results since clocks with similarly high performance are required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Still, excellent comparisons have been performed for, Al+ ion clocks4 on the level of 2.5 × 1017, for example.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An uncertainty level of 5 × 1017 has been achieved involving the Sr clock with the smallest individual uncertainty38, surpassed only by one other SrSr comparison3 with an uncertainty of 5 × 1018.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, all experiments on this low level of uncertainty have been performed within a single group, often with very similar devices that exhibit common mode uncertainty contributions3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the experiments we have presented here involve two fully independent apparatuses and teams, which adds to the significance of the 5 × 1017 clock agreement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Beyond the results presented here, and taking advantage of an ongoing refinement of fibre links and optical clocks, the addition of further institutes will establish a continental, clock science fibre network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even for greatly improved optical clocks, running continuously with an instability below 1016 (/s)1/2, our fibre link instability still does not pose a limitation due to its faster averaging behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such long-distance clock comparisons will soon have reached sufficiently high accuracy that the uncertainty of the geo-potential of mid-1018 will be within the measurement range of optical frequency standards.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This will turn them into precise and accurate height monitors at the centimetre level over continental distances and paves the path towards a new height reference frame based on clocks.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
