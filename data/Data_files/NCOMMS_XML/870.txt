microRNA-17 family promotes polycystic kidney disease progression through modulation of mitochondrial metabolism  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most frequent genetic cause of renal failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we identify miR-17 as a target for the treatment of ADPKD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report that miR-17 is induced in kidney cysts of mouse and human ADPKD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic deletion of the miR-1792 cluster inhibits cyst proliferation and PKD progression in four orthologous, including two long-lived, mouse models of ADPKD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anti-miR-17 treatment attenuates cyst growth in short-term and long-term PKD mouse models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  miR-17 inhibition also suppresses proliferation and cyst growth of primary ADPKD cysts cultures derived from multiple human donors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistically, c-Myc upregulates miR-1792 in cystic kidneys, which in turn aggravates cyst growth by inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation and stimulating proliferation through direct repression of Ppar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, miR-17 family is a promising drug target for ADPKD, and miR-17-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial metabolism represents a potential new mechanism for ADPKD progression.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'ADPKD, caused by mutations of PKD1 or PKD2, is among the most common monogenetic disorders and a leading genetic cause of end-stage renal disease1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The clinical hallmark of this disease is the presence of numerous renal tubule-derived cysts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excessive proliferation, a central pathological feature, fuels the relentless expansion of cysts ultimately causing end-stage renal disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that bind to complementary sequences located in target mRNAs and inhibit their expression4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aberrant activation of miRNAs promotes the progression of many common diseases5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, synthetic inhibitors of miRNAs (anti-miRs) have emerged as novel therapeutic agents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anti-miRs appear to be well tolerated in human clinical trials9, have a long duration of action and are efficiently delivered to the liver and kidney10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These attributes make them an extremely attractive drug class for diseases that primarily affect the kidney and liver and require long-term therapy, such as ADPKD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, whether a miRNA-based therapeutics approach can be applied to ADPKD is not known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have previously shown that miR-1792 inhibits PKD1 and PKD2 and aggravates disease progression in a non-orthologous ciliopathy (Kif3a-KO) model of cystic kidney disease12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the relevance of this finding to ADPKD is unclear because whether miR-17 can modulate cyst growth when Pkd1 or Pkd2 are already mutated has not been studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, with the exception of miR-21 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13), the role of miRNAs in ADPKD still remains unexplored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our primary objective was to identify miRNAs that play a pathogenic role in ADPKD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We began by systematically examining miRNA expression profiles in Pkd1-KO and Pkd2-KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, we found that among upregulated miRNAs, the miR-17 miRNA family contributed most substantially to the total dysregulated miRNA pool in both ADPKD models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These unbiased microarray results and the previous observations in the Kif3a-KO mice prompted us to study the role of miR-17 in ADPKD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using complementary genetic and pharmaceutical approaches, we now show that miR-1792 promotes cyst proliferation and ADPKD progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  miR-17 mediates these effects by reprogramming mitochondrial metabolism through direct repression of Ppar.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

substantially ( greater than 2.7%) to the total miRNA pool in both ADPKD models (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) validated the microarray data and additionally demonstrated that miR-17 upregulation correlates with disease progression in both models (Fig 1d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify the precise location of dysregulated miR-17 expression, we performed in situ hybridization using a locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified probe against the mature miR-17 transcript.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  miR-17 expression was increased in cyst epithelia of both Pkd1-mutant and

also observed in ADPKD models, we generated Pkd1-KO mice in which c-Myc was deleted (Fig 6e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of c-Myc resulted in a 53.7% downregulation of pri-miR-17 expression, suggesting that c-Myc also promotes miR-1792 transcription in the context of ADPKD (Fig 6f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, deletion of miR-1792 did not affect c-Myc expression in Pkd1-KO or Pkd2-KO kidneys,

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The pre-clinical studies presented here indicate that miR-1792 is a novel drug target for ADPKD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this conclusion, we show that genetic deletion of miR-1792 attenuates disease progression in ADPKD mouse models irrespective of the mutated gene (Pkd1 or Pkd2), the type of mutation (null or hypomorphic) or the dynamics of cyst growth (rapidly fatal, aggressive but long-lived or slowly progressing).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a complementary pharmaceutical approach, we demonstrate that anti-miR-17 also slowed cyst growth in two orthologous mouse models, including a long-lived, slow cyst growth model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we show that anti-miRs can be delivered to collecting ducts following systemic administration, perhaps owing to the altered vasculature of cystic kidneys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that anti-miRs are a viable new drug class for ADPKD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are likely to be relevant to human ADPKD pathogenesis because inhibiting miR-17 also attenuated proliferation and cyst growth of primary human ADPKD cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since miR-17 inhibition slows cyst growth in ciliopathy models (Kif3a-KO and Nphp3pcy/pcy), the beneficial effects of anti-miR-17 treatment may also be observed in other forms of cystic kidney disease besides ADPKD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While our data demonstrated that administration of anti-miRs up to 6 months is feasible, additional pre-clinical studies are needed to fully address the long-term safety profile of anti-miR-17 therapy and to further explore miR-17 as a drug target for PKD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our studies point to pro-proliferative metabolic reprogramming induced by the c-Myc-miR-17-Ppar signalling axis as a potential new mechanism for PKD pathogenesis (Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quiescent kidney epithelial cells rely on FAO and the highly efficient OXPHOS pathway for ATP to maintain homoeostasis23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, rather than ATP, a more critical limiting factor for proliferating cells is the amount of biosynthetic intermediates available for DNA replication and synthesis of new cell membranes and organelles26,27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this notion and similar to cancer cells, cyst epithelia appear to depend on two alternative c-Myc-activated metabolic pathways of glycolysis and glutaminolysis to fuel their proliferation20,21,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work suggests that an important additional component of this metabolic re-wiring is the inhibition of FAO and OXPHOS mediated, at least in part, by the miR-17-Ppar axis (Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By reducing OXPHOS, carbon can be shuttled to alternate metabolic pathways to produce building blocks for the formation of new cells30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed Pkd1-mutant renal epithelial cells exhibit reduced OXPHOS31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, PPAR and its target genes are among the top downregulated networks in murine and human ADPKD cysts25, further suggesting that reduced FAO and OXPHOS contributes to cyst pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, mutations in FAO/OXPHOS and PPARA target genes cause clinical disorders that are often characterized by cystic kidneys32,33,34,35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, patients with mutations in CPT2, an enzyme that transports FA into mitochondria, or patients with Zellweger syndrome, a disorder caused due to defective peroxisomes, develop cystic kidneys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glutaric acidemia type-II, caused by mutations of either ETFA, ETFB or ETFDH that collectively encode the OXPHOS enzyme electron transfer flavoprotein, is also characterized by PKD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Etfa, Etfb, Etfdh, Cpt2 and the various peroxisome genes were all downregulated in both Pkd1 and Pkd2 mutant kidneys, whereas their expression was increased after miR-1792 deletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 10: The proposed mechanism by which miR-1792 promotes ADPKD progression.Mutations of

transcript is processed to yield the individual mature miRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the cytoplasm, the mature miRNAs (miR-17 and miR-19) bind to Ppar 3-UTR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PPAR is known to regulate the expression of key metabolic genes involved in mitochondrial OXPHOS pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  miR-17 and miR-19 binding to Ppar 3-UTR lead to reduced Ppar expression, which in turn affects mitochondrial metabolism in kidney epithelial cells.Full size image', 'Another implication of our work is that agonists of the PPAR pathway may also have therapeutic value in PKD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several previous studies have shown that treatment with PPAR agonists (pioglitazone or rosiglitazone) reduces proliferation and retards cyst growth in rodent PKD models37,38,39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a similar beneficial effect of PPAR agonist (fenofibrate) treatment in Pkd2-KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a potential limitation of these widely used PPAR pathway drugs is that they cause kidney-related side effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pioglitazone can cause fluid retention and exacerbate cardiovascular symptoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, whether lower-dose pioglitazone treatment can be safely tolerated by ADPKD patients is currently being evaluated in a clinical trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fenofibrate use is associated with an elevation in serum creatinine and BUN levels41; therefore, whether this drug can be used over the long term in kidney disease patients is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, miR-1792 promotes ADPKD progression through a new mechanism involving the
