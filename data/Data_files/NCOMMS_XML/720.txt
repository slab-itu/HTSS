High-performance shape-engineerable thermoelectric painting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Output power of thermoelectric generators depends on device engineering minimizing heat loss as well as inherent material properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the device engineering has been largely neglected due to the limited flat or angular shape of devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that the surface of most heat sources where these planar devices are attached is curved, a considerable amount of heat loss is inevitable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this issue, here, we present the shape-engineerable thermoelectric painting, geometrically compatible to surfaces of any shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We prepared Bi2Te3-based inorganic paints using the molecular Sb2Te3 chalcogenidometalate as a sintering aid for thermoelectric particles, with ZT values of 0.67 for n-type and 1.21 for p-type painted materials that compete the bulk values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Devices directly brush-painted onto curved surfaces produced the high output power of 4.0 mW cm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach paves the way to designing materials and devices that can be easily transferred to other applications.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The thermoelectric (TE) effect has attracted considerable attention from various research areas, as its ability to directly convert between thermal and electrical energy offers a unique solution to sustainable power generation from waste heat sources1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall power generating performance of solid-state TE devices largely depends on the characteristics of the TE materials itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that the efficiency can be estimated from a dimensionless figure-of-merit inherent in the materials: ZT =(S2T/), where S, ,  and T are the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity and temperature, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TE materials chipped into devices are mostly prepared in the form of cube or cuboid blocks from a TE ingot by means of a topdown dicing process4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A potential problem of this conventional procedure is a relatively high production cost due to the energy intensive processing for ingots such as zone-melting7 or hot-pressing8,9 as well as the post-processing due to shape control10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter, in fact, suffers from another problem that attempts to realize any complicated shape other than a cube are technically impossible within the context of mass production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On the other hand, in the real-world applications, the minimization of heat loss due to incomplete contact between the surface of the heat source and the TE module is no less important than the figure-of-merit of materials4,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noted that the majority of heat sources for TE generators has irregular shapes, where the conventional planar-structured TE devices composed of cubic blocks should fail in achieving a desirable contact (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Comparison of power generation between the conventional planar-structured TE generator and the painted TE generator on a curved heat source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) A conventional planar-structured TE device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Scheme of power generation of the conventional TE generator and the painted TE generator on a curved heat source.Full size image', 'One readily available solution to settling down the aforementioned issues would be to secure a way to maximizing the flexibility in the shape and dimension control of TE materials during the forming stage, where the well-established printing technology would best-serve the purpose14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this printing-based technology has faced at least two major challenges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One is the poor functional properties due to the unavoidable organic-conducting binders in the inks for electrical interconnection among TE particles at the expense of TE properties20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the properties can be enhanced by high temperature processing instead of using organic binders, such enhancement is quite limited; for example, the state of the art utilizing a printing technique for TE materials deposited on a glass fabric achieved ZT values of 0.35 (n-type) and 0.27 (p-type)23 which are at most 2040% of the commonly reported values from the conventional processing2 even with the sintering temperature of as high as 530 °C close to the melting point of the TE materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other is the limited choice of substrates, that is, the usual printing technique forces one to deposit TE materials only on a flat surface, though the targeted heat sources where TE modules are attached are generally curved24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As a solution to these challenges, we present the development of high-performance shape-engineerable TE painting via the molecule-level sintering effect25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we utilized the molecular Sb2Te3-based chalcogenidometalate (ChaM)27,28,29,30 for n-type BiTeSe and p-type BiSbTe TE particles, which are arguably known as the best TE materials at near room temperature31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Sb2Te3 ChaM turned out to promote the sintering process effectively even at as low as 350 °C without any remnant secondary phase, the presence of which jeopardizes the expected TE properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the processing optimized, we have achieved the ZT values of 1.21 for p-type and 0.67 for n-type TE materials that are comparable to the bulk values2 and three times higher than the best values among the printed TE materials reported in the literature23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To show the feasibility of the currently proposed technology, we fabricated TE generators through painting TE paints on flat, curved and large-sized hemispherical substrates, demonstrating that it is the most effective means of heat energy collection from any heat sources with exceedingly high output power density of 4.0 mW cm2, which is the best value among the reported printed TE generators33.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The overall process for the TE painting in the current study is shown in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prepared TE paints with the Sb2Te3 ChaM sintering aid are painted on a curved substrate and sintered at elevated temperatures (Fig 2ac), eventually, producing the curved painted TE device exhibiting high power generating performances (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting n- and p-type painted materials in the TE generators exhibit the ZT values competing those of bulk Bi2Te3-based materials (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detailed results and the related discussion on the each steps are described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Schematic illustrating for the fabrication of painted TE devices with Bi2Te3-based inorganic TE paints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Photographs of the Sb2Te3

and p-bulk) and the printed materials reported in the literature (denoted as n-paste and p-paste)2,23.Full size image', 'Bi2Te3-based inorganic TE paints', 'The Sb2Te3-based ChaM was synthesized by dissolving bulk elemental Sb and Te in a thioldiamine mixture34,35,36 instead of the widely used a N2H4 solvent25,26,27,28,37,38,39,40,41 due to its high-level toxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sb 3d3/2, Sb 3d5/2 and Te 3d5/2 peaks corresponding to metallic bonding peaks are identified in the X-ray photoelectron spectra (Supplementary Fig 1), indicating the formation of an ionic Sb2Te4 phase from elements42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that this soluble compound decomposes into rhombohedral Sb2Te3 and hexagonal Te on mild heat treatment above 100 °C, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis in Supplementary Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is seen that the peaks corresponding to Sb2Te3 and Te phases in the XRD pattern (Supplementary Fig 2) become sharper with increasing temperatures, suggesting the suitability as a sintering aid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of peak representing the decomposition of the ChaM in thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the Sb2Te3 ChaM dried at room temperature (Supplementary Fig 3) implies that it was completely decomposed during drying process27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The Sb2Te3 ChaM can be dispersed in various polar solvents as long as their dielectric constant (, F m1) ranges from 10 to 50 for example, dimethyl sulfoxide (47), dimethylformamide (36), ethylenediamine (13) and viscous polar solvents of ethylene glycol (37) and glycerol (43; Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provides a room for tuning the dielectric constant, solvent viscosity and evaporation temperature of the TE paints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We dispersed the Sb2Te3 ChaM (20 wt% of TE particles) in a mixed viscous solvent of glycerol and ethylene glycol containing n-type Bi2.0Te2.7Se0.3 (BTS) or p-type Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3.0 (BST) TE microparticles (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The viscosity and evaporation temperature for the TE paints were both adjusted by controlling the ratio of glycerol (viscosity at room temperature934 mP s, boiling point290 °C) to ethylene glycol (viscosity at room temperature62 mP s, boiling point197 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the suspension was stable against phase separation and precipitation for more than a week (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Sb2Te3 ChaM as a sintering aid', 'To fully understand the sintering behaviour of the TE paints, both n- and p-type paints, repeatedly painted and dried, were sintered at various temperatures  greater than 350 °C, with all producing mechanically robust TE samples several hundred micrometres in thickness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3ad compare the microstructure of n-type BTS and p-type BST TE materials sintered at 450 °C with and without the Sb2Te3 ChaM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noted that a suspension of TE particles without the ChaM painted and sintered under the same conditions resulted in at most 6070 % of the density achieved with the ChaM (Fig 3e), regardless of the sintering temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3e, the presence of the ChaM effectively increases the initial density of the TE materials by filling up pores, promoting the grain growth and densification of the ensemble of particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a whole, the evidences demonstrate the effectiveness of the Sb2Te3 ChaM as a sintering aid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Characterization of the painted TE materials.SEM images of the painted n-type materials (a) with and

3.6 g cm3 (p-type) above 400 °C (Fig 3e and Supplementary Fig 6); however, a TGA profile in Supplementary Fig 7 revealed that a weight loss occurs above 450 °C due to the evaporation of liquid Te, which is known to result in a slight degradation of properties via the formation of the Te vacancy defect43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the optimum sintering temperature for the current study was taken at 450 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As manifested from the microstructures (Fig 3ad), the grain morphology clearly dictates that the grain growth took place in a layer-by-layer mode, which requires two-dimensional nucleation event from a liquid medium as a prerequisite44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the fractured surface (Supplementary Fig 8) shows the stereotypical microstructure formed by a nucleation and lateral growth44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that the added sintering aid formed a liquid phase at the sintering temperature, which provides a diffusion path for grain growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As evidenced by the differential scanning calorimetry curves of n-type and p-type paints (Supplementary Fig 7), the Te phase formed from the Sb2Te3 ChaM sintering aid is melted at 420 °C, lower than the sintering temperature of 450 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It means that the liquefied Te can contribute to the liquid-phase sintering on heat treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A possible contribution from the viscous flow mechanism during the initial stage of the liquid-phase sintering was ruled out based on an analysis on a time-dependent shrinkage measurement as shown in Supplementary Fig 9, where the time exponent of 0.08 is determined to be much smaller than the theoretically expected one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noted that the viscous flow mechanism during liquid-phase sintering is often represented as the following relation45: l/lt1+y, where l and t denote a linear dimension of the sample and sintering time, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the exponent 1+y is slightly larger than unity due to increasing driving force with decreasing pore size during the process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The temperature-dependent XRD patterns (Supplementary Figs 10 and 11) demonstrate that the Sb2Te3 ChaM was completely integrated into the host phase, suggesting that the Sb2Te3 ChaM should be compositionally compatible with the growth unit of the host phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is more pronounced in n-type materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The XRD patterns (Supplementary Fig 10) shows the peak shift to lower angle with increasing the sintering temperature, signifying the increase of Te stoichiometric ratio in a Bi2(Te,Se)3 phase due to the integration of the Sb2Te3 ChaM into the host phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significance of the improved sinterability is best-reflected in the electrical charge transport property, which is an order of magnitude higher electrical conductivity at 650750 S cm1 than those of the materials without the ChaM (Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'TE properties of the painted materials', 'Excellent TE properties are achieved in both the n- and p-type painted TE samples over the temperature range from 25 °C to 125 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The room-temperature ZT values of the n- and p-type samples marked 0.51 and 0.97, respectively (Fig 3g), where the maximum values reached 0.67 for the n-type sample and 1.21 for the p-type sample at 100 °C (Fig 3g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that these maxima are higher than those obtained with typical Bi2Te3-based bulk ingots (ZT0.81.0)1,2,3 and are close to the recently reported nanostructured TE materials (ZT1.11.9)46,47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, these values are highest among the reported TE materials based on TE inks or pastes, and 34 times greater than anything that has been previously reported for printed TE materials (Fig 2e)23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These promising ZT values of the painted samples originate in high electrical conductivities and ultra-low thermal conductivities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrical conductivities of the n- and p-type samples (Fig 3h) are 650750 S cm1 at room temperature, decreasing with increasing temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These high electrical conductivities result from the moderately high carrier mobilities of 149 cm2 V1 s1 for the n-type and 141 cm2 V1 s1 for the p-type materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Seebeck coefficient of the n-type samples (Fig 3i) is 114 V °C1 at room temperature with a peak value of 134 V °C1 at 102 °C, and that of the p-type samples is 170190 V °C1 over the entire measurement temperature range (Fig 3i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These relatively low-Seebeck coefficients are caused by the high carrier concentrations of 3.0 × 1019 cm3 for the n-type samples and 2.9 × 1019 cm3 for the p-type samples, since the Seebeck coefficient and the carrier concentration are reciprocally proportional2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The most significant effect of molecular ChaM-assisted sintering is seen in the great reduction in the thermal conductivities of the n- and p-type samples (Fig 3j), that is, 0.50.6 W m1 K1 in comparison with the 1.52.5 W m1 K1 of bulk Bi2Te3-based materials2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculated lattice thermal conductivities were as low as 0.19 W m1 K1 for n-type and 0.20 W m1 K1 for p-type painted materials (Supplementary Fig 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values are lower or comparable than the predicted minimum lattice thermal conductivities of 0.31 W m1 K1 in n-type Bi2Te3 and 0.20 W m1 K1 and p-type (Bi,Sb)2Te3, which is calculated using the DebyeCallaway model with the assumption of full densities49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possible explanation for the ultra-low lattice thermal conductivity is the porosity of materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the Sb2Te3 ChaM promotes the sintering of TE particles, their densities are still lower than the bulk values of 6.57.5 g cm3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis of porosity with N2 adsorption measurement and SEM of these materials (Supplementary Figs 13 and 14) reveal the existence of both nano-scale and micro-scale pores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These multi-scale pores can significantly reduce the thermal conductivity by phonon scattering with a broad range of wavelength at pore sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further quantitatively estimate the porosity effect on the thermal transport, the lattice thermal conductivities of painted samples were corrected by using the modified formulation of the effective medium theory suggested by Lee et al.50:  , where h and  are the lattice thermal conductivity of host materials and the porosity, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall porosities of the painted samples were estimated by the direct method of comparing the sample density to the theoretical density of bulk materials with identical compositions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the bulk densities of BTS (7.55 g cm3) for the n-type and BST (6.785 g cm3) for the p-type materials, the calculated porosities of the painted samples were 0.47 for the n-type and 0.46 for the p-type samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculated minimum lattice thermal conductivities of the n-type and p-type painted samples are 0.44 W m1 K1 and 0.47 W m1 K1, (Supplementary Fig 12) respectively, which are comparable to those of typical nanostructured bulk materials prepared from ball-milled Bi2(Te,Se)3 and (Bi,Sb)2Te3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Generally, the porosity of solid materials strongly affects the charge carrier transport due to scattering of carriers at the pore sites51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A charge carrier passing near a pore is scattered due to the potential perturbation50, degrading the carrier mobility and eventually the electrical conductivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The carrier-scattering effect on mobility can be qualitatively described by the Matthiessens rule52', '', 'Accordingly, the total scattering is the sum of the contribution of different carrier scattering mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, bulk is the mobility induced solely by the carrier scattering with acoustic phonons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the painted materials, considering no additional impurity element except Bi, Sb and Te, boundary and pore should be the critical factors to determine the overall mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lee et al.50 suggested that the porosity effect on electrical properties become weaker for larger grains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the material with larger grains necessarily has larger pores with the lower number density under the same porosity, the scattering rate is reduced and mobility is enhanced for larger grain sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that the grain size is in the range of several micrometres (Fig 3a,c) and the pores are mainly macro-scale in the painted materials ( less_than 3% of micro-pores in volume) suggests that the moderately high mobility is attributed to the lower number density of the pore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Another important factor to determine the electrical conductivity is the carrier concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome the lower mobility of the painted samples than those of bulk, we chose the composition of BST (p-type) and BTS (n-type) for host matrix materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The materials with such compositions are known to exhibit high carrier concentration by the formation of SbTe antisite defect to provide hole in p-type and Se vacancy defect to provide electron in n-type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the carrier concentrations of the painted samples were two or threefold higher than 12 cm3 of typically used Bi2Te3-based materials2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these high carrier concentrations decreased the Seebeck coefficients, the electrical conductivities were significantly increased up to 650750 S cm1 at room temperature, close to bulk values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, in spite of high porosity, the high carrier concentration, the low number density of pores and bulk-scale grains can result in the high electrical conductivity of the painted materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'All-painted TE generating devices on flat surfaces', 'The outstanding TE properties and painting processability of these TE paints make it possible to design highly efficient TE generating devices geometrically compatible with heat sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the first attempt, n- and p-type TE paints were applied with a brush to a flexible polyimide substrate, and then sintered at 450 °C for 10 min (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These painted layers formed continuously uniform films with the thickness of about 50 m (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It means that the sintering condition is enough for the system to reach the final stage of sintering, where the coarsening process becomes stagnant with a narrow size distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ag paste was painted in a way that the TE device consists of 5 couples of n- and p-type legs with lateral dimensions of 5 mm × 10 mm and an average thickness of 50 m (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The internal resistance of this device was 25.8 , higher than the expected resistance in reference to the electrical properties, suggesting that the contact resistance between the Ag electrode and the TE leg is considerably high.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured the contact resistance between the Ag electrode and the painted TE leg by the transmission line method (Supplementary Fig 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured contact resistance is quite high at 4.8 × 102  cm2, which is three or four orders of magnitude higher than the contact resistance observed in conventional module composed of Bi2Te3-based TE legs53 and can be responsible for the internal resistance of the painted TE generator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure reliable evaluation of an output power of this device, only the temperature of the hot side was modulated, while the cold side was kept at a constant temperature of 20±0.5 °C (Supplementary Fig 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4:

layers with 15 mm at the base and 25 mm in height and obtained the internal resistance of 40.2 , which is expected for the enlarged TE layers (67% higher aspect ratio).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To minimize radiation or convection factor from a heat source, the planar heat source was fully covered with a glass fabric and the apex of the hemispherical generator was thermally connected by thermal pads

increase the internal resistance since the output power density is inversely proportional to the leg length under same temperature difference54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming the identical dimension of the TE legs to those of other devices, the plotted output power density approached towards the others (Supplementary Fig 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As evidenced by the lower output voltage, small deviation in

coefficient was 10 W m2 K1 with an ambient temperature of 25 °C (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulation details are described in the Supplementary Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temperatures across the apex and the bottom of an alumina hemisphere were kept at 45 and 25 °C (Supplementary Fig 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the conventional module, since the contact area (d) with a hemisphere is small, the temperature distribution in the module is greatly non-uniform (Supplementary Fig 20), which results in a significantly low output voltage of 13.3 mV for d=1 mm and 4.5 mV for d=0.1 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, conventional module generates the output power of 76.9 W (the output power density of 15 W cm2) when d=1 mm, and the output power of 8.6 W (the output power density of 1.7 W cm2) when d=0.1 mm, which are greatly reduced values compared with the reported values of 410 mW cm2 obtained on a flat heat source5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the uniform temperature distribution and electrical potential field on the painted generator (Supplementary Fig 21) result in an order of magnitude higher output power density of 205 W cm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To further validate the practicability of the painting technology against the conventional module, we propose two designs of power generation systems based on the painting technology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the TE leg length in the painted TE generator was controllably varied to obtain the higher power output density, since the power output density can be maximized by the optimum TE leg length5,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Supplementary Fig 22, with the decrease of the leg length, the resistance linearly decreases and the output power increases as expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highest output power per unit area of 4.0 mW cm2 was achieved by the generator with the leg length of 5 mm under the temperature difference of 50 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the predicted power output density based on the fitted function with the data points reached 11.0 mW cm2 in the generator with the leg length of 1.4 mm, which is comparable to 3050 mW cm2 obtained from the conventional module with TE legs with an identical length on a flat heat source5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition, we fabricated the through-plane TE generator using the moulded disks prepared from the TE paints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The details of the moulding experiments are described in the Supplementary Information (Supplementary Fig 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two pairs of n-type and p-type moulded disks with the diameter of 4.0 mm and thickness of 1.0 mm were assembled by soldering with a BiSn solder to Cu foil electrodes on an alumina hemisphere (Fig 6a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The internal resistance was as low as 0.014 , comparable to that of the conventional module.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under the temperature difference of 14 °C, this generator produced an output voltage of 8.0 mV, output power of 1.1 mW and output power density of 2.3 mW cm2 (Fig 6c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the predicted power output density on the fitted function with the data points is as high as 26.3 mW cm2 under the temperature difference of 50 °C, which competes on par with the conventional module5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results clearly demonstrate the practicability of the painting technology in terms of the TE performance as well as the processability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Through-plane TE generator on an alumina hemisphere using the moulded pellets prepared from the TE paints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Scheme for the

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In summary, this study demonstrates that the painted TE devices exhibiting high output power of 4.0 mW cm2 can be easily prepared on any-shaped surfaces by the molecule-level sintering effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most pronounced effect of the molecular sintering aid was shown to enhance the sinterability of TE particles, leading to the particularly high ZT values of 0.67 and 1.21 for n- and p-type painted materials, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was shown that the versatility of the TE paints roots in the unlimited degrees of freedom for dimension and shape engineering in 2D and 3D structures without killing TE properties, shedding a light on the TE device community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, this approach has a potential for cost-effective manufacturing of well-designed TE devices depending on heat sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We strongly believe that the currently developed technology can be easily transferred to other communities such as 3D printed electronics and painted electronic artworks.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
