Nanoelectronic primary thermometry below 4mK  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cooling nanoelectronic structures to millikelvin temperatures presents extreme challenges in maintaining thermal contact between the electrons in the device and an external cold bath.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is typically found that when nanoscale devices are cooled to 10 mK the electrons are significantly overheated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the cooling of electrons in nanoelectronic Coulomb blockade thermometers below 4 mK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low operating temperature is attributed to an optimized design that incorporates cooling fins with a high electronphonon coupling and on-chip electronic filters, combined with low-noise electronic measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By immersing a Coulomb blockade thermometer in the 3He/4He refrigerant of a dilution refrigerator, we measure a lowest electron temperature of 3.7 mK and a trend to a saturated electron temperature approaching 3 mK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work demonstrates how nanoelectronic samples can be cooled further into the low-millikelvin range.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Understanding how to obtain and measure electron temperatures approaching 1 mK has the potential to open a new regime for studying nanoelectronics and pave the way towards pioneering sub-millikelvin techniques1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would benefit numerous areas of activity; for example, investigations of the fractional quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional electron gases2,3 and solid-state quantum technologies including superconducting and semiconducting qubits4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To access these temperatures one must minimize parasitic heating and internal Joule heating, and maximize the coupling to cold contact wires and phonons in the host lattice, all the while overcoming the decrease in electronphonon coupling and electrical heat conduction as temperatures drop6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we study Coulomb blockade thermometers (CBTs) that have been designed to operate significantly below 10 mK and demonstrate cooling of electrons in a nanoelectronic device to below 4 mK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A CBT consists of an array of Coulomb-blockaded metallic islands connected by tunnel junctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conductance of the array is temperature dependent, due to the balance between thermal excitations and an electrostatic barrier to single electron tunnelling across the islands7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CBTs typically function over a decade of temperature and have previously been demonstrated to work at temperatures as low as 7.5 mK (refs 9, 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps most importantly, they can be viewed as a primary thermometer of their internal electron temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have used CBTs as a diagnostic tool to quantify and optimize the thermal environment of a nanoelectronic device and to unambiguously determine the local electron temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the future, similar CBTs could be used to probe the electron temperature of nearby samples with thermal contact provided by direct electrical connections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the techniques that are used to cool the CBTs can be used to cool other nanoelectronic samples.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

small range of VDC (30 V) close to VDC=0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe an extremely long equilibration time (over 3 days) but a rapid cooling of the CBT following a heating event (a refill of the liquid helium bath that briefly heats the CBT above 5.5 mK and the fridge above 3.5 mK).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the thermal contact between the CBT and the refrigerator is relatively strong, and that its slow cooling is probably due to heat leak from an external warm object.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Thermalization of two CBTs at a refrigerator temperature 2.8 mK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a)

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The overheating of the sensor at VDC=0 constrains the value of P0()1 in the fit to the coldest measurement in Fig 4a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the parasitic heating is not large enough to reliably separate the values of P0 and  in the fitting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Qualitatively, the fits suggest that P0300aW per island and  is at least four times larger than expected from the nominal size of the thermalization blocks and the literature value of  for Au17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not possible to determine an upper bound on P0 without constraining .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth noting that the power required to measure the CBT conductance (1aW per island due to Joule heating from IAC) is much lower than our estimate of P0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, we believe that CBTs of this type can be operated at still lower temperatures by further reducing the parasitic heating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The functional form of Te versus Tmxc, as shown in Fig 4b, should have the same temperature dependence as the dominant thermalization mechanism, that is, T5 for electronphonon coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, other power laws have been observed9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we find that the best fit of  gives x=2.7 and a saturated Te of c1/x=3.4 mK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fitted exponent x cannot be confirmed by fits to the conductance dips in Fig 4a, because the overheating is still relatively weak, even at the lowest temperatures, and there is little effect on the shape of the dip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that a thermal model with a T3 thermalization term fits the conductance dips equally well as a model using T5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The saturation of the measured CBT temperature below 7 mK could be caused by parasitic heating of the islands or excess voltage noise across the tunnel junctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that the operating temperature could be lowered by reducing parasitic heating through better shielding and by lowering the voltage noise in the measurement circuit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand the cause of saturation in more detail, or to test an improved measurement environment, this sensor would need to be cooled closer to 1 mK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, the CBTs described here have been shown to operate as reliable primary thermometers of electron temperature down to 3.7 mK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large thermalization blocks incorporated in the device and a relatively low level of parasitic heating ensure that the electron subsystem in the sensor is well coupled to the phonon subsystem down to 7 mK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An immersion cell is shown to improve thermal coupling between a CBT and a dilution refrigerator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allows the onset of overheating to be observed below 7 mK, and although the presence of overheating can be seen, the effect is sufficiently weak that the sensor will need to be cooled further to fully characterize the thermalization mechanisms.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
