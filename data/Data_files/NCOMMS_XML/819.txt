SC83288 is a clinical development candidate for the treatment of severe malaria  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Severe malaria is a life-threatening complication of an infection with the protozoan parasite Plasmodium falciparum, which requires immediate treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Safety and efficacy concerns with currently used drugs accentuate the need for new chemotherapeutic options against severe malaria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe a medicinal chemistry program starting from amicarbalide that led to two compounds with optimized pharmacological and antiparasitic properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SC81458 and the clinical development candidate, SC83288, are fast-acting compounds that can cure a P. falciparum infection in a humanized NOD/SCID mouse model system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed preclinical pharmacokinetic and toxicological studies reveal no observable drawbacks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultra-deep sequencing of resistant parasites identifies the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ transporting PfATP6 as a putative determinant of resistance to SC81458 and SC83288.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Features, such as fast parasite killing, good safety margin, a potentially novel mode of action and a distinct chemotype support the clinical development of SC83288, as an intravenous application for the treatment of severe malaria.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The decline in global malaria mortality rates by 48% over the previous decade has raised hopes of radical malaria control1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the burden of malaria is still high.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were 213 million cases of malaria and 438,000 deaths in 2015 alone, with 3.2 billion people at risk1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, much of the success gained against malaria has been owed to the excellent therapeutic efficacy of artemisinin derivatives and their partner drugs, which together as an artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) have formed the backbone of malaria control since 2005 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the clinical efficacy of ACT is under attack.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasmodium falciparum strains have emerged that display a delayed and possibly reduced responsiveness to ACT3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such early stage ACT resistant parasites have recently spread from their place of origin at the Thai/Cambodian border across all of Southeast Asia and run the risk of spreading further into Asia and beyond4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The consequences would be devastating since alternatives to ACTs are not readily available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The evolving lack of chemotherapeutic options against malaria accentuates the need for new antimalarial drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such novel drugs should exploit novel molecular targets and have distinct chemical structures to protect them from cross-resistance mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several candidates that meet these criteria are in the development pipeline5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, many more would be needed to compensate for the high attrition rate expected during the clinical trials and to build up a stock of reserve antimalarial drugs that can quickly replace first-line drugs should they fail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to novel drugs for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria, there is an equally urgent need for a new generation of drugs for the treatment of severe malaria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Severe malaria is a life-threatening condition that inevitably leads to the death if not treated immediately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The leading symptoms of severe malaria include impaired consciousness, vital organ dysfunction, hyperparasitaemia and the inability to take oral medicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Severe malaria is currently treated with intravenous (i.v.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  or intramuscular artesunate for at least 24 h or, if parenteral artesunate or artemether are not available, with i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  quinine15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in addition to the resistance problem outlined above, there are concerns regarding the safety of both treatment regimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  artesunate has recently been associated with delayed haemolysis in 721% of the treated patients16,17 and quinine is known to cause tinnitus and other audiovisual disorders18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have recently shown that amicarbalide exerts a potent antiplasmodial activity in vitro, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 10 nM (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amicarbalide is a benzamidine derivative that was used in veterinary medicine as an antiprotozoal drug against babesiosis, theileriosis and anaplasmosis20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slow parasite clearance rates, high relapse frequencies, poor oral bioavailability, undesirable mutagenic and toxic side effects, and manufacturing safety issues were the reasons why this drug is no longer in use21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe a medicinal chemistry program starting from amicarbalide that identifies two agents with improved pharmacological and antiplasmodial properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two compounds, SC81458 and SC83288, are fast-acting trophocidal drugs that eliminate P. falciparum blood stage parasites both in vitro and in a humanized non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) gamma c (NSG) mouse model system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed preclinical pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicological studies support the clinical development of SC83288 towards an i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  application for the treatment of severe malaria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further link the Ca2+ pump PfATP6 to reduced susceptibility to SC83288 and SC81458.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Optimization of benzamidines as antiplasmodials', 'Benzamidines are generally associated with poor oral bioavailability, which is explained by the strong basic character of the amidine group and the formation of a stable cation23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To improve oral bioavailability several strategies have been employed, including mimetic replacement of the amidine group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We initially followed this approach, starting with the East side of amicarbalide, while maintaining the West-side amidine group and the benzamidino-ureido-phenyl scaffold (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All compounds were tested in vitro for their activity against asexual blood stages of the multi-drug-resistant P. falciparum strain Dd2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Structures and in vitro activities of hit and lead compounds.The names of the compounds, their half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50), and their molecular masses are indicated.Full size image', 'The removal of the East-side amidino group or its complete substitution by an amine, amide or ester group abolished the antiplasmodial activity (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore explored a wider range of substituents including carbonyl-amino, amino-sulfonyl and amino-carbonyl groups, but decided to focus on 4-sulfonamides because of their overall higher antiplasmodial activity and the ease to synthesize a large number of derivatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 20 sulfonamide derivatives were synthesized and analysed in a reiterative process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The best activity (IC50 of 10±3 nM, n=3; mean±s.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of the mean of n independent determinations) was obtained for compound SC09064, where a bulky 4-sulfonamidomethyl benzene para-sulfonamido group was introduced (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The compound had improved physicochemical and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADMET) properties compared with the parent molecule amicarbalide, including better solubility in water (316 versus 100 g ml1), improved metabolic stability in a human microsome assay (65% residual after 1 h of incubation), negative in Ames test, and no adverse effects on HepG2 cells at a concentration of 10 M. However, the permeability as determined in CACO 2 cells (Papp=0.28 × 106 cm s1) and the oral bioavailability (3% in rats) remained poor, which we attributed to the presence of the remaining amidine group on the West side of the molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The West-side amidine group of SC09064, however, was essential for the antiplasmodial activity and replacing it with amines or uretanic groups rendered the compound inactive (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore explored a series of modifications of the amidine group and found that functionalizing it with a piperazine ring produced compounds with high antiplasmodial activity (Fig 2; Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, introducing the piperazine ring did not significantly improve the permeability, falling short of the targeted value of Papp greater than 10 × 106 cm s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The best two compounds in terms of activity and permeability were SC81458 and SC83288 with IC50 values of 8±1 nM (n=6) and 3±1 nM (n=6), and Papp values of 0.76 × 106 and 0.42 × 106 cm s1, respectively (Table 1; Fig 3a; Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional criteria driving the medicinal chemistry optimization were solubility in water (Supplementary Table 2) and therapeutic efficacy in a rodent malaria model system (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synthesis scheme and analytical chemistry of SC81458 and SC83288 are depicted in Supplementary Figs 1 and 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2 summarizes the structure-activity relationship of all 172 derivatives evaluated during the course of the hit to lead optimization campaign.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Antiplasmodial activity of 172 chronologically ordered amicarbalide derivatives against the P. falciparum strain Dd2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Substitutions on the West-side amidine group (grey), the benzamidine urea linker (green) and the East-side sulfonamide group (dark blue and red) are indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two compounds SC81458 and SC83288 are highlighted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Summary of the SAR analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colour code as above.Full size image', 'Table 1 Relevant activity parameters of SC81458 and SC83288.Full size table', 'Figure 3: Susceptibility of the P. falciparum strain Dd2 to SC81458 and SC83288.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Growth inhibition by SC81458 (closed circles) and SC83288 (open circles) in a standard cell proliferation assay with an exposure time of 72 h.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'SC81458 and SC83288 fulfil several criteria of the target candidate profile for a molecule against severe malaria38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both compounds have advantageous parasitological properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They display steep, in vitro grow inhibition curves with IC50 values  less_than 10 nM and IC99 values 50 nM (Table 1) and absolute Hill coefficients larger than unity (2.6±0.3 for both compounds, Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We interpret this concentrationresponse behaviour as evidence of a biological threshold phenomenon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SC81458 and SC83288 act quickly, killing 99.9% of the parasites within the first 48 h of treatment as demonstrated in a standardized in vitro assay26,38 and in the humanized NSG mouse model system (Figs 4 and 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parasite reduction rate of three log units is a conservative estimate given that, in human patients, parasite killing is aided by the hosts immune system and splenic entrapment and clearance mechanisms26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A logPRR of 3.0 is considered a favourable property of an antimalarial drug candidate38, although the value is lower than that of artemisinin26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the compounds are primarily active against replicative blood stages, with trophozoites being the most susceptible stage, they also target early stage (IIII) gametocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Being devoid of activity against the late stage gametocytes (IV and V) the compounds may not exert appreciable transmission blocking activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro preclinical profiling discovered no obvious liabilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, all animals tolerated exposure to the compounds at therapeutic concentrations without any signs of distress or discomfort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a full evaluation of the safety of the compounds awaits further toxicological studies, in particular acute and 28 day repeat-dose toxicology in a non-rodent species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Both SC81458 and SC83288 belong to a chemotype that has not yet been used in malaria chemotherapy and that does not reveal cross resistance to currently used antimalarials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The analysis of SC83288- and SC81458-resistant clones provided first clues about the possible resistance mechanisms and/or the mode of action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the three candidate genes associated with resistance Pf3D7_0106300 encoding the Ca2+-transporting PfATP6 stands out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finding of both point mutations and gene duplications suggests that Pf3D7_0106300 is under strong selective pressure by the SC compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PfATP6 is the sarco/ER Ca2+ pump of the parasite, and as such plays a vital role in Ca2+ homoeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PfATP6 was once considered a putative target of artemisinin39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, more recent studies failed to validate this hypothesis41 and, instead, point towards a mode of action of artemisinin that involves inhibition of a phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'SC81458 and SC83288 do not seem to target PfATP6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At least no Ca2+ responses were induced in the parasites cytoplasm on the addition of the SC compounds, as would have been expected if SC81458 and SC83288 were to directly inhibit PfATP6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests a putative role of PfATP6 in the drug resistance mechanism, possibly by acting as a compensatory mechanism for the yet to be identified molecular target of the SC compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, mutated and amplified PfATP6 might affect the intracellular distribution of the compounds by transporting the compounds into a compartment, where the compounds are less harmful to the parasite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A comparable role in resistance can be envisaged for PfMDR2, which when mutated might expel the SC compounds from the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A function of PfMDR2 as an export system is consistent with the subcellular localization of PfMDR2 at the parasites plasma membrane33,34 and the fact that PfMDR2 confers heavy metal tolerance and contributes to decreased susceptibility to several antimalarial drugs including quinine and atovaquone35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The role of the putative ATP-dependent RNA helicase DBP9 in the mode of action/mechanism of resistance of the SC compounds is less clear (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA helicases have not yet been considered drug targets in malaria research, although specific inhibitors have been developed in other systems43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although both SC compounds are able to cure a P. falciparum infection in humanized NSG mice, SC83288 showed improved metabolic stability, better efficacy over a wider dose range and less strain variability, compared with SC81458 (Fig 6; Table 1)therefore nominating SC83288 as a potential preclinical development candidate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dose finding experiments conducted in the mouse challenge model, together with the resulting PK/PD relationship, provide first estimates of dose projections of SC83288 in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking into consideration that the initial treatment against severe malaria is i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  applied until the patient is able to take oral medication for final parasite elimination, the mouse PK/PD data suggest that a steady-state free plasma concentration of 1.5 × the free MPC of 200 nM maintained over a period of  less_than 8 h suffices to reduce the initial parasite burden by 99.9% within 48 h (Supplementary Fig 8a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming a parasitemia of 10% that is not uncommon in patients with severe malaria, the total parasite burden will fall from its initial value of 1012 infected erythrocytes (assuming a total red blood cell count of 23 × 1013) to 109 or below if the additional contribution of splenic clearance and immune killing mechanisms are considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parasite burden may even fall faster with longer exposure times, as suggested by the in vitro killing speed experiments revealing concentration and exposure-dependent parasite killing kinetics (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A free plasma concentration of 1.5 × the free MPC of 200 nM translates to a total plasma concentration of 860 ng ml1 (assuming 78% plasma protein binding, Supplementary Table 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maintaining such a plasma concentration would require infusion rates between 8.8 and 13.1 mg h1 given a total plasma clearance rate between 1,0250, ml h1 (lower estimate) and 15,180 ml h1 (higher estimate; Fig 7d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How long such an infusion should be administered or whether i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  or intramuscular bolus applications suffice would await efficacy studies in clinical settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The projected dosing regimen would maintain a safety margin of 55-fold assuming comparable i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  no-observed-adverse-effect level in rats and humans with a C0 of 49,200 ng ml1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, SC83288 may not match the favourable pharmacological and PDs properties of artemisinin in all aspects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the attributes of SC83288 have to be considered in light of the emerging resistance against artemisinin derivatives3,4 and the adverse side effects observed in a substantial number of patients treated with parenteral artesunate16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of SC83288 as an alternative chemotherapeutic option will require extensive clinical studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the available preclinical data suggest that SC83288 holds promise for an efficacious and safe clinical candidate for the acute treatment of severe malaria.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
