A metastable liquid melted from a crystalline solid under decompression  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A metastable liquid may exist under supercooling, sustaining the liquid below the melting point such as supercooled water and silicon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may also exist as a transient state in solidsolid transitions, as demonstrated in recent studies of colloidal particles and glass-forming metallic systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One important question is whether a crystalline solid may directly melt into a sustainable metastable liquid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By thermal heating, a crystalline solid will always melt into a liquid above the melting point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that a high-pressure crystalline phase of bismuth can melt into a metastable liquid below the melting line through a decompression process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decompression-induced metastable liquid can be maintained for hours in static conditions, and transform to crystalline phases when external perturbations, such as heating and cooling, are applied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It occurs in the pressuretemperature region similar to where the supercooled liquid Bi is observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Akin to supercooled liquid, the pressure-induced metastable liquid may be more ubiquitous than we thought.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A supercooled liquid may be obtained by cooling a stable liquid below the melting line where the crystalline phase is stable1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supercooled region (that is, temperature and pressure conditions where the supercooled liquid exists) is highly related to the kinetic energies of nucleation and grain growth, and is therefore sensitive to external perturbations, for example, impurity, vibration, heating and/or cooling3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, a crystalline solid always melts into a liquid above the melting line3, although the melting process may be affected by factors such as heating rate, impurities, particle size and shear stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, there has been a growing interest4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 in studying whether a crystalline solid may directly melt into a metastable liquid below melting line (Tm) and the mechanisms underlying it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Levitas et al.4,5 proposed a transient melting process that occurs in a solidsolid phase transformation at temperatures significantly below the melting temperature due to internal stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently such transient liquid has been experimentally observed using polymeric colloidal systems6,7,8, where the particles mimic atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A two-step diffusive nucleation pathway was observed in a structural transition, that is, appearance of transient liquid first followed by its crystallization6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The occurrence of the transient liquid is attributed to a much smaller interfacial energy barrier at the solid/liquid interface than that at the solid/solid interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was further suggested that an intermediate liquid may exist in solidsolid transformations of metals and alloys, because the interfacial energy for solid/liquid interfaces ranges from 30 to 250mJ m2, much lower than that (500 to 1,000 mJ m2) for the incoherent solid/solid interfaces9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Very recently, transient liquid was adopted in interpreting the fast differential scanning calorimetry data in a bulk metallic glass sample via rapid heating11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a study of pressure-induced melting of ice, endothermic responses indicated the coexistence of two different phases of supercooled liquid water1,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All these imply the existence of a metastable liquid below Tm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the atomistic nature of a metastable liquid remains untested by in situ probes such as X-ray diffraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We here perform experiments on elemental bismuth (Bi) under hydrostatic conditions in diamond anvil cells (DACs) using in situ X-ray diffraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe that a crystalline solid phase of Bi can directly melt into a metastable liquid below the melting line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The metastable liquid can be kept for several hours at static condition until external perturbations are applied such as heating or cooling, resulting in transformation to crystalline phases.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'To understand how the decompression-induced metastable liquid can be formed below the thermal equilibrium melting line, we treat the transition process under decompression into two steps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first step is the formation of a transient liquid at the onset of the phase transition from Bi-III or Bi-IV to low-pressure phases (Bi-II or Bi-II), followed by a sustaining process of the transient liquid similar to supercooled liquid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the classical nucleation theory, the probability of the homogeneous nucleation (I) is determined by the Arrhenius equation10:', '', 'where G* is the free energy barrier in the formation of nucleation, and can be expressed as:', '', 'where  and GV are the interfacial energy and the difference of Gibbs free energy between parent and new phases, which are closely correlated to structures9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GV is the thermodynamic driving force in the phase transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the first step, there are significant differences between the crystal structures of Bi-III (or Bi-IV) and Bi-II (or Bi-II; Supplementary Fig 1)16,17,18,19, implying a large incoherent interfacial energy ((II/III)) in II/III (or II/IV) interface9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From our measured S(Q) and pair distribution function G(r) of the DIL (Supplementary Fig 7), the nearest-neighbour coordination number (CN) of the DIL lies between those of Bi-II and Bi-III (or Bi-IV; Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that the CN of the DIL increases with increasing pressure, with the CN close to that of Bi-II at low pressures and approaching that of Bi-III (or Bi-IV) at higher pressures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structural feature of the DIL implies much lower interfacial energy (L/III) in the liquid/III interface than that in the solidsolid Bi-II/III interface, that is, (L/III) less_than  less_than (II/III)9,30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the previous studies, which show that  is 5082 mJ m2 for the solid/liquid interface in Bi32,33, at least twice smaller than that of the solid/solid interface9,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to equation (2), this will result in a smaller free energy barrier (G*(III/L)) in the Bi-III to DIL transition than G*(III/II) in the III to II transition, that is, G*(III/L) less_than G*(III/II).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the probability of formation (equation (1)) of a transient liquid nuclei in III (or IV) will be larger than that of Bi-II (or Bi-II; Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the small interfacial energy is likely the main cause of the formation of the transient liquid for Bi in the first step6,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Coordination number of Bi in metastable liquid and probability of nucleation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Change of the nearest-neighbour coordination number (CN) of liquid Bi with pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CN (blue solid right triangle) is calculated using the pair distribution function of liquid, assuming that the density of liquid is equal to that of Bi-II at corresponding pressuretemperature conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The uncertainties of CN are estimated from the errors in fitting the first sharp peak in the pair distribution functions of the liquid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CN is close to that of Bi-II at low pressures, while the CN increases with pressure and approaches to that of Bi-IV at high pressures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Nucleation probability in the phase transitions as a function of PtrP under decompression, where Ptr is thermodynamic equilibrium pressure of Bi-III (or IV) and II.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probability is proportional to expG*/kBT, where G* is the free energy barrier in the formation of nucleation, and is proportional to 3/ (GV)2;  and GV are the interfacial energy and difference of Gibbs free energy between parent and new phases, which are closely correlated to structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first step, Bi-III to DIL transition has large probability in formation of liquid (blue solid line) compared with that of Bi-II in Bi-III to Bi-II transition (black dash line), owing to much smaller interfacial energy in solid/liquid interfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the second step, the large kinetic energy barrier in crystallization of the transient liquid suppresses the formation of Bi-II (purple dash line), eventually resulting in the preservation of the DIL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon further decompression, probability of nucleation of Bi-I (olive solid line) increases due to the increase in difference of Gibbs free energies between DIL and Bi-I.Full size image', 'Then why does the transient liquid persist over a long time without crystallization into Bi-II (or II)?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We attribute the preservation of the transient liquid to a process similar to supercooling, based on the following three arguments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (1) The DIL is observed in a pressuretemperature region similar to that of the supercooled liquid Bi (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2) The structure of the DIL is the same as that of the supercooled liquid Bi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (3) Because the structure of B-II (or II) is close to that of Bi-liquid; together with the negligible volume change between Bi-II and liquid Bi across the melting line, which is parallel to pressure (Fig 2), the difference of free energies GV(II/L) must be very small.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The small denominator term GV in equation (2) leads to a large energy barrier in crystallization and a small probability for nucleation of Bi-II (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hydrostatic environment in our experiment may have played an important role in the preservation of the transient liquid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the DIL is further decompressed into the pressuretemperature region where Bi-I is stable, the free energy difference between the DIL and Bi-I increases, resulting in a decrease of the energy barrier and an increase of probability in the nucleation of Bi-I (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eventually, the DIL crystalizes into Bi-I on decompression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The observation of the DIL in Bi is conceptually consistent with the two-step nucleation mechanism in solidsolid phase transitions6,7, that is, the formation of a transient liquid followed by a crystallization process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, rather than the nucleation and crystal growth, we observe the preserved transient liquid owing to a large kinetic energy barrier in crystallization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that a transient metastable liquid can be melted directly from a crystalline phase and preserved if the crystallization of the metastable liquid in the second step is suppressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decompression-induced metastable liquid may be ubiquitous in the first step and possibly observed in other metals, such as Na, K, Rb, Cs, Ba, Si and Ge, which, like Bi, have negative and positive melting lines and large structural differences between low-pressure phases and high-pressure phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The preservation of the metastable liquid in Bi may be unique owing to the structural similarities in Bi-II and supercooled liquid Bi, which leads to the suppression of crystallization of the metastable liquid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we observe a metastable liquid directly melted from a high-pressure crystalline phase in bismuth under decompression at hydrostatic condition by combining in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, high-temperature and high-pressure techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decompression-induced metastable liquid occurs in the pressuretemperature region similar to where the supercooled liquid Bi is observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Akin to supercooled liquid, the decompression-induced metastable liquid can persist over a long time until an external perturbation, such as heating and cooling, is applied, resulting in crystallization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phase transition from crystalline solid to metastable liquid can be attributed to the lower interfacial energy in liquid/solid interface than that in crystal/crystal interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results provide direct evidence of the existence of the metastable liquid as an intermediate state in solidsolid phase transitions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
