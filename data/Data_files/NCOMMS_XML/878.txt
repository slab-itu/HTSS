Regenerable Cu-intercalated MnO2 layered cathode for highly cyclable energy dense batteries  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Manganese dioxide cathodes are inexpensive and have high theoretical capacity (based on two electrons) of 617 mAh g1, making them attractive for low-cost, energy-dense batteries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are used in non-rechargeable batteries with anodes like zinc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only 10% of the theoretical capacity is currently accessible in rechargeable alkaline systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Attempts to access the full capacity using additives have been unsuccessful.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report a class of Bi-birnessite (a layered manganese oxide polymorph mixed with bismuth oxide (Bi2O3)) cathodes intercalated with Cu2+ that deliver near-full two-electron capacity reversibly for  greater than 6,000 cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The key to rechargeability lies in exploiting the redox potentials of Cu to reversibly intercalate into the Bi-birnessite-layered structure during its dissolution and precipitation process for stabilizing and enhancing its charge transfer characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process holds promise for other applications like catalysis and intercalation of metal ions into layered structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A large prismatic rechargeable Zn-birnessite cell delivering 140 Wh l1 is shown.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Batteries for grid applications such as integration of renewable power must be low cost, of high cycle life and energy density, safe, reliable and composed of easily acquired materials requiring relatively simple manufacturing processes1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Available technologies for grid applications are often unsuitable for wide deployment because of cost, durability and potential safety hazards2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High battery energy density is also desirable to minimize installation footprint, for example, for siting in urban areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Manganese oxide (MnO2) has the desired attributes as an electrode material, being abundant, non-flammable, non-toxic, inexpensive, water-compatible and with a high gravimetric capacity of 617 mAh( gMnO2)1 (refs 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Commonly used primary MnO2 batteries, where electrolytic manganese dioxide (EMD or -MnO2) is paired with zinc (Zn) anodes, have very high-energy densities,  greater than 400 Wh l1, but can only be discharged once owing to irreversible changes in the -MnO2 crystal structure13,18,19,20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Limiting the depth of discharge (DOD) to 510% of the 617 mAh g1 MnO2 gravimetric capacity preserves the reversibility for 1,0003,000 cycles but reduces energy density to 20 Wh l1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low cost of the raw materials makes such low DOD MnO2-Zn batteries attractive for grid storage, with costs and cycle life close to the ARPA-E set targets (http://arpa-e.energy.gov/sites/default/files/documents/files/Volume%201_ARPA-E_ImpactSheetCompilation_FINAL.pdf).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, access of the full second electron capacity of MnO2 with high cycle life would enable dramatically increased energy density and reduced costs for MnO2-Zn batteries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'High-energy density batteries for real-world applications require electrodes with a combination of high weight percent (wt%) loading of active materials and high areal capacity (mAh cm2), which together would result in high energy density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately high wt% loading is often the only parameter reported, which is not the true representation of an energy-dense battery as electrodes can be impractically thin with low active mass per unit area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the various polymorphs of manganese dioxide, the birnessite-phase (-MnO2) has been known to deliver 6080% of the 617 mAh g1 when cycled at low active mass loadings and under potentiodynamic protocols15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rechargeability of the -MnO2 in these prior reports was achieved through additives like Bi2O3, which mitigated the effects of hausmannite (Mn3O4), an electrochemical-inactive phase15,16,17, through Bi-Mn complex interactions that maintained the layered structure of birnessite23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, capacity fade was still an issue, and under galvanostatic cycling protocols, the additives had minimal effect, especially when the wt% loadings or areal capacity of the -MnO2 were high25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The addition of Bi2O3 was useful for low loadings of MnO2; however, at high loadings and galvanostatic cycling, the conductivity of the electrode is crucial, where fast charge transfer characteristics are required27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -MnO2 is a very resistive material28, and at high loadings, its poor charge transfer characteristics tend to result in the formation of Mn3O4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Prior reports have reported intercalating the -MnO2-layered structure with ions like cobalt (Co2+, Pb2+, Ni2+) to improve the electrochemical characteristics for Li-ion batteries29,30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these intercalants are toxic and/or expensive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other fields, Cu has been used as an intercalant to improve the properties of layered structures like bismuth selenide32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cu as an intercalant is attractive in cost and is non-toxic compared to the aforementioned intercalants and it has been shown to improve the electrochemical properties of birnessite34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report the development of Cu2+-intercalated layered MnO2 cathodes with a combination of high wt% loading and high areal capacity (mAh cm2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cathodes exhibit high volumetric capacity (mAh ml1) and can be regenerated for several thousand chargedischarge cycles delivering nearly the two-electron capacity with minimal capacity fade and at high rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cu2+ intercalated Bi-birnessite (Bi--MnO2) is a layered polymorph of MnO2 mixed with Bi2O3 and it regenerates via dissolutionprecipitation during charge and discharge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The material exploits the redox potential of Cu to intercalate Cu2+ within the interlayer regions of Bi--MnO2 during charging, and reduces it as Cu0 with a Mn(OH)2-layered material during discharge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, the electrode charge transfer characteristics are greatly improved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This holds promise of dramatically improving energy density and energy storage cost and safety, and amplifies recent interest in birnessite for design of catalysts36, lithium (Li) intercalation materials37,38,39 and intercalation of metallic ions into layered structures32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A large-format rechargeable battery with high loadings of Cu2+-intercalated Bi--MnO2 paired with Zn anodes delivering 140 Wh l1 is shown.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Electrochemical performance of Bi--MnO2 with and without Cu', 'Birnessite-layered structure is of resurgent interest for battery applications as an ionic intercalation material37,38,39 and with what appears to be some characteristics of a conversion electrode14,15,16,17,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bi--MnO2 in alkaline electrolyte is synthesized either by an in-situ formation step15,16,26,40,41 by discharging a mix of EMD with Bi2O3 and recharging to its charged state to form Bi--MnO2 (see Methods section) or by ex situ synthesis methods14,15,17,23,26,41,42,43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both methods have been shown to deliver 6080% of -MnO2s theoretical capacity (617 mAh g1) at low areal loadings for hundreds of cycles potentiodynamically albeit with constant fade over cycle life15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Galvanostatically it has been cyclable at low mass loadings with reduced capacity retention15,16,17,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The best results with higher wt% loading from a Bi--MnO2 cathode were from Kannan et al.,42 where they showed an ex situ synthesized material could retain 310500 mAh g1 for 200600 cycles at C/2 with 5065 wt% loading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there was no mention of areal capacity in the paper and a recent report44 that used the same synthesis procedure to make Bi--MnO2 found that at high areal capacity the cycle life was limited to 60 cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To the best of our knowledge, there has been no literature data accessing 8095% of the 617 mAh g1 of MnO2 at high mass loadings and areal capacities for thousands of cycles at C rates of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To indicate the effects of Cu intercalation on cathode performance, cycling data with and without Cu are presented in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cycle one in Fig 1a shows the material evolution and in situ formation (see Methods section) of Bi--MnO2 with high areal capacity (21 mAh cm2, 45 wt% loading).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EMD is mixed with carbon and Bi2O3 and discharged completely to 1 V versus mercury/mercury oxide (Hg/HgO) at C/3 in 37 wt% potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution to form Mn(OH)2 with Bi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mn(OH)2 with Bi is then charged up at C/3 to 0.3 V versus Hg/HgO to form Bi--MnO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second cycle onwards the flat potential discharge characteristics of the -MnO2 cathode are seen15,16,17; however, it is not able to retain the capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cause of failure appears to be due to Mn3O4 formation as discussed later in the manuscript.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Galvanostatic data for Bi-birnessite cathodes with and

NiOOH counter electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 60 wt% cell is still cycling at the time of this writing.Full size image', 'Figure 1b shows the cycle performance of a Cu2+-intercalated Bi--MnO2 cathode, which is able to access the theoretical capacity reversibly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Cu2+-intercalated Bi--MnO2 formation process is very similar, except with the addition of Cu to the mix of EMD, Bi2O3 and carbon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mix is discharged completely to 1 V versus Hg/HgO and charged to 0.3 V versus Hg/HgO to form Cu2+-intercalated Bi--MnO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of Cu is seen, and further cycling reveals that Cu addition is necessary for the stability of Bi--MnO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discharge potentials (0.406 V versus Hg/HgO) and charge potentials (0.26 V versus Hg/HgO) for the Cu-containing electrode (blue arrows) were stable, while those of the electrode without Cu (red arrows) were not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Impedance experiments45 were performed at the end of charge (0.3 V versus Hg/HgO) for the first five cycles (Supplementary Fig 1), showing the charge transfer resistance of the Cu-containing electrode to increase from 0.26 to 0.65 m cm2, whereas the resistance of the non-Cu electrode increased from 0.78 to 12.7 m cm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High cycling rate (20C) and cycle life ( greater than 4,000) of the Cu-intercalated material with a loading of 19 wt% MnO2 (12 mAh cm2) is demonstrated in Fig 1c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The system in general has low charge transfer resistance and can operate at ultrahigh rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 60 wt% MnO2 loading (29 mAh cm2) cell cycled at C/3 is also shown in Fig 1c, where it is able to access the complete capacity for 300 cycles, after which it retains  greater than 80% of the 617 mAh g1 over 1,000 cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Further, for a series of cells, the wt% loading of EMD was varied from 5 to 45, and the cells were cycled galvanostatically from 1 C to 40 C against nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) counter electrode (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell performance was stable, delivering a large fraction of the two-electron theoretical capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even at high cycling rates, a high loading cell (45 wt%,19 mAh cm2) delivered 6065% of the theoretical capacity in galvanostatic cycling at 4C for  greater than 1,700 cycles (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In several such experiments, much of the capacity was obtained for voltages above 0.6 V, where the effect of the Bi and Cu additives would be expected to contribute little as indicated by the potentiodynamic data in Supplementary Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some experiments, such as that shown in Supplementary Fig 2c, the role of the additives on the capacity is more difficult to interpret because some portion of the discharge capacity is extracted at lower voltages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, potentiodynamic data indicate that even in this low voltage region a majority of the capacity is still derived from the MnO2 (Supplementary Figs 4 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The potentials at which these capacities were obtained appeared to be dependent on wt% loadings and cycling rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In practical applications, these conditions would need to be optimized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical reliability of the data was also ensured by gathering the average discharge capacity of three similar cells with 50 wt% MnO2 cycled at 1C, which is shown in Supplementary Fig 3, where the standard deviation of the discharged capacity is  less_than 2% of the mean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Regeneration mechanism and electrode characterization', 'Figure 2a shows performance of the second cycle of a Cu2+-intercalated Bi--MnO2 electrode under galvanostatic or potentiodynamic cycling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slow potentiodynamic cycle (0.1 mV s1) shows the potentials of electrochemical reactions from which the oxidation state of the reactions shown in Fig 2a were derived.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed combinatorial cyclic voltammograms and the reactions are presented in Supplementary Figs 46 and Supplementary Table 1, where each component was methodically added and the electrode potentials were slowly swept to observe the faradaic reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction mechanism of Cu2+-intercalated Bi--MnO2 is illustrated in Fig 2a, wherein three regions of reaction are observered during both charge and discharge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the discharge region labelled 1, MnIV and CuII partially reduce to form MnIII and Cu0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The partial reduction of MnIV is perhaps from surface sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Discharge region 2 is where Bi--MnO2 without Cu is previously known to undergo MnIV to MnIII to MnII reactions, and here we find that Bi--MnO2 with Cu also has its significant capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reaction pathway includes a dissolved MnIII state followed by formation of solid Mn(OH)2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the discharge region 3, the remaining CuI is reduced to Cu0 and BiIII to Bi0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These regions occur for short times and hence the capacity in those regions is small as supported by the low capacity below 0.6 V versus Hg/HgO in Fig 1b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the charge region labelled as 4, Bi0 oxidizes to BiIII with partial oxidation of Cu0 to CuI, then substantial charging occurs in region 5 where MnII is oxidized to MnIII.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Just above the dissolution potential of MnII, Cu0 also oxidizes to form CuII, which is present as a dissolved species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the charge region 6, the formation of Bi--MnO2 (MnIII to MnIV) takes place, and CuII ions intercalate within the interlayer regions to completely reform Cu2+-intercalated Bi--MnO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanism to the improved performance of the Cu2+-intercalated Bi--MnO2 material is that Cu decreases the charge transfer resistance of the -MnO2, allowing complete regeneration of the materials from the dissolved state during each discharge and

cycled 60 times, a control Bi-birnessite electrode with no Cu (failed after four cycles), and non-cycled initial electrode mix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cycled and control (no-Cu) patterns are both composed predominantly of -MnO2 (indexed to hexagonal space group), indicating the successful Bi--MnO2 formation process, distinct from the no cyling pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The c-direction peaks, corresponding to the birnessite interlayer spacing, are shown magnified on the right-side plot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With Cu present, the birnessite interlayer is expanded compared to the control electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This expansion is consistent with other reports where metal ions have been intercalated in the birnessite interlayers31,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other peaks are also seen in the XRD of the control electrode, which are indexed to Mn3O4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further confirm the fingerprints of these respective phases, Raman spectra was taken for the control and cycled electrode at its charged state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Raman spectra in Fig 3b show peaks from the control material match to Mn3O4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  49), whereas different peaks dominate the cycled Cu Bi--MnO2 material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Raman spectra for synthesized birnessites have the strongest intensity 575 cm1 due to the Mn-O stretching along the chains in the MnO6 sheets followed by a band at 640645 cm1 due to the out of plane stretching of Mn-O in the MnO6 groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the Raman spectra of the cycled electrode a significant broadening feature of the band at 640645 cm1 is seen compared to the control electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This broadening feature could mean a disruption of the Mn-O caused by the presence of Cu2+ ions50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ex situ synthetic birnessite was hydrothermally made51 and soaked in a Cu2+ solution (copper sulfate (CuSO4)) for 48 h, and Raman and XRD were performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The XRD (Supplementary Fig 7c) for the synthetic Cu-soaked

soaked in Cu2+ and battery-cycled Cu2+ Bi--MnO2, indicating expansion of the birnessite interlayer and pointing the Cu2+ ions as the origin of the broadening feature36,50,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This

cathode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ex situ synthesized -MnO2 can also be used with no difference in performance as shown in Supplementary Fig 12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a device standpoint, addition of Cu is not a significant cost contributor because low areal loadings of Cu are sufficient to result in the enhanced capacity and performance (Supplementary Fig 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This also indicates that the capacity obtained is predominantly associated with the -MnO2 as the effect of different Cu loadings on capacity is insignificant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also cycled a Cu cathode against NiOOH counter
