Rapid erasure of hippocampal memory following inhibition of dentate gyrus granule cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The hippocampus is critical for the acquisition and retrieval of episodic and contextual memories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lesions of the dentate gyrus, a principal input of the hippocampus, block memory acquisition, but it remains unclear whether this region also plays a role in memory retrieval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we combine cell-type specific neural inhibition with electrophysiological measurements of learning-associated plasticity in behaving mice to demonstrate that dentate gyrus granule cells are not required for memory retrieval, but instead have an unexpected role in memory maintenance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we demonstrate the translational potential of our findings by showing that pharmacological activation of an endogenous inhibitory receptor expressed selectively in dentate gyrus granule cells can induce a rapid loss of hippocampal memory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings open a new avenue for the targeted erasure of episodic and contextual memories.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The hippocampus is an evolutionarily ancient part of the cortex that makes reciprocal excitatory connections with neocortical association areas and is critical for the acquisition and retrieval of episodic and contextual memories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hippocampus has been the subject of extensive investigation over the last 50 years as the site of plasticity thought to be critical for memory encoding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Models of hippocampal function propose that sensory information reaching the hippocampus from the entorhinal cortex via dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells is encoded in CA3 auto-association circuits and can in turn be retrieved via Schaffer collateral (SC) projections linking CA3 and CA1 (refs 1, 2, 3, 4; Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Learning-associated plasticity in CA3CA3 auto-associative networks encodes the memory trace, and plasticity in SC connections is necessary for the efficient retrieval of this trace2,5,6,7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, both CA3 and CA1 regions receive direct, monosynaptic inputs from entorhinal cortex that are thought to convey information about ongoing sensory inputs that could modulate CA3 memory trace acquisition and/or retrieval via SC (refs 11, 12, 13; Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In DG granule cells, sensory information is thought to undergo pattern separation into orthogonal cell ensembles before encoding (or reactivating, in the case of retrieval) memories in CA3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, how the hippocampus executes both the acquisition and recall of memories stored in CA3 remains a question of debate with some models attributing a role for DG inputs in memory acquisition, but not retrieval2,15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Rapid and selective inhibition of DG neurotransmission in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The hippocampal tri-synaptic circuit receives PP inputs from entorhinal cortex to DG, CA3 and CA1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) A stimulating electrode was implanted in the PP and a recording electrode in CA3 pyramidal layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Strength of CA3 pyramidal layer fEPSPs evoked in anaesthetized mice by electrical stimulation of PP inputs showed fast and slow latency population spike components corresponding to direct PP-CA3 and indirect PPDG-CA3 inputs, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Systemic administration of the selective Htr1a agonist, 8-OH-DPAT (0.3 mg kg1, subcutaneous), to Htr1aDG (Tg) mice caused a rapid and selective decrease in the long-latency component that persisted for several hours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification indicated a significant decrease in DG neurotransmission following agonist treatment of Htr1aDG, but not Htr1aKO (KO) littermates or vehicle treated wild-type mice that reached 80% suppression and persisted for  greater than 2 h (mean±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ; n=10; *P less_than 0.05; two-way analysis of variance followed by HolmSidak post hoc test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Representative fEPSPs evoked at CA3 pyramidal layer after stimulation of PP inputs before and after agonist treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fast and the slow latency population spike components are indicated (black arrow, short; grey arrow, long).Full size image', 'Here we combined a pharmacogenetic approach for the rapid and transient suppression of neural activity with in vivo electrophysiology during trace eye-blink conditioning to examine the contribution of DG to hippocampal learning and plasticity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our studies demonstrate that activity in DG granule cells is not necessary for the retrieval of hippocampal memory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, inhibition of DG is associated with a rapid and persistent loss of memory, as revealed by the suppression of both conditioned responding and learning-associated plasticity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pharmacogenetic inhibition of entorhinal cortex or local delivery of adenosine A1 receptor antagonist into the hippocampus reverse the suppression of learning-associated plasticity, suggesting a role for direct entorhinal-CA1 inputs in promoting memory loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar memory impairment can be induced by DG inhibition during trace fear conditioning, demonstrating its generalization across hippocampus-dependent memory tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we show that activation of an endogenous inhibitory receptor (neuropeptide Y1 receptor) selectively expressed in DG granule cells can similarly induce rapid and persistent memory loss, opening the possibility of the targeted erasure of hippocampal memories.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Rapid pharmacogenetic inhibition of DG granule cells', 'Until recently, a major limitation in resolving the mechanism of hippocampal function has been the lack of tools that allow for the rapid, transient, efficient and specific inhibition of selected hippocampal cell-types to directly assess their contribution to memory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we applied a pharmacogenetic neuronal inhibition strategy that we had previously used to rapidly suppress the firing of DG granule cells in living mice18,19 to dissect the role of this hippocampal input structure in memory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pharmacogenetic neural inhibition system depends on the systemic administration of the selective serotonin 1A receptor (Htr1a) agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, to transgenic mice expressing Htr1a exclusively in DG granule cells (Htr1aKO/Htr1aKO;Nrip2::Htr1a/+, called Htr1aDG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous experiments in brain slices18 neurotransmission via DG mossy fibres was rapidly and significantly suppressed in Htr1aDG mice treated with 8-OH-DPAT as revealed by an 80% reduction of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) evoked in CA3 by electrical stimulation of perforant path (PP) inputs (Fig 1bd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the short latency fEPSP component that reflects direct entorhinal inputs to CA3 was unaffected by 8-OH-DPAT treatment20,21 (Supplementary Fig 1; n=10, P=0.477, two-way analysis of variance followed by HolmSidak post hoc test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither agonist treatment of Htr1aKO control littermates nor vehicle treatment of wild-type mice affected synaptic transmission (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that the 8-OH-DPAT/Htr1a pharmacogenetic inhibition system is able to rapidly and selectively suppress neurotransmission via DG granule cells in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'DG inhibition induces loss of plasticity and memory', 'To define the contribution of DG to the retrieval of hippocampal memory, we combined our pharmacogenetic strategy with in vivo electrophysiology during trace eye-blink conditioning (Fig 2ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We selected trace eye-blink conditioning as a learning paradigm because it is a hippocampus-dependent form of learning in which the neural circuitry supporting conditioned responses is well defined and in which synaptic plasticity correlates are readily identified5,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Htr1aDG and Htr1aKO control littermates that had successfully acquired conditioned behaviour were treated with 8-OH-DPAT (day 8; 0.3 mg kg1, subcutaneous).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Agonist-treated Htr1aDG, but not Htr1aKO mice showed a significant decrease in the per cent of successful conditioned responses on the treatment day (Fig 2d) suggesting a requirement of neural activity in DG granule cells for retrieval of the conditioned response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, a significant deficit in conditioned responding persisted on the day following agonist treatment in Htr1aDG mice (day 9;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In the present study we examined the contribution of DG granule cells to learning and recall and its associated synaptic plasticity in animals that had previously acquired a hippocampal memory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that transient pharmacogenetic inhibition of DG granule cells did not impair conditioned responding to CS presentation nor alter SC synaptic plasticity demonstrating that DG is not required for memory recall (Fig 3c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when DG inhibition occurred during paired presentation of CS and US, we observed a rapid loss of SC synaptic plasticity and conditioned responding to CS (Fig 2d,e and Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, the synaptic plasticity and behavioural impairment persisted in the absence of further stimulus presentation and later relearning occurred at a rate indistinguishable from initial learning, suggesting a loss of the memory trace (Fig 2f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One possible explanation for the memory loss seen on DG inhibition is that presentation of paired CSUS has a dual effect on CA1 plasticity, on the one hand strengthening SC synapses via a DG-dependent mechanism (indirect inputs to CA1 via the tri-synaptic circuit) and on the other hand weakening SC synapses in a non-DG-dependent manner (direct PP-CA1 inputs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This explanation is consistent with several studies in the literature reporting mechanistic and functional differences between the direct and the indirect inputs to CA1 (refs 12, 13, 30, 31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, earlier in vitro12,23 and in vivo33 electrophysiology studies found that stimulation of PP-CA1 inputs to the hippocampus could depotentiate synaptic plasticity that had been previously acquired at SC synapses suggesting that the direct PP pathway might promote depotentiation during hippocampal learning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this possibility, we used dual, orthogonal pharmacogenetic inhibition of DG and entorhinal cortex to show that the memory loss phenomenon we observed depended on PP inputs (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, one of the earlier studies23 had shown that PP stimulation-induced SC depotentiation could be inhibited by blockade of adenosine A1 receptors, but not several other receptors, and we found that bilateral administration of DPCPX to the CA1 region of the hippocampus blocked synaptic depotentiation in our model (Fig 4g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our data lead us to propose a novel function for PP-CA1 inputs to the hippocampus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During CSUS presentation, but not during presentation of unpaired CSUS or CS alone, information arriving via this pathway actively promotes depotentiation of SC synapses, while information arriving via the DG pathway opposes this depotentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in an animal that has successfully acquired a hippocampal-dependent memory, and in which the direct and indirect pathways are intact, SC synaptic strength is stable and memories can be retrieved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when the DG pathway is blocked, as we have done artificially in our study, depotentiation is favoured and memory is lost (see scheme, Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precise function of PP-dependent SC depotentiation remains unclear at this point, but we speculate that it may play a role in weakening previously acquired associations to facilitate the encoding of new memories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Existing data show that selective blockade of synaptic activity in entorhinal cortex neurons projecting to CA1 impairs the acquisition of trace fear conditioning34 and support our hypothesis of a positive role for this pathway in learning13,30,32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, our DPCPX experiments suggest that blockade of the depotentiation mechanism promotes SC synaptic plasticity during CSUS presentation in otherwise intact animals (Fig 4g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, further loss and gain-of-function manipulations of this pathway coupled with in vivo electrophysiology and learning behaviour are needed to directly test a role of PP-CA1 inputs in memory clearing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Model for function of PP-CA1 inputs to the hippocampus.Area CA1 of the hippocampus receives information directly from the entorhinal cortex (direct PP-CA1 pathway) and also indirectly via the tri-synaptic circuit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Presentation of paired CSUS promotes potentiation of SC synapses (+) via the indirect pathway depotentiation of SC synapses () via the PP-CA1 pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an animal having successfully undergone learning, potentiation and depotentiation are balanced, SC synaptic strength is stable and memories can be retrieved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Inhibition of DG during CSUS presentation suppresses potentiation via the indirect pathway, unmasking depotentiation of SC synapses and promoting memory loss.Full size image', 'Our finding that DG granule cells are not required for retrieval of hippocampal memory is consistent with previous data arguing that retrieval of associative information encoded in CA3CA3 and SC plasticity is achieved via direct PP projections to CA3 (refs 1, 2, 3, 4, 35, 36, 37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our data appear to contradict at least one recent study demonstrating a role for DG granule cells in retrieval during contextual fear conditioning39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe this discrepancy is due to a requirement for DG granule cells in the processing of the contextual CS (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to rule out the possibility that other methodological differences between the studies underlie the discrepancy, it would be important to determine whether the cell-type specific optogenetic inhibition method used in their study left intact the recall of hippocampal-dependent memories for discrete cues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our study raises several questions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, while we show SC depotentiation is adenosine receptor dependent, the location of adenosine signalling is not clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adenosine A1 receptors are expressed highly in CA3 pyramidal cells as well as more modestly in CA1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28), and a study in which this receptor was selectively knocked out in one or the other of these structures demonstrated a role for presynaptic CA3, but not postsynaptic CA1 receptors in dampening SC neurotransmission41 suggesting a presynaptic mechanism for our effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The source of adenosine, on the other hand, could involve pre- and/or postsynaptic release as well as release from non-neuronal cells such as astrocytes27,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, although our DPCPX experiment pointed to a role for PP-CA1 projections in SC depotentiation, our entorhinal cortex pharmacogenetic inhibition experiment did not allow us to distinguish between contributions of PP-CA1 and PP-CA3 inputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we cannot rule out a contribution of PP-CA3 projections to SC depotentiation, earlier in vitro and in vivo electrophysiology studies clearly demonstrate a role for PP-CA1 in SC depotentiation12,22,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, the method we used to assess SC postsynaptic strength, namely electrical stimulation evoked field potentials does not allow us to rule out that changes in synaptic plasticity at non-SC inputs underlie our plasticity effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments using targeted optogenetic stimulation of CA3 efferents could be used to more selectively measure SC synaptic strength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourth, our observation that SC depotentiation and memory loss occurred only during paired, but not unpaired CSUS presentation (Fig 2d,e) suggests that the memory loss phenomenon we describe is distinct from other well-described avenues for memory degradation, including enhancement of extinction43 and blockade of reconsolidation44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, our findings demonstrating generalization of DG inhibition-induced memory loss across tasks coupled with our identification of an endogenous pharmacological target that can induce similar memory loss raise the possibility that the novel memory mechanism we have uncovered may be useful for erasing unwanted memories in a clinical setting.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
