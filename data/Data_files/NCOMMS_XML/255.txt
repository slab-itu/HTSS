Type 1 diabetes vaccine candidates promote human Foxp3+Treg induction in humanized mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Immune tolerance is executed partly by Foxp3+regulatory T (Treg) cells, which suppress autoreactive T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D) impaired tolerance promotes destruction of insulin-producing -cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The development of autoantigen-specific vaccination strategies for Foxp3+Treg-induction and prevention of islet autoimmunity in patients is still in its infancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, using human haematopoietic stem cell-engrafted NSG-HLA-DQ8 transgenic mice, we provide direct evidence for human autoantigen-specific Foxp3+Treg-induction in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify HLA-DQ8-restricted insulin-specific CD4+T cells and demonstrate efficient human insulin-specific Foxp3+Treg-induction upon subimmunogenic vaccination with strong agonistic insulin mimetopes in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Induced human Tregs are stable, show increased expression of Treg signature genes such as Foxp3, CTLA4, IL-2R and TIGIT and can efficiently suppress effector T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such Foxp3+Treg-induction does not trigger any effector T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These T1D vaccine candidates could therefore represent an expedient improvement in the challenge to induce human Foxp3+Tregs and to develop novel precision medicines for prevention of islet autoimmunity in children at risk of T1D.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Type 1 diabetes (T1D) afflicts millions of people worldwide and is a severe chronic autoimmune disease characterized by the progressive loss of self-tolerance to insulin-producing pancreatic -cells1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incidence of T1D is rising dramatically especially in young children2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T1D and other autoimmune diseases are thought to develop when T cells with specificity for weakly binding T-cell receptor (TCR) agonists, which may include self-antigens, evade thymic negative selection and then mount a peripheral autoimmune attack3,4,5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In children, the appearance of multiple islet autoantibodies indicates the onset of islet autoimmunity (pre-T1D)8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insulin autoantibodies are often the first to appear thereby highlighting the contribution of insulin in initiating T1D autoimmunity9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Regulatory T (Treg) cells are pivotal in preventing autoimmunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Impairments in Treg numbers, function and induction critically contribute to autoimmune destruction in T1D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tregs are characterized by the expression of the high-affinity interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor -chain (IL-2R) and the X-linked gene forkhead box P3 (Foxp3), encoding the transcription factor Foxp3, which acts as a lineage specification factor for the development and function of CD4+CD25+Tregs10,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The essential function of human Foxp3+Tregs to avoid autoimmunity is illustrated by the fatal autoimmune disease IPEX (immunodysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy and X-linked syndrome), which is caused by mutations in the Foxp3 gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Foxp3+Tregs have attracted attention as they can tame their autoreactive counterparts by direct contact-dependent inhibition of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and effector T cells or by releasing inhibitory cytokines such as TGF or IL-10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tregs maintain their regulatory functions for a long period of time even in the absence of antigens that induced their generation and are stable and transferable14, thereby permitting the prospective induction of these cells to prevent unwanted immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are focusing on novel strategies using optimized variants of critical autoantigens for Foxp3+Treg induction since Tregs bear the promise of specifically targeting the harmful effects of peripheral autoreactive T cells to control autoimmunity such as that observed in T1D while preserving the ability of the immune system to fight off infections15,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optimal in vivo induction of stable murine Foxp3+Tregs requires the subimmunogenic delivery of strongly agonistic TCR ligands to naive CD4+T cells16,17,19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, even high immunogenic doses of weakly agonistic ligands fail to induce stable Foxp3+Tregs17,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most efficient Foxp3+Treg induction is achieved in T cells that proliferated least extensively19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific Foxp3+Treg induction in the context of autoimmunity could allow modulating the immune response for clinical benefit while limiting long-term immune suppression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'T1D mouse models as non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice showed that insulin functions as an essential autoantigen23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In humans and mice, T cell responses to insulin are highly focused on a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ8- or murine IAg7-restricted segment of the insulin-B-chain comprising residues 923 and the human epitope is identical to that of mouse insulin25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial murine studies using subimmunogenic delivery of natural insulin B-chain epitopes show only a limited Treg induction efficacy and a slight delay in T1D progression17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As one possible means to explain the poor efficacy of Treg induction by natural insulin B-chain epitopes in murine T1D, it has been indicated that the insulin-B-chain peptide is presented by I-Ag7 in a low-affinity binding register, which results in weak-agonistic activity of the peptide presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)II (refs 7, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To efficiently induce insulin-specific Foxp3+Tregs that could interfere with the development of T1D in NOD mice, we devised a strongly agonistic mimetope of the natural insulin-B-chain-epitope (21E-22E) with improved MHCII-binding7 and showed that its sub-immunogenic delivery promoted efficient Foxp3+Treg induction and T1D protection for 40 weeks and longer17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, crystal structures of the human T1D susceptibility HLA-DQ8 allele and the homologous molecule in NOD mice, I-Ag7, reveal striking structural overlap between the MHC-peptide binding pockets29, which suggests similar peptide presentation events of insulin-epitopes in human T1D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, a recent study provides evidence that insulin B:9-23-reactive CD4+T cells are present in the peripheral blood of T1D patients and that the immunogenic register of this peptide has low-affinity binding to HLA-DQ8 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, T1D risk may be related to how an HLA-DQ genotype determines the balance of T-cell inflammatory versus regulatory responses to insulin, having implications for insulin-specific therapies to prevent T1D (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Currently, the majority of strategies approved by the FDA for autoimmune diseases have focused on non-antigen-specific immune suppression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this was found to be partially effective in inhibiting autoreactivity, these compounds have numerous side effects and long-term treatment remains challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strategies that promote autoantigen-specific Treg induction will permit the specific blockade of the deleterious effects of autoimmune destruction while maintaining the ability of the immune system to clear non-autoantigens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While promising results have been obtained in mice, in man the development of autoantigen-specific Foxp3+Treg induction strategies is still in its infancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is currently unclear whether concepts established for efficient murine in vivo Foxp3+Treg induction will be translatable to the human immune system, especially in the context of autoimmune diseases such as T1D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies are needed that provide mechanistic insights for the in vivo induction of human autoantigen-specific Foxp3+Tregs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an excellent accessible system permitting predictive in vivo immunology research, here we used human haematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-engrafted NOD-Scid-IL2-receptor--chain knockout (NSG)-HLA-DQ8 transgenic mice and newly established autoantigen-specific Treg induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We provide first direct evidence that a set of two novel human insulin mimetopes promotes human Foxp3+Treg induction in human-HSC-engrafted NSG-HLA-DQ8 transgenic mice in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such induced Tregs from humanized mice are stable over prolonged periods of time, present with robust suppressive capacities and harbour high abundance of Treg signature genes such as Foxp3, CTLA4, IL-2R and TIGIT in the absence of effector T-cell responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These T1D vaccine candidates could critically contribute to the development of efficient autoantigen-specific Treg induction strategies for prevention of islet autoimmunity in children at risk of developing T1D.'

'Agonistic activity of insulin mimetopes in CD4+T cells', 'To define optimal conditions for human insulin-specific Foxp3+Treg induction we tested agonistic activities of four insulin-B-chain-10-23 mimetopes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peptide selections were made first based on the finding that insulin-B:10-23 peptide variants with a mutation of arginine (R) to glutamic acid (E) at position 22 and/or including a change to glycine (G) at position 21 (ins.mim.2=21G-22E; ins.mim.3=21E-22E) were more potent in stimulating murine insulin-specific CD4+T cells7,17,28 and stimulated human insulin-specific CD4+T cells30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of either E or G at position 21 was included based on findings in NOD mice that insulin B:923-specific CD4+T cells can be divided into types A and B T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both recognize the peptide bound to IAg7 in register 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, type A T cells prefer the glutamic acid at position 21 as TCR-binding residue while type B cells prefer glycine 21 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Second, we set up two novel human insulin mimetopes with mutations at position 22 to glutamic acid (E) together with position 21 being E or G

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Control of autoimmunity through instruction of endogenous regulatory mechanisms is a long envisioned challenging goal of physicians and scientists18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In man, the development of autoantigen-specific tolerance induction strategies is still in its infancy and currently studies are ongoing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial results from clinical trials using natural autoantigens for induction of self-tolerance, for example, natural insulin in T1D showed thus far little benefit45,46,47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, a first primary insulin-specific vaccination dose-finding study in children genetically susceptible to T1D was finished49 where oral insulin application to children genetically at risk but without ongoing islet autoimmunity supported an immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To further advance the translation of these antigen-specific therapies from bench to bedside it will be critical to investigate whether the choice of antigen, the time point and route of administration induced a tolerogenic response and specifically to study the conditions for efficient human Foxp3+Treg induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been suggested that efficacy of tolerance induction may critically depend upon: disease state, antigen dosage, route of administration, the study cohort that is treated and the choice of antigen, for example, insulin versus insulin B chain peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In humans, T1D risk is linked strongly to combinations of the HLA-DR4/DQ8 and DR3/DQ2 haplotypes50 with 90% of T1D patients harbouring DQ8 or DQ2 alleles.
