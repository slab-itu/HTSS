Whole genome sequencing and imputation in isolated populations identify genetic associations with medically-relevant complex traits  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Next-generation association studies can be empowered by sequence-based imputation and by studying founder populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report 9.5 million variants from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of a Cretan-isolated population, and show enrichment of rare and low-frequency variants with predicted functional consequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use a WGS-based imputation approach utilizing 10,422 reference haplotypes to perform genome-wide association analyses and observe 17 genome-wide significant, independent signals, including replicating evidence for association at eight novel low-frequency variant signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two novel cardiometabolic associations are at lead variants unique to the founder population sequences: chr16:70790626 (high-density lipoprotein levels beta 1.71 (SE 0.25), P=1.57 × 1011, effect allele frequency (EAF) 0.006); and rs145556679 (triglycerides levels beta 1.13 (SE 0.17), P=2.53 × 1011, EAF 0.013).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings add empirical support to the contribution of low-frequency variants in complex traits, demonstrate the advantage of including population-specific sequences in imputation panels and exemplify the power gains afforded by population isolates.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for complex medical traits have to date been designed and powered for the discovery of common-frequency variants with small to modest effect sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is becoming increasingly clear that rare and low-frequency variants also play an important role1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Utilizing a large reference panel can greatly improve GWAS imputation accuracy2, capturing a slice of the previously unattainable allelic architecture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isolated populations can additionally help expedite the identification of low-frequency variants affecting complex traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The founding event can lead to an increase in allele frequency due to genetic drift, thereby boosting power for GWAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we use GWAS and exome chip data from the Mylopotamos (MANOLIS) and Pomak villages cohorts as a scaffold (Fig 1), and impute up to a large reference panel of 5,122 individuals, including 249 MANOLIS samples sequenced at 4 × depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the first time WGS data have been generated in this population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examine 13,541,454 and 15,514,754 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) with minor allele count (MAC)2 in the Pomak and MANOLIS cohorts, respectively, and test for association with traits of cardiometabolic relevance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To enable meta-analysis across potentially related individuals, we implement a method that accounts for non-independence across strata and demonstrate its robustness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify eight novel signals for traits of medical relevance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Flowchart of study design.The HELIC cohorts were prephased, imputed and analysed separately by cohort and array, and finally meta-analysed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variant numbers reported here are total regardless of MAF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imputed variants are for chromosomes 122.Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Genetic architecture of Cretan population', 'We generated whole-genome sequence data at 4 × depth in 249 MANOLIS individuals selected on the basis of genome-wide genotype data to maximize haplotype diversity in the population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To characterize the variation landscape in this isolated population, we aggregated the proportion of SNVs captured across the genome (total n=9,554,503 with MAC2) by functional class (Fig 2a and Supplementary Table 1) and found that variant densities are inversely correlated with ascribed functional importance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Highest densities are observed in intergenic regions, while coding and splice regions, where disrupting variants may have more severe consequences, are sparsest, in line with observations in other populations1,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, we also find that variants with more severe consequences are present in a higher proportion at the lower end of the minor allele frequency (MAF) spectrum compared to the genomic average (Supplementary Fig 1 and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Variant sharing and functional annotation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) SNP density per kbp and percentage of

UK10K and 1000 Genomes Project reference panels (Fig 2b and Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most variants unique to MANOLIS were low-frequency and rare, in fact, the rarer a variant was, the more likely it was to be unique to MANOLIS, with 32% of doubletons being unique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore the functionality of these variants, we compared, for each MAF bin, the proportion of unique and shared variants belonging to any given functional consequence in that class, and found that rare variants are more likely to be unique to MANOLIS if they belong to a severe functional class.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we find significant (P less_than 1.00 × 1010) enrichment of rare and low-frequency (MAF5%) coding and regulatory region variants (Fig 3 and Supplementary Table 4), which is expected when comparing shared, older variants with newer, cohort-specific ones which havent yet fully undergone purifying selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also find a significant but modest depletion

METACARPA', 'The MANOLIS (n=1,476) and Pomak (n=1,737) cohorts were each genotyped in two tranches (Fig 1), leading to a requirement for within-cohort meta-analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Existing methods to correct for sample relatedness (which is a distinct possibility when meta-analysing within an isolated population) or overlap are based on Pearsons correlation of the z-scores6, but this can lead to overcorrection in the presence of a large polygenic burden7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, a meta-analysis method that uses tetrachoric correlation7 and combines P with effect-size based methods8 can account for non-independence of samples across strata.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We implemented the method in openly-available new software, METACARPA (https://github.com/wtsi-team144/metacarpa and http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/metacarpa).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using simulation, we show that under typical levels of sample overlap (up to 10%) METACARPA reduces false-positive rate inflation by 8%, while conserving power (Fig 4a-4b, and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We infer a tetrachoric correlation of 1.96% between P values in the two MANOLIS datasets, and a correlation of 1.84% between the two Pomak datasets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those values reflect an average within-cohort, cross-dataset kinship of 0.43 and 0.33%, respectively, as measured by pi-hat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4:

METACARPA to a genotype-level mega-analysis (Fig 4a and b, Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When individual level data are available, a global analysis that takes dataset provenance into account and where overlapping samples are removed maintains the type-I error rate at nominal significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The power of such a global mega-analysis drops markedly as sample overlap increases, although it is more powerful than summary-statistic level meta-analyses when no or little overlap is present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When only summary-level statistics are available, METACARPA provides the advantage of a lower false-positive rate than a naïve meta-analysis under typical levels of overlap (010%), although it does not control type-I error to nominal levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, power is conserved compared to the naïve meta-analysis, and is higher than for a sample-level global analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the tetrachoric estimate of overlap is more robust than Pearson's correlation to an excess of signal in the meta-analysed studies (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ", 'Furthermore, for the HELIC MANOLIS data, we compared the results produced by METACARPA to a mega-analysis of the genotype-level data, as well as a summary-level meta-analysis not accounting for relatedness using the GWAMA software, and found similar median statistics (=0.985±0.015) for

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We provide here a first characterization of the genetic architecture of the MANOLIS isolated population and report 9.5M SNVs, of which 6% are absent from previous sequenced panels and are enriched for predicted functional consequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our complex trait association findings highlight the advantages of whole genome sequencing in founder populations: two lipid traits and the HGB signals we identify are driven by variants unique to the MANOLIS cohort or extremely rare in other worldwide populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining five novel associations are present in European populations (1000 Genomes Project EUR MAF ranging from 0.014 to 0.096) but are not significantly associated in GWAS meta-analyses of cosmopolitan populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be due to a number of reasons in addition to winners curse, that is, larger effect sizes in the discovery isolate cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For two of these signals, the variant and its proxies are not present in the HapMap reference panel and therefore these variants are not represented in GWAS conducted to date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three of the associated variants are represented in HapMap and show no evidence of association outside the isolate; this can indicate that the index variant is in LD with the causal variant in the isolate but not in the cosmopolitan population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the effect and therefore the power to detect associations can be increased in isolates due to the environmental and phenotypic homogeneity when compared to other worldwide populations, in addition to extended LD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our study demonstrates the power benefits of using a large, sequence-based imputation reference panel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six of the eight new associations reported here have been detected for the first time as a consequence of improved imputation accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cost-effective hybrid WGS and imputation approach in founder populations serves as a good model for further low-frequency variant discovery, which can enhance our understanding of the biological processes underpinning complex traits of medical relevance.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
