Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'There is enormous potential in combining the capabilities of the biological and the solid state to create hybrid engineered systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While there have been recent efforts to harness power from naturally occurring potentials in living systems in plants and animals to power complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor integrated circuits, here we report the first successful effort to isolate the energetics of an electrogenic ion pump in an engineered in vitro environment to power such an artificial system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An integrated circuit is powered by adenosine triphosphate through the action of Na+/K+ adenosine triphosphatases in an integrated in vitro lipid bilayer membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ion pumps (active in the membrane at numbers exceeding 2 × 106 mm2) are able to sustain a short-circuit current of 32.6 pA mm2 and an open-circuit voltage of 78 mV, providing for a maximum power transfer of 1.27 pW mm2 from a single bilayer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two series-stacked bilayers provide a voltage sufficient to operate an integrated circuit with a conversion efficiency of chemical to electrical energy of 14.9%.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The energetics of living systems are based on electrochemical membrane potentials that are present in cell plasma membranes, the inner membrane of mitochondria, or the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the latter two cases, the specific membrane potential is known as the proton-motive force and is used by proton adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthases to produce ATP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the former case, Na+/K+-ATPases hydrolyse ATP to maintain the resting potential in most cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While there have been recent efforts to harness power from some naturally occurring potentials in living systems that are the result of ion pump action both in plants2 and animals3,4 to power complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuits (ICs), this work is the first successful effort to isolate the energetics of an electrogenic ion pump in an engineered in vitro environment to power such an artificial system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior efforts to harness power from in vitro membrane systems incorporating ion-pumping ATPases5,6,7,8,9 and light-activated bacteriorhodopsin9,10,11 have been limited by difficulty in incorporating these proteins in sufficient quantity to attain measurable current and in achieving sufficiently large membrane resistances to harness these currents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both problems are solved in this effort to power an IC from ATP in an in vitro environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting measurements provide new insight into a generalized circuit model, which allows us to determine the conditions to maximize the efficiency of harnessing chemical energy through the action of electrogenic ion pumps.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'ATP-powered IC', 'Figure 1a shows the complete hybrid integrated system, consisting of a CMOS IC packaged with an ATP-harvesting biocell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biocell consists of two series-stacked ATPase bearing suspended lipid bilayers with a fluid chamber directly on top of the IC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Series stacking of two membranes is necessary to provide the required start-up voltage for IC and eliminates the need for an external energy source, which is typically required to start circuits from low-voltage supplies2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1c, a matching network in the form of a switched capacitor allows the load resistance of the IC to be matched to that presented by the biocell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In principle, the switch S can be implicit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biocell charges CSTOR until the self start-up voltage, Vstart, is reached.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chip then operates until the biocell voltage drops below the minimum supply voltage for operation, Vmin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Active current draw from the IC stops at this point, allowing the charge to build up again on CSTOR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our case, however, the IC leakage current exceeds 13.5 nA at Vstart, more than can be provided by the biocell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, an explicit transistor switch and comparator (outside of the IC) are used for this function in the experimental results presented here, which are not powered by the biocell and not included in energy efficiency calculations (see Supplementary Discussion for additional details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The energy from the biocell is used to operate a voltage converter (voltage doubler) and some simple inverter-based ring oscillators in the IC, which receive power from no other sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Fully hybrid biologicalsolid-state system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Illustration depicting biocell attached to CMOS integrated circuit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Illustration of membrane in pore containing sodiumpotassium pumps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Circuit model of equivalent stacked membranes, =2.1 pA, =98.6 G, =575 G and =75 pF, Ag/AgCl electrode equivalent resistance RWE+RCE less_than 20 k, energy-harvesting capacitor CSTOR=100 nF combined with switch as an impedance transformation network (only one switch necessary due to small duty cycle), and CMOS IC voltage doubler and resistor representing digital switching load.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RL represents the four independent ring oscillator loads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Equivalent circuit detail of stacked biocell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Switched-capacitor voltage doubler circuit schematic.Full size image', 'A silver/silver-chloride (Ag/AgCl) microfabricated thin film on the surface of the chip, and an Ag/AgCl pellet serve as the working (WE) and counter (CE) electrode to convert ions to electrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Careful attention must be paid to the electrodes in this power-transfer application to ensure that the electrodes are not an uncontrolled galvanic energy source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lipid (purified 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, DOPC) bilayers are formed in a 250-m pore12 epoxied to a teflon housing (see Methods for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purified 5-sodium potassium adenosine triphosphatase from porcine cerebral cortex is embedded into each bilayer (see Methods for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior to the addition of ATP, the membrane produces no electrical power and has an Rm of 280 G.

(The load impedance, RL, of the ring oscillators alone is 305 k.) This mismatch in source and load impedance is manifest in large differences in power densities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, integrated circuits, even when operated at the point of minimum energy in subthreshold, consume on the order of 102 W mm2 (or assuming a typical silicon chip thickness of 250 m, 4 × 102 W mm3) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typical cells, in contrast, consume on the order of 4 × 106 W mm3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our case, a typical active power dissipation for our circuit is 92.3 nW, and the active average harvesting power is 71.4 fW for the biocell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discrepancy is managed through duty-cycled operation of the IC in which the circuit is largely disabled for long periods of time (Tcharge), integrating up the power onto a storage capacitor (CSTOR), which is then expended in a very brief period of activity (Trun), as shown in Fig 3a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Complete hybrid biologicalsolid-state system characterization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Duty-cycled operation of the stacked biocell and CMOS IC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shown are the input (Vm) and output (Vout) voltage of the voltage doubler.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tcharge=6250, s, Trun=5.5 ms.
