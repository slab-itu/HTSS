SiRHoechst is a far-red DNA stain for live-cell nanoscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cell-permeable DNA stains are popular markers in live-cell imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently used DNA stains for live-cell imaging are either toxic, require illumination with blue light or are not compatible with super-resolution microscopy, thereby limiting their utility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe a far-red DNA stain, SiRHoechst, which displays minimal toxicity, is applicable in different cell types and tissues, and is compatible with super-resolution microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of these properties makes this probe a powerful tool for live-cell imaging.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Many live-cell imaging applications rely on DNA stains as intracellular reference markers, to identify and track individual cells based on the nucleus or to visualize processes such as mitosis1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ideal DNA stain for live-cell imaging would (i) show high selectivity, (ii) show minimal toxicity, (iii) be fluorogenic for wash-free imaging, (iv) be applicable in different cell types and tissues, (v) be excited by far-red light and (vi) be suitable for super-resolution microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To the best of our knowledge, a stain that fulfils all these requirements has not been described yet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the popular DNA minor groove-binder Hoechst 33342 is non-toxic when used at low concentrations but requires cell-damaging blue light illumination2 and is not compatible with super-resolution microscopy techniques such as stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the anthraquinone-based intercalator DRAQ5 is a far-red DNA stain but is toxic at the concentrations used for live-cell microscopy3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We previously demonstrated how the attachment of carboxylated siliconrhodamine (SiR) derivatives to appropriate targeting ligands permits the generation of far-red probes for live-cell (super-resolution) microscopy of cellular proteins4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the bisbenzimide core of Hoechst 33342 has recently been exploited as a DNA-targeting ligand for green dyes6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Building on these findings we introduce here a bisbenzimideSiR conjugate, SiRHoechst, and demonstrate its utility as DNA stain for live-cell (super-resolution) microscopy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The coupling of the bisbenzimide core of Hoechst 33342 to carboxylated siliconrhodamine yielded a new DNA stain, which is ideally suited for live-cell imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The far-red excitation and emission spectra of the probe minimize phototoxic effects and enable its use in combination with popular red- and green-emitting fluorescent protein tags9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SiRHoechst has higher nuclear-staining specificity in live cells than the popular far-red DNA stains SYTO 61, Vybrant DyeCycle Ruby and DRAQ5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, SiRHoechst was the only far-red DNA dye that we were able to image with high signal-to-noise ratio and undetectable toxicity on a confocal laser scanning microscope over extended periods of time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SiRHoechst is compatible with STED microscopy at the standard 775 nm wavelength, providing exciting opportunities to investigate how the 3D folding of DNA relates to the organization of core histones in intact nuclei10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our work furthermore underlines the utility of carboxylated SiR for the generation of far-red, fluorogenic probes for live-cell imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior work demonstrated that coupling SiR to ligands that specifically bind to proteins or insert in membranes can generate powerful fluorogenic probes for live-cell imaging11,12,13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate that DNA-binding ligands such as the bisbenzimides can also be employed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data make a strong case for carboxylated SiR as first choice when coupling ligands to fluorophores for the generation of fluorescent probes for live-cell imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, the favourable spectroscopic properties, excellent biocompatibility and applicability to STED microscopy make SiRHoechst a powerful tool for the imaging of DNA in living cells and tissues.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
