Increased activity in frontal motor cortex compensates impaired speech perception in older adults  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Understanding speech in noisy environments is challenging, especially for seniors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although evidence suggests that older adults increasingly recruit prefrontal cortices to offset reduced periphery and central auditory processing, the brain mechanisms underlying such compensation remain elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that relative to young adults, older adults show higher activation of frontal speech motor areas as measured by functional MRI during a syllable identification task at varying signal-to-noise ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increased activity correlates with improved speech discrimination performance in older adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multivoxel pattern classification reveals that despite an overall phoneme dedifferentiation, older adults show greater specificity of phoneme representations in frontal articulatory regions than auditory regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, older adults with stronger frontal activity have higher phoneme specificity in frontal and auditory regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, preserved phoneme specificity and upregulation of activity in speech motor regions provide a means of compensation in older adults for decoding impoverished speech representations in adverse listening conditions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Perception and comprehension of spoken languagewhich involve mapping of acoustic signals with complex and dynamic structure to lexical representations (sound to meaning)deteriorate with age1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Age-related decline in speech perception is further exacerbated in noisy environments, for example, when there is background noise or when several people are talking at once3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior neuroimaging research has revealed increased activity in prefrontal regions associated with cognitive control, attention and working memory when older adults processed speech under challenging circumstances5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These increased activations are thought to reflect a compensatory strategy of aging brains in recruiting more general cognitive areas to counteract declines in sensory processing9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a more precise accounting of the neural mechanism of such an age-related compensatory functional reorganization during speech perception in adverse listening conditions is lacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'According to sensorimotor integration theories of speech perception11,12,13, predictions from the frontal articulatory network (that is, speech motor system), including Brocas area in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and ventral premotor cortex (PMv), provide phonological constraints to auditory representations in sensorimotor interface areas, for example, the Spt (Sylvian-parietal-temporal) in the posterior planum temporale (PT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This kind of sensorimotor integration is thought to facilitate speech perception, especially in adverse listening environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in young adults, we found greater specificity of phoneme representations, as measured by multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA), in left PMv and Brocas area than in bilateral auditory cortices during syllable identification with high background noise14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggests that phoneme specificity in frontal articulatory regions may provide a means to compensate for impoverished auditory representations through top-down sensorimotor integration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, whether older adults show preserved sensorimotor integration, and by which means they can benefit from it in understanding speech, particularly under noise-masking, has never been explicitly investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the current study, we measured blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) brain activity while 16 young and 16 older adults identified naturally produced English phoneme tokens (/ba/, /ma/, /da/ and /ta/) either alone or embedded in broadband noise at multiple signal-to-noise ratios (SNR, 12, 9, 6, 2 and 8 dB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that older adults show stronger activity in frontal speech motor regions than young adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These increased activations coincide with age-equivalent performance and positively correlate with performance in older adults, suggesting that the age-related upregulations are compensatory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also assessed how well speech representations could be decoded in older brains using MVPA, which can detect fine-scale spatial patterns instead of mean levels of neural activity elicited by different phonemes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Older adults show less distinctive phoneme representations, known as neural dedifferentiation15,16,17,18,19, compared with young adults in speech-relevant regions, but the phoneme specificity in frontal articulatory regions is more tolerant to the degradative effects of both aging and noise than auditory cortices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, older adults show a preserved sensorimotor integration function but deploy sensorimotor compensation at lower task demands (that is, lower noise) than young adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further probe the nature of age-related frontal upregulation in terms of its relationship with phoneme representations in speech-relevant regions, we tested whether under noise-masking activity in frontal articulatory regions would correlate with phoneme specificity in frontal and auditory regions in older adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that older adults with stronger frontal activity have higher phoneme specificity, which indicates that frontal speech motor upregulation specifically improves phoneme representations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide neural evidence that in older adults increased recruitment of frontal speech motor regions along with maintained specificity of speech motor representations compensate for declined auditory representations of speech in noisy listening circumstances.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The present study revealed increased activity in speech motor regions of older adults compared with young adults, which remained after controlling for the age difference in performing syllable identification in noise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, under noise masking the positive correlation between activity in speech motor regions and behavioural accuracy in older adults is consistent with a compensatory frontal upregulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using MVPA, we found greater phoneme specificity in frontal articulatory regions than in auditory areas despite a general dedifferentiation of phoneme representations in older adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the sensorimotor integration function, reflected in greater phoneme specificity in frontal motor than auditory regions, was shifted towards lower task demands in older adults compared with young adults, suggesting that older adults relied to a greater extent on speech motor compensation during speech in noise perception relative to younger counterparts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the lower phoneme specificity in auditory compared with frontal regions at medium-to-no noise conditions in both groups was not due to reductions in BOLD activity in auditory regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the reduced phoneme specificity in older compared with young adults in both frontal and auditory regions cannot be accounted for by decreased BOLD activation in older adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under noise masking increasing activity in left POp correlated with higher phoneme specificity in this region and in the sensorimotor interface in left PT in older adults, which functionally linked frontal speech motor upregulation with disambiguation of phonological representations via sensorimotor integration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these findings provide neuroimaging evidence for a preserved sensorimotor integration function during perception of speech in noise in seniors, and for the first time, integrate the decline-compensation hypothesis9,10 with age-related dedifferentiation24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, older adults enhanced frontal speech motor recruitment to compensate for auditory dedifferentiation during speech comprehension in noisy environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In older adults the pure-tone threshold correlated with overall accuracy in syllable identification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, a reduction in peripheral hearing acuity partly contributed to impaired performance for older adults in the current study, although it alone cannot adequately account for speech in noise perception deficits3,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous findings that showed age-related upregulation of activity in various cognitive tasks26 and speech perception in particular5,6,7,8, we found increased activities in multiple temporal, frontal and parietal regions in older relative to young adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, upregulation of left POp of Brocas area and motor/premotor regions in preCG accompanied age-equivalent performance, and the activity in those regions positively correlated with older adults ability to correctly identify speech in noise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results fit with the compensatory account9,10,27 that the additional activity in speech motor regions presented a beneficial function in supporting task performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with previous studies in young adults that frontal articulatory regions were activated in perceiving speech even without any overt speech production task14,28,29,30, increased recruitment of speech motor regions in older adults could reflect elevated motoric feedback modulation on speech perception in counteracting deficient auditory processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frontal speech motor upregulation may result from adaptive changes in resource allocation and/or coping strategy from data-driven sensory processing towards experience/knowledge-based top-down predictions from articulatory gestures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Aging is associated with dedifferentiated neural processes in sensory, memory and motor systems15,16,17,18,19 and a reduction in the distinctiveness of neural representations may serve as a common cause for general cognitive disruptions24,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we revealed an age-related dedifferentiation of phoneme representations in the cortical hierarchy of speech processing, reflected as reduced number of regions showing significant phoneme classification when there was no noise and comparable classification pattern at the NoNoise condition in older adults and at 8 dB SNR in young adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dedifferentiation in older listeners may be due to age-related declines in peripheral hearing1, deficits in phase-locking and timing in brainstem31,32, changes in cortical anatomy33,34, as well as reductions in functional connectivity6,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduced phoneme specificity in speech-relevant regions may partially account for the difficulty in fine discrimination of syllables in the elderly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when there was noise, phoneme classification performance only in left POp, not in auditory cortices, correlated with syllable identification accuracy in older adults, reflecting the impact of articulatory predictions in driving categorical decisions in adverse listening conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Intriguingly, the age-related phoneme dedifferentiation was not evenly distributed in speech-relevant regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phoneme specificity was better preserved in frontal articulatory regions than auditory areas in older adults, both in the NoNoise and slightly noisy conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the left POp showed better phoneme classification than auditory areas at medium (6 to 8 dB SNRs) but not lower or higher noise levels in young adults, indicating a convex pattern of sensorimotor mapping as a function of task difficulty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison, older adults exhibited stronger phoneme classification in left POp than in auditory regions only when noise was weak or absent (SNR8 dB), leading to a preserved sensorimotor integration function which, however, was shifted to easier task levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stronger reliance on sensorimotor compensation by older listeners was also suggested by elevated left POp activity irrespective of task difficulty, in contrast to a SNR-dependent increase of left POp activity in young adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The persistent upregulation with reduced dynamic responding range in speech motor regions along with the shifted sensorimotor integration function in older listeners are consistent with the compensation-related utilization of neural circuits hypothesis (CRUNCH35), such that older adults recruited sensorimotor integration at lower levels of task load than young adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'However, we do not know yet whether frontal speech motor activity still affects older adults performance when SNR falls below a certain level (for example, 2 dB here or even lower when scanner noise is absent).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It would be important for future work to investigate the effects of deactivation of frontal articulatory regions via transcranial magnetic stimulation or other approaches on the speech in noise identification performance at various SNRs in older adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the constant scanner noise in the background might increase the cognitive load, especially in older adults, and affect the brain activity patterns in general.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that higher phoneme specificity would be observed and older adults may show less need of speech motor compensation in quiet environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Note that neither the lower phoneme specificity in auditory relative to frontal articulatory regions in both groups, nor the decreased phoneme specificity in older compared with young adults in both frontal and auditory regions, was due to decreased hemodynamic responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, stronger BOLD activity was found in auditory than frontal regions regardless of age, and activity was stronger in older relative to young adults in both auditory and frontal regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that reduced phoneme distinctiveness in older adults and in auditory regions may be the result of noisy phonological representations associated with elevated activity strength, possibly caused by neural inefficiency, but less clear, consistent and differential patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differential robustness of phoneme representations in frontal versus auditory regions to the effects of aging and noise masking may also arise from the hierarchical organization of speech processing from data-driven sensory processing in auditory cortices to schema-driven linguistic and decision processes in frontal motor regions11,13,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Since categorical speech perception requires listeners to maintain sub-lexical representations in an active state as a meta-linguistic judgment is made, increased activity in left IFG of older adults may reflect effort-related changes in attention7,8, verbal working memory8,37, cognitive control5 or categorical judgment and response selection29,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the correlations among increased left POp activity, better phoneme classification in that region and in left PT, and improved performance in older adults under noise masking directly link frontal speech motor upregulation with a specific compensatory mechanism in enhancing the specificity of speech representations, which in turn facilitated speech in noise identification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The positive correlation between left POps activity and phoneme specificity in left PT suggests that neural dedifferentiation in auditory regions may be a target of frontal compensation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, increased activity in frontal speech motor regions in older adults may counteract the lack of phoneme discrimination in auditory cortex, likely through top-down sensorimotor mapping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we revealed an age-related increase of activity in speech motor regions that compensated for performance and dedifferentiated phoneme representations during speech in noise perception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were able to show a link between compensatory frontal upregulation and neural dedifferentiation associated with aging in a sensorimotor integration framework.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relation between preserved phoneme specificity and the upregulation in frontal articulatory regions in seniors provides evidence that sensorimotor integration serves as a source/mechanism of compensation for speech perception in challenging listening conditions, which significantly advances our understanding of the age-related increase of frontal activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recruitment of the frontal speech motor system in understanding speech interacted with cognitive demands and age; seniors called on sensorimotor integration at easier task conditions than their younger counterparts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings also suggest that phoneme dedifferentiation may be a neural correlate for difficulty with speech in noise perception, and the binding of bottom-up sensory processing with top-down articulatory predictions substantially impacts speech recognition performance in the elderly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the preserved sensorimotor integration function in seniors suggests avenues for rehabilitative and training regimens for better communication later in life.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

high-dimensional classification problems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate classifier performance, we used five-fold cross-validation where each fold of data consisted of the -regression weights of four of the five runs, with one run held out for testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shrinkage discriminant classifier produces both a categorical prediction (that is, the label of the test case) as well as a continuous probabilistic output (the posterior probability that the test case is of label x).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The continuous outputs were used to compute the AUC metrics, and the AUC scores were used as an index of classification performance because they are robust to class imbalances and are better able to incorporate the relationship between probabilistic classifier output and discrete category membership.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the experiment had four phoneme categories, we used a multiclass AUC measure that was computed as the average of all the pairwise two-class AUC scores.

not be optimal to disentangle speech- and response-related activities in articulatory and hand areas of left premotor/motor cortex, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the classifiers were trained
