Equilibrium oxygen storage capacity of ultrathin CeO2- depends non-monotonically on large biaxial strain  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Elastic strain is being increasingly employed to enhance the catalytic properties of mixed ionelectron conducting oxides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, its effect on oxygen storage capacity is not well established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we fabricate ultrathin, coherently strained films of CeO2- between 5.6% biaxial compression and 2.1% tension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In situ ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals up to a fourfold enhancement in equilibrium oxygen storage capacity under both compression and tension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This non-monotonic variation with strain departs from the conventional wisdom based on a chemical expansion dominated behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through depth profiling, film thickness variations and a coupled photoemissionthermodynamic analysis of space-charge effects, we show that the enhanced reducibility is not dominated by interfacial effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of ab initio calculations of oxygen vacancy formation incorporating defect interactions and vibrational contributions, we suggest that the non-monotonicity arises from the tetragonal distortion under large biaxial strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results may guide the rational engineering of multilayer and coreshell oxide nanomaterials.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The tunable oxygen nonstoichiometry of mixed ionic and electronic conducting (MIEC) oxides underlies their application in solid oxide fuel cell electrodes1, heterogeneous catalysis2, solar fuel generation through thermochemical cycles3 and resistive switching-based memory devices4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It governs the concentration of mobile oxygen vacancies and electronic defects that mediate oxygen exchange at the oxide/gas interface, store oxygen at the surface and in the bulk and facilitate transport5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oxygen nonstoichiometry can be tuned intrinsically through temperature and oxygen partial pressure, and extrinsically through composition, nanostructuring and lattice strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent advances in achieving atomic-level control in thin-film growth techniques, the inherent layered architecture of solid-state devices and their rapid downsizing have rendered lattice strain an attractive and dopant-free alternative to enhance a wide array of properties of existing materials6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strain-induced modifications to the crystal symmetry of multilayered thin films and coreshell nanomaterials have led to dramatic enhancements in carrier mobilities of semiconductors7, superconducting transition temperatures8,9 and ferroic properties of layered oxides10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In MIEC oxides, strain has an additional impact on the material properties through its coupling with oxygen chemical potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of oxygen vacancies is associated with an expansion of the lattice due to electron localization on the neighbouring cations, commonly known as chemical expansion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, control of lattice volume through strain provides a means to tune the defect chemical properties of MIEC oxides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerous studies have investigated the effect of strain on the surface reactivity using substrate-supported films12,13,14,15 and on ionic transport using multilayered heterostructures16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the latter, a wide variation in the results is often observed depending on the volume fraction of the strained phases and the geometry of electrical contacts, among other parameters20,21,22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is generally recognized that compressive strain increases the migration barrier for oxygen ion transport and surface exchange, while tensile strain has the opposite effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis of a monotonic dependence of reaction barriers on strain has been corroborated by computational studies25,26,27, and is believed to extend to oxygen vacancy formation energetics as well28,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a trend is consistent with a chemical expansion-dominated behaviour31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, strain also affects the ligand field and distorts local bonding which can influence the vacancy formation and migration significantly32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet another important consideration for MIECs with large point defect concentrations is the chemical strain effect that describes the alleviation of elastic strain energy through defect association and formation of concentration gradients33,34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Gd-doped ceria, for instance, defect association lowers the apparent elastic modulus by over an order of magnitude to accommodate large stresses34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decoupling the multiple effects of strain necessitates well-defined model systems and precise fabrication control, as elegantly pointed out by Yildiz36 and Wen et al.37 in recent reviews.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An important metric of catalytic activity of MIEC oxides is the surface redox capacity, that is, the extent of change in oxygen nonstoichiometry with oxygen chemical potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes to the surface chemistry and its ability to buffer oxygen can have dramatic implications for both the thermodynamics and kinetics of oxygen insertion reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To establish a definitive relationship between strain and a functional property, it is desirable to have the oxide film uniformly strained over a wide range of values, both compressive and tensile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is challenging, because biaxially strained films undergo strain relaxation beyond a critical film thickness, rendering the strain fields inhomogeneous38, or undergo a polymorphic transition due to large local strains39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, in a recent study using electron energy-loss spectroscopy to probe the incoherent CeO2-/YSZ interface, Song et al.38 found that the Ce atoms are reduced to the 3+ oxidation state near the misfit dislocation, regardless of the sign of the strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Sun et al.30 used atomistic simulations and arrived at an opposite prediction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Donner et al.40 showed that strained La0.5Sr0.5CoO3 thin films undergo cation ordering (unlike the bulk oxide), facilitated by lower oxygen vacancy formation energy and enhanced cation mobility under biaxial strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another recent ex situ study of strained SrCoO3- observed an increase in oxygen nonstoichiometry with tensile strain41, though the non-equilibrium nature of the experiment convolutes the kinetics and thermodynamics of oxygen vacancy formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As can be seen, the difficulty of isolating strain effect from that of the buried interface and misfit dislocations, and the lack of in situ measurements, have precluded a clear connection between biaxial strain and oxygen storage capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we quantify the effect of large biaxial strain on the surface redox capacity of CeO2-, a prototypical MIEC with wide-ranging applications in chemical catalysis and electrocatalysis2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ceria shows exceptional oxygen nonstoichiometry and phase stability in its bulk form over a range of reducing conditions and elevated temperatures, making it an ideal model system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to the immense lattice mismatch between ceria and YSZ (5.6%), a coherent interface between the two has been regarded as impossible to stabilize.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, equilibrium theory predicts a critical thickness of 0.8 nm ( less_than 2 unit cells, see Supplementary Note 1)42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We successfully fabricate ultrathin cerium oxide films under biaxial compression on atomically flat, single-crystalline (001) YSZ43, and under biaxial tension on (001) STO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using in situ ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS), we directly quantify the surface Ce3+ and oxygen vacancy concentrations of the strained ceria films under conditions relevant to solid oxide fuel cells and catalysis, and compare them with those of fully relaxed films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, both compressive and tensile strained films showed a significant enhancement in the Ce3+ and oxygen vacancy concentrations near the surface compared with the unstrained films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using depth profiled APXPS and by varying the thickness of strained films, we show that the buried interface does not contribute significantly to the observed strain effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of coherently strained films (5.6% and 2.1%) and measuring oxygen nonstoichiometry in chemical equilibrium with the gas phase capture the true effect of strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reproducible, non-monotonic behaviour goes against the conventional wisdom that defect chemical properties vary monotonically with lattice strain and opens up new means to engineer enhanced redox capacity in multilayer structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By combining APXPS, coupled photoemissionspace-charge analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate a systematic framework for understanding and isolating the various thermodynamic contributions (apart from strain) to defect formation at the surface.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Characterization of strain and interface structure', 'Three sets of CeO2- films were studied: (1) 3.2 nm thick, compressively strained on (001) YSZ, (2) 350 nm thick, unstrained on (001) YSZ and (3) 3.0 nm thick, tensile strained on (001) STO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strain state of the ceria films was quantified using X-ray reciprocal space mapping (RSM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For CeO2-/YSZ, Fig 1a shows the RSM about the off-specular (113) reflection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sharp, intense feature centred at (113) is that of the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The faint (113) ceria reflection immediately below the substrate reflection indicates that its in-plane lattice constant is matched to that of YSZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the absence of any intensity at approximately (0.95 0.95 2.85) corresponding to relaxed ceria (Fig 1b), and diffuse features in between, we conclude that the film is coherently strained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For CeO2-/STO, RSM was performed about the STO (103) and ceria (113) reflections, because of the 45° in-plane rotation for registry alignment (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As evident in Fig 1c, the in-plane reciprocal lattice vectors of the film and substrate are once again matched, and the relaxed ceria feature expected at (2.15 2.15 1.02) is absent, confirming that ceria is coherently strained on STO as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: -ray reciprocal space

and hence no interfacial misfit dislocations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was confirmed at 10 different locations along the interfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in contrast with a recent theoretical calculation39, no secondary crystallographic phase was visible in HR-TEM images between the ultrathin ceria film and the substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: HR-TEM characterization of the

the substrate) was used (Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is equivalent to the diffraction pattern from the periodic images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Much lower beam divergence is possible with this method than in direct nanoscale electron diffraction patterns from the specimen in the TEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For CeO2-/YSZ, the line-cut of the FFT along 010 (in-plane direction, blue curve) shows singlet diffraction spots with a d-spacing of 2.55 Å (that is, 1/2 unit cell YSZ), confirming that the substrate and film have identical in-plane lattice parameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the line-cut along 001 (cross-plane direction, red curve), we observe doublets with d-spacings of 2.55 Å (1/2 unit cell YSZ) and 2.82 Å (1/2 unit cell ceria).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these data and equilibrium lattice constants, the in-plane compression and the cross-plane Poisson tension for the ceria films grown on YSZ were calculated to be 5.6% and 4.2%, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This corresponds to a volume decrease of 7.1% from that of the relaxed structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 3.2 nm thin-film thickness is significantly greater than the expected critical thickness of 0.8 nm predicted by equilibrium theory (see Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that the large nucleation barrier for misfit dislocations stabilizes the coherent film43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The FFT of the HR-TEM image of CeO2-/STO is shown in Fig 2d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The (00l) peaks of CeO2- and STO are clearly separated in the diffraction pattern, and the difference in d-spacing is verified using a cross-plane line cut (red curve).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along the in-plane direction (blue curve), the hh0 of ceria align with the 2h00 reflections of STO, confirming that the film is lattice matched with the substrate in-plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The in-plane tension and the corresponding cross-plane Poisson compression are calculated to be 2.1% and 1.3%, respectively, implying a volume increase of 2.9% over the unstrained structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table 1 summarizes the strain state of the ultrathin and relaxed films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnitude of in-plane and cross-plane elastic strains, ranging from 5.6 to 4.2%, is exceptional.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The residual strain due to differential thermal expansion is expected to be 0.1%, given the films growth temperature at 550 °C in 0.5 mTorr O2, since the coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch between bulk ceria and YSZ is only 2 × 106 K1 (refs 44, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the measured room temperature strain state is expected to be accurate at the APXPS measurement conditions as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Summary of crystallographic information obtained from TEM and X-ray diffraction.Full size table', 'The surface topography of the strained films was examined by atomic force microscopy before and after APXPS measurements (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both films, an atomically flat terrace-and-step structure is

terraces shows that they retain their single termination, within the detection limit of atomic force microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The topography was almost identical even after sustained exposure to reducing atmospheres (H2/H2O) and temperatures up to 550 °C, suggesting that strain relief through surface roughening was not significant during the course of the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

by electron redistribution to render the system charge neutral (formation of Schottky pairs is unlikely under our experimental conditions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the formation of an oxygen vacancy is accompanied by electron localization in the unoccupied 4f orbitals of two Ce4+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using KrogerVink notation, the point defect reaction is given by:', '', 'where the species,

corresponding X-ray photoelectron spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking a range of electron and oxygen vacancy segregation energies between 0 and 1.5 eV as the driving force for SC formation, we mapped out the resulting electrostatic potential in the SC region and in the core, and the concentration profiles (Supplementary Figs 6 and 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We simulate the Vo/CeCe probed by XPS (Fig 3d), which shows an experimental value of 0.30±0.02, in slight excess of the expected 0.25 in the electroneutral limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, the Vo/CeCe ratio is close to 0.30±0.02 irrespective of the biaxial strain state of the oxide films, and the XPS probing depth (0.6 versus 1.2 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the simulations, this experimental result corresponds to a negligible space-charge potential (0) of  less_than  0.1 eV (in the limit that XPS only probes the SC core) or a 0 of 0.2 eV and SC width of 0.2 nm (in the limit that XPS only probes the SC region/bulk).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this comparison, we conclude that (1) if the XPS probes the SC region, it is likely too thin to contribute significantly to the observed strain effects, and that the observed behaviour correspond primarily to defects in the bulk (Fig 5c); (2) or, if XPS probes mostly the surface core, the experimental Vo/CeCe ratio suggests a very weak 0 (Fig 5d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the fact that the experimental Vo/CeCe ratio does not depend on misfit strain confirms that SC effect does not explain the unusual strain dependence of the defect concentrations that we observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We note that having thin films with uniform strain that is independent of thickness is key towards understanding the role of the interface on the redox capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we note that ex situ observation of CeO2-/YSZ interface being reduced38 is not inconsistent with our interpretation, which is that biaxial strain interacts with the rest of the

shallower dependence of CeCe on compressive strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To explore the role of tetragonal distortion under large biaxial strain, we performed DFT plus Hubbard U (DFT+U) calculations of oxygen vacancy formation energies (Evac) in the relatively simpler bulk model system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we subject bulk CeO2- to biaxial versus isostatic strain (see Methods for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At each value of biaxial strain, Poisson relaxation and chemical expansion were explicitly accounted for.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnitude of the isostatic strain was chosen to match the optimized cell volume under biaxial strain for the stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric structures, enabling a meaningful comparison between the two.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, 5.0% biaxial compression, after accounting for Poisson relaxation, corresponds to an equal change in volume as 2.2% isostatic compression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 6c illustrates Evac as a function of volume

almost-linear decrease in oxygen vacancy formation energy, in agreement with a recent study on uniaxially strained bulk ceria by Sun et al.30 Under large biaxial strain, on the other hand, the behaviour is asymmetric under compression and tension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the oxygen vacancy formation energy displays a significantly shallower dependence on compression compared with tension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the vacancy formation energies approach an inflection point around a compressive strain of 5% (similar to the coherent CeO2-/YSZ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also computed the vacancy formation energies at the (100) terminated surface of ceria under biaxial strain (see Methods for details of the surface calculations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most stable surface vacancies (of the many distinct positions), summarized in Supplementary Table 3, have lower formation energies relative to the bulk, in agreement with the literature, but the dependence on biaxial strain is similar to that of the bulk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To probe the interplay between biaxial strain and oxygen vacancyvacancy interaction, we computed the formation energy of a second oxygen vacancy in a unit cell of bulk ceria (that is, =0.50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are aware that disordered ceria is likely not stable in its cubic/tetragonal crystal structure at such high oxygen nonstoichiometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, to achieve a large vacancy concentration while keeping the electron localization problem tractable, this calculation remains insightful.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nonlinearity in the dependence of oxygen vacancy formation energies on volume persists under large biaxial strain (Fig 6c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, a weakly non-monotonic behaviour becomes apparent at =0.50 compared with =0.03 under large biaxial compression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DFT+U calculations reveal that for all values of biaxial compressive strain, oxygen vacancy ordering is favoured in the cross-plane direction to minimize vacancyvacancy repulsion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For low values of biaxial tension (up to 2.5%), orienting oxygen vacancies in the cross-plane direction is still favoured, as the chemical expansion due to the significantly larger Ce3+ ions is better accommodated along the unconstrained cross-plane direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For large biaxial tensile strain, there is no apparent preference in vacancy ordering in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, as expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coupling between biaxial strain and vacancy ordering/association can be inferred from Fig 6c; cross-plane ordered vacancies become relatively more favoured under large biaxial compression compared with tension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that defect association, enabled by high vacancy content, could be serving as a strain relaxation mechanism34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Chemical expansion associated with oxygen vacancy formation makes the process vibrationally stabilized in the absence of geometric constraints52,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the effect under biaxial strain, we computed the vibrational entropy and free energy changes with oxygen vacancy formation as a function of temperature under the harmonic approximation at 5, 0 and 5% biaxial strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 6d depicts the vibrational free energy and entropy change per oxygen as a function of biaxial strain at 550 °C (the corresponding harmonic phonon density of states for the three strain states and two stoichiometries are plotted in Supplementary Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in the oxygen vibrational free energy (Fvib) between compressively strained and unstrained ceria, 0.1 eV, is comparable in magnitude to the difference in the enthalpy (Evac), also 0.1 eV; between tensile strained and unstrained ceria, the difference in the Fvib, 0.3 eV, is likewise significant in magnitude compared with the difference in the Evac, 0.6 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in contrast to Evac, Fvib becomes more favourable as lattice constants are decreased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the relative importance of vibrational contribution with increasing temperature, our calculations suggest that this could be another important factor in determining how compression enhances the redox capacity relative to the unstrained ceria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'With these insights, we can now look at the effect of biaxial strain on the redox properties as being multipronged, affecting energetics, vibrations and ordering of oxygen vacancies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under biaxial tension, the larger lattice volume and the lowered crystal symmetry inherently favour reduction of ceria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under biaxial compression, Ce3+ formation is hindered if the strain coupling with volume is the only driving force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the ability of 3+ oxidation state of Ce to better accommodate the tetragonal distortion from biaxial strain and the lowering of vibrational free energy favour the creation of oxygen vacancies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finding that the enhanced reducibility is insensitive to the type of biaxial strain could explain the observation of Song et al.38 about the reduction of Ce in the heterogeneous strain fields surrounding a misfit dislocation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To conclude, we fabricated ultrathin CeO2- films that are coherently strained

relevant for water splitting and hydrogen oxidation reactions revealed a dramatic, fourfold enhancement in the surface redox capacity of the ceria films under both compression and tension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Geometrical considerations and ab initio calculations indicate that biaxial strain affects the redox capacity not only by its coupling with chemical expansion, but also by breaking the cubic symmetry of ceria through tetragonal distortion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This non-monotonic enhancement in the oxygen nonstoichiometry could be useful in applications relying on redox capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decrease in oxygen vacancy formation energy by 0.4 eV observed in this study could lower the operating temperature and/or overpotential of catalysts and electrocatalysts significantly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our insights into the role of strain may guide the rational redox engineering using nanoscale strain fields such as that found near dislocations and in multilayer
