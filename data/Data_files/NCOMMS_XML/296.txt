Experimental evidence for compositional syntax in bird calls  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Human language can express limitless meanings from a finite set of words based on combinatorial rules (i.e., compositional syntax).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although animal vocalizations may be comprised of different basic elements (notes), it remains unknown whether compositional syntax has also evolved in animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the first experimental evidence for compositional syntax in a wild animal species, the Japanese great tit (Parus minor).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tits have over ten different notes in their vocal repertoire and use them either solely or in combination with other notes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments reveal that receivers extract different meanings from ABC (scan for danger) and D notes (approach the caller), and a compound meaning from ABCD combinations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, receivers rarely scan and approach when note ordering is artificially reversed (DABC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, compositional syntax is not unique to human language but may have evolved independently in animals as one of the basic mechanisms of information transmission.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A prominent feature of human language is its combinatorial power, which allows us to generate innumerable expressions from a finite number of vocal elements and meanings1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Language has two hierarchical levels of syntactic structure: one combines otherwise meaningless elements to form meaningful words (phonology) and the other combines different words to form more complex expressions (compositional syntax)4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animal communication systems share many of the basic properties of human language.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, mammals and birds can use specific call types to denote specific predator categories (i.e., referential communication)7,8 and can learn to recognize the meaning of calls given by other individuals9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although combinations of discrete vocal elements have been found in some mammals and birds10, it remains controversial whether the ability to combine elements is linked to the creation of more complex meanings6,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recent field studies have suggested that particular combinations of sounds may be linked to particular meanings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, white-handed gibbons (Hylobates lar) alter the sequence of notes (that is, basic vocal elements) in their vocalizations when informing group members about predatory threats or conspecific intrudors12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, chestnut-crowned babblers (Pomatostomus ruficeps) combine two types of notes into two sequences that have different meanings13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, the sounds that constitute the sequence of notes have no apparent communicative meaning on their own and, therefore, these combinations are considered to be phonological5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the evidence for compositional syntax remains inconclusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Campbells monkeys (Cercopithecus campbelli) can modify alarm calls by adding oo, increasing the generality of the call meaning14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, oo is never used alone and, consequently, it is a suffix rather than a sound with a distinct meaning15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, putty-nosed monkeys (Cercopithecus nictitans) combine discrete alarm calls that denote different predator types to elicit group movements16,17, but call receivers do not extract a compound meaning from the call combination18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it remains unknown whether animals have evolved compositional syntax or whether this is a unique feature of human language6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we provide, to our knowledge, the first unambiguous experimental evidence for compositional syntax in a non-human vocal system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Birds within the family Paridae produce structurally complex vocalizations (chicka or chick-a-dee calls) that are composed out of different note types (for example, A, B, C and D)19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individuals use these calls in a range of contexts, such as to communicate the discovery of food sources20,21, when approaching predators to deter them (i.e., mobbing)22,23,24,25, or to maintain social cohesion with conspecifics26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies suggested that different note types have different functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Carolina chickadees (Poecile carolinensis) incorporate a greater number of D notes when discovering a food source or when mobbing a higher-risk predator, and D-rich calls serve to attract flock members to the callers20,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These birds incorporate more A notes when discovering an aerial predator28 and more C notes when flying29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because of the lack of playback studies testing the function of individual notes and their combinations, it is still uncertain whether these notes function as different meaningful elements and if these combinations yield a corresponding complexity in call meanings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we investigated whether different note types produced by Japanese great tits (P. minor; Paridae) have distinct meanings to receivers when produced separately and, if so, whether receivers extract a compound meaning when both elements are combined (compositional syntax).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tits produce chicka calls when approaching and mobbing predators, and these calls contain a number of unique call types composed of different note types, mainly A, B, C and D notes25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A, B and C notes are typically produced in combination with other note types, resulting in AC, BC or ABC calls (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, D notes are produced as a string of seven to ten notes (hereafter referred to as a D call, Fig 1b) and are also used in non-predatory contexts, such as when a bird visits its nest alone and is recruiting its mate (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In predatory contexts, D notes are often produced in combination with other note types and typically appear at the end of note strings, such as ACD, BCD or ABCD calls (Fig 1c) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, D notes are both produced alone and in combination with other notes, suggesting that they modify the meaning of ABC calls to elicit appropriate mobbing responses to different predator types25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Sound spectrograms of call treatments played to Japanese great tits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) ABC call is composed of single A, B and C notes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) D call is composed of seven to ten D notes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) ABCD call is the combination of ABC and D calls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) DABC call is a reversed combination of ABC and D calls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These calls were digitally edited using Raven Pro 1.3 software.Full size image', 'Figure 2: Usage of D calls in a non-predatory context in Japanese great tits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Effect of the presence of a mate on the production of D calls (n=187 observations, n=40 individuals): tits produced D calls more often when they visited the nest alone than when they did following their mate (generalized linear mixed model: 2=5.00, df=1, P=0.025), after controlling for the nonsignificant influence of sex of the callers (2=1.16, df=1, P=0.281).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Effect of D calls on the recruitment of their mate (n=136 observations, n=34 individuals): tits that produced D calls were more likely to subsequently attract their mates than tits that did not produce D calls (generalized linear mixed model: 2=35.37, df=1, P less_than 0.0001), even after controlling for a significant influence of the responding mates sex (males were more likely to approach D calls given by their partners than were females;

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our results show that Japanese great tits discriminate between different calls containing different note types: they scan the horizon in response to ABC calls, whereas they approach the sound source in response to D calls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that these two calls function as different meaningful units to receivers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ABC calls serve as warning calls that elicit predator-scanning behaviour, whereas D calls serve as recruitment calls that attract conspecifics to the callers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are consistent with previous research showing that A, B and C note combinations are used in response to predators25, whereas D notes on its own are used to recruit conspecifics (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In response to ABCD calls, Japanese great tits both scan the surroundings and approach the sound source, indicating that they extract the meanings of both ABC and D calls from combined ABCD calls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we find no correlation between scanning and approaching behaviours, which enables tits to perform and combine these behaviours flexibly according to the presence and absence of each note unit within calls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, tits reduce horizontal scanning and rarely approach the loudspeaker when the ordering of the two note units is artificially reversed (DABC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the tits perceive ABCD calls as a single meaningful unit but not as two separated meaningful units (ABC and D calls) simply produced in close proximity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As ABC and D notes convey unique meanings and can be used alone25, the combination of these two notes does not meet the criteria of phonology5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, unlike call combinations reported in several non-human primates14,15,16,17,18, the combination of ABC and D calls conveys a compound meaning that originates from both of the note units.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we conclude that the combination of ABC and D calls in the Japanese great tit obeys semantically compositional syntax6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous studies have shown that parids (chickadees and titmice) alter the repetition rate of particular note types (for example, D notes), which elicits different degrees of response in receivers (i.e., graded call system)22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One explanation for why tits produce different responses to combined ABCD calls is that D notes increase the salience of ABC calls (or vice versa), rather than alter their meaning through a syntactic rule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we find no evidence supporting this explanation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Experiment 1, our data show that tits do not alter the intensity of their responses according to the variation in note repetition rate; they scan with similar intensity to both ABC (3 notes) and ABCD calls (1013 notes) and, likewise, approach in response to both D (710 notes) and ABCD calls (1013 notes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, neither ABC nor D calls simply modify the intensity of behavioural responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, using a matched-pairs or balanced design controls for the possibility that any acoustic features other than either note combinations (Experiment 1) or note ordering (Experiment 2) influenced the interpretation of the results (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using a compositional syntax is likely to provide adaptive benefits to Japanese great tits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to many small songbirds, tits face a variety of predatory threats requiring complex behavioural responses30,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have demonstrated that avian antipredator communication is adapted to such complexity: some birds produce different calls for different types of threats (for example, different predator types or behaviours) and receivers respond to the calls with appropriate behaviours30,31,32,33,34,35, leading to positive fitness consequences30,32,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that the first units of great tits combinatorial calls (ABC calls) serve as general warning calls, whereas the last units (D calls) serve as recruitment calls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specific combination of these calls may serve as an adaption to facing predators that require complex behaviours to be effectively detected and monitored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, scanning the surroundings is likely to allow a tit to efficiently detect a flying predator, such as a crow that can approach a nest from all directions31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, predators that only approach the nest from below, such as martens, are likely to be effectively detected and monitored both by approaching the caller and scanning the surroundings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Japanese great tits incorporate a greater number of D notes into other note units, such as ABC, when mobbing martens than when mobbing crows25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that tits have co-opted the signal normally used to recruit other individuals (for example, to coordinate parental feeding visits), to stimulate receivers to perform an appropriate combination of behaviours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition, we suggest that the specific note-ordering rule (ABC calls before D calls) used by Japanese great tits in anti-predator contexts may be an adaptation to the greater importance of effectively and quickly warning conspecifics about the presence of predators before transmitting any additional behavioural cues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As D notes are often produced in non-predator contexts, conspecifics hearing D notes before ABC notes may be slower to produce appropriate anti-predator behaviours, which may be of particular importance when tits are defending their nestlings25,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although we provide evidence for compositional syntax in the combination of ABC and D calls, it is not yet clear how the meaning of ABC calls is generated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility is that A, B and C notes have different meanings and their combination has a compound meaning (i.e., compositional syntax).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these notes may be meaningless as their own, but the combinations make the meaningful units that elicit scanning behaviour in receivers (i.e., phonology).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Support for this idea comes from the observation that tits use A, B and C notes in many different combinations (for example, AB, AC and BC) when mobbing predators25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it might be possible that all these combinations potentially encode the same threat information; however, the difference in note combinations or sequences of different call types may encode additional information, such as individual identity of callers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note combinations are widely documented in other members of the Paridae, but their complexity may differ across species37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further comparative studies may provide insight into the socio-ecological factors38 that drive the evolution of combinatorial signalling such as phonology and compositional syntax.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we provide the first experimental evidence for compositional syntax in a non-human vocal system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the past decades, many key attributes of human language have been reported from animal species: vocal learning9,39, referential communication7,8 and phonology12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results extend these studies and challenge the long-standing view that compositional syntax is unique to human language5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although previous studies on syntactic communication mainly focused on primates12,14,15,16,17,18, our findings highlight that the ability to recognize the combinations of different meaningful units as compositional calls has evolved in birds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Signal combinations can increase the number of meanings that individuals can convey from a limited number of vocal elements and provide the basis for the generation of novel signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Uncovering the cognitive mechanisms and socio-ecological functions of syntactic communication in animal models may provide insights into the evolution of structural complexity of human language.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'General experimental design', 'This study consisted of two playback experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiment 1 was designed to test whether Japanese great tits discriminate between calls with

syntax, tits are expected to show different responses to the two different note units and a compound response to the combined calls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined the response of Japanese great tits to

the recognition of the note-ordering rule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If they perceive the combined calls (ABCD calls) as a single meaningful unit but not as separated and independent calls (ABC and D calls), they are expected to respond differently to the natural (ABCD) and reversed (DABC) sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested the response of tits to playbacks of ABCD and DABC calls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Study population and call recordings', 'Experiments were conducted in a colour-ringed population of Japanese great tits in a mixed deciduousconiferous forest near Karuizawa, Nagano Prefecture, Japan (36°1922N, 138°3237E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all playbacks, we used chicka mobbing calls that were previously recorded from Japanese great tits (ten males and seven females) from the study population in 2009 and 2010 (refs 25, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chicka calls were elicited by exposure to either a taxidermic model of a crow or a marten near the nest boxes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calls were recorded using an LS370 parabolic microphone (Fuji Planning Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) connected to an R-09HR digital audio recorder (sampling rate, 48 kHz; sample size, 16 bits; Roland Corporation, Shizuoka, Japan).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed information on call recordings has been provided elsewhere25,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Playback stimuli', 'Adobe Audition 3.0 software and Raven Pro 1.3 software40 were used to construct the playback stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose four types of notes (A, B, C and D) from recordings of every source individual on the basis of the sound quality (for example, the bird was close to the microphone when it called and the background noise was low).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although A, B and C notes were typically produced as a single note in a call, D notes always occurred as a string of multiple notes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we used a single A, B and C note and a string of seven to ten D notes to construct the playback calls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These four note types were combined into an ABCD call with natural intervals between the notes (50150 ms, measured for each individual of the recording source).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus obtained a total of 21 ABCD calls from the recording files (11 calls from the recordings of 10 males and 10 calls from the recordings of 7 females).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In Experiment 1, we prepared three call treatments (ABC, D and ABCD calls;

Calls were repeated in a sound file at a rate of 30 calls per minute (one call every 2 s, total duration 90 s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This calling rate is within the range of the natural repetition rates

chose 17 different ABCD calls that originated from different individuals (10 male calls and 7 female calls).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DABC calls (n=17) were constructed by using these ABCD calls and re-ordering the sequence by moving D notes before A notes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intervals between D and A notes within DABC calls were set at the same durations as those between C and D notes in their original ABCD calls, ensuring that any acoustic features other than note orderings did not differ between ABCD and DABC calls (balanced design).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These calls were recorded in a sound file at a rate of 20 calls per minute (one call every 3 s, total duration 90 s), which was saved in WAV format (16-bit accuracy, 48.0-kHz sampling rate) onto an SD memory card.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This calling rate is within the natural range25,30 and ensures that each call is separated by at least 1.6 s from any preceding calls, reducing the chances that receivers could perceive ABCD sequences from

separated by at least 2 h to reduce habituation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The order of the playbacks was randomized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the same position for setting the loudspeaker in all treatments at each site to control for its possible effect on the behavioural response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trials were conducted in calm and dry weather between 08:30 and 16:00 h (Japan Standard Time).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To determine the tits responses to different treatments, we recorded the following behavioural variables during 90 s of playbacks: (1) number of horizontal scans: we counted the number of movements that birds made with their heads from left to right or right to left (approximately a 180° turn) and (2) approaching the loudspeaker: we recorded whether birds approached within 2 m of the loudspeaker during the playback.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These behavioural variables were commented onto an R-09HR digital audio recorder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also recorded the latency to feed nestlings by using a GZ-MG880 digital video camera (JVC Kenwood Corporation) set ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10 m from the nest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Behavioural observations were continued until each playback had ended and the adults entered the nest box to feed the chicks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Experiment 2', 'We tested the responses of Japanese great tits to naturally combined ABCD calls and artificially reversed DABC calls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conducted this experiment with 34 individual great tits (ABCD calls: 11 males and 6 females; DABC calls: 12 males and 5 females).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The minimum distance between experimental sites was 400 m, to ensure the collection of data from different individual tits21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trials were carried out between 6 November and 19 November 2015, during the non-breeding season, when tits, such as other members of the Paridae, are threatened by a variety of predators and produce a corresponding variety of alarm calls22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'First, we searched for a flock of Japanese great tits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On finding a flock, we hung an AT-SPG50 loudspeaker from a tree at 1.8±0.1 m from the ground (mean±s.d., n=34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loudspeaker was connected to an R-09 HR digital audio recorder with EXC-12A extension cords, which enabled the control of playbacks from an observation position ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10 m away from the loudspeaker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, we commenced the playback when a tit came within 15 m of the loudspeaker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We defined the individual that was closest to the loudspeaker as the focal individual and focussed on this individual during the playback.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trials were carried out under calm and dry weather between 08:45 and 15:30 h (Japan Standard Time).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ABCD and DABC treatments were alternated with each other on successive trials so that responses to both treatments were observed under largely similar conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As with Experiment 1, we measured two behavioural variables: (1) number of horizontal scans and (2) the probability of approaching within 2 m of the loudspeaker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These variables were commented onto an R-09HR digital audio recorder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Usage of D calls in a non-predatory context', 'Japanese great tits produce D calls not only in predatory contexts but also in non-predatory contexts such as when visiting their nests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigated the usage and function of D calls in a non-predatory context, testing the hypothesis that D calls serve to recruit conspecifics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If this hypothesis is true, then we predict that (1) tits produce D calls more often when they visit the nest alone than when their mated partner is also present and (2) a callers mate is more likely to visit the nest when the caller produces D calls than when it does not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore investigated the effect of social context on the usage of D calls and whether the production of D calls increases the visitation of their mate to the nest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We observed n=187 nest visitations of 40 adults (19 males and 21 females) at 22 nests from 3 June to 15 June 2012, when nestlings were 1017 days old.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a parent visited within 5 m of the nest box with a food item, we noted (1) the sex of the parent, (2) whether it gave D calls and (3) whether its mate was present within 5 m of the nest box.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case in which a parent visited the nest alone (n=136), we also noted (4) whether the mate visited within 5 m of the nest before the first bird entered the nest box.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Observations were made at 15 m from the nest box, a distance from which the tits behaviour was not disturbed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Statistical analysis', 'All the statistical analyses were performed using R for Mac OS X version 3.1.1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the analysis of Experiment 1, we used generalized linear mixed models for primary analyses, which include the treatment as a fixed term and individual identity of focal birds as a random term.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trial order and sex were also entered as covariates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a negative binomial error distribution and log-link function (glmer.nb in the package lme4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  43)) for the analysis of the number of horizontal scans and a binomial error distribution and logit-link function (glmer in the package lme4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  43)) for the analysis of the probability of approaching behaviour (yes or no).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some trials, tits visited the nest boxes and flew out of sight immediately after feeding chicks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we determined the time duration in which we could observe the behaviour of the tits as the observation time and included this term in the analysis of horizontal scans as a log-transformed offset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the analysis of approaching behaviour, it was not possible to run the model because of the absence of variance in background noise control treatment (no birds approached to the loudspeaker during this treatment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we combined background noise and ABC calls in this analysis, as there was no significant difference between these two treatments (sign test, P=0.5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used likelihood ratio tests to calculate P-values of each term.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the event of a significant effect of treatment, we further conducted pair-wise comparisons by using non-parametric statistics: Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests (wilcox.paired.multcomp in the package RVAideMemoire44) for the number of horizontal scans (standardized by observation time) and sign tests for approaching to the loudspeaker (cochran.qtest in the package RVAideMemoire44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When making these multiple comparisons, sequential Bonferroni corrections were applied for the adjustments of P-values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the correlation between scanning and approaching behaviours, we used Spearmans rank-order correlations (cor.test in the default package stats).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the analysis of Experiment 2, we ran generalized linear models including treatment as a fixed term and sex as a covariate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a negative binomial error distribution and log-link function (glm.nb in the package MASS45) for the analysis of horizontal scans and a binomial error distribution and logit-link function (glm in the package stats) for the analysis of approaching behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We standardized the number of scans by observation time, as in some cases the focal individuals flew away from the sight during the trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the analysis of the usage of D calls, we ran generalized linear mixed models with a binomial error distribution and a logit-link function (glmer in the package lme4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  43)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the effect of social context on the production of D calls, we fitted social context (mate present or absent) as a fixed term and the probability of D calling (yes or no) as a dependent variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the effect of D calling on the recruitment of a mate to the nest, we fitted the production of D calls (yes or no) as a fixed term and the probability of recruitment (yes or no) as a dependent variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both models, we also included sex of focal birds as a covariate and individual identity of focal birds and individual nest as random terms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All tests were two-tailed and the significance level was set at =0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Ethical statement', 'All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
