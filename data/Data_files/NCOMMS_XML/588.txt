Structure of the Neisseria meningitidis Type IV pilus  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Neisseria meningitidis use Type IV pili (T4P) to adhere to endothelial cells and breach the blood brain barrier, causing cause fatal meningitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T4P are multifunctional polymers of the major pilin protein, which share a conserved hydrophobic N terminus that is a curved extended -helix, 1, in X-ray crystal structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report a 1.44 Å crystal structure of the N. meningitidis major pilin PilE and a 6 Å cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of the intact pilus, from which we built an atomic model for the filament.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This structure reveals the molecular arrangement of the N-terminal -helices in the filament core, including a melted central portion of 1 and a bridge of electron density consistent with a predicted salt bridge necessary for pilus assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This structure has important implications for understanding pilus biology.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) is one of the very few extracellular bacterial pathogens able to cross the blood brain barrier after having invaded the bloodstream from the nasopharynx.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the bloodstream an unusually tight interaction between the bacteria and the brain microvasculature endothelial cells is established, leading to cortical plaque formation that results in opening of the blood brain barrier and bacterial invasion of the brain1,2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interaction is mediated by Type IV pili (T4P), long thin polymers of pilin proteins that interact with two endothelial cell receptors, CD147 and the 2 adrenergic receptor (2AR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interaction with CD147 is responsible for bacterial adhesion6 and the interaction with the 2AR induces signalling in endothelial cells7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the host cell signalling events that lead to disruption of the blood brain barrier are somewhat well-defined, the mechanism by which T4P initiate this process is poorly understood and would benefit from a detailed structure of the N. meningitidis T4P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'X-ray crystal structures of full-length Type IV pilin proteins have been obtained by dissociating intact pilus filaments with detergent, revealing a canonical structure with an extended gently curving 53-amino-acid -helix (1), the C-terminal half of which is embedded in a globular C-terminal domain8,9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The N-terminal half of the -helix, 1N, protrudes from the globular domain and is comprised of hydrophobic residues, with the exception of a threonine or serine at position 2 and an invariant glutamate at position 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two helix-breaking residues, Pro22 and Gly42, which are conserved in Type IV pilins of the IVa class, introduce kinks in 1 and are responsible for its curvature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional glycine at position 14 is also conserved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1N has dual functions in T4P biogenesis: it anchors the globular domain in the inner membrane before pilus assembly13, and it interacts with adjacent 1Ns in the assembled pilus, forming a staggered helical array in the filament core8,9,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conserved Glu5 is critical for T4P assembly14,16,17,18,19,20,21,22 and models of T4P, based in part on the crystal structure of the full-length pilin subunit from Neisseria gonorrhoeae, PilE (Ng PilE), place this side chain in a salt bridge with the positively charged N-terminal amine of its neighbouring molecule in the otherwise hydrophobic core of the filament8,9,11,14,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'N.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  meningitidis PilE (Nm PilE) is 78% identical to Ng PilE and 100% identical in 1 (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both pilins share a 20 amino-acid hypervariable region, located between two conserved cysteines, imparting antigenic variability to these pili24,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In N. gonorrhoeae PilE the hypervariable region is located on a -hairpin that lies on top of the globular domain -sheet9,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) reconstruction of the Ng T4P was determined at 12.5 Å resolution and an atomic model was built by fitting the full-length Ng PilE structure into the cryoEM density9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PilE globular domains fit well into the reconstruction, exposing the hypervariable region prominently on the pilus surface and burying the N-terminal -helices in the filament core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PilE subunits are related in the Ng T4P reconstruction by an axial rise of 10.5 Å and an azimuthal rotation (twist) of 100.8°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subunits are held together largely by hydrophobic interactions among the N-terminal -helices but these helices were not resolved due to the limited resolution cryoEM map.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The importance of the hydrophobic interactions was corroborated by biochemical studies, which showed that Ng T4P require detergent to dissociate into pilin subunits9,11,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interactions between subunits are very strong, requiring temperatures of 60 °C to denature the filaments14, consistent with their ability to withstand tensile forces of 100 pN or more27,28,29,30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet both Ng and Nm T4P have been shown to undergo a force-induced conformational change that exposes an epitope, EYYLN, along the length of the pilus29,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EYYLN is located at the end of 1 (resides 4953) in Ng PilE, a site that is buried by subunit:subunit interactions in the Ng T4P model and only accessible at the tips of the pili9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this model, anti-EYYLN antibodies normally bind to the tips of Nm and Ng T4P but not along its length33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet when Ng T4P are placed under force using optical or magnetic tweezers or molecular combing they become longer and narrower29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This force-induced conformational change exposes the anti-EYYLN epitope all along the length of the pilus, allowing antibody to bind.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, Brissac et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  showed that anti-EYYLN antibodies can bind along the length of Nm T4P when Nm are adhered to endothelial cells, a property that is dependent on expression of the minor pilin, PilX32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is unclear how these T4P extend in a reversible manner without completely disrupting the extensive hydrophobic interactions among the N-terminal -helices in the core of the filament.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another poorly understood phenomenon of T4P from at least one species, Geobacter sulfurreducens, is their ability to facilitate long-range electron transport, a property that is thought to occur via overlapping  orbitals of aromatic residues in 1 (refs 35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher resolution structures may provide a molecular basis for these and other remarkable properties of T4P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Sequence alignment between N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae

of the 2AR in endothelial cells38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  N-PilE crystals were grown in the P212121 space group and the structure was solved by molecular replacement with the full-length PilE structure from N. gonorrhoeae (Ng PilE, 2HI29), which shares 78% sequence identity with N. meningitidis PilE (Nm PilE; Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data collection and refinement statistics are reported in Table 1.

77121).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between 1C and the -sheet is the -loop (residues 5476), an extended segment with a single-turn -helix and a 310 helix that forms one edge of the globular domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two residues in the -loop, Ser63 and Ser69, are post-translationally modified in the native PilE39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the opposite side of the -sheet, the polypeptide chain exits 4 and forms a

-loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conserved disulfide-bonded cysteines at the end of 4 (Cys120) and close to the C terminus (Cys154) define the boundaries of the D-region containing the -hairpin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most protruding segment of the D-region, the -hairpin loop and 6 plus the beginning of the loop that follows 6, is highly variable in sequence among N. meningitidis Type IV pilins and is referred to as the hypervariable region (residues 127 to 146)38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The -hairpin loop hooks over the top of the -sheet and across the 12 loop; Ala129 at its apex forms a main chain hydrogen bond

square deviation for main chain atoms, 1.1 Å, Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small differences in the backbone conformations occur mainly in the hypervariable region at the end of the 6 strand of the -hairpin and in the loop following this strand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MC58 pilin has an Ala142 in place of the very prominent Lys140 seen in our 8013 PilE structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electron density is absent for a single residue, Ala131, at the tip of the -hairpin loop in 4V1J, and the 3-4 loop conformation differs very slightly between the two pilins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Not surprisingly, the Nm PilE structure is highly similar to Ng PilE (Fig 2a, b), superimposing with a root mean square deviation of 3.1 Å for all main chain atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the N-terminal 54 residues are identical in both proteins the missing 29 N-terminal residues in Nm N-PilE monomer are also expected to be -helical, forming a continuous -helix with 1C, as seen in the full-length Ng PilE structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conserved Pro22 and Gly42 introduce kinks in Ng PilE, giving 1 a gentle S-shaped curve (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both proteins share essentially the same secondary

greater degree than it does in Ng PilE, and in the -hairpin, which is more twisted in Nm PilE and has a two-residue insertion in its loop that allows it to contact the -loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

1-start helix have limited contact, between the 34 loop on one subunit and the -loop on the next (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bottoms of each globular domain fit into a gap between two globular domains in the next turn of the 1-start helix: the 23 loop of the upper subunit contacts the tip of 1 of one of the lower subunits, and the D-region of the upper subunit contacts both the top of 1C and the -loop of the other lower subunit (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These interactions, mediated by mostly polar and charged residues, connect the globular domains in each consecutive turn of the

hydrophobic residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primary contact points between the 1s occur along the 1-start helical strand: the continuous -helical segments 1:2441, which are an integral part of their respective globular domains, alternate along the 1-start helix of the pilus filament with the ordered segments of 1N (residues 114) from subunits in the next turn up in the 1-start helix (Fig 4d, e).

resistant to heat and chemical denaturation and require treatment with detergent in order to dissociate them14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The -helical core of the N. meningitidis T4P', 'In our Nm T4P model the 1 segment 2453 is curved but runs roughly parallel to the filament axis while 1:1-14 is tilted with its N terminus oriented toward the centre of the filament (Fig 5ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This orientation places the side chain of Glu5 in close proximity ( less_than 5 Å) to the N-terminal amine of Phe1 (Phe1:N) on the neighbouring 1 in the 1-start helix, consistent with a salt bridge, which matches perfectly the well-defined channel connecting the rod-like densities at their termini (Fig 5b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glu5 is invariant in Type IV pilins and Type II secretion pseudopilins and is also present in most minor (pseudo)pilins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the Phe1-Glu5 salt bridge has been proposed previously to neutralize these charges in the hydrophobic core of the filament11 and to drive subunit docking into a growing pilus9 this is the first structural evidence of such an interaction in a T4P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither the rod-like density for 1, nor the connection between these densities, were resolved in the 12.5 Å Ng T4P structure9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thr2 is also positioned to form an intermolecular hydrogen bond with Glu5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A hydroxyl-containing threonine or

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our 1.44 Å crystal structure of Nm N-PilE, together with our 6 Å resolution cryoEM reconstruction of the Nm T4P allowed us to generate a model for this pilus that closely resembles our earlier 12.5 Å Ng T4P structure (Supplementary Fig 2) but reveals new structural features that inform pilus biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The non-helical conformation revealed for residues 1523 of 1 is surprising given that this region is -helical not only in the Ng PilE monomer structure but also in the other full-length Type IV pilin structures from Pseudomonas aeruginosa8, Dichelobacter nodosus10 and G. sulfurreducens12 all of which possess S-shaped -helices with kinks at Pro22 and Gly/Pro42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These full-length Type IV pilin structures were obtained by dissociating purified pili into pilin subunits with the detergent octyl -D-glucopyranoside (OG), which disrupts hydrophobic interactions and solubilizes 1N.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In bacteria 1N is anchored in the inner membrane prior to pilus assembly13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The -helical conformation would shield the polar nitrogens and oxygens in the 1N backbone from the hydrophobic phase of the lipid bilayer (and also from the acyl chains of OG during crystal growth).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the melting of the helix at 1:1523 appears to be induced on integration of the pilin subunits into the pilus filament, perhaps to facilitate packing of 1N (Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conserved helix-breaking residues Gly14 and Pro22 may destabilize the -helical secondary structure in this region, allowing it to unfold during pilus assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly the Type II secretion pseudopilins also have Gly14 and Pro22 (Fig 1b) and thus may also adopt a non-helical conformation in this region within the pseudopilus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, although the Type IVb pilins lack the proline at position 22 they have glycines at positions 11, 14 and 19, which may destabilize this region in a manner similar to that of Gly14/Pro22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, archaeal flagellins contain an N terminus that is homologous to 1N in the Type IV pilins44 but possess no proline in this segment, and glycines are not in conserved positions (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A  4 Å resolution cryoEM reconstruction of an archaeal flagellar-like filament from Igniococcus hospitalis was recently determined, which shows well-defined density corresponding to a straight, fully -helical 1N (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the loss of helical order seen for Nm T4P may be a shared feature of the T4P and Type II secretion pseudopili but is not necessarily a universal feature of filament-forming proteins containing a Type IV pilin N-terminal domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The new Nm T4P model with its non-helical 1 segment provides a molecular basis with which to understand the reversible force-dependent polymorphism observed for both Nm and Ng T4P29,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ng T4P can be stretched to approximately three times their length when subjected to forces of  100 pN, with a corresponding narrowing of the filament diameter29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This force-induced conformational change exposes the EYYLN epitope at the end of 1, which is normally buried in the pilus and only accessible at the tip (Figs 4ce and 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar exposure of this epitope is induced for Nm T4P upon binding to endothelial cells32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanism by which Nm and Ng T4P can extend in a reversible manner was not apparent from the lower resolution Ng T4P model, in which the 1s are all-helical and twisted around each other in the filament core9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new Nm T4P model can be envisioned as a coil-like structure: each turn of the coil, which follows the 1-start helical path, is comprised of the globular domains connected by a small number of electrostatic/polar interactions and by extensive hydrophobic interactions with intervening 1Ns (1:114) from the subunits in the next turn of the coil; each consecutive turn of the coil is held together axially by electrostatic and polar interactions between the globular domains and by 1, which acts as a tether between each turn (Figs 4d,e and 6b, left panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shear forces on the pili may disrupt the weaker axial interactions between globular domains in consecutive turns of the coil, and extend residues 1:1523, stretching the pilus while maintaining the lateral interactions between globular domains, 1:2441 and 1:114 along the coil (Fig 6b, right panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, force would produce a spring-like motion separating the coils to elongate the pilus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a motion was described recently for the P pilus of the donor chaperone pilus family based on the 3.8 Å resolution cryoEM reconstruction46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The architecture of the P pilus is markedly different from that of the T4P: elongated P pilin subunits are connected along the coils by donor-strand exchange of their N-terminal extensions, which insert into a groove in the next subunit to complete an Ig fold47; polar interactions hold the coils of the P pili together in the axial direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet P pili, like the Nm and Ng T4P, can extend under force in a reversible spring-like manner, providing an interesting example of convergent evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In our Nm T4P model 1:1523 spans  18 Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a fully extended conformation these nine residues could potentially span 32 Å, which would take the axial rise per subunit from 10.3 Å to  24 Å, an increase of  230%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The melting of a few residues flanking 1523 could further increase the filament length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such an extension might separate the globular domains between consecutive turns of the coil enough for antibody to access to the EYYLN epitope, while maintaining the lateral hydrophobic interactions along the coil, between the globular domains, 1:2441 and 1:114.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the accompanying increase in rise per subunit can occur in the P pili by simply tilting the subunits, the more complex interactions holding the Type IV pilins may also shift relative to each other, changing the register of the 1 interactions to increase the rise per subunit, transiently resulting in thinner longer pili.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon release of force, 1N would collapse to the more compact and stable conformation seen in the Nm T4P model and interactions between the coils would reform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conformational elasticity would allow N. meningitidis to remain attached via T4P to endothelial cells in the brain vasculature, and N. gonorrhoeae cells to remain attached to the lining of the urethra under shear forces from blood and urine flow, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, the force-induced stretching of Nm T4P would separate the 2AR-binding residue Thr130 from the Lys140/Asp143/Lys144 patch in adjacent subunits (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a change may provide a signal to activate 2AR and cortical plaque formation, leading to loosening of the endothelial cell junctions and opening of the blood brain barrier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conformational flexibility of the Nm T4P is likely responsible for the structural heterogeneity observed during processing of the cryoEM images, which precluded a higher resolution reconstruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The Nm T4P structure may also be relevant in considering the mechanism for charge transfer in the related T4P from G. sulfurreducens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The G. sulfurreducens Type IV pilin is unique in its absence of a globular domain: this 61 amino-acid pilin has an extended curved 1, as seen for Ng T4P, followed by an unstructured 8 amino-acid C terminus12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pilin shares 50% identity with Nm PilE in its N-terminal 30 amino acids, including Gly14 and Pro22 (Fig 1b), thus it may also have a non-helical 1 segment when incorporated into a pilus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The G. sulfurreducens pilin contains 6 aromatic residues, Phe1, Tyr24, Tyr27, Tyr32, Phe51 and Tyr57, five of which are also present in Nm PilE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These residues are implicated in charge conduction in G. sulfurreducens T4P, as a mutant, Aro-5, with alanine substitutions for all aromatics except Phe1, makes pili but shows a 10-fold reduction in conductivity36,48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The authors proposed metallic-like charge conductivity through closely spaced  stacked aromatic side chains, similar to electron transport through polyaniline or polyacetylene nanostructures48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model is supported by X-ray microdiffraction data for wild type conductive G. sulfurreducens T4P, which show a 3.2 Å peak representative of a repeating feature within the pilus; this peak is absent in the Aro-5 mutant35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the spacing of the aromatic residues in existing T4P models8,9,14 is considerably larger than 3.2 Å, new computational models for the G. sulfurreducens T4P have been proposed that bring the core aromatic residues Phe1, Tyr24 and Tyr27 within  stacking distance (34 Å) to facilitate long-range electron transport through the pilus35,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such energy-minimized models have a comparable rise to Ng T4P (10 Å) but a much smaller twist (5560°) and are more compact50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While feasible, these models assume an all-helical 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our Nm T4P model with its non-helical 1 segment, the aromatic residues are not within  stacking distance, with most being  greater than 8 Å away (CC) from their closest neighbour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phe1, Tyr24 and Tyr27 form an aromatic band that spirals up the filament axis (Fig 5d), whereas residues 32, 51 and 57, corresponding to the remaining aromatic amino acids in the G. sulfurreducens pilin, occupy more peripheral positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phe1 lies at approximately the same level along the Nm T4P filament axis as the Tyr27 of three subunits preceding (protomers P and P-3, respectively) and  6 Å from Tyr24 (Fig 5d), distances that are incompatible with  orbital overlap and the 3.2 Å diffraction peak seen for G. sulfurreducens T4P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spacing of the aromatic side chains is constrained in Nm and Ng T4P by the presence of the globular domain, which places a lower limit on the subunit rise and rotation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of a globular domain for the G. sulfurreducens Type IV pilins means that they can pack more closely in the pilus, with smaller rise and rotation values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These parameters, together with a non-helical, partially extended portion of 1, may provide more realistic G. sulfurreducens T4P computational models that aromatics except Phe1, Tyr24 and Tyr27, and perhaps other aromatic side chains, within 3-4 Å of each other to form a continuous chain of  stacked aromatic side chains for charge transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, reduction of the solution pH from 10.5 to 2 results in a 100-fold increase in electrical conductivity for G. sulfurreducens T4P and a corresponding increase in the intensity of the 3.2 Å diffraction peak35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A possible explanation for this apparent increase in order is that the low pH disrupts the Phe1-Glu5 salt bridge, freeing the Phe1 side chain to optimize its orientation for charge transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, the 6 Å structure of the Nm T4P provides a framework for understanding Nm pilus interactions with host cell receptors as well as more general aspects of T4P biology including assembly, function and biophysical properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highly conserved T4P N-terminal domain is all-helical in X-ray crystal structures of full-length Type IV pilins, which most likely represents its state in the inner membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of these crystal structures and low resolution EM reconstructions it has been assumed until now that 1 is all -helical in the intact pilus as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have shown that the N-terminal segment is actually partially melted in the assembled pilus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The melting of this region helps to explain pilus heterogeneity, flexibility and elasticity, including T4Ps ability to stretch under force, and in the case of G. sulfurreducens T4P, to conduct charge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  N-terminal sequence similarity between Nm PilE and other Type IV pilins and Type II secretion pseudopilins suggest that this 1N melting may be a conserved feature, yet one that does not extend to the archaeal flagellins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Nm T4P cryoEM reconstruction shows the limitations of secondary structure predictions, which can never be more than 8090% accurate as they fail to account for contextual influences on protein structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also illustrates the value of obtaining the highest resolution possible for macromolecular assemblies, as key structural features can be missed with rigid body fitting of atomic structures of isolated subunits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such features can have important biological implications for the protein complexes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
