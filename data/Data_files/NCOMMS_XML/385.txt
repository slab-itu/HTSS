Generation of stem cell-derived -cells from patients with type 1 diabetes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We recently reported the scalable in vitro production of functional stem cell-derived -cells (SC- cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we extend this approach to generate the first SC- cells from type 1 diabetic patients (T1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -cells are destroyed during T1D disease progression, making it difficult to extensively study them in the past.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These T1D SC- cells express -cell markers, respond to glucose both in vitro and in vivo, prevent alloxan-induced diabetes in mice and respond to anti-diabetic drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we use an in vitro disease model to demonstrate the cells respond to different forms of -cell stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using these assays, we find no major differences in T1D SC- cells compared with SC- cells derived from non-diabetic patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show that T1D SC- cells could potentially be used for the treatment of diabetes, drug screening and the study of -cell biology.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Patient-derived human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), differentiated to disease-relevant cells, are becoming quite important due to their potential for cell replacement therapy and drug screening, as well as improving our understanding of the pathophysiology of disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Type 1 diabetes (T1D) occurs by autoimmune-mediated destruction of pancreatic -cells, and genome-wide association studies have revealed that most genetic loci associated with T1D are affiliated with the immune system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, several loci and related networks are expressed in the -cells or are otherwise non-immune1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role intrinsic defects in -cells from patients, such as reduced mass and function or susceptibility and response to stress, may play in initiating the disease remains unclear1,2,3,4,5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, what T1D patient-specific barriers, if there are any, may impede the use of autologous hiPSC technology for cell replacement therapy are unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As -cells are destroyed during disease progression, procurement of -cells from T1D patients that have not undergone disease-related environmental stress for study has not been possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Transplantation of exogenous -cells to replace dead or dysfunctional endogenous -cells is a potential strategy for controlling blood glucose levels in diabetic patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Allogeneic transplantation of cadaveric islets has already been performed on patients with positive clinical results, but this approach suffers from a limited islet supply and the requirement that patients remain on immunosupressants8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human pluripotent stem cells9, including both human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)10,11,12,13 and hiPSC13,14,15,16, provide the basis for potentially unlimited numbers of replacement cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several groups have detailed the generation of early and intermediate cell types from human pluripotent stem cells, such as definitive endoderm and pancreatic progenitors10,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells that express low levels of insulin, but few other -cell markers, have been generated from T1D hiPSC previously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these cells have been of limited utility, as they do not resemble bona fide -cells, lack function in vitro and in vivo, mis-express -cell and other islet genes, and lack correct granular ultrastructure15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In recent times, we reported the generation of SC- cells from both hESC- and hiPSC-derived from non-diabetic (ND) donors that have many of the defining features of -cells, including its function both in vitro and in vivo, -cell marker expression and the ability to control glucose levels in diabetic mice17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other groups have reported similar protocols and findings19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we use this novel technology to generate SC- cells from T1D hiPSC for the first time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells, referred to as T1D SC- cells, express markers found in -cells, are functionally indistinguishable from ND SC- cells in vitro and in vivo, and prevent alloxan-induced diabetes in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insulin secretion is increased in these T1D SC- cells in response to several categories of anti-diabetic drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we show that these cells respond to different types of chemically induced stress, develop an in vitro disease model of T1D SC- cell stress and demonstrate a partial rescue of this stress phenotype with treatment of a small molecule (an Alk5 inhibitor).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T1D SC- cells can be used to better study diabetes and as a potential autologous source for cell replacement therapy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In summary, we demonstrate that functional SC- cells can be generated from hiPSC derived from T1D patients in vitro (Fig 1ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells are very similar to those we previously reported for hESC and ND hiPSC SC- cell and are similar but not identical to adult -cells17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T1D SC- cells express markers found in -cells, including NKX6-1 and PDX1, and have global gene expression patterns similar to adult -cells (Figs 1d,e and 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T1D SC- cells are functional in vitro and in vivo, responding to glucose challenges by increasing their human insulin release and controlling glucose levels in diabetic mice after transplantation (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After exposure to chemical-induced stress, T1D SC- cells lose expression of -cell markers (Fig 3b,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells also respond to cytokine stress, which can be partially prevented by treatment with Alk5i (Fig 3bf)28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, these cells also respond to known anti-diabetic drugs that cause increased insulin secretion (Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These experimental approaches could directly be used for discovery of novel compounds that increase function and prevent stress and death in -cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The usefulness of these cells could be further enhanced by a combination with recently reported genetic modification strategies, for example, by the use of TALEN or CRISPR-Cas9 to introduce or correct known diabetes-associated mutations29,30 or engineering reporter constructs to improve functional readout31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Overall, we do not observe major differences in SC- cells derived from T1D and ND patients with the assays and cell lines used in this report.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that this does not mean differences do not exist in T1D -cells compared with ND -cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility is that defects or differences would appear after extended culture or many years after transplantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diabetes generally develops over a long period, and we did not test for the effects of ageing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, investigating how T1D SC- cells interact with the immune system would be quite informative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the gene with the largest differential expression in T1D and ND SC- cells is TAP1, a peptide transporter associated with the major histocompatibility complex that has been implicated in with T1D32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, it is important to note that the three T1D donors used in this study do not represent the whole T1D population; differences among patients are likely to exist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The lack of observable gross deficiencies in T1D SC- cells combined with their functional phenotype indicates the potential utility of these autologous cells in cell replacement therapy for diabetes for at least a proportion of the T1D population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We caution that additional studies need to be conducted with a larger number of patient-specific cell lines before clinical use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In combination with a strategy to prevent autoimmune destruction33, these cells may provide an alternative to current approaches in transplantation that have to address the additional hurdle of allo- or xenogeneic rejection.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
