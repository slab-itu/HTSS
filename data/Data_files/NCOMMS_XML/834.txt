Soil networks become more connected and take up more carbon as nature restoration progresses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Soil organisms have an important role in aboveground community dynamics and ecosystem functioning in terrestrial ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, most studies have considered soil biota as a black box or focussed on specific groups, whereas little is known about entire soil networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that during the course of nature restoration on abandoned arable land a compositional shift in soil biota, preceded by tightening of the belowground networks, corresponds with enhanced efficiency of carbon uptake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mid- and long-term abandoned field soil, carbon uptake by fungi increases without an increase in fungal biomass or shift in bacterial-to-fungal ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The implication of our findings is that during nature restoration the efficiency of nutrient cycling and carbon uptake can increase by a shift in fungal composition and/or fungal activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we propose that relationships between soil food web structure and carbon cycling in soils need to be reconsidered.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Many ecosystems worldwide face exposure to intensified human use1,2,3, which has resulted in loss of biodiversity4, altered functioning5 and altered provisioning of ecosystem services6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The abandonment of disturbed land represents one of the most widely used restoration strategies implemented at a global scale7, with the potential to promote biodiversity, and associated ecosystem services.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the restoration of natural ecosystem functioning and soil properties is known to be a long-term process7,8, dependent upon the time it takes to restore connections between different components of the community9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over half a century ago, Odum10 identified mechanistic linkages between the successional dynamics of natural communities and the functioning of natural ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, as communities progress through succession, diversity is expected to increase and nutrients will become locked-up in the biota, with consequences for the build-up of soil organic matter and closure of the mineral cycles10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, the interplay between aboveground and belowground biodiversity has emerged as a prominent determinant of the successional dynamics in biological communities11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, little is known about how changes in the soil biota contribute to the associated changes in ecosystem functioning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In ecosystems undergoing secondary succession, it is evident that available nitrogen diminishes, primary productivity decreases and the plant community shifts from fast- to slow-growing plant species12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is less evidence of an increase of soil biodiversity13, and evidence of a relationship between soil biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is mixed, at best5,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, it is still unclear how soil and plant community composition relate to each other and what is the relative role of plants and soil biota in driving soil processes and plant community development12,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interestingly, studies on a time series (chronosequence) of abandoned arable fields revealed that carbon and nitrogen mineralization by the soil food web increases during secondary succession18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies a more active soil microbial community in later successional stages19,20,21 where bacterial-dominated systems are expected to be replaced by fungal-dominated systems22 with more carbon turnover via fungi23 and their consumers24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, data to test these assumptions are largely lacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine how biodiversity, composition and structure of the soil community change during successional development of restored ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We used a well-established chronosequence of nature restoration sites on ex-arable, formerly cultivated, lands that represent over 30 years of nature restoration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined biodiversity of almost all taxonomic groups of soil biota, analysed their network structure and added labelled carbon dioxide and mineral nitrogen to intact plantsoil systems in order to track their uptake by the soil food web.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested the hypothesis that functional changes in carbon and nitrogen flows relate more strongly to the belowground community network structure than to belowground biodiversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We analysed variations in species co-occurrence and considered enhanced correlations as network tightening, which we define as a significant increase in percentage connectance and an increase in the strong correlations as a percentage of all possible correlations25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results reveal increased tightening and, therefore, connectance, of the belowground networks during nature restoration on the ex-arable land.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A combination of correlation-based network analysis and isotope labelling shows that soil network tightening corresponds with enhanced efficiency of the carbon uptake in the fungal channel of the soil food web, without an increase in the total amount of soil biodiversity or in fungal-to-bacterial biomass ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For nitrogen, the non-microbial species groups revealed a similar pattern as for carbon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tightening of the networks reflects stronger co-occurring patterns of variation in soil biota25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased carbon and nitrogen uptake capacity by the fungal channel in the soil food web can be explained by stronger co-occurrence of preys and their predators24, which enhances the efficiency of resource transfer in the soil food web compared with a soil food web where preys and predators are spatially isolated.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

data with Spearmans rank correlation 0.9 (Fig 1a, Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Network structure change was the most pronounced between recently and mid-term abandoned fields, largely owing to increased correlations between bacteria and fungi (Fig 1b, Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of co-occurrence showed that patterns in network structure were robust for the type of comparison; network analysis using presenceabsence data in the correlation matrix showed the same transition in network tightening between recent and mid-term abandonment stages (Supplementary Figs 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

in the mid-term abandoned fields; however, there was no significant difference between variation in recent versus long-term abandoned fields (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Abiotic conditions explained a substantial amount of variation of the different groups of soil biota (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the increased network tightening from recent to long-term abandoned

fungivorous cryptostigmatic mites, predaceous mesostigmatic mites, root-feeding nematodes and bacterivorous nematodes in general also increased during the course of succession, whereas other species groups did not show any successional change at all (Supplementary Fig 3, Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, there were significant changes in soil community composition, among others, in composition of bacteria, fungi and their predators (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, increased network tightening could not be explained only by a general convergence in plant community composition or soil properties or by the total amount of soil biodiversity, whereas a contribution of changed composition of the soil community could not be excluded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Stable isotope data', 'Analysis of 13C revealed that the tightening of the belowground networks coincided with increased efficiency of carbon uptake: in later successional stages that had been abandoned longer time ago, plants tended to have least newly photosynthesized carbon in their roots, whereas consumers, such as root-feeding nematodes and soil fungi, contained most of the supplied label (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern becomes even clearer when considering the relative amounts of carbon in the microbes 1 day after pulse labelling (phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA): bacteria F2,13=6.51, P=0.01, fungi F2,13=2.85, P=0.09, neutral lipid fatty acids (NLFA): AMF F2,13=1.16, P=0.34) and, later, in consumers and their predators (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the recently abandoned grasslands, fungi took up half of the carbon, whereas in long-term abandoned grasslands three quarters of the carbon was taken up by fungi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes could not be explained by increased fungal biomass or by an increase in fungal-to-bacterial biomass ratio (Figs 3 and 5, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The changes, however, go along with substantial shifts in microbial consumers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of tighter connections and stronger labelling of the fungal channel in the mid and longer-term abandoned fields make us conclude that network tightening contributes to enhanced efficiency of carbon uptake by the soil food web.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Carbon flow in relation to biomass and abundance in the soil food web.Labelled carbon derived from living

at recently abandoned fields, fungivorous collembola and nematodes were the predominant fungal consumers, whereas in later succession stages mites took a larger proportion of the labelled carbon (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, these differences in soil community functioning were recorded in spite of soil cores being collected from sites along the chronosequence that were largely dominated by the same three plant species (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our results suggest that successional changes in soil community structure and functioning can arise even under the same plant community composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such field-based evidence on the role of whole-soil biodiversity in ecosystem functioning is quite rare2,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed analysis of incorporation of label into the soil food web revealed similar temporal patterns of incorporation of 13C and 15N into higher trophic levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible to analyse 15N in microbes, but methods do not allow distinguishing bacterial from fungal 15N.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we chose not to relate tightening of the belowground networks to the microbial efficiency of nitrogen use by the belowground food web (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 and Supplementary Fig 6).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We show that nature restoration on ex-arable land results in increased connectance of the soil biota, which leads to increased tightening of the networks of soil biota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased network tightening may be due to several factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, tightening may be caused by successional shifts in species26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacteria and fungi showed hump-shaped development in numbers of taxa, whereas numbers of AMF taxa steadily increased, indirectly suggesting that there are indeed shifts in species composition along the successional gradient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AMF have been suggested to increasingly influence plant community composition with increasing time since land abandonment27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in our study network tightening is due to changes in more species groups than AMF alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, increased tightening could be due to declined nutrient availability in the soil along the successional gradient18,28,29, which may enhance the necessity of stronger cooperative and trophic interactions between functional groups of soil biota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Third, changes in the soil physical conditions can influence network tightening30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arable soils are assumed to be relatively heterogeneous31,32, whereas natural succession following land abandonment will increase spatial heterogeneity in abiotic soil conditions33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soil biota have a variety of responses to soil heterogeneity34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased soil heterogeneity could contribute to network tightening, when it enhances co-occurrence patterns of variation in the soil biota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found reduced variation in soil abiotic properties from recent to mid-term abandoned fields, but there were no differences in variation between recent and longer-term abandonment stages, which only partly supports the possibility that changes in soil abiotic factors enhance network tightening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further correlative analyses of soil abiotic properties and network tightening would require independent pairs, however, we do not have individual networks for each individual soil sample used for abiotic analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our 13C/15N analyses revealed that a plant community dominated by the same species allocated less carbon and nitrogen to the roots in soil with late (long-term abandoned) than in soil with early successional (recently abandoned) soil communities but that the mid-late successional soil communities were more efficient in carbon uptake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may be that low abundant plant species35 or conversion of soil abiotic properties have changed soil functioning, but our results also support the suggestion that changes in soil community structure may precede succession in plant communities16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Opposite to expected, during successional transition the fungal biomass and the fungal-to-bacterial biomass ratios did not increase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus nature restoration resulted in a transition in terms of belowground taxonomical composition and fungal productivity but not in terms of fungal biomass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, saprotrophic fungi represented only 0.060.08 of the fungal-to-bacterial ratio of the total microbial biomass in PLFAs, which is in accordance with previous estimates36, yet these fungi processed most of the carbon in later successional stages (Fig 4)23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such changes in soil community structure and functioning have been rarely considered in relation to nature restoration9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Often, restoration targets are focussing on aboveground biodiversity and the presence of rare or red list species, although it has been demonstrated that adding particular soil inocula can direct vegetation development towards particular target systems37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We conclude that over successional time the connectance of species in the soil community increases, while carbon uptake becomes more efficient, even without major changes in species composition of the dominant plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our network approach combined with labelling study concerns a substantially different approach compared with previous soil food web modelling studies18,38, because it is based on actual community composition, whereas food web models are based on biomass of entire feeding groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that transition in fungal composition can change element cycling and carbon uptake in soil without an increase in fungal biomass or fungal-to-bacterial biomass ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that there is a need to verify these findings also in other chronosequences and re-think how soil food web structure influences carbon cycling in soils.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Ex-arable land chronosequence', 'We used a well-established chronosequence21,39,40,41 of nine ex-arable fields all on Pleistocene sandy soils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The history of agricultural use is comparable; on all fields, there was a crop rotation, including barley and potato.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fields were abandoned from agricultural practice at different points in time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following abandonment, seminatural grasslands were allowed to establish, all fields were grazed by free-ranging cattle and additionally mowed maximally once per year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On 18 and 19 October 2011, we visited the field sites marked in Supplementary Fig 7 that correspond with the coordinates provided in Supplementary Table 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At each ex-arable field, we collected soil and plant samples from three subplots of two square metres each, which were 100 metres apart from each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In one square metre, vegetation records were made, whereas in the other square metre soil cores were collected from the top 10 cm for analysing microorganism composition and soil properties and for collecting enchytraeids, nematodes and soil micro-fauna by extraction methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The soil samples were collected using a split-corer sampling device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the same square, we collected earthworms by a combination of hand-sorting of 30 × 30 × 30 cm3 soil monoliths excavated with a hand-held spade and subsequent liquid irritant extraction of earthworms from the deeper soil layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aboveground and belowground standing plant biomass were determined based on these same excavated soil monoliths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soil samples for microbial identification were processed the day after collection and transported by courier to specialists in our research team for further identification and quantification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples for soil analyses, nematodes and enchytraeids were stored and transported at 4 °C

collected from the field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soil cores were collected 1 week before labelling to allow the microbial and faunal communities to stabilize after collecting and transportation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cores were made using a 12-cm diameter soil corer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All cores were 20 cm deep.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immediately after collection, the intact cores were slid into a polyvinylchloride tube and closed with a fitting cap underneath to prevent respiration from the exposed soil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All cores were collected within 2 weeks under similar weather conditions.

labelling with 13C, 81 intact soil cores with native vegetation were labelled with 10 atom% 15N ammonium nitrate (15NH415NO3) (Sigma Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of ammonium nitrate added was 0.1 mg per core, which corresponds to approximately 0.025 mg kg1 soil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The labelled ammonium nitrate solution was watered on the soil surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the potential N mineralization in all the soils was 5 mg kg1 week1, this was assumed not to disturb the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nine control cores were treated with the same amount of unlabelled (14N) ammonium nitrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 81 cores were labelled with 99.99 atom% 13CO2 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA, USA) in an artificially lit air-tight growth chamber for a total of 13 h.
