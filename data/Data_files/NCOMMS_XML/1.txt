Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In most experiments investigating coherent quantum dynamics, dissipation is an undesirable process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there have been several recent theoretical proposals for turning controlled dissipation into a useful resource, for example, for the realization of interesting many-body quantum states1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main idea is to engineer the interaction with the environment such that the combination of coherent and dissipative dynamics drives the system in question to a stationary state identical to the quantum state of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The feasibility of such a reservoir engineering has already been demonstrated experimentally5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In our work, we employ a similar idea to show that a bond between two interacting atoms (or molecules) can be induced by dissipation, thereby extending the notion of a bonding mechanism from purely conservative to dissipative forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bond manifests itself as a stationary state of the scattering dynamics that confines the atoms at a fixed distance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to the unprecedented control available for ultracold atoms and molecules6, the characteristics of the resulting molecules such as bond lengths and spectroscopic properties are highly tunable and can be observed in current experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a specific physical implementation, we first consider two interacting atoms whose motion is restricted to one-spatial dimension (1D), see Fig 1a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For ultracold atoms and molecules, such a constraint can be enforced by appropriate trapping potentials6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assume the internal level structure of the atoms as shown in Fig 1b: each has one internal state |1 exhibiting a distance-dependent interaction shift, and two other non-interacting states |2 and |3, with |2 undergoing spontaneous decay into states |1 and |3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This particular level structure is quite common in ultracold atoms and molecules, see the Methods section for two different possible realizations based on Rydberg-dressed atoms7,8,9 or laser-cooled molecules10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our approach is general, we focus on dipoledipole interactions, as this brings in additional tunability due to the anisotropy of the interaction potential13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We generalize our results to higher spatial dimensions and many-particle systems, and discuss the prospects of using dissipative bonding as a cooling mechanism for strongly interacting quantum gases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Setup of the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Strong confinement by external fields restricts the atoms motion to one spatial dimension parallel to the two counter-propagating laser beams represented by the driving fields with Rabi frequencies ; (b) internal level structure of the atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two internal states  and  are coupled to a metastable state  spontaneously decaying with a rate .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The laser field coupling the states  and  is detuned from the resonance by ; state  is subject to a dipolar interaction shift (r), which depends on the interparticle distance r; states  and  are non-interacting.Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Interaction-induced coherent population trapping', 'The process behind the formation of the bond is coherent population trapping (CPT)14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our setup, we include two counter-propagating laser beams; the one is resonant with the transition between states |2 and |3, and another is detuned by  from the resonance between |1 and |3; for simplicity we set the Rabi frequencies of both fields to .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CPT entails a dark state, that is, a stationary state that cannot absorb photons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For a system of two atoms subject to the electromagnetic field treated as a reservoir16, the dynamics is obtained from the quantum master equation,', '', 'whose stationary solution is given by the condition d/dt=0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here H is the Hamiltonian describing the two atoms and their interaction with the laser fields,  is the density operator describing the two atoms, and n and cn are the rates and corresponding jump operators associated with spontaneous decay, see the Methods section for details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the master equation (1), one can extract an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, Heff=HiVd, containing a dissipative potential,', '', 'The zero-energy eigenstate of Heff corresponds to the dark state  if its dissipation vanishes, that is, .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the non-interacting but resonant case, (r)=0, the dark state for each atom is given by .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking the coupling to translation via the Doppler effect into account retains this dark state and gives rise to the well-known velocity-selective CPT15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, here we consider the regime where the kinetic energy is small compared with the dipolar interaction between the atoms, which in turn is small compared with both the laser driving and the decay, that is, .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that although the conventional velocity-selective CPT scheme can preserve a dark state in presence of the dipoledipole interactions between the ground and excited states17, our setup involves interactions only in state |1 and therefore does not entail a true dark state corresponding to zero dissipation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the limit of infinite mass m, we find via perturbation theory, that the dissipation has a minimum when the atoms are separated by a distance rd where the dipolar interaction (r) destructively interferes with the detuning  the most,', '', 'Here d is the dipole moment of state , 0 the vacuum permittivity,  Plancks constant, and the numerical constants are  and .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The width of the Raman hole in the absorption profile, on the order of 2/, amounts to the distances where the dipolar interaction and the detuning approximately cancel each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although in conventional CPT schemes the photon-scattering rate depends quadratically on the detuning from the resonance, the dipolar interaction shift scales with distance as .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This results in an anharmonic shape of the dissipative potential Vd(r), and thereby in dependence of rd on the Rabi frequency  in equation (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though there still is some residual dissipation for atoms confined to the vicinity of rd, the probability to find the atoms separated by rd is strongly enhanced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a confinement of the atoms amounts to the formation of a dissipative bond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional perturbations arising owing to a finite mass lead to a stationary state that exhibits a distribution of distances sharply centred around rd rather than a single-fixed distance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the case of molecules bound by conservative forces, the strength of the bond is characterized by the binding energythe amount of energy needed to be transfered to a molecule for dissociation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the strength of the dissipative bond can be characterized by an imaginary binding energy, reflecting the amount of dissipation that is required to be added to the system in order to achieve dissociation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The imaginary binding energy is then defined as the difference between the decay rates at r= and r=rd, and can be calculated in the regime  less_than  as', '', 'Numerical simulations of the dynamics', 'We now turn to numerical simulations to confirm the existence of the dissipative bond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We solve the quantum master equation (1) using the wave-function Monte-Carlo method18, see the Methods section for details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the time evolution the atomic positions are redistributed by the kinetic energy and photon recoil, and the atomic population is accumulated in the vicinity of rd on a fast timescale of a few tens of 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For an ensemble of atoms with randomly distributed initial conditions, we observe the appearance of a quasi-stationary distribution strongly peaked around rd, see Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For even longer times, the spatial distribution of the atoms appears to evolve towards a completely delocalized distribution of the laboratory-frame positions, r1 and r2, compatible with a relative distance rd500 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This constitutes evidence that in the long-time limit the state corresponding to the dissipative bond is a state with a relatively low entropy, which is confirmed by the semiclassical studies of the dynamics described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once the dissipative bond has been formed, it is possible to further reduce the probability of subsequent spontaneous decay events by decreasing the Rabi frequencies .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This leads to an effective decay rate eff=p2, with p2 the total probability of any of the atoms being in state |2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For experimentally realistic parameters, see the Methods section for details, we find p20.01, implying the lifetime of the dissipative bond to be longer than the timescale of the formation of the bond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we find that the reduction of the Rabi frequencies does not lead to a significant increase of the spread about rd, and that lifetimes of the bound state exceeding  can be achieved.

inclusion of additional counter-propagating laser beams as used in conventional laser cooling setups19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a two-dimensional (2D) configuration, we consider the case when the quantization axis defined by the electric dipole moment is perpendicular to the plane of the motion, that is, when the dipolar interaction is always repulsive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, the dissipative bond restricts the relative radial motion to a ring where the atoms are separated by rd.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effective Hamiltonian Heff for the remaining angular motion is then described by a 2D rigid rotor, , with Jz the projection of the angular momentum on the quantization axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rotational constant  can be widely tuned by changing rd; for typical experimental realizations, we find that values of B~1001,000 Hz are realistic, that is, by far exceeding the effective decay rate eff.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rotational spectrum of the bound atoms can be then probed with standard techniques of molecular spectroscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In three-spatial dimensions (3D), the constrained relative motion of the two atoms is even richer due to the anisotropy of the dipolar

rotational symmetry about the quantization axis, the projection of the angular momentum, Jz, is conserved, allowing to reduce the problem to an effective one-dimensional problem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effective potential corresponds to an azimuthally symmetric double well centred at =/2, resulting in an almost equidistant spectrum consisting of tunnelling doublets, Fig 3a, similar to those encountered in microwave spectra of ammonia20 or molecules in strong laser fields21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3b features the probability density distributions on the three-dimensional surface.

performed by making use of the techniques well-established in the area of ultracold quantum gases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, a suitable setting would be a many-body system, in which the atoms are essentially uncorrelated at the beginning, with an average interatomic distance much larger than rd, so that many-body effects could be neglected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, the existence of the bound state will appear as a sharp peak in the pair-correlation function, see Fig 2b, which is readily accessible through Bragg scattering22 or noise correlation spectroscopy23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To analyse the behaviour in a many-body setting in more detail, we employ a semiclassical model of the dynamics, see the Methods section for the details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare this semiclassical approach with the quantum mechanical model, we calculated the pair-correlation function for the case of two particles in a one-dimensional trap, see Fig 4a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite being obtained in different temperature regimes, there is a good agreement with the quantum mechanical treatment of Fig 2b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed decrease in entropy towards a stationary value, shown in the inset of Fig 4b, is a sign of a substantial cooling of the relative motion in the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 4b,c, the appearance of a sharp peak around rd corresponding to the formation of dissipative bonds is independent of the number of particles and the dimensionality of the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that in all the cases described above the density is low enough to neglect any

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have established the existence of a dissipative-binding mechanism triggered by non-conservative forces found in interaction-induced coherent-population trapping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results are applicable to a large class of atomic and molecular systems, while the properties of the bound states are highly tunable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we note that the mechanism underlying the formation of the dissipative bond can potentially be used for cooling of strongly interacting many-body systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, the appearance of a low-entropy stationary state independent of the initial conditions already amounts to a demonstration of a cooling of the relative motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the high-density regime, the correlation length rd will be modified by an effective coordination number, embodying the interactions of an individual atom with its surroundings in the stationary state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this renormalization, the formation of dissipatively bound complexes25 in free space or even the realization of dipolar crystals26,27 appear possible.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
