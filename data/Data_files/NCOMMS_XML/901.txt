Self-amplified Amazon forest loss due to vegetation-atmosphere feedbacks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Reduced rainfall increases the risk of forest dieback, while in return forest loss might intensify regional droughts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The consequences of this vegetationatmosphere feedback for the stability of the Amazon forest are still unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that the risk of self-amplified Amazon forest loss increases nonlinearly with dry-season intensification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We apply a novel complex-network approach, in which Amazon forest patches are linked by observation-based atmospheric water fluxes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that the risk of self-amplified forest loss is reduced with increasing heterogeneity in the response of forest patches to reduced rainfall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under dry-season Amazonian rainfall reductions, comparable to Last Glacial Maximum conditions, additional forest loss due to self-amplified effects occurs in 1013% of the Amazon basin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our findings do not indicate that the projected rainfall changes for the end of the twenty-first century will lead to complete Amazon dieback, they suggest that frequent extreme drought events have the potential to destabilize large parts of the Amazon forest.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The Amazon forest has been listed as one of the tipping elements of the Earth system1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large-scale vegetation shifts resulting from reduced rainfall probably occurred in glacial times2,3 and might occur under twenty-first century climate change in combination with increasing deforestation, logging and fire4,5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is an open question whether these stressors can trigger self-amplified forest loss in the Amazon basin9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Self-amplified forest loss may happen due to the strong coupling of vegetation and regional climate (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the one hand, the vegetation state depends on the rainfall regime6,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With decreasing precipitation, forest resilience (defined here as the ability of the forest to recover from perturbations12) decreases12,13 and the forest might shift to an alternative low tree-cover (TC) state11,14,15 as a result of perturbations such as fire and extreme drought events8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, forest loss amplifies drought16,17 by reducing dry-season evapotranspiration rates18,19,20 and thereby weakening atmospheric moisture recycling, which is estimated to amount to 2550% of total Amazonian rainfall21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, a decrease in oceanic moisture inflow could trigger vegetationatmosphere feedbacks and lead to self-amplified forest loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Schematic representation of cascading effects in the vegetationrainfall system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Vegetationatmosphere system in equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Initial forest loss triggered by decreasing oceanic moisture inflow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reduces local evapotranspiration and the resulting downwind moisture transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) As a result, the rainfall regime is altered in another location, leading to further forest loss and reduced moisture transport.Full size image', 'Intensification of the Amazonian hydrological cycle has been observed in the last decades, with the wet season getting wetter and the dry season getting drier in southern and eastern Amazonia24,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is partly explained by a reduction in oceanic moisture inflow caused by a sea-surface-temperature-induced northward displacement of the intertropical convergence zone24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether these anomalies will persist in the future is uncertain and climate model predictions in Amazonia vary from strong drying to modest wetting27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recent projections constrained with observations show a widespread drying during the extended dry season (JuneNovember)27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, while the spatial variability of precipitation during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, around 21,000 yr BP) was roughly similar to the present conditions, rainfall may have been lower over large parts of the Amazon basin28,29,30 due to reduced dry-season oceanic moisture inflow induced by lower evaporation from the cooler sea surface31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite progress in recent years, the complex and nonlinear vegetationrainfall interactions that may cause self-amplified Amazon forest loss are still poorly represented in process-based vegetationclimate models32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we provide a new perspective on the stability of the Amazon vegetationrainfall system and the potential of self-amplified Amazon forest loss by applying a complex-network approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such an inter-disciplinary approach is powerful for analysing cascading effects and has been applied to study, for example, contagion in financial systems34, the spread of innovations in society35, catastrophic species extinctions36, cascading failure in power grids37 or the collapse of marine ecosystems38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, complex networks representing statistical similarities in climatic fields were used to improve forecasts of Indian monsoon timing39, extreme floods in the central Andes40 and El Ni√±o events41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we use the reconstruction of moisture recycling networks23 obtained from atmospheric moisture tracking22,42 of synthesis climate data (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these networks, nodes represent individual vegetation grid cells within the Amazon basin that are linked by monthly water fluxes from the source (evapotranspiration) to the sink (rainfall).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, rainfall in each node has an oceanic and a continental component22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of such networks to represent real moisture recycling processes has been shown in a previous detailed analysis of networks topology23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining moisture recycling networks23 and an empirical indicator of forest resilience11 in a unified cascade model35 allows us to evaluate the strength and extent of vegetationatmosphere feedbacks in a spatially explicit way while relying on observations.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Forest shifts', 'For each node, the rainfall regime is characterized by mean annual precipitation (MAP) and maximum cumulative water deficit (MCWD), a measure of the intensity of the dry season43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MAP and MCWD are well-suited climatic variables to explain the variability of vegetation distribution in the tropics6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under a range of these variables, two TC states can be found (Supplementary Fig 1): (1) an intermediate TC state (5TC less_than 55%), comprising deciduous forest, shrubs and herbaceous and (2) a high TC state (TC55%) corresponding to evergreen forest (hereafter simply called forest) (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probability of forest for different rainfall regimes is derived from satellite data (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This probability is used as an indicator of forest resilience11 (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2b shows that forest resilience decreases with reduced MCWD and MAP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our interpretation, a forest with lower resilience is more likely to shift to a lower TC state in response to perturbations such as extreme drought and fire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our modelling approach, forest nodes can shift stochastically based on thresholds in resilience (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Probability of finding forest in tropical South America depending on rainfall regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

forest loss, understanding the specific properties and mechanisms that stabilize the system is of key interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous modelling studies indicated the importance of spatial heterogeneity for the stability of ecosystems47,48,49 and complex networks in general35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we assess the effect of heterogeneity in the response of forest nodes to changing climatic conditions on the stability of the Amazon vegetationrainfall system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theoretically, while a completely homogeneous forest would shift completely if it crosses a uniquely defined critical rainfall regime, heterogeneity in the forest response would result in forest nodes shifting at different critical rainfall regimes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such heterogeneity may arise, for instance, from spatial variability in forest adaptability to drought, in land surface properties controlling water availability for trees and in disturbances to the forest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the importance of such heterogeneity, we investigate the effect of the width of the bell-shaped resilience threshold distribution on cascade size (see Methods) under complete breakdown of dry-season oceanic moisture inflow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 6 shows that larger heterogeneity in forest resilience thresholds reduces the frequency of high-order cascades by more than 50%, regardless of the model settings (Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, if individual forest nodes shift at different critical rainfall regimes, propagation of forest loss is usually stopped in the early stage of the cascade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, variability in the Amazon forests sensitivity to altered rainfall regime seems to alleviate the risk of long-term self-amplified forest loss.

typically sensitive to the underlying model and input data50,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the sensitivity of our results, we performed additional analyses using a generalized linear model (equation (17) and for different input evapotranspiration data (satellite observations and/or measurements, simulations from land-surface models, output from atmospheric reanalyses and the merged synthesis of all these three categories52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that these choices do not affect our results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Firstly, the spatio-temporal variability of simulated evapotranspiration changes after forest loss is consistent for all input data sets and for the two statistical models considered (Supplementary Figs 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondly, similar dynamics are found regarding the effect of decreasing oceanic moisture inflow on simulated changes of evapotranspiration after forest loss (Supplementary Fig 5c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gives us confidence that our main findings are robust with respect to different choices of evapotranspiration model and input data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the absolute changes might vary depending on the evapotranspiration data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our results highlight the key role of regional dynamic vegetationatmosphere interactions in the Amazon basin, which are not considered in most previous modelling studies assessing the likelihood of Amazon forest dieback for the future5,6,53,54 or for the LGM3,55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As it does not resolve the underlying processes of forest dieback, our method is not suited to provide information on the real-world time scale of self-amplified forest loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study should be seen as a sensitivity analysis rather than a projection of the system dynamics, as it omits some key feedbacks important for regulating forest cover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, wind fields are considered to be static, which is a possible drawback of our approach as forest loss is expected to alter atmospheric circulation patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this effect might be relatively weak over the Amazon compared to changes in the amount of water transported17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We do not account for the effects of changing temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentrations on the hydrological cycle and on forest resilience, the latter remaining highly uncertain6,53,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results for the LGM show a self-amplified expansion of the intermediate TC state (encompassing savannas and/or deciduous forests) at the expense of the high TC state (evergreen forests).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we do not account for all processes of vegetation dynamics, this finding is in line with recent observations of Amazonian speleothem records indicating a reduced moisture recycling during this period29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gives us confidence that vegetationatmosphere interactions, as represented in our modelling approach, probably play a major role in explaining Amazonian precipitation and vegetation changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our results suggest that self-amplified forest loss triggered by oceanic moisture inflow reductions similar to LGM conditions did not affect the western Amazonia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more resilient forest area related to more climatically stable conditions in this region, which is also suggested by paleoenvironmental records3,29,30,56, might have been crucial in the biogeographic history of one of the worlds most species-rich terrestrial ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For the end of the century, in agreement with previous studies53,54,57, we find that projected rainfall reduction does not lead to complete dieback of the Amazon forest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if extreme drought events become more frequent or intense in the future, as suggested by some studies based on current trends25 and climate projections51,58, these may push the system towards large-scale self-amplified forest loss in a step-wise process without similarly drastic changes in the long-term mean rainfall regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the main mechanisms responsible for large-scale self-amplifying forest loss identified in our study might occur during such extreme drought events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Firstly, we found that the reduction of evapotranspiration after forest loss is more pronounced with increasing water deficit, consistent with measurements from flux towers20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is due to the fact that, compared to forest, vegetation states with lower TC are less able to access subsurface water and thereby to maintain high evapotranspiration rates during drought18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondly, we find that the contribution of moisture recycling to total rainfall increases with reduced oceanic moisture inflow, consistent with paleoprecipitation records29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two effects have probably already occurred during recent drought years17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further efforts are needed to assess the effect of inter-annual rainfall variability on the stability of the Amazon vegetationrainfall system and potential time lags in the response of the coupled system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By fully coupling vegetation and rainfall, our study goes beyond previous efforts combining moisture-tracking algorithms with statistical16 or mechanistic17 climate models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Existing coupled models still poorly represent nonlinear regional interactions between biosphere and atmosphere, as shown by large discrepancies in predictions depending on model structure and settings9,59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Misrepresented key processes include (1) access of subsurface water by tropical trees, leading to an underestimation of the reduction of evapotranspiration after forest loss (by around 1‚Äâmm per day)55,60, (2) moisture recycling, leading to biases in moisture fluxes61 and (3) forest responses to drought5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our statistical model, all abovementioned processes are included by applying vegetation and hydro-climate data, which are either observation-based or merged from multiple data sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings are robust against choices of evapotranspiration model and data, to which insights about the hydrological cycle are usually sensitive50,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This work adds to previous studies that suggested the importance of heterogeneity for ecosystems stability32,33,47,62,63 and the Amazon forests in particular48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, none of these studies considered spatial interactions among vegetation patches32,33,48,49,62 or interactions were represented non-realistically47,63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results illustrate the importance of maintaining the structural and functional diversity of Amazon forests to reduce the risk of long-term self-amplified forest loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This should be incorporated into future conservation management strategies and calls for cross-regional and -national approaches.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

linear model already reproduces sufficiently well the results based on our evapotranspiration model (equations 15 and 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cascade model', 'Our approach has been largely inspired by the Watts model35, which simulates cascades that are found in social systems, such as the spread of innovations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically, individuals must decide between two alternative actions and their decisions depend explicitly on the actions of other individuals with whom they interact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Watts model is based on a random network, in which each node might shift between alternative states depending on the states of their neighbours according to a simple threshold rule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, our model is based on moisture recycling networks and the threshold rule is related to local forest resilience that depends on the total incoming moisture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially, each node is assigned a resilience threshold drawn from a normal distribution with mean  and standard deviation .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A simulation run comprises the following steps (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, moisture of oceanic and continental origin propagates through the network using moisture recycling networks and the simple evapotranspiration model (equation 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This occurs on a monthly time scale, where the strongest effects of varying vegetation states on evapotranspiration can be observed, as shown by flux tower measurements18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this step, it is assumed that with the moisture recycling link between two nodes, mj,k (from j to k) changes linearly with total evapotranspiration in the source node (in j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that atmospheric circulation following vegetation shifts are not considered and that rainfall is assumed to be linearly correlated to atmospheric moisture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the rainfall regime characterized by the MAP and the MCWD are calculated for each node.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, the forest resilience is calculated for each node (equation 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourth, a critical transition occurs in all nodes for which the forest resilience crosses the individual threshold, without any time lag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fifth, local evapotranspiration is updated in nodes where shifts occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model runs with nodes updating their status

not affect vegetation states (vegP) (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several metrics are of interest: first, the difference between forest loss in Pveg and Pveg, which quantifies the additional forest loss due to self-amplified effects; second, the relative difference between the shifting frequency in Pveg and Pveg, which quantifies the share of cascading effect in forest loss (share of cascading effect); third, the number of model iterations until equilibrium (cascade size) in the fully coupled version (Pveg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cascade size can be interpreted as a time span of the cascade, but only on a relative scale (for comparison between high- and low-order cascades).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that only nodes in which the shifting frequency exceeds 3% are accounted for.

extended dry season (JuneNovember) with the period 19892005 as baseline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a first setup, oceanic moisture inflow is homogeneously decreased by 2‚Äâmm per day increments until this inflow ceases completely in most of the Amazon basin (up to 8‚Äâmm per day reduction for each month of the extended dry season).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In a second setup, two stylized scenarios (end of twenty-first century and LGM) are generated based on long-term precipitation change estimations for the extended dry season in the Amazon basin drawn from previous studies27,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first scenario (end of twenty-first century) follows the upper bound of projected precipitation reduction for the end of the twenty-first century (20602099) based on a combination of observation-based

June-November).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the resulting amount of oceanic moisture inflow becomes negative, it is set to zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Averaged over the Amazon basin during the extended dry season, it corresponds to an oceanic moisture inflow reduction of 57% and a total rainfall reduction of 38% (calculated from step 1 of the cascade model).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The second scenario (LGM) follows a reconstruction of Amazonian rainfall during the LGM from a regional climate model, in which the effect of vegetation on climate has been turned off (Fig 13b in Cook et al.31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, monthly oceanic moisture inflow is reduced by 0, 1, 2, 6, 10, 6‚Äâmm per day (JuneNovember).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Averaged over the Amazon basin during the extended dry season, it corresponds to an oceanic moisture inflow reduction of 76% and a total rainfall reduction of 52% (calculated from step 1 of the cascade model).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of this scenario to represent accurately LGM rainfall conditions depends on the quality of the sea-surface temperature reconstruction used as forcing data, as well as on the climate model parameterization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter was optimized to
