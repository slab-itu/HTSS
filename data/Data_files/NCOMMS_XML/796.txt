The tumour microenvironment harbours ontogenically distinct dendritic cell populations with opposing effects on tumour immunity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Various steady state and inflamed tissues have been shown to contain a heterogeneous DC population consisting of developmentally distinct subsets, including cDC1s, cDC2s and monocyte-derived DCs, displaying differential functional specializations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identification of functionally distinct tumour-associated DC (TADC) subpopulations could prove essential for the understanding of basic TADC biology and for envisaging targeted immunotherapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that multiple mouse tumours as well as human tumours harbour ontogenically discrete TADC subsets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monocyte-derived TADCs are prominent in tumour antigen uptake, but lack strong T-cell stimulatory capacity due to NO-mediated immunosuppression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pre-cDC-derived TADCs have lymph node migratory potential, whereby cDC1s efficiently activate CD8+ T cells and cDC2s induce Th17 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice vaccinated with cDC2s displayed a reduced tumour growth accompanied by a reprogramming of pro-tumoural TAMs and a reduction of MDSCs, while cDC1 vaccination strongly induces anti-tumour CTLs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data might prove important for therapeutic interventions targeted at specific TADC subsets or their precursors.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialized antigen-presenting cells, present in all tissues, that play a major role in orchestrating immune responses1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of mature DCs in tumours has been correlated with a positive prognosis in several tumour types2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, multiple clinical studies have indicated a defective functionality and scarcity of mature DCs in tumours4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, DCs seem to switch from an immunostimulatory activation state driving anti-tumour immunity in early stage tumours to an immunosuppressive activation state at later stages7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The secretion of immunosuppressive factors by cancer cells has been proposed to be implicated in the control of DC differentiation, maturation and function4,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, tumour-associated DCs (TADCs) may favour tumour progression by mediating genomic damage, supporting neovascularization and stimulating cancerous cell growth and spreading4,9,10, features that may be attributed to the existence of distinct TADC populations10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although not much is known about DC heterogeneity in tumours, DCs isolated from various steady-state and inflamed tissues have been shown to represent a heterogeneous population consisting of developmentally distinct DC subsets11,12,13, including cDC1s (CD8+-like or CD103+ conventional DCs), cDC2s (CD11b+-like cDCs), plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and so-called monocyte-derived DCs (Mo-DCs)12,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, distinct DC classification systems and nomenclatures have been used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Throughout this manuscript, we employ the ontogeny-based classification/nomenclature as proposed by Guilliams et al15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cDCs arise from bone marrow-derived pre-cDC precursors in an Flt3L-dependent fashion16, are maintained under homeostatic conditions by (granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor) GM-CSFR signalling17 and differentiate into cDC1s and cDC2s under the control of BATF3, ID2 and IRF8 or RELB, ZEB2 and IRF4, respectively, while Mo-DCs differentiate from Ly6Chi monocytes which exit the bone marrow in a CCR2-dependent manner and were reported not to require GM-CSFR signalling for their in vivo differentiation17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, transcriptomic analysis of mouse and human DC subsets revealed that human CD141 (BDCA3)+ DCs are related to mouse cDC1s, whereas human CD1c (BDCA1)+ DCs are more related to mouse cDC2s (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human CD141+ DCs express Batf3 and IRF8 and lack expression of IRF4, akin to mouse cDC1s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the differentiation of human haematopoietic progenitors into CD141+ DCs occurs only when Flt3L is added to the cultures, and inhibition of Batf3 in these cultures abolishes the differentiation of CD141+ DCs but not of CD1c+ DCs, suggesting that CD141+ DCs are indeed developmentally related to mouse cDC1s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Importantly, DCs of distinct cellular origin have been shown to display a differential functional specialization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While cDC1s are specialized in the induction of cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) responses, cDC2s have been shown to excel at the induction of Th17 or Th2 responses13,21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the migratory potential of Mo-DCs is debated, they have been proposed to reactivate effector T cells in inflamed tissues13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether the various functions ascribed to TADCs are in fact performed by distinct DC subsets is unknown, but the recent elegant report of cDC1 presence in tumours24 emphasizes that the tumour tissue may, like any other tissue, be populated by DCs with distinct developmental origin and possibly a differential functional specialization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a matter of fact, subpopulations of tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) with distinct functions have been identified25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we aimed to investigate the generation and function of ontogenically distinct DC populations and to assess their potential for inducing anti-tumour responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data unveil the complexity of the TADC compartment, which is for the first time demonstrated to consist of both pre-cDC and monocyte-derived DC subsets in tumours, and might prove important for therapeutic interventions targeted at specific TADC subsets or their precursors.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Distinct TADC subsets derive from different precursors', 'To delineate the relative abundance of distinct tumour-associated DC (TADC) populations in solid tumours, we first employed the 3LL-R Lewis Lung Carcinoma model, which is known to be strongly infiltrated by myeloid cells26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These tumours contain a sizeable population of CD3neg CD19neg Ly6Gneg CD11chi MHC-IIhi TADCs (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Earlier studies characterized distinct DC populations based on their differential expression of CD24, CD11b, Ly6C and CD64 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this approach, three discrete TADC subsets were clearly distinguishable (Fig 1a): Ly6Clo CD64lo CD24+ CD11blo conventional TADCs (cDC1s, gate 1), Ly6Clo CD64lo CD24int-lo CD11b+ conventional TADCs (cDC2s, gate 2) and Ly6Chi CD64hi CD24int CD11b+ monocyte-derived TADCs (Mo-DCs, gate 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This situation is similar to what has been reported in several non-cancerous tissues12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Origin of different TADC subpopulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) TADCs of 12-day-old 3LL-R tumours were subdivided into (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD64neg CD24pos CD11blo cDC1s, (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD64neg CD24neg CD11bpos Ly6Clo cDC2s and (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD64pos CD24int CD11bpos Ly6Chi Mo-DCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each subset, forward scatter versus side scatter plots are shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results are representative of four independent experiments with n4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Pre-cDCs (B220CD11c+Sirpint) and monocyte precursors (CD11b+Ly6GLy6C+MHC-II) were sorted from CD45.2+ bone marrow and labelled with CellTrace.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Either 4 × 105 pre-cDCs or 1 × 106 monocytes were adoptively transferred (IV) to CD45.1 7-day-old 3LL-R tumour-bearing recipient mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three days later, tumours were processed and transferred cells were gated based on their CD45.1CD45.2+CellTrace+ phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results are representative of two independent experiments with n=24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) 3LL-R tumours were grown for 12 days in WT, CCR2-KO, Flt3L-KO and GM-CSFR KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentage of each TADC subpopulation within the total tumour single-cell suspension was determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results are representative of two independent experiments with n=6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analysis by two-way ANOVA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  *P less_than 0.05;

content of similarly sized tumours, the cDC1s were the rarest subset in all investigated models, whereas the cDC2s were always well represented (between 30.1% and 75.7% of all TADCs depending on the model) (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The greatest variability was seen among the Mo-DCs, which were only poorly present in 3LL-R and T241 tumours, but form a sizeable population in LLC-OVA, MMTV-PyMT, 3LL-S, MC38 and B16 tumours, being even the dominant TADC population in the latter three models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the TADC content of subcutaneously versus orthotopically grown 3LL-R or MC38 tumours is very comparable, suggesting that the tumour microenvironment rather than the surrounding tissue dictates TADC heterogeneity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, tumour models with a high Mo-DC content also harbour relatively more M1-like MHC-IIhigh TAMs as compared with their M2-like MHC-IIlow counterparts (high MHC-IIhigh/MHC-IIlow TAM ratio) (Fig 2c), suggesting that the microenvironment in these tumours favours the differentiation of infiltrating monocytes towards these MHC-IIhigh macrophages and DCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, MC38 tumours, which also contain a large Mo-DC population, contain a single TAM population displaying a mixed M1-like and M2-like phenotype (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correlation between Mo-DCs and MHC-IIhigh TAM presence is maintained within the same tumour model, whereby an underrepresentation of MHC-IIhigh TAMs and a gradual accumulation of MHC-IIlow TAMs in the course of tumour growth is paralleled by a reduced percentage of Mo-DCs, as illustrated by the 3LL-R model (Fig 2d and Supplementary Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the total percentage of 3LL-R-infiltrating TADCs increases during tumour growth (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, 3LL-S tumours are invariably dominated by MHC-IIhigh TAMs (within the TAM compartment) and Mo-DCs (within the TADC compartment) throughout tumour growth and the percentage of TADCs did not change (Supplementary Fig 2B,C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The distinct TADC subsets are also present in human tumours', 'To translate our original findings to the human situation, the presence of distinct TADC subpopulations was assessed in fresh tumour biopsies of lung and colorectal cancer patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small amounts of CD16 CD11c+ HLA-DR+ TADCs were retrieved from human tumours (Fig 3a,b and Supplementary Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, this TADC compartment encompassed three distinct subsets, highly reminiscent of the murine TADC subsets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human TADCs contained a BDCA2 BDCA1 IRF8+ CD14 CD11blow cDC1 population, which also expressed the other commonly used cDC1 marker BDCA3 (Supplementary Fig 3B), and a BDCA2 IRF8- BDCA1+ TADC fraction, which consisted of two subsets with differential CD14 and CD11b expression (Fig 3a,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As previously suggested33, these consist of a CD14 CD11b+ cDC2 population and a CD14+ CD11bhigh DC population, analogous to murine Mo-DCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, no BDCA2+ plasmacytoid DCs could be retrieved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: The presence of distinct TADC subsets can be recapitulated in human tumours.

been described as tolerogenic or immunosuppressive cells with impaired antigen presenting, T-cell stimulating and migratory capacities, enabling tumour immune escape4,10,34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, it could be postulated that distinct TADC subsets exert different functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In first instance, we investigated the antigen uptake, processing and presenting capacities by the three distinct TADC populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Their inherent phagocytic capacity was tested in vitro by adding fluorescent latex beads to 3LL-R tumour single-cell suspensions at 37 °C (active phagocytosis) or at 4 °C (Supplementary Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All TADC subsets were able to ingest latex beads at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when compared with the total TADC population, the proportion of cells within the latex+ TADC population only increased for the Mo-DC subset, signifying that this population was more phagocytic than both cDC types (Supplementary Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, when performing an in vivo phagocytosis assay by injecting fluorescent latex beads intravenously into tumour-bearing mice 2 h before removing the tumour, the Mo-DCs were again overrepresented within the latex+ population, corroborating their superior phagocytic capacity in vivo (Supplementary Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The uptake of relatively large beads by phagocytosis is mechanistically distinct from the uptake of protein antigens, such as ovalbumin (OVA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adding fluorescently labelled OVA to 3LL-R tumour single-cell suspensions for 15 min at 4 and 37 °C (active Ag uptake) revealed that all TADC subsets were able to ingest OVA at 37 °C (Fig 4a), but that Mo-DCs again showed a higher Ag uptake capacity compared with both cDC types (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further test OVA processing by the different TADC subsets, 3LL-R tumour single-cell suspensions were incubated with DQ-OVA for 15 min, allowing antigen uptake.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'DCs are a heterogeneous population of cells and the coexistence of developmentally and functionally distinct DC subsets was reported in different organs, such as the skin, intestine and lung11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using precursor transfer experiments and Flt3L- and CCR2-deficient mice, we demonstrated for the first time the coexistence of three developmentally distinct TADC subsets: pre-cDC-derived cDC1s, pre-cDC-derived cDC2s and monocyte-derived Mo-DCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dissection of MHC-IIhigh CD11c+ CD11b+ cells in cDC2s and Mo-DCs might explain the slight expression of the monocyte/macrophage related markers CD64 and MerTK in the ontogenically mixed CD11b+ TADC population described by Broz et al.24', 'Moreover, using markers confirmed by previously published transcriptome analysis defining human inflammatory monocyte derived DCs33, the coexistence of cDC1s, cDC2s and Mo-DCs was suggested in freshly isolated tumour biopsies of human lung and colorectal cancer patients, indicating the therapeutic relevance of dissecting the DC compartment in tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Since TAMs make up the bulk of the monocyte-derived intratumoral cells, the question arises which microenvironmental cues instruct a monocyte to become a macrophage-like or a DC-like cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, it is interesting to note that tumours containing higher amounts of Mo-DCs were also infiltrated with a higher amount of MHC-IIhigh M1-like TAMs, at the expense of MHC-IIlow M2-like TAMs, suggesting that these differentiation pathways employ overlapping signals25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of Mo-DCs, Flt3L and GM-CSFR appear both instrumental for their differentiation, while MHC-IIhigh TAMs are influenced by GM-CSFR42, but not Flt3L.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The involvement of GM-CSFR in the generation of tumour-associated Mo-DCs is remarkable, as it disagrees with the GM-CSFR-independent generation of inflammatory monocyte-derived DCs in infectious models of acute inflammation17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be explained by the more chronic, smoldering type of inflammation in the tumour microenvironment, or, alternatively, Mo-DC generation may depend on the presence of cDCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this scenario, Flt3L and GM-CSFR would contribute to cDC generation, which subsequently instruct monocyte-to-Mo-DC differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the presence of cDC1s and cDC2s seemed dependent on a combination of both Flt3L and GM-CSFR signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, it was previously shown that the combined loss of GM-CSF and Flt3L generates a much greater decrease in cDCs than the loss of Flt3L alone29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Intracellular staining for IRF4 and IRF8 further corroborated the heterogeneity of the TADC compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High levels of IRF8 were detected in tumour-associated cDC1s and of IRF4 in tumour-associated cDC2s, suggesting their kinship to cDC1s and cDC2s found in several organs, respectively30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IRF8 also regulates the inflammatory profile of M1 macrophages43, but inflammatory Mo-DCs only express intermediate levels of IRF8, as well as IRF4, suggestive of other transcription factor(s) stimulating Mo-DC development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It was previously described that TADCs differ at the functional level at different phases of tumour growth7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we showed that the relative proportions of distinct TADC subsets evolve during tumour progression, which could at least partly explain a change in function over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, although all TADC subsets express high levels of costimulatory molecules and intrinsically possess the capacity to activate naive T cells in an MLR, Mo-DCs outcompeted cDCs for antigen uptake, both in vitro and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Mo-DCs sorted from LLC-OVA tumours were inefficient inducers of naive OVA-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, they efficiently suppressed polyclonally- or OVA-stimulated T-cell proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could be linked to their tolerogenic IL-10high TIP-DC phenotype and high production of immune suppressive molecules, such as NO and the mitochondrial superoxide anion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Mo-DCs, unlike both cDC subsets, failed to upregulate CCR7 in tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, Mo-DCs efficiently scavenge tumour antigen, but are unable to migrate to the tdLN, and contribute to an immunosuppressive environment at the tumour site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Conversely, we could show that cDCs sorted from tdLNs of LLC-OVA tumour-bearing mice could stimulate OVA-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses, indicative for in vivo migration of antigen-loaded cDCs from the tumour to the tdLNs, in line with the high CCR7 expression of these cells and as recently shown in other models44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, cDC2s, either isolated from the tumour site or from tdLNs, were unique in their Th17-inducing capacity, which is likely to be linked with their high production of the Th17-inducing cytokines IL-23, IL-1 and IL-6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Th17-inducing capacity of this DC subset has also been reported in the mucosa21,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, tumours contain both suppressive Mo-DCs and fully functional, mature cDC subsets, the latter being of interest for therapeutic purposes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Throughout the past decade, the use of patient-derived DCs as a means to elicit therapeutically relevant immune responses in cancer patients has been extensively investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, DCs used for vaccination are commonly generated from peripheral blood monocytes and might thus be reprogrammed by the tumour microenvironment into suppressive Mo-DCs45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess whether tumour-associated cDC subsets could be amenable to elicit relevant immune memory responses in cancer, we isolated these cells from LLC-OVA tumours to immunize mice, without ex vivo stimulation or antigen loading of the sorted tumour-derived cDCs, prior to a challenge with LLC-OVA or B16-OVA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LLC tumours are heavily infiltrated by M2-oriented TAMs, which are mainly recruited to hypoxic tumour areas and prohibit anti-tumour immunity25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reprogramming of these macrophages, for example, by preventing their entry into hypoxic sites has been shown to initiate a cascade of anti-tumour events resulting in reduced tumour growth47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  B16 tumours, on the other hand, are poorly infiltrated by myeloid cells, whose contribution to tumour growth is rather minor48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, cDC2 vaccination led to a reduced LLC-OVA, but not B16-OVA, tumour growth paralleled by an increased infiltration of RORt+ CD4+ T cells, a reduction of monocytic and granulocytic MDSCs and a reprogramming of TAMs from a protumoral M2-like MHC-IIlow to an antitumoral M1-like MHC-IIhigh phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Th17 cells are crucial for this antitumoral effect of cDC2 vaccination, but the exact downstream mechanisms still need elucidation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Th17-associated cytokine IL-21 was reported to shift TAMs from M2-like to M1-like cells in breast tumours49, but effects of IL-17 on TAM polarization were not reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, GM-CSF was recently shown to regulate the M1-like phenotype of TAMs50 and is coming to the forefront as a Th17 signature cytokine51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, cDC2 vaccination does not increase the number of SIINFEKL-specific CTL in tumours compared with non-vaccinated mice, but increases the IFN production by these cells, explaining the partial contribution of CD8+ T cells to the success of vaccination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, cDC2 vaccination does not significantly influence B16-OVA tumour growth, the control of which may be more strictly dependent on OVA-specific CTLs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with the antitumoral immune responses induced by cDC1s in melanomas53, our cDC1 vaccination increases the proportion of intratumoral CTLs resulting in a significant reduction of B16-OVA tumour growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of effect on LLC-OVA tumours is likely due to the dominance of immunosuppressive cell types, such as M2-like TAMs and MDSCs, in the environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proposed vaccination strategy holds promise as a beneficial follow-up therapy, where genuine tumour-derived cDCs could be sorted from postoperative, primary tumour tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, the absolute number of TADCs required in our vaccination approach was very low (104 cells) compared with similar reports applying DC vaccination (with 105 to 3 × 106 cells), as either prophylactic or therapeutic strategies54,55,56,57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, unlike most DC-based anti-tumour approaches currently under investigation, knowledge of the immunodominant tumour antigen is no prerequisite for this TADC vaccination strategy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we unraveled the coexistence of ontogenically and functionally distinct TADC subsets, which can facilitate the design of therapeutic interventions targeted at specific TADC subsets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, cDC1s are needed to boost anti-tumour CTLs, which may not work efficiently in tumours dominated by MDSCs and M2-oriented TAMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, cDC2s may help in eliminating MDSCs and shifting the TAM phenotype from M2-like to M1-like.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
