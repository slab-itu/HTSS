Archaeogenomic evidence reveals prehistoric matrilineal dynasty  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'For societies with writing systems, hereditary leadership is documented as one of the hallmarks of early political complexity and governance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, it is unknown whether hereditary succession played a role in the early formation of prehistoric complex societies that lacked writing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use an archaeogenomic approach to identify an elite matriline that persisted between 800 and 1130 CE in Chaco Canyon, the centre of an expansive prehistoric complex society in the Southwestern United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that nine individuals buried in an elite crypt at Pueblo Bonito, the largest structure in the canyon, have identical mitochondrial genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses of nuclear genome data from six samples with the highest DNA preservation demonstrate motherdaughter and grandmothergrandson relationships, evidence for a multigenerational matrilineal descent group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results demonstrate the persistence of an elite matriline in Chaco for 330 years.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Major advances in ancient DNA and genomic sequencing approaches have recently transformed our understanding of modern human and archaic hominin admixture1,2, dynamic population turnover in the European Upper Paleolithic and Neolithic3,4,5 and the peopling of the Americas6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use these methods, in combination with high-precision accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) 14C dating, to document the hereditary origins of a long-lasting elite lineage at Pueblo Bonito in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico (USA), the political and ritual centre of one of North Americas earliest complex societies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hereditary leadership formed the basis of the earliest historically recorded complex societies around the world8, but the cultural evolutionary foundations of these systems are unknown elsewhere because of the absence of writing in societies like Chaco.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Pueblo Bonito was the largest (650 rooms, Fig 1) of more than a dozen, multistoried masonry buildings, referred to as great houses, in Chaco Canyon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From 800 to 1130 CE, remarkable population expansion occurred in much of the Pueblo World, but Chaco was unusual because of the coalescence of some communities into a concentration of great houses ranging in size between 50 and 650 rooms9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By the end of the ninth century CE, there were no fewer than three of these multistoried great houses in the canyon, including Pueblo Bonito.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bonito itself and the human presence in the canyon expanded rapidly in the eleventh and early twelfth centuries CE, including the construction of at least 10 new great houses and scores of outlying settlements that adopted Chacoan architectural style10, some connected by roads indicating significant investment in political and ritual infrastructure (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was followed by a rapid decline in construction and the almost complete depopulation of the canyon by 1130 CE9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Photographs and maps of Pueblo Bonito and surrounding Chacoan sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Photograph and plan view map of Pueblo Bonito with the location of room 33 noted (photo: G.

scores of cylindrical ceramic vessels; the remains of scarlet macaws (Ara macao); and jewelry20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we use archaeogenomic methods, in combination with high-precision AMS 14C dating, to demonstrate that all nine of the successfully sampled individuals who were buried in this elaborate crypt have identical mitochondrial genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses of nuclear genome data from the six individuals with the highest DNA preservation demonstrate motherdaughter and grandmothergrandson relationships consistent with matrilineal descent in this elite lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results indicate that hereditary inequality and societal complexity emerged in Chaco by the early ninth century CE and that this matrilineal dynasty persisted at the centre of this complex society for 330 years until its rapid collapse in the early twelfth century CE.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The use of room 33constructed as an elaborate burial crypt in what became the largest great house in the regionprovides evidence for the early hereditary basis of leadership in the Chaco World.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the combination of the relatedness estimates from the nuclear genome data, our high-precision AMS 14C dates, and osteological and genetic-based estimates of sex and ages of the room 33 individuals, we infer that two generations separated the individuals whose remains have been identified as cranium 8 (3040-year-old female) and cranium 10 (3035-year-old male), suggesting a grandmothergrandson relationship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only one generation separated the individuals identified as cranium 1 (3545-year-old female) and cranium 7 (2327-year-old female), suggesting a motherdaughter relationship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both of these observations are consistent with the importance of close matrilineal ties among those interred in the room (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although hereditary relationships have been explored elsewhere in historic contexts using short-tandem repeat genotyping26,27,28, to our knowledge this is the first study using genome-wide data to document hereditary relationships among individuals within an elite lineage using archaeogenomics, in the absence of a written record, anywhere in the world.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Diagram of a hypothetical Chacoan matriline.The diagram illustrates the inferred relationships for at least two pairs of individuals interred in room 33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Matriline members and descent are highlighted in red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lineal relationships (motherdaughter and motherson) and sibling relationships are first degree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The blue * shows the grandmothergrandson relationship suggested for crania 8 and 10 and the blue ** indicates the motherdaughter relationship suggested between crania 1 and 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ethnographically, matrilineal systems are present in all the Western Pueblos (Hopi, Zuni, Acoma, Laguna), and also among Rio Grande Keresans (see Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Graphical layout: T.

macaws over a shorter interval21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For room 33, we do observe that a few gaps in the 14C ages do correspond to periods where the calibration curve is relatively steep, and therefore are likely artefacts of the curve rather than pauses in interment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the simulations indicate the observed 14C ages of room 33 are consistent with continuous rather than episodic
