Foxa2 identifies a cardiac progenitor population with ventricular differentiation potential  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The recent identification of progenitor populations that contribute to the developing heart in a distinct spatial and temporal manner has fundamentally improved our understanding of cardiac development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mechanisms that direct atrial versus ventricular specification remain largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the identification of a progenitor population that gives rise primarily to cardiovascular cells of the ventricles and only to few atrial cells ( less_than 5%) of the differentiated heart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These progenitors are specified during gastrulation, when they transiently express Foxa2, a gene not previously implicated in cardiac development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, Foxa2+ cells contribute to previously identified progenitor populations in a defined pattern and ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, we describe an analogous Foxa2+ population during differentiation of embryonic stem cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these findings provide insight into the developmental origin of ventricular and atrial cells, and may lead to the establishment of new strategies for generating chamber-specific cell types from pluripotent stem cells.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Heart development is a complex morphogenetic process that integrates cells from multiple origins into a well-organized structure1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correct specification of progenitor populations and the ability of these cells to respond to spatiotemporal cues in the early embryo are critical for successful formation of the four-chambered heart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Errors in this process can result in congenital heart defects, which affect about 8 in 1,000 newborns and over 1 million adults in the United States alone3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although treatments for some of these defects have improved, the underlying causes remain poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing our understanding of the morphogenesis and cellular origin of the heart will advance our knowledge of how heart defects occur, as well as provide an important framework for designing better in vitro models and regenerative approaches using pluripotent stem cell (PSC) systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Research in mouse, chick and zebrafish has identified four main progenitor populations that give rise to distinct areas of the mature heart: the first and second heart fields (FHF and SHF), neural crest cells, and the proepicardial organ (PEO)2,7,8,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FHF and SHF give rise to the majority of the heart, with the left ventricle, most of the atria and part of the right ventricle (RV) deriving from the FHF, and the SHF giving rise to the RV, outflow tract and part of the atria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, these progenitor pools are defined by their spatial arrangement during heart tube morphogenesis rather than by their specific cell fate potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of these progenitor populations contributes to the heart in a strictly chamber-specific manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distinct morphological and functional differences between atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes raise the question as to whether chamber-specific progenitor populations exist before atrial and ventricular differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the lack of tools and paucity of molecular information has thus far not allowed for a definitive confirmation of this intriguing hypothesis, nor for the isolation and detailed characterization of atrial and ventricular progenitor populations and the underlying mechanisms regulating their specification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Several selective fate-mapping studies have identified cardiac progenitors at the gastrulation stage, further implying early specification of the cardiac lineages12,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies suggest that the cardiac mesoderm (CM) is formed from the posterior epiblast and migrates anteriorly, where it takes up residence beneath the head folds to form the cardiac crescent (CC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Retrospective clonal analysis revealed common origins for myocardial cells in multiple regions of the developing heart, supporting the proposed early emergence of specified cardiac progenitors9,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Explant experiments in the avian model system and fate mapping in the fish have suggested that atrial and ventricular cells are specified during gastrulation and defined by their anteroposterior position in the primitive streak (PS)14,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recent lineage tracing experiments using Mesp1 or regulatory regions for Smarcd3 identified cells during gastrulation that have already acquired a cardiac fate20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these efforts have greatly advanced our knowledge of the timing of heart specification, many open questions remain with respect to the mechanistic regulation of these early migration and specification events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we provide evidence that transient expression of Foxa2 during gastrulation labels a progenitor population that gives rise selectively to cardiovascular cells of both ventricles, as well as to epicardial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, Foxa2 lineage tracing enables the visualization and isolation of prospective ventricular cells throughout development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis at the CC stage shortly before cardiac differentiation and formation of the primitive heart tube (PHT) reveals Foxa2 lineage-traced ventricular progenitors in a distinct localization that overlaps with both FHF and SHF cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Foxa2 is a pioneer transcription factor active during gastrulation and previously implicated primarily in endoderm and ectoderm lineage specification22,23,24, but not in heart development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using mixed chimera experiments we show that Foxa2 seems to be required for the normal development of ventricular cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, translation of our findings to the mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) system identified an analogous Foxa2-derived CM population during differentiation to cardiomyocytes and demonstrates reduced cardiac differentiation potential of Foxa2-deficient embryonic stem cells (mESCs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data provide an approach to genetically label a ventricular cardiac progenitor population as early as during gastrulation, enabling the isolation and characterization of prospective ventricular cells at any stage during development.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Foxa2+ cells at gastrulation give rise to cardiac ventricles', 'Long-standing evidence and recent work both suggest that cardiac specification events occur before the establishment of the PHT during mammalian development14,19,20,21,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the key regulators of these cell-fate specification events have been challenging to study, largely due to the inability to prospectively identify early chamber-specific progenitor populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify such cardiac progenitor populations during early embryogenesis, we turned our attention to genes that are known to be critical for cell-fate specification events during gastrulation and that are expressed in the prospective mesoderm in the PS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An analysis of early expression patterns revealed that the pioneer transcription factor Foxa2 is present in the epiblast underlying the anterior PS region (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, as Foxa2 is an organizer gene, its expression domain overlaps with the areas derived from the organizer, including CM27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the embryo develops, Foxa2 protein is rapidly downregulated in the anterior PS and is restricted to the node, midline and endoderm, as expected (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate whether Foxa2-expressing cells will contribute to cardiac structures later during development, we used a recently established Foxa2 lineage-tracing model (Fig 1c)28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice that express Cre recombinase under control of the endogenous Foxa2 promoter through use of the autocleaving 2A linker, Foxa2T2AiCre (Foxa2Cre)28, were crossed to Rosa26-tdTomato (tdT) reporter mice29,30, to generate Foxa2Cre:tdT lineage-tracing mice in which endogenous Foxa2 expression remains undisturbed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Foxa2Cre:tdT mice, cells that have expressed Foxa2 at any time during their development will remain tdT positive, irrespective of endogenous Foxa2 expression at later stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Lineage tracing of Foxa2-expressing cells during mouse development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) Representative confocal images of WMIF of E7.0 (a) and E7.75 (b) embryos with antibodies against Foxa2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Embryos were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to label nuclei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arrowhead shows the presumptive cardiogenic region of the PS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars, 75 m.

gastrulation (E7.5), tdT+ cells are found predominantly in the node, midline, and visceral and definitive endoderm, as expected, as well as in a region that corresponds to migrating mesoderm cells (Fig 1d, arrowhead).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, tdT+ cells can further be observed on the anterior side of the embryo in the CC region at E8.25 (Fig 1e, arrowhead).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At E8.5, when the PHT begins to form, tdT+ cells are present in the ventral region of the PHT, indicating contribution of Foxa2-expressing cells to the forming heart and distinct localization of these cells early during cardiac morphogenesis (Fig 1f, arrowhead).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the heart continues to develop into a regionalized structure with four distinct chambers (E9.517.5), tdT+ cells become localized to the ventricular chambers, a pattern that persists throughout development (Fig 1gj).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identical lineage-tracing patterns are observed with a different reporter allele (Rosa26-YFP)31 crossed to the Foxa2Cre line (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Live en face images, as well as sections and immunofluorescence (IF) analysis of the corresponding time points further illustrate the distinct distribution of Foxa2Cre:tdT linage-traced cells (Supplementary Figs 2 and 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, endogenous Foxa2 expression is not detected in any cardiac structures from E8.5 onwards (Supplementary Fig 3ac), confirming that Foxa2 is not expressed in cardiomyocytes, and suggesting that Foxa2 lineage-traced, ventricular cells (tdT+) are derived from a population preceding the differentiated heart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As Foxa2 lineage-traced cells present in the PHT no longer express Foxa2 (Supplementary Fig 3ac), we next sought to determine the precise time of occurrence of the Foxa2+ cardiac progenitor population during development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we performed inducible lineage tracing by crossing mice carrying a tamoxifen (Tam)-inducible Cre recombinase expressed under the control of the endogenous Foxa2 promoter32 with Rosa26-tdT mice (Foxa2CreER:tdT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We injected Tam at distinct time points during development (E6.5E8.5) and embryos were analysed at E12.5 to assess the distribution of tdT+ cells in the heart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tam injection at E6.5 results in the presence of tdT+ cells in both ventricular chambers but not the atria of the heart, consistent with the pattern observed in the constitutive Foxa2 lineage-tracing embryos (Fig 1k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, embryos injected with Tam at E7.5 or later were devoid of tdT+ cells in the heart (Fig 1l,m), supporting the hypothesis that Foxa2 expression in cardiac progenitor cells is transient and occurs during gastrulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the labelling efficiency using inducible lineage tracing is lower compared with lineage tracing with the constitutively active Foxa2Cre line, likely due to the low doses of Tam (0.05 mg g1) that are required to avoid toxicity to the developing embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the maintained expression of Foxa2 in the liver and lung throughout development, tdT+ cells can readily be observed in these organs when Tam is injected at the later time points (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, these data confirm that Foxa2-expressing progenitor cells with ventricular differentiation potential, hereafter referred to as Foxa2-vCPs, are specified during gastrulation, and that later expression of Foxa2 is excluded from the differentiated cardiovascular lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our data describe a unique progenitor cell population during gastrulation that is marked by the expression of a single gene, Foxa2, and that distinctly segregates into atrialventricular chambers later in development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Foxa2-vCPs contribute to cardiac mesoderm', 'To confirm the transient nature of Foxa2 expression in Foxa2-vCPs, we analysed Foxa2Cre:tdT lineage-traced embryos at different stages of development for endogenous Foxa2 protein expression via flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, all tdT+ cells also express endogenous Foxa2 during gastrulation (Fig 2a, E7.25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At slightly later stages, in addition to the Foxa2+tdT+ cells (Fig 2a, E8.25, P1), a subpopulation of tdT+ cells emerges that no longer expresses endogenous Foxa2 protein (Fig 2a, E8.25, P2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When investigating the expression of the mesoderm marker Pdgfra and the endoderm marker Epcam33, many of the Foxa2+tdT+ (P1) cells co-express Epcam, suggesting partial endoderm identity of this population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Foxa2-tdT+ (P2) cells do not express Epcam but contain a subpopulation of cells expressing Pdgfra, indicating a mesodermal identity (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transient Foxa2 expression was further confirmed by whole-mount IF (WMIF) of Foxa2Cre:YFP embryos for yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and Foxa2 at E7.75, which again illustrates the presence of both Foxa2+YFP+ and Foxa2-YFP+ cell populations (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To facilitate visualization of these populations, surface renderings were generated based on the confocal images in Fig 2c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These renderings clearly show that endogenous Foxa2 is restricted to the midline of the developing embryo, whereas the YFP+ region extends laterally from the anterior side (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further investigate the mesoderm identity of the Foxa2-derived cells, we crossed Foxa2Cre:tdT mice to Pdgfra-H2B-GFP mice34 (Supplementary Fig 5a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WMIF analysis of E7.5 Foxa2Cre:tdT/Pdgfra-H2B-GFP embryos with antibodies for endogenous Foxa2 revealed Foxa2+tdT+ (Foxa2-expressing endoderm and ectoderm lineages) and GFP+tdT (Pdgfra-expressing mesoderm) populations, as expected, and that endogenous Foxa2 and Pdgfra expression are largely exclusive (Supplementary Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we do observe GFP+tdT+ cells, primarily located at the anterior side of the embryo, where the CC is forming at that stage during development (Supplementary Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

regions that fall within each of the areas of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A surface rendering was then generated for the masked YFP signal (Fig 4c,e and Supplementary Movies 6 and 7, note that presented colours do not indicate channel merges).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The volume of the YFP surface was calculated and compared with the volume of each of the reference surfaces and is displayed as a percentage of total volume (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on this analysis we conclude that 50% of the total CC (Nkx25+) is derived from Foxa2-vCPs, consistent with the contribution of Foxa2-vCPs at the CM stage (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the same analysis we conclude that Foxa2-vCPs give rise to a majority of the FHF and about half of the SHF (Fig 4f); this is consistent with the ventricular differentiation potential of the Foxa2-vCP population, as the FHF gives rise primarily to the LV, while the SHF gives rise to the RV in addition to other regions of the heart2,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further support our image-based volumetric analysis, we additionally performed flow cytometric analysis for Foxa2-vCP-derived cells and the CC regions of individual E8.25 embryos using antibodies

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Clonal analysis has suggested that regional segregation and lineage restriction of cardiac progenitors occurs early during gastrulation20,21, which is in accordance with fate maps generated in the fish, chick and mouse embryos13,16,19,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This segregation appears to occur largely along the FHF and SHF lineages, and thus atrialventricular boundaries have remained elusive to date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through genetic lineage tracing we have identified a progenitor population that specifically develops into the cardiovascular cells of both ventricles of the differentiated heart but not the atria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, this ventricular-specific progenitor population emerges during gastrulation and our data thus strongly support previous hypotheses that atrialventricular segregation occurs long before the establishment of differentiated cardiac structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Intriguingly, the newly identified progenitor population expresses Foxa2, a gene primarily associated with endoderm and ectoderm development22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During gastrulation, Foxa2 is expressed in the posterior epiblast underlying the anterior PS27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data support a model for cardiac development in which Foxa2-vCPs are the first cardiogenic cells that migrate to the anterior side of the embryo during gastrulation, when they comprise approximately half of the CM population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the anterior side, these progenitors contribute to large parts of the CC structure in a highly defined pattern that overlaps with both FHF and SHF domains.

spatial relationship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis at the CC stage, when FHF and SHF populations occur, illustrates that Foxa2-vCPs contribute to both of these progenitor populations in a defined

shown that ventricular development is highly sensitive and relies on proper execution of the specification and differentiation programmes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Namely, in the absence of Foxa2, ventricular progenitor specification is compromised and perturbation of these progenitors through either loss of a key member of the cardiac gene regulatory network (Islet1), or modulation of the signalling environment (RA) leads to morphogenetic errors during early heart development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although functional assays are challenging at these early stages due to possible confounding effects of Islet1 loss-of-function in endoderm cells, or due to general patterning defects in RA-treated embryos, they nevertheless reveal the investigative power of this new model system and progenitor
