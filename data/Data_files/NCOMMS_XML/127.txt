Ternary structure reveals mechanism of a membrane diacylglycerol kinase  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Diacylglycerol kinase catalyses the ATP-dependent conversion of diacylglycerol to phosphatidic acid in the plasma membrane of Escherichia coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The small size of this integral membrane trimer, which has 121 residues per subunit, means that available protein must be used economically to craft three catalytic and substrate-binding sites centred about the membrane/cytosol interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How nature has accomplished this extraordinary feat is revealed here in a crystal structure of the kinase captured as a ternary complex with bound lipid substrate and an ATP analogue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residues, identified as essential for activity by mutagenesis, decorate the active site and are rationalized by the ternary structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The -phosphate of the ATP analogue is positioned for direct transfer to the primary hydroxyl of the lipid whose acyl chain is in the membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A catalytic mechanism for this unique enzyme is proposed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The active site architecture shows clear evidence of having arisen by convergent evolution.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Diacylglycerol kinase (DgkA) is the smallest known kinase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Escherichia coli, it is responsible for the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent phosphorylation of diacylglycerol (DAG) to phosphatidic acid used in periplasm membrane-derived oligosaccharide synthesis in response to osmotic shock1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enzyme has long served as a model for integral membrane enzymology1,2,3, folding4,5,6, assembly7,8,9 and stability10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is a trimer with three active sites of the shared sites type that exhibits moderate positive heteroallostery, random-binding kinetics and lipid substrate promiscuity1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'High-resolution X-ray structures of wild-type (WT) and functional thermostable mutants (4, 7) of DgkA were obtained using protein crystallized in a membrane environment by the lipid cubic phase (LCP) or in meso method12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to a solution NMR structure that displayed domain swapping13, the crystallized kinase showed a simple quaternary arrangement in which adjacent monomers created shared active sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considerable effort was devoted to demonstrating that the enzyme was functionally active in the crystal12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the model included a lipid substrate, a monoacylglycerol (7.8 MAG), its functional relevance remained uncertain in the absence of a nucleotide bound structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report such a structure, along with mutagenesis studies, molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) and density functional theory (DFT) modelling, which explain a wealth of biochemical and biophysical data and support a mechanism for direct transphosphorylation by this diminutive kinase.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Crystallization and overall structure', 'Because DgkA was crystallized in the LCP composed of MAGs (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14), which double as lipid substrates15, solving a structure with ATP bound was impossible  the enzyme turns over catalytically as soon as nucleotide is added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the enzyme was co-crystallized with the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue, adenylylmethylenediphosphonate (ACP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Producing structure-grade crystals of the complex involved extensive screening of protein constructs and crystallization conditions including host lipid MAGs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Best crystals, providing a ternary complex structure with ACP and lipid bound at 2.7 Å resolution (Table 1), were obtained with 4-DgkA grown in 9.9 MAG at 4 °C and soaked with zinc-ACP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Crystallization conditions, data collection and refinement statistics.Full size table', 'Like the apo-enzyme12, the ternary complex is a homo-trimer (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each subunit has four helices, three of which are largely membrane embedded (H1-3), whereas the fourth, an N-terminal amphiphilic surface helix (SH), anchors the protein at the membrane interface (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stereo images of individual subunit models and the electron density on which the models are based are shown in Supplementary Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H2 and H3 extend out of the membrane and are connected by a cytosolic loop (CL) whose conformation and sequence position in the protein differ between subunits in ways that may have functional consequences (Supplementary Fig 3), as discussed below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual subunits are identified suA, suB and suC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trimer has three active sites of the shared sites type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each site has contributions from two subunits, identified asAB, asBC and asCA, where asAB is created by the SH of suA and H1-3 of suB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the complex, asBC has zinc-ACP and lipid bound (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other two sites are nucleotide-free.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Overall structure of the DgkA-ACP-lipid ternary complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

is secured by electrostatic, hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions along its length on the relatively flat, cytosol-exposed surface of H2C and H3C (Fig 1a,c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enzyme has a requirement for metal ions, known to be satisfied by zinc16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two zinc atoms (Zn1, Zn2) bound to ACP were identified and positioned in the complex by anomalous scattering (Fig

the side-chain carboxyl of the essential Asp95C (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These contribute to substrate binding and specificity, and explain why 2-deoxy-ATP, with one less hydroxyl anchor to the protein, is a considerably poorer substrate2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydrophobic interactions between the non-polar surface of the ribose and the methylenes of Lys94C, itself a critical residue9,13 (Fig 2b), contribute to fixing the ribose in place and to having it correctly oriented (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Substrate-binding sites of DgkA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Binding of the adenosine of

observed for the side chains of Arg9 and Glu28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, interactions with zinc-ACP, of the type noted, were seen with both residues in MDS (Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) The putative active site of DgkA where the catalytic residue Glu69C, ACP and lipid substrate MAG1 meet in asBC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The glycerol headgroup of MAG1 could not be oriented unambiguously in the active site based on the available electron density maps, even at 2.05 Å resolution (Supplementary Fig 4ad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the interactions between MAG1 and the enzyme are shown as dashed lines only and without specifying distances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orientation shown, with the 1-OH in hydrogen-bonding distance to the carboxyl group of Glu69, is plausible in light of a careful consideration of the available maps and the nature of the lipid substrate and the reaction being catalysed.Full size image', 'The purine ring of ACP is locked in position by hydrogen bonds between the N1 and N6 of adenine and the backbone linkage of His87C and Glu85C, respectively, in CLC (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such backbone-adenine interactions form the basis of nucleotide recognition by analogy with base pairing in nucleic acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Backbone interactions are relatively residue non-specific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This explains mutagenesis work where neither residue was identified as essential (Fig 2b and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between Glu85 and His87 is Tyr86C whose tyrosyl ring hovers close to the adenyl of ACP poised for  stacking to lock adenine firmly against the protein (Supplementary Fig 3c,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We refer to these three sequential residues as the clamping triad.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The purine is secured too by its N7 interaction with the -amino of Lys94C, which also interacts with the -phosphate of ATP, and is tethered in place by a salt bridge with Asp80C (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, this position is, by contrast, sensitive to mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with Glu85C, His87C and Asp95C, Lys94C acts like a multiply tipped pincer to lock the adenosine of ACP in a specific orientation on the protein (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measured kcat values of DgkA for guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and inosine triphosphate (ITP) are reduced by orders of magnitude compared with ATP (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This purine selectivity makes sense in light of the ternary structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, replacing the N6 in adenine with an O6 in guanine or inosine would lead to unfavourable interactions between the two purines and adjacent backbone carbonyls of Gly83, Ser84, Glu85 and Val79.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clear evidence of instability with GTP was observed by MDS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, the crystal structure is not compatible with tight pyrimidine nucleotide binding, consistent with the observation that while adenine nucleotides dissolved crystals of DgkA, cytidine triphosphate (CTP), uridine triphosphate (UTP) and thymidine triphosphate (TTP) did not12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MDS show that ATP is extremely stably bound with the same orientation and interactions as ACP in the crystal structure (Fig 4a and Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ACP is therefore a reliable ATP analogue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Changes in the active site of the DgkA ternary complex at the beginning and end of a 100-ns MDS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) WT simulation of ATP based on the ACP coordinates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are limited differences in the binding site between the start (grey) and end (colour) of the MDS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) E28A mutation (red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This principally affects the binding of the Zn2 ion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of the E28 side chain the zinc ions become purely coordinated by E76 and the ATP phosphates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the entire zinc-ATP complex moves away from the protein, towards the cytoplasm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This, in turn, slightly alters the conformation of the CL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) E76A (red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compensate for the loss of E76, the zinc ions move towards the membrane to interact with E69.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pulls the ATP in the same direction and, in turn, the CL is affected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) K94A (red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The WT residue coordinates both -phosphate and N7 of the adenine ring of ATP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loss of the basic side-chain releases the adenine of ATP and the binding is lost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In WT simulations, K94 forms a salt bridge with D80 and it is expected that the loss of this bridge in the D80A mutant can also explain the loss of catalytic ability in this mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) GTP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The major difference in dynamics is observed in the CL, where the loss of the N6 hydrogen bond with the backbone of E85 destabilizes purine binding and the CL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) ADP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ADP molecule is expected to leave the binding site after catalysis has taken place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A change in zinc ion coordination takes place as Zn1 now coordinates the - and -phosphates of ADP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This relocates ADP closer to K94, which also coordinates both phosphates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In turn, K94 no longer interacts with the N7 position of the purine ring, which changes conformation, priming the ADP molecule for exit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Throughout this legend, WT refers to 4-DgkA (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12).Full size image', 'The ternary complex asBC contains two lipid substrates (MAG1, MAG2; Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MAG1 has been modelled into the electron density map with its headgroup deep in the protein positioned at the level of the membrane interface with its reactive 1-OH next to the -phosphate of ACP (Fig 1c,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MAG2 is in the putative lipid substrate-binding pocket, with its headgroup 4 Å from MAG1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their acyl chains extend into the membrane along the hydrophobic surface of the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since DAG, with two acyl chains, is the canonical lipid substrate of DgkA (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2), finding a pair of MAGs as noted, implies they demark the lipid substrate-binding site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The electron density for MAGs in the complex is variable and in parts, discontinuous (Supplementary Fig 4ad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in our studies of DgkA to date, we have crystal structures that include a total of 10 trimers with density in the active site for bound lipid that is variable (refs 12, 17 and this work).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mapping these onto a single active site makes a convincing case that lipids reside in the binding pocket (Supplementary Fig 4eg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their variable definition likely reflects acyl chain flexibility and lipid movement during reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The two other active sites in the complex lack nucleotide (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  asAB has two MAGs situated similar to those in asBC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like asBC, asAB includes an almost complete SH that creates a well-defined active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the SH of asCA is not visible in density until Ser17A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, this active site appears wide open (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It contains just one, distant MAG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Reaction mechanism', 'Mutational studies have identified residues in DgkA that impact on catalysis (refs 9, 13 and this work).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They include Thr8, Arg9, Ser17, Gly20, Glu28, Ala30, Glu34, Glu69, Asn72, Ser73, Glu76, Asp80, Gly83, Ser90, Lys94, Asp95, Gly97 and Ala100 (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Convincingly, 14 out of the 18 are proximal (5 Å) to the nucleotide and lipid substrates in the ternary complex and all are exposed to solvent during the MDS (Fig 3ac, Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They demark the substrate binding and catalytic sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The putative catalytic site resides on the protein at the membrane/cytosol interface where the reactive moieties of the two substrates, with disparate polarities, come together for reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The active site includes glutamates and an aspartate predicted to play roles in substrate binding and catalysis (Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concerns have been raised generally regarding possible X-ray damage to anionic residues18 and to irrelevant conformational substates trapped as a result of collecting diffraction data with an intense synchrotron microbeam at 100 K (refs 19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address these issues we have obtained a structure by serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) with an X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) at room temperature (RT) and ahead of radiation damage21,22,23 (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It suggests that damage and frozen conformational substates were not major issues under current conditions and that the ternary complex structure reported here is reliable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternative conformers for side chains of three critical residues, Glu34, Glu69 and Glu76, were observed in the XFEL structure at RT that may be functionally relevant, as discussed (Fig 5a,b,d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Rationalizing functional roles of highly conserved residues in DgkA not directly involved in catalysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The anionic carboxyl of Glu34C is proposed to elevate the pKa of catalytic residue Glu69C making it a stronger base for proton abstraction from the lipid (green protein carbons).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electron density (mesh) for alternative Glu34 conformers was observed in the XFEL data recorded at RT (purple carbons) that may enable a switch in pKa at Glu69.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Alternative conformations for Glu76C in the XFEL structure.

coordinating oxygen at some distance (3.8 Å, green dashed line) from Zn2 where it may facilitate product release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The polyphosphate and zinc are superimposed from the ternary complex

-phosphate oxygens, the electrophilicity of the -phosphorus is elevated making it more reactive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the amide may stabilize a transient bisubstrate by being positioned close to where the pentavalent intermediate is likely to form between the 1-OH of MAG1 and the -phosphate of ACP (dotted blue line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likely interactions between MAG1 and the enzyme are indicated by dashed lines only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Alternative conformations for Glu69 observed in the XFEL structure (magenta carbons) superimposed on the DgkA ternary structure (green carbons).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first conformation (Glu69_1) is like that seen in the ternary complex and interacts with MAG1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second (Glu69_2) extends into the membrane and may guide lipid substrate to the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) An expanded view of Glu69 in d with electron density corresponding to alternative conformers seen in the XFEL structure superposed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) The methyl side chain of Ala30C (red circle) is proposed to provide room for lipid substrate and product to pass between the start of SHB and the top of H1C that define the gateway into and out of the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CC distance from Ala30C (red circle) to Ala13B (blue circle) in asBC is 10.0 Å.Full size image', 'Convincing kinetic and biochemical evidence supports a direct, in-line phosphoryl transfer mechanism for DgkA (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in contrast to one that requires the formation of an enzyme-phosphate intermediate with subsequent phosphotransfer to the lipid substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The direct route displays a hallmark, trigonal bipyramidal phosphorus intermediate and a random kinetic pathway where one substrate does not exclude the binding of the other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, the -phosphate of ATP should be proximal to the 1-OH of the lipid substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is what was observed in the ternary complex where the two entities are poised for reaction 4 Å apart (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The separation is reminiscent of what has been interpreted for DgkA and for water-soluble kinases, where a tetraphosphate analogue of the bisubstrate (ATP-DAG in the case of DgkA) is a better inhibitor than the bisubstrate itself2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presumably, the extra space accommodates both substrates, the reactive moieties of which are brought together for reaction by a small conformational change in the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Glu69 is a conserved, essential residue in DgkA (refs 9, 13; Fig 2b, Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the liganded asBC, its carboxyl is in hydrogen-bonding distance to the 1-OH of MAG1 (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By analogy with other kinases24, we propose that Glu69 initiates catalysis by abstracting a proton from this primary hydroxyl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this configuration, the proximal Glu34C (Fig 5a, Supplementary Fig 6, and Supplementary Fig 7) is predicted to have a pKa of 7.53 and therefore will be protonated at neutral pH, acting as a hydrogen bond donor to Glu69C at rest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a stable configuration in the MDS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the hydrophobic nature of the pocket, deprotonation of Glu34C will elevate the pKa of Glu69C making it a stronger base and a better general-base catalyst.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize, therefore, that deprotonation of Glu34C is the trigger for catalysis in a substrate-loaded enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, in the XFEL structure of the apo-enzyme there are two conformations for Glu34 and Glu69.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of each conformer has a matching partner in the cryo structure described above that can be isolated from the MDS by switching the protonation states of Glu34C and Glu69C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of Glu69, the alternate conformation extends deeper into the membrane and has a predicted pKa value of 8.82.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is reflected in the MDS, where protonation of Glu69C induces a side-chain switch to this conformation and inversion of the hydrogen-bonding configuration with Glu34C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is likely to be the side-chain rotamer after the proton has been removed from the primary hydroxyl of the lipid substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, this may guide substrate lipid entering from the bilayer to the active site (Fig 5d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With Glu34, the two conformers may also provide a switch that controls the pKa and basicity of Glu69.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lipid alkoxide formed on proton abstraction is in position to attack the -phosphate of ATP which leads to the formation of the pentavalent intermediate, stabilized by Asn72C and/or Arg9B (Figs 2a, 3b and 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collapse of the intermediate severs the  linkage, generating lyso-phosphatidic acid and ADP as products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since both are negatively charged, product egress might be aided by electrostatic repulsion from anionic residues Glu69C and Glu76C in the active site, accompanied by metal-binding site rearrangement, and by cationic residues Arg9 and Lys12 in the SH proposed to draw the lipid out as the SH flexes away from the site (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On release, the active site is reset for another round of catalysis, with Glu34 reprotonating from Glu69 (Supplementary Figs 6,7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'MDS show clearly that ADP is positionally unstable in the binding site (Fig 4f, Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DFT simulations on MDS-sampled configurations displaying intimate MAG1 contacts (similar to Fig 3c) suggest that 1-OH proton abstraction by Glu69C is kinetically more accessible than phosphate cleavage (Supplementary Fig 8, Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accord with the proposed pentavalent stabilization by Asn72C and/or Arg9B (Fig 2a), the cleavage step is likely to be rate-limiting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Two MAGs have been modelled in the liganded asBC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 1-OH of MAG1 is proximal to the carboxyl of the putative catalytic Glu69C (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ser98C interacts with the 2-OH of MAG1 which, in the case of the canonical substrate DAG, would be in ester linkage to an acyl chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The carbonyl oxygen at the ester linkage in MAG1 is within hydrogen-bonding distance of critically important Ser17B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these interactions with highly conserved and/or critical residues fix the headgroup of the lipid substrate in position for proton abstraction by Glu69C and for reaction with the -phosphorus of ATP (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lipid acyl chains reside within or close to a three-walled hydrophobic pocket created by the transmembrane stretches of H1-3C (Supplementary Fig 4eg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pocket appears to use the bulky and highly conserved Trp112C (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig 1b) with the plane of its indole ring oriented, by hydrogen bonding to Ser61C in the trimer core, to create a base for the pocket below which the chains do not extend (Supplementary Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its location towards the bilayer mid-plane may contribute to defining lipid substrate chain-length preference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Comparison with other kinases', 'In support of the proposed mechanistic model, we note the striking resemblance between critical residues in the active site of DgkA and their equivalents in cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) for which a similar catalytic mechanism is well established24,25 (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To begin with, the catalytic residue in both kinases is anionic, Glu69 in DgkA and Asp166 in PKA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While magnesium is a common ATP counter-ion in kinases, zinc can serve this role in DgkA (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both zinc ions in the ternary complex bind electrostatically with the -phosphate of ACP and, by electron withdrawing effects, render the phosphorus more susceptible to attack by the lipid nucleophile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same kind of interaction is seen in PKA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lys94C coordinates with the -phosphate of ACP in a manner analogous to its counterpart, Lys72, in PKA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lys94C is stabilized in position by a critical Asp80C, just like the Lys72-Glu91 pair in PKA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The essential Glu76C chelates

the particular residue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are summarized in Fig 2b and Supplementary Table 1 along with data from separate mutational studies9,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A few notable mutants will be discussed here, as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (i) Glu69 is the putative catalytic residue in DgkA (Figs 2a and 3c), in contrast to Asp which serves that function in serine protein kinases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, Glu69 tolerated none of the mutations tested, one of which was Asp (pKa 3.8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could be a spatial effect because the side chain of Asp is too short.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may also have to do with the fact that the 1-OH in glycerides like MAG and DAG have pKa values (13.6) higher than those of PKA substrates Ser/Thr (pKa 13.0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glycerides therefore may require the carboxyl of Glu, with a pKa of 4.3, or higher enabled by nearby Glu34, for proton abstraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) The conserved Asp95 coordinates the hydroxyls of ribose in ACP, preserved throughout the MDS, and the carbonyl of Gly91 (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutating it to Ala essentially abolished activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Glu with its longer side chain did substitute but activity was reduced by 76%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, Asn had a minor effect which makes sense given that its side-chain amide can hydrogen bond with carbonyls and hydroxyls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iii) Ala30 resides on H1 in the active site entrance at the membrane interface (Fig 5f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its methyl side chain was speculated to enable lipids with small headgroups to enter the site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutating it to the bulky leucine reduced activity by 93% consistent with a putative gatekeeping role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iv) Gly83 in the CL was proposed to facilitate the helix-coil transition enabling adenine binding (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutating it to Pro was expected to compromise such activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the Gly83Pro mutant was virtually dead enzymatically; MDS show dynamic instability of the CL (Supplementary Movie 2) and (v) finally, Asn72 plays a key role in catalysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its side-chain amide bridges Glu69 and Glu76 (Fig 5c) both of which are essential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These H-bonds bridge the two essential residues throughout the MDS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Asn72Ala mutant is catalytically inactive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all intents and purposes, so too are the Asn72Gln and Asn72Asp mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data show how important both the precise chemistry and the architecture of

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'DgkA is the tiniest of kinases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With just 121 residues and a trimeric constitution, three kinase catalytic sites have been fashioned (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each acts at the membrane/cytosol interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rest of the protein creates binding pockets on either side that position the reactive ends of two large substrate molecules with dramatically different polarities in juxtaposition for reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ternary structure explains in atomic detail how the nucleotide and lipid-binding sites interact with substrate molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The many, contact site-docking defines a specific orientation for the nucleotide that presumably is optimized for transphosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particularly striking is the similarity between the binding site architecture of this bacterial DgkA and mammalian PKA (Figs 2a and 6), kinases that bear no resemblance at any other level of structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, these defined points of chemical constitution arrayed precisely in three-dimensional space have evolved independently achieving a similar end in entirely different protein contexts  a convincing case of convergent evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'DgkAs small size shows that a functioning kinase can be built with very little protein mass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ternary structure points to a minimum required for that purpose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inspecting the complex suggests that a pair of helices, each 3-4 turns long, connected by a 7-residue loop (Supplementary Fig 3) might be all that is needed to create an ATP-binding module.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ternary structure should serve as a template for rational protein and enzyme design, optimizable for solubility, stability, specificity and catalytic efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Kinetic studies suggest that DgkA functions with a moderate level of heteroallostery1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the binding of one substrate influences (in this case positively) that of its co-substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a multimer like DgkA, it is possible for heteroallostery to come about through inter-subunit signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that any given active site is a composite, with components from at least two subunits, suggests a way for the substrate-bound status of one site to be relayed to another; the SH is an obvious means for inter-subunit information transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, the enzyme could present simultaneously three active sites in distinct states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find some evidence for this in the ternary structure where only one of the three active sites is occupied by ACP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, two of the sites in the CL region, which clamps onto the nucleotide base, are profoundly different (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither CL is involved in crystal contacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presumably therefore both are physiologically relevant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that the three sites in DgkA are in different states at any given time during catalysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is possible to model a symmetrical DgkA trimer that is stable in MDS, indicating that the enzyme may adopt a symmetrical configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This does not imply that all three sites are catalytically active at the same time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional mechanistic and structure work is required to evaluate allosteric coupling within the enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As a trimer situated with half its bulk in the membrane and half in the cytosol, DgkA has features that make it a good biocatalyst.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its three active sites are arranged around the enzymes periphery (Fig 1b) opening to the cytosol and the membrane for easy access and egress of substrates and products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This naturally raises the probability of productive encounters between substrates and binding sites, thus elevating the reaction rate compared to a hypothetical solitary active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conformational changes, where needed for turnover, would appear to be relatively minor involving small segments such as the CL for nucleotide and the SH for lipid and nucleotide binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This should ensure efficient substrate loading and product release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduction in dimensionality, as a result of lipid substrate and enzyme confinement to a two-dimensional membrane, increases overall efficiency of delivery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amphiphilic nature of the lipid and of the membrane in which it and the kinase reside, ensure the spontaneous and proper alignment of substrate in the lipid-binding site for reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These features of trimeric DgkA undoubtedly contribute to making it an efficient biocatalyst, described previously as an evolutionarily optimized integral membrane enzyme.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

"Examining carefully MDS-sampled, cut-down configurations of the ternary complexs active site similar to Fig 3c, the energetics of possible interactions of 1-OH with neighbouring protein residues were studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both geometry optimization and systematic movement of the lipid substrates 1-OH proton towards nearby residues were used to examine the change in the system's energy along this proton abstraction path.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In DFT, albeit approximate, the electron probability density around nuclei is determined, so geometry optimization can relax and move the nuclear coordinates to lower the systems energy to a (local or global) minimum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relaxation of particular configurations could include 1-OH proton transfer, or rearrangement of bonds, or the formation of a (near-) covalent bond between an 1-O oxyanion (or even 1-OH with proton intact) and the -phosphorus atom to form a pentavalent intermediate structure (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A key point regarding these possible events is their energetic (and kinetic) accessibility, especially in relation to background thermal energy RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At room temperature (RT) is around 0.6 kcal mol1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, such reaction events accessible for routine observation during geometry optimization would typically have energy barriers of 23 kcal mol1, or less.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the connection between reaction-energy barriers and approximate rates is well-established in chemical kinetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On this basis, we found that the only likely interaction with protein residues for reaction of 1-OH was with Glu69, featuring a prominent hydrogen bond with the proton in 1-OH pointing directly to Glu69.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some cases, geometry optimization entailed the direct transfer of the proton to Glu69, suggesting an energy barrier of 23 kcal mol1, or less.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative potential-energy profile for this is shown in Supplementary Fig 8b, where the kink in slope denotes the rupture of the OH covalent bond prior to formation of the bond with Glu69.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because movement along this direct path (cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementary Fig 8a) does not necessarily follow a minimum-energy path across the potential-energy landscape (akin to taking an as-the-crow-flies route through a valley, rather than following a slightly meandering river), the 5 kcal mol1 barrier is an overestimate, and direct transfer in structure relaxation suggests the actual barrier is lower (see above).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sharply downhill energetic nature of proton transfer indicates an approach towards spontaneity for this event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This transfer is facilitated greatly by the prominent hydrogen bonds strong electrostatic interaction, especially given the high charge-to-mass ratio of the proton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ", 'Optimization of the alkoxide form led to the formation of a somewhat strained, imperfect covalent bond for the resultant (1-O) oxyanion (sans proton) with the -phosphorus atom, not unusual for a pentavalent intermediate, suggesting reasonable kinetic accessibility with a 23 kcal mol1 barrier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, further structure relaxation did not suggest any rupture (or meaningful stretch/strain) of the bridging -PO bond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extending systematically this covalent bond until breakage, the relative potential-energy profile (Supplementary Fig 8b) suggests a reaction-energy barrier of 15 kcal mol1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike the hydrogen bond in proton transfer, there is no appreciable local electrostatic interaction in this bond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The much larger mass of P and O atoms and inertia of the MAG1 and to-be-formed ADP moieties compounds this, altering the character of this potential-energy profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a large positive barrier to be crossed, it is much less kinetically favourable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the substantial positive-energy hill shows clearly the unfavourable nature of extending the bond from a local minimum in the immediate vicinity of the reactant state, hindered by less electrostatic interaction, until rupture beyond 0.50.6 Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is somewhat consistent with previous computational estimates of 26.7 kcal mol1 (based on potential-energy differences),

by Asn72 and/or Arg9 of the pentavalent intermediate (Fig 2a), and MDS evidence pointing to Arg9-mediated stabilization.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
