Pyruvate kinase type M2 promotes tumour cell exosome release via phosphorylating synaptosome-associated protein 23  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Tumour cells secrete exosomes that are involved in the remodelling of the tumourstromal environment and promoting malignancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanisms governing tumour exosome release, however, remain incompletely understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that tumour cell exosomes secretion is controlled by pyruvate kinase type M2 (PKM2), which is upregulated and phosphorylated in tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During exosome secretion, phosphorylated PKM2 serves as a protein kinase to phosphorylate synaptosome-associated protein 23 (SNAP-23), which in turn enables the formation of the SNARE complex to allow exosomes release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct phosphorylation assay and mass spectrometry confirm that PKM2 phosphorylates SNAP-23 at Ser95.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ectopic expression of non-phosphorylated SNAP-23 mutant (Ser95Ala95) significantly reduces PKM2-mediated exosomes release whereas expression of selective phosphomimetic SNAP-23 mutants (Ser95Glu95 but not Ser20Glu20) rescues the impaired exosomes release induced by PKM2 knockdown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings reveal a non-metabolic function of PKM2, an enzyme associated with tumour cell reliance on aerobic glycolysis, in promoting tumour cell exosome release.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'As a mechanism to communicate with the microenvironment, tumour cells actively release large quantity of extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, microvesicles (MVs) or microparticles, and apoptotic bodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These tumour-released EVs, which are abundant in the body fluids of patients with cancer, play a critical role in promoting tumour growth and progression1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, NCI-H460 tumour cells actively release MVs containing EMMPRIN, a transmembrane glycoprotein highly expressed by tumour cells, MV-encapsulated EMMPRIN that facilitates tumour invasion and metastasis via stimulating matrix metalloproteinase expression in fibroblasts3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumour cell exosomes also deliver active Wnt proteins to regulate target cell -catenin-dependent gene expression4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cancer cell-derived microparticles bearing P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 accelerate thrombus formation in vivo, and by targeting P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 researchers were able to prevent thrombosis5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While these studies are exciting and suggest potential strategies for blocking metastasis, the mechanism underlying the active exocytosis of exosomes by tumour cells, however, remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies suggest that cellular exosome secretion activity is increased during tumorigenesis6,7, but the molecular basis for switching on the exocytosis process in tumour cells requires further clarification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The mechanisms that govern cell endosomal secretion have been extensively studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exosomes share structural and biochemical characteristic with intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular endosomes (MVEs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studying trafficking of proteolipid protein in Oli-neu cells, Trajkovic et al.8 reported that the sphingolipid ceramide played a key role in triggering budding of exosomes into MVEs, and the release of exosomes was reduced after the inhibition of ceramide synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Kosaka et al.9 found that neutral sphingomyelinase 2 was directly involved in promoting tumour cell endosomal secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using an RNAi screen, Ostrowski et al.10 identified the role of Rab GTPases in promoting exosome secretion: among the small GTPases, Rab27a and Rab27b were involved in MVE docking to the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like other cells, tumour cells employ the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex that many cell types utilize in the exocytic release of exosomes11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SNARE complex is comprised of proteins on membrane of budding vesicles (v-SNAREs) and proteins on the cells membrane (t-SNAREs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The v-SNAREs and t-SNAREs enable the apposition of the vesicle and cell membranes and the subsequent fusion of the two membranes thereby mediating vesicle exocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In tumour cells, the SNARE complex includes syntaxin-4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12) and SNAP-23 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13) serving as t-SNAREs, while VAMP-2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14) and VAMP-8 (refs 12, 15) represent candidates for v-SNAREs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphorylation of SNAP-23 not only directly increases cell exocytosis16,17 but also promotes association with other SNARE proteins, thereby allowing the formation of the stable SNARE complex to enhance cell exocytosis18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mast cells, SNAP-23 has been reported to be phosphorylated by IB kinase (IKK) to promote exocytosis19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the kinase that phosphorylates SNAP-23 in the tumour cell has not been identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the present study, we demonstrate that PKM2, an enzyme involved in the tumour cells reliance on aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect), plays a critical role in promoting the release of exosomes from the tumour cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we identify SNAP-23, which controls the docking and release of secretory granules or exosome-containing multivesicular bodies, is a substrate of PKM2 in tumour cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During exosome secretion, phosphorylated PKM2 forms a dimer structure with low pyruvate kinase activity but high protein kinase activity21 and then associates with SNAP-23 near cells membranes, leading to SNAP-23 phosphorylation at Ser95 and upregulation of tumour cell exosome release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that PKM2, following phosphorylation and dimerization, plays an essential role in not only switching tumour cell metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis, but also promoting tumour cell exosome secretion via directly phosphorylating SNAP-23.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Exosome secretion requires high level of aerobic glycolysis', 'Exosomes released by various cell types were isolated from cell culture medium using exosome isolation kit and analysed by transmission electron microscopy and western blot (WB) using antibodies against exosomal marker proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1a, tumour cells actively release exosomes, a double membrane vesicle with 50100 nm size, into the culture medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The immune-gold label showed that exosomes expressed membrane protein CD63 (Fig 1a, right lower panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of additional marker proteins such as CD63, Tsg101 and CD9 was validated by WB analysis (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To monitor the concentration of exosomes released by tumour cells and non-tumour primary culture cells, a Nanosight NS 300 system (NanoSight) was used to track the release of exosomes (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) confirmed that the sizes of released exosomes are around 100 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with previous reports, we found that tumour cells (SW480, Hela, A549 and HepG2 cells) generally displayed more active exosome secretion than non-tumour mammalian cells, mouse primary myoblast and mammary epithelial cell (MEC) (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the increased exosome release by tumour cells is positively correlated to the higher aerobic glycolysis (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with the positive correlation between aerobic glycolysis and exosome secretion observed in Fig 1f, we found that glycolysis level was positively correlated with the amount of exosome release in tumour cells (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further examine the potential link between the exosome secretion and the aerobic glycolysis flow in the tumour cells, we treated A549 cells and HepG2 cells with aerobic glycolysis inhibitor shikonin22 or aerobic glycolysis promoter tumour necrosis factor  (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23), and then determined the alteration of exosome release from tumour cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results clearly showed that suppressed aerobic glycolysis by shikonin inhibited, whereas activated aerobic glycolysis by TNF enhanced, the release of exosomes by tumour cells (Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identification of the dependence of exosome secretion process on cell glycolysis is in agreement with previous findings in other cell types22,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Release of exosomes by tumour cells depends on aerobic glycolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ac) Isolated exosomes from A549 cells

#@NEW_LINE#@#  We next treated the A549 tumour cells with EGF or OA and examined whether the effect of these reagents was mediated through alteration of tumour cell aerobic glycolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1h, EGF and OA significantly enhanced and suppressed aerobic glycolysis in A549 cells, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next examined whether the effect of EGF and OA was mediated through alteration of tumour cell aerobic glycolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1i, EGF and OA significantly enhanced and suppressed aerobic glycolysis in A549 and HepG2 cells, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the effect EGF and OA on promoting or inhibiting A549 and HepG2 cells exosome exocytosis was abolished by decreasing or increasing aerobic glycolysis, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results collectively suggest that release of exosomes in tumour cells is dependent on cellular aerobic glycolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'PKM2 plays a critical role in tumour cell exocytosis', 'PKM2 expression has been widely regarded as an important molecular feature of tumour development27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In tumour cells, PKM2 forms a dimer, which is catalytically inactive for conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate and production of ATP28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lowering pyruvate formation provides a growth advantage for tumour progression as blocking production of pyruvate helps to channel the glycolytic intermediates to biosynthesis to meet the demands for tumour cell proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that PKM2 plays a key role in switching tumour cell metabolic status from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis and PKM2 level is increased during tumorigenesis30,31, we next tested whether tumour cell exosome release is correlated with the PKM2 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with previous reports, tumour cells contained significantly higher PKM2 level than non-tumour cells (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with the correlation between aerobic glycolysis and exocytosis observed in Fig 1, we found that level of PKM2 was positively correlated with the amount of exosome release in tumour cells (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a similar manner, tumour cells also showed significantly higher phosphorylated PKM2 (p-PKM2) level than non-tumour cells (Fig 2c), and the p-PKM2 level was positively correlated with the amount of exosome release in tumour cells (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, treating A549 lung carcinoma cells with OA (Fig 2e) or EGF (Fig 2f), which enhanced or suppressed tumour cell exosome release, respectively, we found that the level of PKM2 in A549 cells was dose-dependently decreased by OA or increased by EGF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: PKM2 plays a critical role in

modulating the release of exosomes from tumour cells, we assessed exosome release after knocking down PKM2 level in A549 and Hela tumour cells via PKM2 siRNA or overexpressing PKM2 in myoblasts and MEC via HA-tagged PKM2-expressing plasmid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Supplementary Fig 2, knockdown or overexpression of cellular PKM2 levels decreased or enhanced p-PKM2 levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NTA results clearly showed that knockdown of PKM2 in A549 and Hela cells (Fig 2g) strongly reduced the release of exosomes (Fig 2h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, overexpression of HA-tagged PKM2 (HA-PKM2) in non-tumour cells (Fig 2i) markedly enhanced the release of exosomes (Fig 2j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that apoptotic cells secrete more exosomes than healthy cells and aerobic glycolysis inhibitor or PKM2 knockdown may affect cell apoptosis, we next determined the effects of shikonin and PKM2 knockdown on cell apoptosis using flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Supplementary Fig 3, both shikonin treatment and PKM2 knockdown significantly increased early or late apoptosis of A549 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that total exosome release from A549 cells is decreased after shikonin treatment or PKM2 knockdown, increase of cell apoptosis by shikonin treatment or PKM2 knockdown further demonstrates that PKM2-mediated aerobic glycolysis promotes tumour cell exosome release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, given that switching the behaviour of PKM2 from a tetramer form to a dimer form increases the initial steps of tumour cell aerobic glycolysis and promotes tumour progression21,32, we treated A549 cells with pTyr, a phosphotyrosine peptide that can promote PKM2 dimeric formation33, or fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) and serine, two molecules that enhance PKM2 tetrameric formation34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the dimeric or tetrameric formation of PKM2, chemical crosslinking reaction was carried out to maintain the polymer structure before WB analysis21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parallel samples without crosslinking treatment were included as loading controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, pTyr treatment increased the level of PKM2 dimer (116 kDa), while FBP and serine enhanced tetrameric formation (232 kDa) in A549 cells (Fig 2k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the configuration of PKM2 either facilitating or reducing exosome exocytosis, pTyr, induced dimeric PKM2, increased tumour cell exosome exocytosis, while FBP and serine, which induced tertrameric PKM2, significantly decreased tumour cell exosome exocytosis (Fig 2l).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition, through assaying the level change and the effect on secretion exosomes of PKM1, we found that pyruvate kinase activity of PKM might be not relevant to tumour cell exosome secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Supplementary Fig 4, overexpression or knockdown of PKM1 in Hela and A549 cells displayed no effect on the release of exosomes from tumour cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results strongly argue that PKM2, particularly phosphorylated PKM2 which easily dimerizes, plays an essential role in promoting the release of exosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

exocytosis13,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We isolated exosomes released by SW480, A549, Hela, 293 T and LLC cells, and then performed mass spectra analysis and an isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) assay for protein expression profiling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, protein profiling analysis showed that SNAP-23 was the only component of SNARE complex detected in exosomes derived from all the five cell lines (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether PKM2-promoted tumour cell exocytosis is through SNAP-23-mediated exocytic machinery, we first compared the levels of SNAP-23 and phosphorylated SNAP-23 (p-SNAP-23) in tumour or non-tumour cells (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown, tumour cells particularly the cells with high capacity to secrete exosomes, had a significantly higher level of p-SNAP23 compared with myoblast and MEC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we knocked down SNAP-23 in A549 cells and then assessed the release of exosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a separate experiment, A549 cells were also transfected with HA-PKM2-expressing plasmid or co-transfected with HA-PKM2-expressing plasmid plus SNAP-23 siRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3, knockdown of SNAP-23 (Fig 3b) not only significantly blocked the release of exosome in A549 cells but also almost completely abolished the promotion of exosome release by PKM2 overexpression (Fig 3c).

phosphorylation of SNAP-23 by PKM2 in mediating tumour cell exosome release, we constructed three plasmids expressing SNAP-23 mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ser95 of wild-type (WT) SNAP-23 was replaced with Glu95 (SNAP-23 (Ser95Glu95)), whose carbolyic acid side chain will mimic the effect of phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, to render a constitutively dephosphorylated state, we replaced Ser95 of WT SNAP-23 with Ala95 (SNAP-23 (Ser95Ala95)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure that serine phosphorylation by PKM2 is the critical factor (as opposed to phosphorylation of some other residue) enabling the role of SNAP-23 in exosome exocytosis, we also mutated Ser20 of SNAP-23 to Glu20 (SNAP-23 (Ser20Glu20)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to generating three mutated versions of SNAP-23 DNA,

SNAP-23 siRNA, we designed them as R-SNAP-23 and R-SNAP-23 (Ser95Ala95), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT SNAP-23 and SNAP-23 mutants were then expressed into the A549 cells and the release of exosomes at 24 h post-incubation was assayed by NTA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that knockdown of cellular SNAP-23 level via SNAP-23 siRNA significantly decreased exosome secretion (Fig 7b).

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'It has been well established that tumour cells have elevated rates of glucose uptake and high lactate production in the presence of oxygen, known as aerobic glycolysis (also termed as the Warburg effect)41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Switch to glycolysis facilitates the uptake and incorporation of nutrients into nucleotides, amino acids and lipids to meet the requirements of rapid proliferation by tumour cells42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High lactate production also remodels the tumour microenvironment by contributing to angiogenesis, acting as a cancer cell metabolic fuel and inducing immunosuppression43,44,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apart from Warburg effect, an increased secretion of EVs, which can shuttle reciprocal signals and other molecules between transformed and stromal cells, is another phenomenon observed during tumorigenesis6,46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, few studies have explored the link between the enhanced aerobic glycolysis and active exosome secretion in tumour cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the present study, we have shown that PKM2 is the key factor modulating both glycolysis and exosome release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PKM2, an enzyme whose expression is upregulated in tumour cells whose metabolic needs are met through glycolysis, promotes the release of exosomes from tumour cells by phosphorylating Ser95 of SNAP-23, a component of the synaptosome/SNARE complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we demonstrated a positive link between the cells reliance on glycolysis and exocytosis of exosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, when we inhibited glycolysis, then the exosome release was attenuated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we showed, utilizing knockdown or overexpression of PKM2 in a cell, that PKM2 is pivotal for exosome release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using various molecules to promote dimerization or tetramerization of PKM2, we showed that dimerization is relevant to exosome release from the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, we showed that PKM2 promotion of exosome release requires the presence of SNAP-23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we identified Ser95 as the critical residue in SNAP-23 that is phosphorylated by PKM2 in effecting exosome exocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results confirm that PKM2 phosphorylation of SNAP-23 at Ser95 is a key to SNARE complex formation and the secretion of exosomes in tumour cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The biogenesis and release of exosomes is a multi-step process modulated by various molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have shown that sphingolipid ceramide, nSMase2 and Rab small GTPases, such as Rab27a and Rab27b, are involved in regulating different steps of the exosome secretion8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, after knocking down PKM2 in A549 cells, we failed to find significant alteration in the levels of Rab27a, Rab27b and nSMase2 (Supplementary Fig 7), suggesting that PKM2s enhancement of exosome secretion in tumour cells is not mediated through changes in the expression of Rab27a, Rab27b and nSMase2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results identify the mechanism through which PKM2 enhances the release of exosomes: PKM2 phosphorylates SNAP-23 at Ser95 enabling the formation of the SNAP complex required for the docking and fusion between endosome-containing MVEs and plasma membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'PKM2 is best known for catalysing the last step in the process of glycolysis, the transfer of a phosphate group from PEP to ADP yielding the products of pyruvate and ATP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PKM2 exhibits a high level of catalysis for this reaction when protein is in a tetrameric state but not in a dimeric state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PKM2 is particularly likely to form a dimer when tyrosine 105 (Y105) is phosphorylated34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In its dimeric state, Yang et al.32 found that PKM2 phosphorylates nuclear histone H3 to promote gene transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional functions of PKM2 have also been recognized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PKM2 was found to activate transcription of MEK5 by phosphorylating STAT3 at Y105 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18) and to regulate cytokinesis of tumour cells via phosphorylating MLC2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A previous study also showed that IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation requires PKM2, although mechanism remains unclear35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As catalysis of the last step of glycolysis generally occurs in the cytoplasm, PKM2 particularly PKM2 in its tetrameric form mainly locates in the cytoplasm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to phosphorylate various transcription factors, phosphorylated/dimerized PKM2 is required to be relocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we suggest that dimerized/phosphorylated PKM2 can also re-locate at the vesicular structures close to the cell plasma membranes where it associates with the component of SNARE complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following exosome release from the plasma membrane, PKM2 is found in the secreted exosome fraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, location of PKM2 in secreted exosomes was also detected by Buschow et al.32 in B cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that PKM2 and SNAP-23 are widely expressed in various cell types, the PKM2-SNAP-23 signal pathway may play a critical role in promoting exocytosis in other cell types as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our data as well as the data of others offer clues as to the specific environments in the plasma membranes at which SNARE complexes are likely to form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, we found that PKM2 and SNAP-23 co-localize at certain punctate structures close to or on the cell surface (Fig 4b, arrows).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These punctates might be lipid rafts or secretory vesicles very close to lipid rafts on the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous study by Suzuki and Verma20 suggest that SNAP-23 is highly enriched in the lipid raft fraction during stimulated degranulation, and the localization of SNAP-23 in lipid rafts facilitates the phosphorylation of SNAP-23 at Ser95 and Ser120 by IKK 2, leading to SNARE complex formation and degranulation of mast cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we did not observe the phosphorylation of SNAP-23 at Ser120 by PKM2 in the direct phosphorylation assay, the phosphorylation site of SNAP-23 by PKM2 may be not identical for a putative IKK consensus sequences for phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these studies suggest that PKM2 particularly phosphorylated/dimerized PKM2 can phosphorylate SNAP-23, a key component of exocytosis machinery, to promote tumour cell exosome secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, the findings presented here demonstrate a role for PKM2 in the release of exosomes from tumour cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PKM2 phosphorylates a component of the SNARE complex, SNAP-23 at Ser95.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This event is critical to the exocytosis of exosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the release of exosomes from the tumour cell is highly correlated with the tumour cells metabolic switch to aerobic glycolysis, a metabolic switch in which the perturbation of function of PKM2 is implicated.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
