Physical nanoscale conduit-mediated communication between tumour cells and the endothelium modulates endothelial phenotype  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Metastasis is a major cause of mortality and remains a hurdle in the search for a cure for cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not much is known about metastatic cancer cells and endothelial cross-talk, which occurs at multiple stages during metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report a dynamic regulation of the endothelium by cancer cells through the formation of nanoscale intercellular membrane bridges, which act as physical conduits for transfer of microRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The communication between the tumour cell and the endothelium upregulates markers associated with pathological endothelium, which is reversed by pharmacological inhibition of these nanoscale conduits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results lead us to define the notion of metastatic hijack: cancer cell-induced transformation of healthy endothelium into pathological endothelium via horizontal communication through the nanoscale conduits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pharmacological perturbation of these nanoscale membrane bridges decreases metastatic foci in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeting these nanoscale membrane bridges may potentially emerge as a new therapeutic opportunity in the management of metastatic cancer.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Angiogenesis and metastasis are the two key inflection points during tumour progression and are associated with a negative outcome1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although angiogenesis is a critical, early driver of tumour growth3, metastasis is the final step in the progression of tumour accounting for  greater than 90% of cancer-related mortality4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Communication between cancer cells and the endothelium is the hallmark of both these processes5,6, and the cancer cells and the endothelium mount a dynamic regulation on each other via such communication7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The cancer cellendothelial communication in the context of angiogenesis has been extensively explored8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, paracrine signalling via growth factors is well established9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, in a recent study, communication between cancer and endothelial cells through tumour-secreted microRNAs (miRNAs) packaged in microvesicles was implicated in angiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antagomirs that target this miRNA-mediated signalling were shown to inhibit angiogenesis and reduce tumour burden11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the communication between tumour cells and endothelium in the context of metastasis is less explored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Metastasis is the culmination of a cascade of events, including invasion and intravasation of tumour cells, survival in circulation, extravasation and metastatic colonization4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple studies have reported a dynamic interaction between the metastatic tumour cell and the target organ, mediated by cytokines4,12 or by exosomes that can prime metastasis by creating a pre-metastatic niche13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the interactions between cancer cells and endothelium in the context of metastasis, which occurs during intravasation, circulation and extravasation, remains less studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cancer cell-secreted soluble factors can induce retraction of endothelial cells and the subsequent attachment and transmigration of tumour cells through the endothelial monolayers14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, studies indicate a more intricate communication between cancer cells and the endothelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, a miRNA regulon was found to mediate endothelial recruitment and metastasis by cancer cells16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, exosome-mediated transfer of cancer-secreted miR-105 was recently reported to disrupt the endothelial barrier and promote metastasis17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We rationalized that a better understanding of cancerendothelial intercellular communication, primarily during extravasation, could lead to novel strategies for inhibiting metastasis18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recently, nanoscale membrane bridges, such as tunnelling nanotubes (TNTs) and filopodias, have emerged as a novel mechanism of intercellular communication19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, specialized signalling filopodia or cytonemes were recently shown to transport morphogens during development20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, TNTs, which unlike filopodia have no contact with the substratum21, were shown to facilitate HIV-1 transmission between T cells, enable the spread of calcium-mediated signal between cells and transfer p-glycoproteins conferring multi-drug resistance between cancer cells22,23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TNTs were also recently implicated in trafficking of mitochondria from endothelial to cancer cells and transfer miRNA between osteosarcoma cells and stromal murine osteoblast cells, and between smooth muscle cells and the endothelium26,27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, whether similar intercellular nanostructure-mediated communication can be harnessed by cancer cells to modulate the endothelium is not known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report that metastatic cancer cells preferentially form nanoscale intercellular membrane bridges with endothelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These nanoscale bridges act as physical conduits through which the cancer cells can horizontally transfer miRNA to the endothelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe that the recipient endothelial cells present an miRNA profile that is distinct from non-recipient endothelial cells isolated from the same microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the co-cultures of cancer and endothelial cells upregulate markers associated with pathological endothelium, which is inhibited by pharmacological disruption of the nanoscale conduits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the pharmacological inhibitors of these nanoscale conduits can decrease metastatic foci in vivo, which suggests that these nanoscale conduits may potentially emerge as new targets in the management of metastatic cancer.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cancer cells form nanoscale bridges with the endothelium', 'In a previous study, we had observed that quiescent endothelial cells can mute the proliferative and invasive phenotype of cancer cells7, suggesting that cancer cells need to dynamically modulate an inhibitory physiological endothelium to facilitate metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we set up a simple experiment, where we added the metastatic breast cancer cells to preformed endothelial tubes on a three-dimensional (3D) tumour matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cancer cells preferentially attached to the vascular network, acquired an elongated phenotype and invaginated into the endothelial network (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was in contrast to the phenotype reported earlier, where monocultures of breast cancer cells were typically found to form characteristic mammospheres on 3D matrices (Fig 1b)29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicated that the interactions between metastatic cancer cells and endothelial cells can create a niche that facilitates an invasive phenotype in the cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the change in phenotype of the cancer cells was consistent with previous observations wherein tumour cells adopted a spindle-shaped morphology to migrate through endothelial layers15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have shown that the endothelial tubules formed in these studies represent an inside-out model of a blood vessel30, indicating that the cancer cells are exposed to the thrombogenic apical side of an endothelial cell, that is, the current assay likely modelled cancer cellendothelium interactions in the context of extravasation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Nanoscale structures physically connect metastatic cells and the endothelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Representative image of MDA-MB-231 cancer cells exhibiting an invasive phenotype in the presence of preformed endothelial tubes in co-culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Representative image of a mammosphere typically formed by MDA-MB-231 cells when cultured on 3D tumour matrix in the absence of endothelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MDA-MB-231 cells were loaded with CFSE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Actin was labelled with rhodamine phalloidin and nuclei were counterstained with DAPI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) A representative SEM of epithelial (EPI) MDA-MB-231 cells aligning on HUVEC (ENDO) tubules in the co-culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lower panel shows higher magnification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) SEM image reveals nanoscale membrane bridges connecting (nCs) metastatic breast cancer (EPI) cells and endothelial vessels (arrows).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) A representative transmission electron micrograph shows intercellular connectivity through the nanoscale membrane bridge between MDA-MB-231 and an endothelial cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) A cartoon represents the types of homotypic and heterotypic intercellular nanoscale connections that an epithelial cell may form in the presence of endothelial tubules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Highly metastatic (MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-435) or low metastatic (MCF7 and SkBr3) cancer cells were co-cultured with the endothelial tubes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Normal HMECs were used as control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Graphs show percentage of total population of epithelial cells that exhibit either homotyptic (EpiEpi) or heterotypic (EpiEndo) nanoscale connections and (g) average number of nanoscale connections formed per cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification analysis was done on  greater than 300 cells of each cell type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data shown are mean±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (n=6 replicates per study, with 23 independent experiments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  **P less_than 0.01, ***P less_than 0.001 (analysis of variance followed by Bonferronis post-hoc test).Full size image', 'Scanning electron micrographs (SEMs) confirmed that the cancer cells preferentially attach to the endothelial tubules and acquire an elongated morphology (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we observed nanoscale membrane bridges connecting the cancer and endothelial cells (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bridges were found to hover over the substratum, consistent with the phenotype associated with TNTs19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These connections between epithelial and endothelial cells are referred as heterotypic connections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These nanoscale membrane bridges had the dimensions of 290±20 nm in the short axis and 30.69±2.43 m in the long axis (mean±s.e.m., n greater than 300 cells), similar to membrane nanotubes31, and were significantly distinct from cytoskeletal projections such as lamellipodia (short axis: 4.99±0.23 m; long axis: 12.90±1.79 m; mean±s.e.m., n greater than 300) (Supplementary Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that the nanoscale membrane bridges enabled continuous intercellular connectivity between the two cells (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next tested the ability of cancer cells of different metastatic grades to form these membrane nanoscale connections with the endothelium (Supplementary Fig 1B-F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) were used as controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nanoscale membrane bridges could form between two epithelial cells, which we term as homotypic connections (Fig 1f and Supplementary Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, an epithelial cell could simultaneously form both heterotypic and homotypic connections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Highly metastatic breast epithelial cells (MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231) and metastatic melanoma (MDA-MB-435) cells formed significantly more intercellular nanoscale membrane bridges compared with both HMECs and low/non-metastatic cells (MCF7 and SkBr3) in co-cultures with endothelial cells, quantified as % of total cancer cells with membrane nanoscale bridges and also the number of nanotubes per cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumorigenic but non/low-metastatic breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and SkBr3) contained higher number of nanoscale connections/cell than HMECs in co-culture, although the increase was a result of enhanced homotypic connections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, as compared with the non/low-metastatic cell lines, the highly metastatic cells were found to preferentially form heterotypic nanoscale connections (Fig 1f,g and Supplementary Fig1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar phenotype was conserved when the metastatic breast cancer cells were co-cultured with primary human dermal microvascular blood and lymph endothelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the average number of nanoscale connections per cancer cell was greater in the presence of primary vascular endothelial cells, a greater percentage of the population of tumour cells exhibited these structures when cultured with lymphatic vascular cells (Supplementary Fig 1HL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We next monitored the kinetics of formation of these intercellular nanostructures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The co-cultures of MDA-231 and endothelial cells were fixed at defined time points and imaged using an SEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous observations, the cancer cells were found to attach with the endothelial cells, preferably in regions with additional cancer cells (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, time-lapse analysis revealed that the nanoscale membrane projections develop from the metastatic cancer cells, from the surface in closest proximity to the endothelial tube, within 1.5 h of establishing the co-culture and evolving into stable intercellular structures over a 24-h period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Limited projections were observed from the opposite pole (away from endothelial cells) of the cancer cell (Fig 2b), indicating that the formation of these structures occurred in a directed non-stochastic manner, consistent with a functional role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peak lengths were reached between 15 and 20 h in co-culture (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Temporal directed growth of heterotypic nanoscale membrane bridges from metastatic cancer cells to the endothelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ae) Representative SEM images show temporal growth of the nanoscale bridges from the epithelial cells towards the endothelial cells over a 24-h period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) High-resolution image of the region highlighted by the box in b shows directionality of growth from the cell surface in close proximity to the endothelium (open arrow) but not the opposing pole (closed arrow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (H1 and H2) High-magnification images of highlighted regions in d show the growth of the nanoscale connections that can both hover over or attach to the substratum, finally fusing with endothelial cells as seen in e high magnification by 24 h.

composed of cytoskeletal elements', 'To characterize the compositional structure of the nanoscale membrane bridges connections, we labelled the co-culture with phalloidin to delineate the actin filaments, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) to stain the nucleus and cell membrane, respectively, and used immunolabelling for tubulin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3, intercellular nanoscale connections were continuous membranous structures composed of actin supported by tubulin cytoskeletal components (Fig 3a and Supplementary Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of a population of the nanoscale membrane bridges revealed that 70% were composed of both actin and tubulin, while the remaining were composed of only actin (Supplementary Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have reported that membrane bridges or nanotubes could comprise only actin, as well as both actin and tubulin19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, extrapolating an established filopodial mathematical model (Supplementary Discussion) to the observed structures indicates that at the observed mean diameter, a majority of the nanoscale membrane bridges, and especially the longer ones, should comprise both actin and tubulin, consistent with the fact that tubulin is critical for increasing flexural rigidity of the nanostructures at the observed length and diameter scales (Fig 3bd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, owing to the larger radius of tubulins (4 × radius of actin filaments), there is an optimal fraction of tubulin (6.6%) to maximize nanostructure flexural strength while minimizing thickness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, immunocytochemistry revealed a punctate Myosin V motor protein expression within these nanostructures (Fig 3e), consistent with the previous observation of Myosin V in TNTs31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Myosin V motors are known to transport cargo progressively along actin filaments32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together with the increased propensity of metastatic cells to form heterotypic nanoscale connections and the directionality of growth towards the endothelium, these compositional observations suggested that these membrane nanostructures could function as an intercellular highway enabling transfer of materials from the cancer cells to the endothelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Structure and function of the heterotypic intercellular nanoscale membrane bridges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Representative images show the heterotypic nanoscale membrane bridges are composed of both F-actin and /-tubulin cytoskeletal components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-cultures were stained with /-tubulin antibody (green) and phalloidin (purple) to label actin, and counterstained with DAPI (nuclear)+WGA (plasma membrane) (blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Endothelial cells were labelled with DiL-Ac-LDL (red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Mathematical modelling of the structure of the nanoscale connections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The physical properties of actin filaments necessitate microtubules for projections of certain length scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum projection length for a given minimum diameter at the buckling limit is plotted for actin-only nanoscale structures (purple line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This curve is overlaid with the experimental length and diameter measurements (red dots) from the observed thin projections measured in these studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Projections containing only actin or projections containing both actin and tubulin can exist to the right of the curve (purple line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, actin-only projections cannot exist to the left of the curve (green region).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) The effect of incorporating tubulin in these projections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum length is plotted against the minimum diameter for varying fractions of tubulin incorporated in the nanoscale projection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of microtubules to the projections increases the overall flexural rigidity, shifting the curves left of the actin-only limit (purple line), thus allowing for longer and thinner nanoscale connections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, owing to the larger radius of microtubules (4 × radius of actin filaments), there is an optimal fraction of tubulin (green line) that can be incorporated into the projection before the effect is reversed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) The optimal fraction of microtubules is about 6.6% (red dashed line) to maximize nanostructure flexural strength, while minimizing thickness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Representative confocal image shows the presence of myosin V motor proteins within the

hypothesis that the nanoscale membrane bridges indeed facilitate intercellular communication from the cancer cells to endothelium, we loaded MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with a cell-impermeable dye, carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE), before adding them to a co-culture with DiI-Ac-LDL-labelled endothelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  De-convolved volume 3D rendering of the co-cultures revealed transfer of cytoplasmic CFSE within the nanoscale membrane bridges connecting the cancer cells and endothelial cells (Fig 4a and Supplementary Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, although gap junctions have been reported to mediate intercellular transfers between cancer and endothelial cells33, here we observed intercellular transfer between distant cancer and endothelial cells that were not in direct physical contact except via the nanoscale membrane bridges (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next validated the intercellular transfer using flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a control, CFSE-loaded cancer cells and the endothelial cells were grown in the top and bottom chambers of a Boyden assay, respectively (dual culture), which allowed media contact and exosomes to cross through the 0.4-m pores but did not allow direct physical contact, that is, no nanoscale membrane bridges could form between the cells (Fig 4b and Supplementary Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we used a membrane with 3 m pores, which allow both exosomes and larger vesicles to pass through (Supplementary Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The endothelial cells were first flow sorted from the dual/co-cultures using double labelling for DiI-Ac-LDL and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sorted endothelial cells were then analysed for CFSE and the subset of endothelial cells positive for CFSE was then quantified as a percentage of the total sorted endothelial cell population (Fig 4c) as a measure of transfer from cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we did observe intercellular transfer when the cells were separated in the Boyden assay (in both 0.4 and 3 m pores), consistent with exosome- and extracellular vesicle-mediated transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, as seen in Fig 4d,  less_than 5% of the endothelial cells were found to be CSFE+ve in the dual culture (Boyden assay) as compared with 30% of the endothelial cells being labelled as CFSE+ve when isolated from the co-cultures (after subtracting background signal from both conditions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that this transfer seen in the co-culture study includes the basal transfer arising from exosome- or gap-junction-mediated transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were described in the TNT-mediated transfer of p-glycoproteins, where two cells separated by a membrane with 0.4 m pores exhibited a basal transfer consistent with exosome-mediated transfer as opposed to higher levels of transmission when TNTs were present26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the temporal quantification of intercellular transfer of CFSE revealed that the peak is reached between 24 and 36 h, lagging behind the kinetics of formation of these nanoscale structures (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lag in transfer kinetics is consistent with the notion that the nanoscale connections are not fully functional at the early stages of formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar transfer was observed between the metastatic breast cancer cells and primary human vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to CFSE, the nanostructures facilitated the transfer of nanoparticles (quantum dots) and proteins (green fluorescent protein) (Supplementary Fig 4AE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we did not observe a similar communication between metastatic tumour cells and vascular smooth muscle cells, further emphasizing the specificity of the communication between cancer cells and the endothelium (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicated that the nanoscale bridges act as conduits for communication from cancer cells to endothelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: The nanoscale membrane bridges

to further validate the above hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the nanoscale membrane bridges were composed of building blocks that could not be genetically knocked down without causing lethality, we harnessed a pharmacological approach, using docetaxel and latrunculin A or cytochalasin D, to perturb the two major components of the intercellular nanoscale membrane bridges, that is, tubulin and actin, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A key limitation of these inhibitors is that they can exert nonspecific anti-mitotic effects leading to cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore first performed titration studies to establish the threshold concentration below which the inhibitors did not exert any nonspecific effect on cell migration, proliferation or apoptosis (Supplementary Fig 6AF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 4f, at concentrations below the threshold, pretreatment of metastatic cells with a combination of docetaxel (500 pM) with latrunculin A (30 nM) or cytochalasin D (50 nM) disrupted the formation of the heterotypic intercellular nanostructures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Drug treatment inhibited the total number as well as the length of intercellular nanostructures, suggesting that the inhibitors prevent initiation and growth of the nanostructures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that at these concentrations the inhibitors did not disrupt the basal transfer between HMECs or non-metastatic MCF7s and endothelial cells but reversed the increased intercellular transfer observed between the metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells and the endothelium to the basal level (Supplementary Fig 7), which suggested that the basal transfer could occur via a mechanism independent of the formation of the nanoscale connections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, at these concentrations, drug treatment did not inhibit the shedding of exosomes from the cancer cells (Fig 4g and Supplementary Fig 7B), suggesting that the basal transfer could possibly be mediated via exosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was further validated in a similar study, where cytochalasin disrupted nanotubes in phaechromocytoma cells but had no effect on endocytosis or phagocytosis34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the inhibitors reduced the heterotypic epithelialendothelial intercellular nanostructures to a greater degree compared with homotypic epithelialepithelial connecting nanostructures (Fig 4h,i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent reports have indicated that some homotypic nanoscale connections could rise as vestiges of cytokinesis during cellular division35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, heterotypic connections can only develop de novo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this further, we stained the epithelial cells with Cep55, which labels the cytokinetic bridges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Supplementary Fig 6G, the epithelial cells were found to be connected via nanoscale membrane as well as cytokinesis bridges (positive for both Cep55 and actin).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treating the cells with low-dose docetaxel (500 pM)+cytochalasin D (50 nM) disrupted the nanoscale membrane bridges but the cytokinesis bridges were found to be intact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with our in vitro viability studies, where the cells were viable at these concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, at a higher concentration (docetaxel 50 nM+cytochalasin D 50 nM), both the cytokinesis bridges as well as the nanoscale membrane bridges were inhibited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the pharmacological inhibitors, at the appropriate titrated concentration where it perturbs the de novo origins of the heterotypic membrane bridges without impacting cytokinesis, could be powerful tools to exquisitely dissect the functions of the heterotypic nanoscale connections between the metastatic cancer cell and the endothelium without the confounding nonspecific effects of a global knockdown of cytoskeletal components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pharmacological disruption of nanoscale membrane bridges between metastatic cancer cells and the endothelium inhibited the transfer of CFSE from the former to the latter, validating that the nanostructures can indeed act as conduits for intercellular communication (Fig 4j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Nanobridges transfer miRNA from cancer cells to endothelium', 'Although our study revealed the nanoscale membrane bridges could act as conduits for intercellular transfer, we rationalized that communication via the transfer of miRNAs from the cancer cells to the endothelium could result in the maximal amplification of signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, multiple studies have highlighted the role of miRNAs as signalling regulators in tumour cell migration and invasion36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, miR-132 was reported to be highly expressed in the endothelium of human tumours but was undetectable in normal endothelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, conditioned media from MDA-MB-231 cells was shown to upregulate miR-132 in endothelial cells37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a proof-of-concept, we assessed whether the nanoscale membrane bridges can act as a physical conduit for transfer of miR-132 from metastatic cancer cells into endothelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cy3-labelled control miRNA or miR-132 was transfected in the metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells, which were then used to establish the co-cultures with endothelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 5a,b (Supplementary Fig 8), Cy3-labelled miRNAs were detected within the nanoscale bridges and were transferred to the endothelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further validate the transfer, we quantified Cy3-labelled miRNA in endothelial cells by flow cytometry (Fig 5c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a control, the cancer and endothelial cells were separated in dual chambers of a Boyden assay, which revealed a baseline transfer of Cy3-labelled miRNAs from the cancer cells to the endothelium that remained constant between 24 and 36 h. Indeed, a previous study reported that the kinetics of exosome-mediated miRNA transfer between MDA-MB-231 and endothelial cells starts by 4 h and peaks by 24 h17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, a significant increase in Cy3-labelled miRNAs in the endothelial cells was observed over baseline by 36 h of co-culture (Fig 5d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, pretreating the cancer cells with a combination of docetaxel and cytochalasin or latrunculin A, at concentrations previously established to inhibit the formation of the nanoscale membrane connections without affecting exosome shedding, reduced the elevated miRNA levels in the endothelial cells in the co-cultures but had no effect on basal transfer (Fig 5d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This further validated that basal transfer is probably mediated by exosomes, whereas the nanoscale membrane bridges play a critical role as conduits for enhancing miRNA-mediated communication between the metastatic cancer cells and the endothelium.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The complexity of regulatory tumour parenchymaendothelial communication is increasingly being unravelled7,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The altered phenotypic behaviour of the metastatic cancer cells in the presence of endothelial cells observed in this study, instead of forming classical mammospheres, is consistent with the emerging paradigm of modulatory tumour parenchymastroma communication and the creation of a pre-metastatic niche.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, a recent study proposed the concept of the formation of a pre-metastatic niche mediated via metastatic cell-secreted exosomes, leading to vascular leakiness at the pre-metastatic sites13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate that cancer cells form nanoscale membrane bridges, which can act as conduits for horizontal transfer of miRNA from the cancer cells to the endothelium, switching the latter to a pathological phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings reveal that the ability to form the nanoscale conduits with endothelial cells correlates with the metastatic potential of the cancer cell, and that the pharmacological perturbation of these nanoscale connections can lead to a reduction in the metastatic burden in experimental metastasis models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our studies shed new insights into the tumour parenchymaendothelial communication, adding depth to the emerging paradigm of the ability of a cancer cell to hijack a physiological stromal cell for self-gain13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Indeed, exosomes have emerged as an extensively studied mechanism of horizontal intercellular transfer of information51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a key distinction exists between the exosome-mediated versus the nanoscale membrane bridge-mediated intercellular communication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the former is stochastic, that is, it is unlikely the cancer cell has control over which cell will be targeted by a secreted exosome, the communication via nanoscale membrane bridges is deterministic, that is, the cancer cell can connect to a specific endothelial cell, which could be further away than the most proximal endothelial cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although the aim of this study was to study the nanoscale membrane bridges as a mode of horizontal transfer of miRNAs from the metastatic cancer cells to the endothelium, and not to characterize a specific miRNA that are implicated in metastasis, many of the miRNAs, which were differentially regulated in the recipient endothelial cells, have previously been shown to regulate metastasis (Supplementary Discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, a downregulated miRNA, miR885, and an upregulated miR29 have both been implicated in directly suppressing the expression of CD276 (B7-H3)52, indicating that the overall increase in CD276 expression in recipient endothelial cells is probably an outcome of the altered miRNA regulome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, phenotypic overexpression of CD276 and CD137 is reported in tumour endothelium and correlates with metastasis53,54,55,56,58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of CD137 can increase endothelial cell surface expression of adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and E-selectin, which can contribute to recruitment and extravasation of cells53,54,55,56,58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although multiple mechanisms could play a role in the transition of an endothelial cell from a physiological to a pathological phenotype, the observation that pharmacological disruption of the nanoscale membrane bridges inhibits the increase in CD276 and CD137 expression both in vitro and in vivo suggests that the nanoscale membrane bridge-mediated cancer cellendothelial communication contribute to the process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, not every endothelial cell is transformed, but as outlined in a recent study the alteration of a fraction of endothelial niche cells is sufficient to open gates in these natural barriers for extravasation of cancer cells, thereby facilitating metastasis17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, our study add to the increasing repertoire of mechanisms that facilitate horizontal miRNA transfer in the metastatic setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observations also open up many fundamental questions, which need to be addressed in future studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, is there a heterogeneity of endothelial cells, that is, are there subsets of endothelial cells that attract the deterministic growth of the nanoscale membrane projections from cancer cells, and what are the drivers of the directed growth of these nanoscale bridges?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, there is significant heterogeneity in the subtypes of nanoscale membrane bridges, and the characterization and extent of involvements of these subtypes in metastasis needs to be elucidated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, we do see heterogeneity within a cancer cell population in their ability to form these nanostructures; what governs this heterogeneity?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, emerging insights that cancer cells with lower proliferation rate59 and enriched with lipid rafts form a higher number of intercellular nanoscale connections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These properties are typically associated with cancer stem-like cells60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This raises an interesting question whether the cancer cells that form nanoscale membrane bridges are more stem like?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, further understanding of the nanoscale conduit-mediated intercellular communication can offer potential novel strategies for the management of metastatic disease, which is currently associated with dismal 5-year survival rates.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
