Decoding and reprogramming fungal iterative nonribosomal peptide synthetases  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) assemble a large group of structurally and functionally diverse natural products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the iterative catalytic mechanism of bacterial NRPSs is known, it remains unclear how fungal NRPSs create products of desired length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that fungal iterative NRPSs adopt an alternate incorporation strategy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beauvericin and bassianolide synthetases have the same C1-A1-T1-C2-A2-MT-T2a-T2b-C3 domain organization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During catalysis, C3 and C2 take turns to incorporate the two biosynthetic precursors into the growing depsipeptide chain that swings between T1 and T2a/T2b with C3 cyclizing the chain when it reaches the full length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reconstruct the total biosynthesis of beauvericin in vitro by reacting C2 and C3 with two SNAC-linked precursors and present a domain swapping approach to reprogramming these enzymes for peptides with altered lengths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings highlight the difference between bacterial and fungal NRPS mechanisms and provide a framework for the enzymatic synthesis of non-natural nonribosomal peptides.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) represent an important family of bioactive natural products, such as daptomycin, penicillin and vancomycin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are assembled by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) that consist of a series of catalytic domains1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adenylation (A), thiolation (T) and condensation (C) are essential domains for the formation and elongation of the peptide chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other tailoring domains, such as methyltransferase (MT), oxidation (Ox) and epimerization (E), contribute to the large structural diversity in natural NRPs2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Iterative NRPSs generate NRP products with repeated moieties/monomers3, such as bacterial metabolites enterobactin, echinomycin and gramicidin, as well as fungal natural products beauvericin (1), beauvericins AC (24), bassianolide (5), enniatins AC (68) and verticilide (9) (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These molecules possess a wide range of biological activities, including antimicrobial, insecticidal, anthelmintic, herbicidal, anti-haptotactic, anti-cholesterol and anticancer activities3,4,5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19 are cyclic oligomers of monomer synthesized from a hydroxycarboxylic acid and an N-methylated amino acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, 1 is a cyclic trimer of a dipeptidol monomer synthesized from N-methyl-L-phenylalanine (N-Me-L-Phe) and D-hydroxyisovaleric acid (D-Hiv), and 5 is an octadepsipeptide containing four units of D-Hiv-N-Me-L-Leu (leucine: Leu).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, how fungal iterative NRPSs are programmed to assemble these compounds is not well understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Fungal iterative NRPSs and their products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Representative NRPs (19) synthesized by fungal iterative NRPSs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The monomer unit is green shaded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Domain organization of BbBEAS and BbBSLS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both modular enzymes have the same architecture of C1-A1-T1-C2-A2-MT-T2a-T2b-C3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To differentiate these two enzymes, BbBEAS is shown in blue and BbBSLS in red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) HPLC analysis of the in vitro reaction of BbBEAS and BbBSLS with ATP, SAM, D-Hiv and L-amino acid (L-Phe for BbBEAS and L-Leu for BbBSLS).Full size image', 'Beauveria bassiana is a filamentous fungus known to produce 15, and the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of these compounds have been reported9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The beauvericin and bassianolide synthetases (BbBEAS and BbBSLS) share significant sequence homology (66% identity and 79% similarity) and the same domain organization (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In spite of the high sequence similarity, BbBEAS catalyses recursive head-to-tail condensation of three dipeptidol monomers, while BbBSLS condenses four monomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, these enzymes constitute a promising model to understand the product elongation and length control mechanism by fungal iterative NRPSs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gene sequences of several other fungal NRPSs with the domain organization of C1-A1-T1-C2-A2-MT-T2a-T2b-C3 (Fig 1b) have also been reported11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The common architecture of these NRPSs suggests that they share a general assembly rule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous studies on bacterial iterative NRPSs, such as those involved in the biosynthesis of tyrocidine and gramicidin S, revealed that these enzymes use an oligomerization approach for chain elongation and length control through the C-terminal thioesterase (TE) domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They oligomerize a monomer intermediate formed by upstream condensation domains and catalyse the subsequent head-to-tail cyclization for product release12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, TE or a homologous domain is absent in fungal iterative NRPSs such as BbBEAS and BbBSLS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the conserved signature regions, it was generally proposed that A1 of BbBEAS and BbBSLS activates D-Hiv, while A2 recognizes L-Phe and L-Leu, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activated D-Hiv is transferred to T1, and MT methylates the A2-activated amino acid4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the roles of several key domains in these fungal NRPSs remain unknown, including the twin T2 domains and three C domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, the product assembly process by fungal NRPSs is poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this work, we report that BbBEAS and BbBSLS adopt an alternate incorporation strategy to assemble the products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two precursors, D-Hiv and N-Me-L-Phe/N-Me-L-Leu, are alternately incorporated into the extending depsipeptide chain by C2 and C3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C3 domain controls the product length and cyclizes the full-length depsipeptide chain to form the final products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Products with altered chain lengths are obtained by swapping the C3 domain, providing a domain swapping approach to reprogramming these enzymes for new molecules.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Purification and reconstitution of BbBEAS and BbBSLS', 'We have recently expressed BbBEAS and BbBSLS and achieved high-yield production of 15 (33.8 mg l1 for 14 and 21.7 mg l1 for 5) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae BJ5464-NpgA14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To decode the functions of the catalytic domains in BbBEAS (352 kDa) and BbBSLS (348 kDa), we first expressed and purified these giant enzymes from S. cerevisiae BJ5464-NpgA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Supplementary Fig 1, both enzymes were expressed in the yeast and obtained in pure form (0.8 mg l1 for both BbBEAS and BbBSLS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reaction of C-His6-tagged BbBEAS with adenosine triphosphate (ATP), S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), L-Phe and D-Hiv yielded 1 (trace i, Fig 1c), which was confirmed by electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) (Supplementary Fig 2), high-resolution electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS) (Supplementary Fig 3) and a comparison with the authentic sample prepared and fully characterized in our previous work (trace ii, Fig 1c)14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, BbBSLS was found to synthesize 5 (traces iii and iv, Fig 1c, Supplementary Fig 2 and Supplementary Fig 4) from L-Leu and D-Hiv14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Formation of 1 and 5 allowed direct functional characterization of BbBEAS and BbBSLS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicated that both BbBEAS and BbBSLS were functionally expressed in S. cerevisiae and their catalytic activity can be reconstituted in vitro, providing a great platform to further study the catalytic domains in these modular NRPSs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Roles of the twin T2 domains and the biosynthetic model', 'Two possible biosynthetic models were proposed for BbBEAS and other similar NRPSs: linear (alternate incorporation of the precursors) and parallel (oligomerization of a monomer synthesized from the precursors) (Fig 2a)4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the linear model, T1 and T2a/T2b are alternately used for tethering the growing depsipeptide chain for addition of the D-hydroxycarboxylic acid and N-Me-L-amino acid units.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T2a and T2b have the same function and only one of them is required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in the parallel model, one of the twin T2 domains is proposed to hold the synthesized dipeptidol monomer after it is synthesized at the other T2 domain4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional monomers are added to the T2b- or T2a-linked monomer through oligomerization to form the dimer and subsequently the trimer (1) or tetramer (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this parallel model, both twin T2 domains are required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacterial iterative NRPSs adopt a product assembly process that is more like the parallel model in Fig 2a, except that the growing product chain is linked to the TE instead of a T domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand what model is used by fungal iterative NRPSs, it is necessary to reveal the roles of the twin T2 domains in BbBEAS and BbBSLS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Roles

and/or T2b on bassianolide biosynthesis.Full size image', 'Sequence analysis revealed that the twin T2 domains in both BbBEAS and BbBSLS contain the conserved motif (I/L)GG(D/H)SL, in which the key serine (Ser or S) residue serves as the phosphopantetheine attachment site (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first examined how inactivation of T2a and/or T2b affects the biosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutation of S2591 in T2a to alanine (A) did not abolish the production of beauvericins (trace i, Fig 2b), but the titre (0.7±0.1 mg l1) calculated from three replicates was significantly lower than that (33.8±1.4 mg l1) by wild-type BbBEAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the T2b mutant BbBEAS-S2688A produced beauvericins (trace ii, Fig 2b) with a titre of 23.0±1.0 mg l1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When both key Ser residues were mutated, no products were synthesized by BbBEAS-S2591A/S2688A (trace iii, Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We next tested how removal of the twin T2 domains from BbBEAS affects beauvericin biosynthesis using a dissection and co-expression approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BbBEAS was dissected at different positions and the fragments were functionally expressed in S. cerevisiae BJ5464-NpgA (traces iiv, Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this system, we removed T2a from BbBEAS by co-expressing C1-A1-T1-C2-A2-MT and T2b-C3 in the yeast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Liquid chromatographymass spectrometry (LCMS) analysis revealed that beauvericins were produced at 5.0±1.2 mg l1 (trace v, Fig 2c) in the absence of T2a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was validated by the construction of an intact enzyme BbBEAS-T2a, which produced beauvericins at 0.5±0.1 mg l1 (trace vi, Fig 2c), confirming that the dissection and co-expression approach is effective and reliable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To remove T2b, C1-A1-T1-C2-A2-MT-T2a and standalone C3 were co-expressed in the yeast, yielding 14 at 13.0±3.9 mg l1 (trace vii, Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When both T2 domains were removed, no products were detected (trace viii, Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results were consistent with those from Ser mutations, which confirmed that only one of the twin T2 domains is required for beauvericin biosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Similarly, we also dissected BbBSLS before and after T2a, and confirmed that the fragments can be co-expressed in the yeast to reconstitute bassianolide biosynthesis (traces i and ii, Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Removal of T2a (trace iii, Fig 2d) or T2b (trace iv, Fig 2d) did not abolish the production of 5, although the titre by the former was much lower (2.9 mg l1 versus 10.6 mg l1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This further confirmed that T2a plays a major role in the biosynthetic process as inactivation or removal of this domain significantly lowered the efficiency of the product assembly line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, T2b is less important in the biosynthetic process and may serve as an auxiliary T domain to contribute to the overall efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the presence of both twin T2 domains is not necessary for the biosynthesis, the possibility of oligomerization (parallel model) in chain elongation can be ruled out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is concluded that 15 are assembled through an alternate incorporation approach (linear model, Fig 2a) by the fungal NRPSs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The condensation activity of the C1 and C2 domains', 'Another mystery of BbBEAS and BbBSLS is the unknown roles of the three C domains in the biosynthetic process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analysed the C domains in four reported fungal iterative NRPSs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3a, the C2 domains of these fungal NRPSs have the conserved HHxxxDG motif15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was generally believed that the second histidine (H) in this motif serves as a general base for the condensation in most NRPSs, while aspartic acid (D) plays an important role in the structure of C domains16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first H residue in this motif is not highly conserved, as some C domains such as the C3 domains shown in Fig 3a have an S at this position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exact function of the G residue in this motif is not clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared to C2 and C3, the C1 domains of these fungal NRPSs are more divergent and C1(BbBEAS) does not have the essential H residue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the C-terminal condensation domain, C3 is likely involved in the final cyclization and concomitant release of the peptide chain from the end of the NRPS assembly lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining two condensation domains, C1 and C2, are possibly responsible for forming the ester and amide bonds in the product assembly line, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first tested the condensation activity of C2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C2(BbBEAS) was overexpressed and purified from E. coli BL21(DE3) (Supplementary Fig 6), and reacted with D-Hiv-SNAC (S1) (SNAC: N-acetylcysteamine)18 and N-Me-L-Phe-SNAC (S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3b, D-Hiv-N-Me-L-Phe-SNAC (S3) was synthesized by C2(BbBEAS), and then spontaneously cyclized to form cyclo-D-Hiv-N-Me-L-Phe (10, Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, this domain could not form an ester bond as the reaction of S1 and (D-Hiv-N-Me-L-Phe)2-SNAC (S4) with C2(BbBEAS) did not yield any products (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the role of C2 was determined to be forming the amide bond in the assembly process of NRPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Investigation of the condensation activity of C1 and C2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a)

next attempted to understand whether C1 forms the ester bond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C1(BbBEAS) was overexpressed and purified from E. coli BL21(DE3) (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incubation of C1(BbBEAS) with S1+S2 or S1+S4 did not yield any products (Fig 3c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because C1(BbBEAS) lacks the active site H, we mutated D179 to A and expressed this mutant enzyme BbBEAS-D179A in S. cerevisiae BJ5464-NpgA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LCMS analysis revealed the synthesis of beauvericins by BbBEAS-D179A (trace i, Fig 3e) at 24.2±1.0 mg l1, indicating that the mutation did not affect the biosynthetic process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, mutation of H170 and D174 in the conserved motif of C1 of BbBSLS did not interfere with bassianolide biosynthesis (traces ii and iii, Fig 3e), indicating that mutation of these functionally or structurally important residues does not influence the biosynthesis of 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results clearly indicate that C1 has no condensation activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further probe the role of C1 in beauvericin biosynthesis, we constructed a truncated version of BbBEAS by removing C1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No beauvericins were produced by BbBEAS-C1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of standalone C1(BbBEAS) into the yeast did not recover beauvericin biosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SDSPAGE analysis revealed that BbBEAS-C1 (308 kDa) was not expressed and the attempt to purify His6-tagged BbBEAS-C1 using Ni-NTA chromatography from the yeast host failed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, BbBSLS-C1 could not be expressed in the yeast either.

cause observable changes in the formation rate of 10 (trace iii, Fig 5d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dimer substrate S4 is stable in the buffer (trace iv, Fig 5d), but was not cyclized by C3(BbBEAS) to yield 16 (trace v, Fig 5d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trimer substrate (D-Hiv-N-Me-L-Phe)3-SNAC (S6) mimics the full-length intermediate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This substrate is stable in the reaction buffer (trace vi,

applied to C1(BbBEAS) but no cyclization products 16 and 1 were detected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These in vitro reactions further confirmed that C3 catalysed the macrocyclization in beauvericin biosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutation of the active site residue H in C3(BbBEAS) to A abolished its macrocyclization activity, indicating that this domain uses the same active site for the condensation and macrocyclization, both leading to the formation of an ester bond (intermolecular or intramolecular) between the carboxyl of L-Phe and hydroxyl of D-Hiv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, C3 only cyclizes the mature depsipeptide intermediate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This property is critical for chain length control, which also explains why 10 and 16 are not produced by the beauvericin-producing strain B. bassiana

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Fungal NRPs represent an important group of bioactive natural products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BbBEAS and BbBSLS are two fungal iterative NRPSs that are involved in the biosynthesis of the anticancer NRPs 15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the assembly process of these cyclooligomer depsipeptides is unclear, largely due to the poorly understood domains including T2a, T2b, C1, C2 and C3 in these modular enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a combination of enzyme dissection, domain swapping, site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro enzymatic reactions to study BbBEAS and BbBSLS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work elucidates fungal NRPSs chain elongation and length control strategy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Highly consistent results were obtained from both BbBEAS and BbBSLS, suggesting that this family of fungal iterative NRPSs follows a general biosynthetic mechanism, which is different from the approach used by bacterial iterative NRPSs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A typical NRPS module contains a C domain, an A domain and a T domain for chain elongation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-existence of two T domains in module 2 of fungal iterative NRPSs not only represents an interesting structural feature, but also raises questions about the roles of these T domains in fungal NRP biosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are several examples of twin carrier proteins in a megasynthase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, it was previously reported that module 6 of the leinamycin polyketide synthase from Streptomyces atroolivaceus S-140 contains twin acyl carrier protein (ACP) domains that are separated by a MT domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Either is sufficient for the biosynthesis, and ACP62 is preferred21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our work, we found that T2a plays a major role in the formation of the NRPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two possible biosynthetic models have been previously proposed to explain the biosynthetic process of fungal NRPs based on how the depsipeptide chain is elongated and how the twin T2 domains are involved in the assembly process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We specifically mutated the key Ser residue in these T domains that is required for the 4-phosphopantetheinylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inactivation of either T2 domain did not abolish the formation of the corresponding NRPs, but affected the yield to different extents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were observed when one of the T2 domains was removed, providing solid evidence against the parallel model (Fig 2a), which requires the functions of both T2a and T2b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is hypothesized that the biosynthesis of 15 proceeds through the linear model (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was confirmed by the in vitro reactions of C2(BbBEAS) and C3(BbBEAS), which demonstrated that C2 forms the amide bond and C3 catalyses the synthesis of the ester bond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-reactions of C2(BbBEAS) and C3(BbBEAS) with D-Hiv-SNAC and N-Me-L-Phe-SNAC reconstituted the in vitro biosynthesis of 1 with only two condensation domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, some of the intermediates or hydrolysis products were observed, including cyclo-D-Hiv-N-Me-L-Phe, (D-Hiv-N-Me-L-Phe)2-SNAC, (D-Hiv-N-Me-L-Phe)2-D-Hiv (hydrolysis product) and (D-Hiv-N-Me-L-Phe)3-SNAC, which provides direct evidence for the alternate incorporation approach described in the linear biosynthetic model (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'C3 is a crucial domain that integrates three functions, including condensation, chain length control and macrocyclization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While it acts like normal condensation domains to form the ester bond in the depsipeptide chain, this domain is actively involved in chain elongation and catalyses the macrocyclization of the mature intermediate for product release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is different from CT domains in fungal noniterative NRPSs that only perform cyclization22 and Cy domains that form oxazoline or thiazoline rings using the D residues in the conserved motif DXXXXD23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacterial iterative NRPSs typically use a C-terminal TE domain to cyclize and release the final products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enterobactin synthetase is such an enzyme whose TE plays a key role in the oligomerization25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The monomer intermediate is transferred from the T domain of EntF (C-A-T-TE) to the active site Ser residue of the TE, which allows the T domain to be used for the formation of the next monomer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TE catalyses the oligomerization and holds the growing peptide chain until it reaches the full length for macrocyclization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar TE was observed in the tyrocidine12 and gramicidin NRPSs13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was also reported that cyclooligomerization can be catalysed through ATP-dependent condensation reactions by NRPS-independent siderophore synthetases, such as DesD26, PubC27 and BibC28 that participate in the biosynthesis of desferrioxamine, putrebactin and bisucaberin, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we show that fungal iterative NRPSs use a different strategy for chain elongation and product length control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacterial NRPSs use an oligomerization approach through their C-terminal TE for product chain elongation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cyclooligomerization by bacterial iterative NRPSs involves acylation and deacylation of the active site serine residue of the C-terminal TE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The monomer intermediate is formed by upstream domains and transferred from a T domain to the Ser of TE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional units of the monomer are then added to the monomer-O-TE intermediate to elongate the peptide chain to the full length for product cyclization and release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, bacterial iterative NRPSs oligomerize a monomer unit that is synthesized from the precursors for chain elongation, and the growing oligomer intermediate is formed at and always tethered to the TE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, fungal iterative NRPSs use an alternate incorporation approach to extend the peptide chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The growing depsipeptide chain in the biosynthesis of 15 swings between T1 and the twin T2 domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The monomer is not used as a unit for chain elongation at all.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C3 needs to work with the other condensation domain (C2) to alternately incorporate the two precursors (D-Hiv and N-Me-L-Phe or N-Me-L-Leu).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, bacterial iterative NRPSs adopt a product assembly process that is more like the parallel model in Fig 2a, while fungal iterative NRPSs use a linear biosynthetic route.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the linear model (Fig 2a), C3(BbBEAS) forms an ester bond between T1-tethered D-Hiv and T2a- or T2b-tethered D-Hiv-N-Me-L-Phe and (D-Hiv-N-Me-L-Phe)2 in beauvericin biosynthesis, while C2 catalyses the formation of an amide bond between T2a- or T2b-tethered N-Me-L-Phe and T1-tethered D-Hiv, D-Hiv-N-Me-L-Phe-D-Hiv and (D-Hiv-N-Me-L-Phe)2-D-Hiv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C3(BbBSLS) has the same function except that N-Me-L-Leu is used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both C2 and C3 work collaboratively to elongate the depsipeptide chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once C2 catalyses the last condensation step to yield the full-length depsipeptide chain, C3 acts as a decision maker to determine and inform the biosynthetic machinery of whether further elongation is required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, when a hexadepsipeptide intermediate is synthesized, C3(BbBEAS) will shut down the elongation line and perform the macrocyclization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, C3(BbBSLS) will continue the elongation to get an octadepsipeptide intermediate and then conduct the macrocyclization and product release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When C3(BbBEAS) was substituted for the C3 in BbBSLS, it continued to condense D-Hiv and the hexadepsipeptide intermediate (D-Hiv-N-Me-L-Phe)3, and C2(BbBEAS) will continue to form an additional amide bond to get an octadepsipeptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cyclization of this intermediate yielded the new product 15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, substitution of C3(BbBSLS) with its counterpart in BbBEAS switched BbBSLS from an octadepsipeptide synthetase to a hexadepsipeptide synthetase and yielded 8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, C2 is flexible and can catalyse extra or fewer condensations according to the command of C3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While C3 is strict with the number of condensation, it is flexible enough to condense unnatural precursors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, reprogramming of BbBEAS and BbBSLS can be conveniently and readily achieved by swapping the C3 domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work thus provides an unprecedented tool for engineering fungal iterative NRPSs to yield unnatural cyclooligomer depsipeptides with varied chain lengths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work also presents in vitro total biosynthesis of a fungal NRP using only two condensation domains.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
