Shugoshin forms a specialized chromatin domain at subtelomeres that regulates transcription and replication timing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A chromosome is composed of structurally and functionally distinct domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of chromatin structure and the function of subtelomeres, the telomere-adjacent regions, remain obscure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the roles of the conserved centromeric protein Shugoshin 2 (Sgo2) in defining chromatin structure and functions of the subtelomeres in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that Sgo2 localizes at the subtelomeres preferentially during G2 phase and is essential for the formation of a highly condensed subtelomeric chromatin body knob.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the absence of Sgo2 leads to the derepression of the subtelomeric genes and premature DNA replication at the subtelomeric late origins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the subtelomeric specialized chromatin domain organized by Sgo2 represses both transcription and replication to ensure proper gene expression and replication timing.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Eukaryotic chromosomes consist of various chromatin domains that contribute to genomic integrity and functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The telomere is a specialized chromatin domain located at chromosome ends that contains repetitive nucleotide sequences called telomere repeats and associated proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The telomere protects the chromosome ends and ensures proper chromosome movement during both mitosis and meiosis for genome stability1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subtelomere is the chromosomal region located adjacent to the telomere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subtelomeric (ST) DNA contains multiple elements that share high sequence similarity among the subtelomeres of an individual organism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the subtelomeres are highly variable in length and commonly contain an X element and tandem copies of a Y element, which includes the open reading frame (ORF) of an RNA helicase gene4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In humans, the subtelomeres comprise a complex mosaic of  greater than 40 duplicated segments with a variety of ORFs5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the sequencing is not yet complete ( http://www.pombase.org/status/sequencing-status), the subtelomeres of S. pombe also contain a mosaic region of multiple segments of the highly similar sequences that spans 50 kb of the telomere-proximal site6,7a site containing multiple ORFs of common genes including the RecQ-type DNA helicase genes (tlh1+and tlh2+).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the chromatin structure of the S. pombe subtelomere is composed of two distinct parts: heterochromatin and ST chromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heterochromatin contains histone H3 with methylated Lys9 (H3K9me) and HP1 homologues, and spans 4580 kb of the telomere-proximal site8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The adjacent telomere-distal ST chromatin spans 50 kb and shows low sequence similarity among the subtelomeres, but shares a common feature of low levels of methylated and acetylated histones11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the substantial accumulation of knowledge on telomeres, not much attention has been paid to subtelomeres, and their regulation and physiological function remain largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The centromere is a crucial domain for the faithful segregation of chromosomes during cell division.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shugoshin (Sgo) is a conserved centromeric protein that protects centromeric cohesion and promotes loading of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) onto centromeres12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S. pombe possesses two Sgo paralogues: Sgo1 and Sgo2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sgo1 is expressed specifically during meiosis I, recruits PP2A phosphatase to the centromeres and thereby counteracts the casein kinase 1-dependent cleavage of cohesin13,21; in contrast, Sgo2 is ubiquitously expressed during the mitotic and meiotic cell cycle, and plays an important role in recruitment of CPC to the centromeres for proper chromosome segregation in M phase18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, during interphase, the accumulation of Sgo2 at the centromeres decreases and, instead, a substantial fraction appears at the vicinity of the telomeres17,18,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, details of the regulation and localization of Sgo2 during interphase, in addition to its physiological roles at the telomere vicinity, remain largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we reveal new roles of Sgo2 at the subtelomeres in S. pombe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that Sgo2 associates with the subtelomeres preferentially during G2 phase and is essential for the formation of a highly condensed interphase-specific chromatin structure at the subtelomeres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Sgo2 regulates ST gene expression by reducing the occupancy of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and maintains normal timing of DNA replication by limiting loading of a replication initiation factor to the late origins within the subtelomeres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, Sgo2 defines the chromatin structure and functions of subtelomeres during interphase in S.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pombe.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Sgo2 associates with the subtelomeres of chromosomes 1 and 2', 'To characterize the precise distribution of Sgo2 across the three chromosomes of S. pombe (Fig 1a), we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)chip analyses of Flag-tagged Sgo2 in logarithmically proliferating cells, which were primarily in interphase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sgo2-Flag was enriched not only at the centromeres but also at the subtelomeres of both chromosomes 1 and 2 (subtel1L, 1R, 2L and 2R), extending  greater than 100 kb from each telomere (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These Sgo2-enriched regions encompassed the clusters of non-essential genes23 and partially overlapped with the telomere-adjacent ST heterochromatin, which contains H3K9me and the heterochromatin protein Swi6/HP1 (refs 8, 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Sgo2 associates with the whole subtelomeres of chromosomes 1 and 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic illustration of S. pombe chromosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chromosomes 1 and 2 contain telomere-proximal common sequences that are highly similar among the subtelomeres, whereas chromosome 3 contains rDNA repeats close to the telomeres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) ChIPchip analysis of the genome-wide distribution of Sgo2-Flag in logarithmically growing wt cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that the probes used in the tiling array did not encompass regions outside the rDNA repeats on chromosome 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Magnification of the ChIPchip data for the subtelomeric regions shown in b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gaps in the data represent regions not included in the chips due to a lack of sequence information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) ChIP analyses of Sgo2-Flag localization at the rDNA repeats in asynchronous cultures (predominantly in interphase).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative fold enrichment, normalized to the signal at the his1+ locus, is shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No tag indicates the negative control for the ChIP analyses;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this study, we have discovered new regulations and functions of the subtelomere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have shown that Sgo2, which accumulates at the centromeres and contributes to precise chromosome segregation during M phase, is recruited to the subtelomeres during interphase, especially G2 phase, and plays a role in the organization of the condensed chromatin body called a knob, in the repression of gene transcription and in the repression of replication, to ensure proper gene expression and replication timing at the subtelomeres (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 8: Model of the multiple roles of Sgo2 during the cell cycle.During M phase, Sgo2 accumulates at the outer regions of the centromeres, where H3K9me is enriched and recruits CPC for precise chromosome segregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In interphase, Sgo2 is enriched at the heterochromatin-adjacent region of the subtelomeres, where the levels of the histone modifications such as H3K9me, H3K4me and H3K36me are relatively low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sgo2 is essential to form the knob structures and to repress both gene transcription and replication, to ensure proper gene expression and replication timing.Full size image', 'It is currently unknown how Sgo2 is targeted to the subtelomeres during interphase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphorylation of H2A-S121 can be observed outside the subtelomeres in interphase (Supplementary Fig 4), indicating that H2A-S121 phosphorylation alone is not sufficient, and that another factor is required to restrict Sgo2 access to the subtelomeres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility is that Teb1a regulator of histone gene expression that localizes at the subtelomeres44may support the recruitment of Sgo2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As Sgo2 dynamically changes its location during the cell cycle, some cell cycle regulators may also be involved in Sgo2 recruitment to the subtelomeres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Notably, knobs are not formed at the centromeres at any stage of the cell cycle34, despite the high accumulation of Sgo2 at that location in M phase, suggesting that Sgo2 requires other factors to form knobs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detailed mechanism underlying the subtelomere-specific formation of knobs remains unclear; however, one possibility is that ST chromatin contributes to this process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ST chromatin is characterized by its unique histone composition with low levels of acetylated and methylated histones, and the histone H2A variant H2A.Z11,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low level of H3K9 methylation at the telomere-distal region of the subtelomeres (adjacent to the ST heterochromatin region) is in marked contrast to the high level of H3K9 methylation at the Sgo2-associated outer regions of the centromeres11,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, knobs are observed preferentially at the telomere-distal regions of the subtelomeres34 (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Set2 is important for Sgo2 localization and knob formation34 (Fig 4c,d); however, the level of Set2-dependent H3K36 methylation was found to be increased by Sgo2 deletion (Fig 5e), which might seem to be contradictory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H3K36 methylation has been shown to be associated with transcription elongation and is observed at actively transcribed regions35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is likely to be that Set2 recruited by the transcription at subtelomeres somehow promotes Sgo2 localization, thereby leading to knob formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Either the knob or Sgo2 itself may in turn repress the transcription and/or accessibility of histone-modifying enzymes including Set2, thereby forming a negative feedback loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Removal of Sgo2 from the subtelomeres would resolve the condensed knob structures, leading to the activation of gene expression and the recruitment of Set2, resulting in the observed increase in H3K36 methylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Does the knob structure itself regulate gene transcription and replication?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highly condensed nature of a knob may limit access of the transcription and replication machineries to chromatin, which would be consistent with the observation that the association of both RNAPII and the replication regulator Sld3 with the subtelomeres was increased in knob-deficient sgo2 cells (Figs 5d and 7d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another possibility is that Sgo2 itself recruits some regulatory factors to the subtelomeres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies in S. cerevisiase have revealed that the telomere-binding protein Rif1 regulates the replication timing of late origins by interacting with PP1 phosphatase to counteract the action of Dbf4-dependent kinase at the initiation step of replication46,47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Sgo1 forms a complex with PP2A phosphatase to protect cohesin in S. pombe, S. cerevisiae and mammals21,49,50,51, and human Sgo2 also interacts with PP2A for the protection of cohesion52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, S. pombe Sgo2 may also interact with a protein phosphatase to counteract with the activity of Dbf4-dependent kinase and thereby regulate Sld3 loading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It has been predicted that early replication from the subtelomere region will lead to an increase in the length of telomere DNA53,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore checked whether the early replication caused by Sgo2 deletion leads to abnormal telomere elongation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Telomere Southern analysis showed that the telomere DNA lengths were only slightly shorter in sgo2 and bub1 cells than in wt cells (Supplementary Fig 12), suggesting that Sgo2 is not important for telomere length control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'What are the physiological roles of the ST gene repression caused by Sgo2?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Matsuda et al.34 reported that the frequency of knob formation substantially decreased when cells were arrested in G1 phase by nitrogen starvation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this condition, Sgo2 might dissociate from the subtelomeres, inducing the expression of some ST genes in response to the nutrient stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another stress conditionlow glucose stress (from 111 to 4.4 mM)has been shown to induce the expression of a set of hexose transporter genes called ght1+-ght8+ (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  55), of which ght3+ and ght7+ are located at the subtelomeres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 5c, deletion of Sgo2 caused an increase in the expression of ght3+ and ght7+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that Sgo2 might dissociate from the subtelomeres under some stress conditions including low glucose, to enable the efficient activation of ST gene expression for cell survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, this study has revealed that Sgo defines chromatin functions not only at the centromeres but also at the subtelomeres in a cell cycle-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus far, ST localization of Sgo in other organisms has not been reported; however, some cases in which Sgo relocates from the centromeres to the chromosome arms have been demonstrated in human cells and in Xenopus egg extracts56,57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, one can speculate that the translocation of Sgo to subtelomeres or other chromosomal regions might lead to the local organization of a repressive chromatin domain in other eukaryotes, as it does in S.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pombe.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
