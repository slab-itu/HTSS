T-cell activation is an immune correlate of risk in BCG vaccinated infants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Vaccines to protect against tuberculosis (TB) are urgently needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed a casecontrol analysis to identify immune correlates of TB disease risk in Bacille CalmetteGuerin (BCG) immunized infants from the MVA85A efficacy trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among 53 TB case infants and 205 matched controls, the frequency of activated HLA-DR+ CD4+ T cells associates with increased TB disease risk (OR=1.828, 95% CI=1.252.68, P=0.002, FDR=0.04, conditional logistic regression).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an independent study of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected adolescents, activated HLA-DR+ CD4+ T cells also associate with increased TB disease risk (OR=1.387, 95% CI=1.0681.801, P=0.014, conditional logistic regression).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In infants, BCG-specific T cells secreting IFN- associate with reduced risk of TB (OR=0.502, 95% CI=0.290.86, P=0.013, FDR=0.14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The causes and impact of T-cell activation on disease risk should be considered when designing and testing TB vaccine candidates for these populations.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Tuberculosis (TB) causes higher mortality than any other infectious disease globally and there is an urgent need for improved vaccines if we are to control the epidemic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incidence of TB disease in children under 2 years of age in the Western Cape of South Africa is estimated to be 1.5% per annum1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the widespread use of Bacille CalmetteGuérin (BCG), we do not have an immune correlate of TB risk following immunization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Defects in cytokine signalling pathways for interferon (IFN)- and interleukin (IL)-12 increase susceptibility to mycobacterial infection in humans2,3,4,5,6, suggesting a role for these cytokines in protection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HIV infection is also a risk factor, with TB risk increasing as CD4 T-cell counts decline7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animal studies have confirmed the importance of CD4 T cells and IFN- in protection from TB disease8,9 and have guided the development of new candidate TB vaccines, which increase immunity against M. tuberculosis through boosting of a Th1 type cellular immune response10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, results from an immune correlates study in BCG-vaccinated infants from the Western Cape of South Africa did not find BCG antigen-specific Th1 cytokine-secreting T cells to be associated with reduced TB disease risk11, and the Th1 boosting candidate TB vaccine MVA85A (Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara expressing Ag85A from M. tuberculosis) did not improve protection in BCG-vaccinated infants12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To aid the development of more effective TB vaccines, there is an urgent need to identify immune correlates of TB disease risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although MVA85A did not protect against TB disease beyond that conferred by BCG alone, all infants were vaccinated with BCG at birth and analysis of samples collected from infants subsequently diagnosed as TB cases in the trial provided an opportunity to identify correlates of TB risk12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed a casecontrol study on cryopreserved blood samples using immune assays, that measured both BCG-specific and non-specific immune responses with the aim of identifying immune variables, which correlate with disease risk in BCG-vaccinated infants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In BCG-vaccinated infants, activated HLA-DR+ CD4+ T cells associate with increased risk of TB and BCG-specific T cells secreting IFN- associate with reduced risk of TB disease over the next 3 years of life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The causes and impact of T-cell activation should be considered when designing and testing candidate TB vaccines.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this primary correlates of risk analysis, we have demonstrated that activated HLA-DR+ CD4+ T cells were associated with subsequent risk of TB disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding was replicated in an independent cohort of M. tuberculosis-infected adolescents who either progressed to active TB disease, or who remained healthy over 2 years of follow-up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have also shown that BCG-specific IFN--secreting T cells measured by ELISpot assay were associated with a reduced risk of TB disease in infants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BCG-specific IFN--secreting T cells were not measured in the adolescent cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of BCG-specific IFN--secreting T cells in infants was linear with higher numbers of IFN--secreting T cells associated with a greater reduction in risk of TB disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main effect of IFN--secreting T cells appeared to be in the first 612 months of follow-up, suggesting an early protective effect of BCG-specific IFN--secreting T cells in infancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activated T cells are known to be associated with HIV progression but this is the first report of an association between T-cell activation and TB disease risk15,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although BCG immunization has been shown to drive early BCG-specific CD4+ T-cell activation in this infant population, we do not know if BCG immunization is driving T-cell activation or if other factors such as immunization with extended programme of immunisation (EPI) vaccines or infection with pathogens is contributing to T-cell activation19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection with CMV has been shown to drive T-cell activation in HIV-positive patients and we did observe a correlation between T-cell activation and CMV ELISpot response in this study20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an immune phenotyping study, differences in T-cell activation were largely associated with environmental and not genetic factors, with CMV identified as the major microbial driver of immune variation22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The factors that drive variation in BCG efficacy include previous exposure to mycobacteria, age and proximity to the equator23; these factors have all been associated with increased T-cell activation24,25,26,27,28,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elevated CD4 T-cell activation observed in M. tuberculosis-infected progressors coincides with an elevated type I/II interferon signature, which is suggestive of incipient or sub-clinical TB (Zak et al.,31 in the press), suggesting a possible link between bacterial replication and T-cell activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary CMV infection typically peaks at birth and again in adolescence32,33 and may also be contributing to T-cell activation in this adolescent cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is likely that there are other, unknown factors driving immune activation in the adolescents, and that these may be different to those driving CD4 T-cell activation in infants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultimately, multiple mechanisms of CD4 T-cell activation may be associated with risk of TB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The cellular immune response to BCG administered at birth in South African infants peaks at 610 weeks19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples collected here were 1620 weeks post BCG immunization and we see an association between BCG-specific IFN- ELISpot response and reduced TB disease risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The importance of an intact Th1 type cellular immune response in protective immunity has been demonstrated in human genetic studies and murine M. tuberculosis challenge experiments2,3,4,5,6,8,9, however, this is the first time a role has been demonstrated for magnitude of vaccine-induced IFN--secreting T cells and reduced TB disease risk in a human immune correlates study11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A previous study in this infant population found no association of IFN- with TB disease risk11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study differs in several aspects, which could explain the contrasting results including the time point (age) at which the response was measured (at peak or post-peak), IFN- assay used (ELISpot versus intracellular cytokine assay), sample type (PBMC versus whole blood), statistical design, more stringent TB case definition and different control definition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In infants, the magnitude of the MVA85A-boosted Ag85A, PPD and BCG-specific IFN- ELISpot response is lower than that of UK adults, children or adolescents12,34,35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that the lack of efficacy with MVA85A was due to insufficient boosting of a Th1 type immune response in infants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An unexpected finding was the association of Ag85A-specific IgG measured at D28 (57 months of age) with reduced risk of TB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ag85A-specific IgG increased from D0 to D28 in both treatment groups in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibody response are likely primed by BCG vaccination at birth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, they could also be rising due to exposure to environmental mycobacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a cohort of 66 BCG-vaccinated infants in Turkey, PPD-specific IgG levels began to rise at 4 months of age and progressively increased through to the end of the study at 15 months of age37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there are no published studies describing BCG-specific antibody responses in South African infants, it is possible that Ag85A IgG would have a similar kinetic and would be rising in this infant cohort at the time of randomization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although the Ag85A IgG response was boosted after vaccination with MVA85A, there was no significant effect of vaccination status when included as a main effect in our D28 analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that the infant Ag85A antibody response induced by MVA85A was short-lived or that the protective effect of induced antibodies was masked as Ag85A IgG antibodies were also rising in the placebo group in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also possible that in BCG-vaccinated infants Ag85A IgG is not directly linked with reduced risk but is correlated with an alternative protective immune mechanism induced by BCG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not see any significant differences using a MGIA between case and control infants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of difference could be due to sample size or lack of sensitivity of the assay; however, we did not use autologous serum in the MGIA assay and would not therefore have measured any potential effect of antibodies on the control of mycobacterial growth in infant PBMC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The immune correlates identified in this study would ideally be confirmed in independent clinical studies in BCG-vaccinated infants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the infant population in the Western Cape in South Africa has the highest incidence of non-HIV-associated TB recorded in the world at a rate of 1.39 per hundred person years12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With such a low incidence rate, the MVA85A trial had to enrol 2,797 infants who were followed up for a median of 24.6 months at a total cost of 30 million US dollars to gain sufficient power to determine differences between the placebo and MVA85A arms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finding that T-cell immunogenicity is reduced in infants compared with adults with MVA85A and other subunit vaccines in development, together with the realization that an adolescent vaccine would have a greater impact on transmission, has led to a refocusing within the field on adolescents as the most important target population38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the TB incidence rate in adolescents and adults is even lower than in infants and a TB vaccine efficacy trial will therefore be more costly and lengthy in these populations than it was in infants14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Nonetheless, we have identified CD4+ T-cell activation as a potential correlate of TB disease risk in BCG-vaccinated infants and have confirmed this finding in an independent adolescent cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we have identified BCG-specific IFN- T cells as a correlate of reduced risk in infants, supporting the concept of Th1 boosting in TB vaccine design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also identified Ag85A-specific IgG as a potential novel immune correlate of TB disease risk in BCG-vaccinated infants, suggesting a possible role for both Ag85A antibodies and BCG-specific IFN- T cells in protection from TB disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these responses may be impaired by T-cell activation and the impact of T-cell activation on disease risk should be considered when designing and testing TB vaccine candidates for these populations.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
