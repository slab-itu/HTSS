Boundaries can steer active Janus spheres  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The advent of autonomous self-propulsion has instigated research towards making colloidal machines that can deliver mechanical work in the form of transport, and other functions such as sensing and cleaning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While much progress has been made in the last 10 years on various mechanisms to generate self-propulsion, the ability to steer self-propelled colloidal devices has so far been much more limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A critical barrier in increasing the impact of such motors is in directing their motion against the Brownian rotation, which randomizes particle orientations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, here we report directed motion of a specific class of catalytic motors when moving in close proximity to solid surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is achieved through active quenching of their Brownian rotation by constraining it in a rotational well, caused not by equilibrium, but by hydrodynamic effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate how combining these geometric constraints can be utilized to steer these active colloids along arbitrary trajectories.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The ability to accurately steer self-propelled particles without the application of an external force field should have far reaching consequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such precise navigational control is essential for cargo transport1,2,3, repair and drug delivery within the body4, sensing5, environmental remediation6 and even micro-surgery targeting individual cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Self-propelled colloidal motors7,8, which transduce chemical energy into mechanical motion are an important class of active matter9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A critical challenge is in directing the motion of such active colloids, which include bi-metallic nanorods12, nanotubes13 and Janus spheres14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The major barrier is Brownian rotation, which randomizes particle orientations15, leading to long-time isotropic enhanced diffusion16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current strategies for directing catalytic motors include external magnetic fields18, Earths gravitational field19,20 and electrophoretic traps21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these strategies either lack autonomy22 (external fields and traps) or only constrain along one-dimension (gravity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we introduce a new method of steering individual micromotors, using geometric boundaries, in a way that does not lead to global steering, as happens when external fields are applied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate directed motion of a special class of catalytic motorsthe spherical Janus colloid with half-coating of platinum with variable thicknesswhen moving in close proximity to solid surfaces through active quenching of their Brownian rotation, which leads to constrained in-plane swimming along the wall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such prolonged directed transport is not dependent on any external fields or potentials and continues for length scales much larger than previously reported23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that a very specific set of criteria needs to be satisfied for this steering mechanism to work, and that it is the dynamic flow fieldnot the equilibrium interaction of the particle with the wallthat constrains the motion from enhanced 3D translational diffusion in the bulk to constrained 2D-enhanced diffusion at the walls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By combining geometric constraints, we demonstrate how it is possible to reduce the number of degrees of freedom for these autonomously moving catalytic colloids.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Experimental characterization of the orientational quenching', 'Our system consists of Janus24 particles composed of platinum (Pt)-capped polystyrene (PS) colloids, which swim in solutions of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) due to its catalytic decomposition into water and oxygen14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These Janus particles swim with the PS side forward, according to a self-electrophoretic mechanism, wherein ionic currents are set-up at the Pt end, between the poles and the equator25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We aim to study these colloids stochastic trajectories when they swim near an interface, so that we can characterize its effect on their active motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The polar angle, , which probes how the polarity of a Janus particle is oriented with respect to the surface normal vector, and the corresponding in-plane orientation can be observed under fluorescence microscopy as phases of the moon27 (see Methods), Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of H2O2, Janus particles sediment in a rectangular cuvette to the bottom wall and are observed to undergo Brownian translational and rotational diffusion about a cap-down equilibrium orientation dictated by gravity, due to the weight of the Pt (Fig 1a,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But in the presence of H2O2, the Janus particles undergo enhanced diffusion in the bulk and accumulate at both the top and bottom walls, according to the competition between gravitaxis19 and sedimentation (Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, once close to the wall, for sufficiently high H2O2 concentrations, the swimmers maintain an orientation such that the half-moon shape is persistently visible (Fig 1a,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the out-of-plane rotational diffusion is quenched so that the polar angle (defined in Fig 1d) is 90° (Fig 1b and Supplementary Movies 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Brownian rotational quenching and alignment near a planar surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Selection of frames from

undergoing unquenched Brownian rotation, we have .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In water, a linear time dependence of the MSAD is observed at short time periods (MSAD trend towards an upper limit at longer times due to the periodic boundary conditions for the polar angle, 0°180°).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as the magnitude of v increases, the MSAD becomes sub-diffusive after an initial period of linear time dependence at short timescales, and saturates at long times, to within our experimental resolution (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strength of the orientational quenching is manifestly increased as the propulsion velocity is increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Steering the active colloid', 'To further probe the role of geometry on the orientational quenching, we examine swimming of Janus particles near two orthogonal surfaces (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe that a particle initially exhibiting 2D-enhanced diffusion at the surface (Fig 2c) undergoes persistent linear motion when it reaches the vertical edge of the cuvette.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2d,e shows examples of active colloids following curved and straight sections of the boundary for appreciable distances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inset

(and Supplementary Movie 4) verifies that the colloid equator is aligned close to 90° as seen above for a single boundary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, over many repeated experiments we observed that all the colloids investigated (which were of different sizes) were directed by the edge of the cuvette for length scales up to several centimetres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colloidal motion continued around the entire macroscopic cuvette edge, only occasionally stopped by small blemishes (standard laboratory glassware that had not been precision engineered was used) or by encountering other stuck colloids, resulting in pile-ups of aligned colloids, Fig 2e right hand inset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the build-up of colloids following the edge, sometimes in different directions, collisions between moving colloids were also observed (Supplementary Movie 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collisions result in stable agglomerates, which continued to move along the boundary in a direction that qualitatively appeared to be determined by the relative propulsive velocities of the colliding components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Particles moving along geometric boundaries, at speeds of up to 10 m s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Here we show that geometric constraints can help steer our Janus particles, by lowering the effective dimensionality of the space on their trajectories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One surface constrains the motion in 2D, and two perpendicular surfaces constrain it to 1D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be further exploited to create more elaborate constraints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, we expect a corner with three perpendicular surfaces to act as a trap and fully constrain the motion of our active colloids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The ability to steer Janus motor particles uni-directionally along complicated trajectories by simply following an edge or groove opens the door for many transport and separation tasks such as directed cargo delivery, motility-based sorting and flow-free microfluidics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Feature-directed steering combined with single-particle42 and collective many-body43 chemotactic response could provide an ideal toolkit for designing novel strategies to be employed in oil or mineral exploration tasks44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also as evident from Fig 2e this is a useful method for reversible bottom-up assembly of active colloids and gives us a unique advantage in controlling the orientation of the assembled active Janus particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One further possibility opened up by understanding the mechanism is that in addition to geometric railroad tracks, we could take advantage of chemical patterning of the surface to achieve a higher degree of control when we guide particles along pre-determined paths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a final comment, nature frequently produces motion at micron scales using moving parts to displace fluids, and in these systems hydrodynamic interactions between moving cellular structures and interfaces also leads to confinement at interfaces28,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we have shown that orientation confinement for phoretic synthetic active colloids with no moving parts can result in phenomenologically equivalent behaviour.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
