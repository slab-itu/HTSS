Quantum test of the equivalence principle for atoms in coherent superposition of internal energy states  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The Einstein equivalence principle (EEP) has a central role in the understanding of gravity and spacetime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In its weak form, or weak equivalence principle (WEP), it directly implies equivalence between inertial and gravitational mass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Verifying this principle in a regime where the relevant properties of the test body must be described by quantum theory has profound implications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report on a novel WEP test for atoms: a Bragg atom interferometer in a gravity gradiometer configuration compares the free fall of rubidium atoms prepared in two hyperfine states and in their coherent superposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of the superposition state allows testing genuine quantum aspects of EEP with no classical analogue, which have remained completely unexplored so far.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we measure the Eötvös ratio of atoms in two hyperfine levels with relative uncertainty in the low 109, improving previous results by almost two orders of magnitude.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Several experiments have been performed so far in the attempt to detect weak equivalence principle (WEP) violations and unveil new physics beyond general relativity and the standard model1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They compare the free-fall accelerations aA and aB of different test bodies, A and B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative differential acceleration AB provides the Eötvös ratio, which is a measure of the WEP violation:', '', 'where mi and mg denote the inertial and gravitational mass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most stringent bounds on  are today provided by torsion balance tests2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They measure the differential acceleration of macroscopic objects of different composition to better than 2 × 1013.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar accuracy levels are provided by laser ranging experiments tracking the orbital motion of the Moon3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In space, the MICROSCOPE mission4 is currently using a differential accelerometer to compare the free fall of a Ti versus Pt:Rh test body aiming at 1 × 1015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rapid development of atom interferometry5 is now providing instruments for testing WEP at the atomic level, based on different schemes of preparation, control and measurement of the probe masses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the first atom interferometry test by Fray et al.6, several experiments have recently compared the free fall of different atoms: 85Rb versus 87Rb7,8 and 39K versus 87Rb9, the bosonic 88Sr versus the fermionic 87Sr10 and atoms in different spin orientations10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The accuracy of these measurements, now in the 107 to 108 range, is expected to improve by several orders of magnitude in the near future owing to the rapid progress of atom-optical elements based on multiphoton momentum transfer12,13 and of large-scale facilities providing a few seconds of free fall during the interferometer sequence14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments testing the free fall of antihydrogen are in progress16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, STE-QUEST is proposing a WEP test to 1 × 1015 using a differential atom interferometer in space18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond distinguishing general relativity from other gravitational theories, experimental tests of Einstein equivalence principle (EEP) are of high interest as its violations are a common low-energy prediction of various quantum gravity frameworks, despite their disparate motivations and mathematical formalisms19,20,21,22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The EEP requires equivalence of the total rest massenergy of a body, the massenergy that constitutes its inertia, and the massenergy that constitutes its weight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In classical physics, for testing EEP it suffices to compare the values of the massenergies that are treated as classical variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In quantum mechanics, internal energy is given by a Hamiltonian operator describing the dynamics of internal degrees of freedom that contributes to the total mass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that a general state of the internal energy can involve superpositions of states with different internal energy eigenvalues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, one has to introduce a quantum formulation of EEP that states equivalence between the rest, inertial and gravitational massenergy quantum operators25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far performed experimental tests of EEP are only sensitive to the diagonal elements of the massenergy operators and hence they can be characterized as tests of the classical EEP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To probe the validity of the quantum EEP one needs to additionally test equivalence between the off-diagonal elements of the operators, which necessarily involves superpositions of states with different energies27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the following, we present the results of our test of the quantum WEP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An atom interferometer compares the free-fall acceleration of rubidium atoms prepared in the two hyperfine levels of the internal energy ground state and in their coherent superposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on first principles, we introduce a quantum formulation of EEP to interpret the results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within this framework, our measurements provide constraints on the off-diagonal elements of the massenergy operators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, we significantly improve current limits of WEP tests performed on rubidium atoms prepared in different eigenstates of the internal energy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
