Impact of simultaneous exposure to arboviruses on infection and transmission by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The recent emergence of both chikungunya and Zika viruses in the Americas has significantly expanded their distribution and has thus increased the possibility that individuals may become infected by more than one Aedes aegypti-borne virus at a time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent clinical data support an increase in the frequency of coinfection in human patients, raising the likelihood that mosquitoes could be exposed to multiple arboviruses during one feeding episode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The impact of coinfection on the ability of relevant vector species to transmit any of these viruses (that is, their vector competence) has not been determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we here expose Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti mosquitoes to chikungunya, dengue-2 or Zika viruses, both individually and as double and triple infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that these mosquitoes can be infected with and can transmit all combinations of these viruses simultaneously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, infection, dissemination and transmission rates in mosquitoes are only mildly affected by coinfection.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Chikungunya (CHIKV; genus Alphavirus), dengue (DENV; genus Flavivirus) and Zika (ZIKV; genus Flavivirus) viruses are mainly transmitted to humans by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, their geographic distributions largely overlap (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As these agents continue to emerge into new regions1,2,3, the likelihood of coinfection by multiple Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti-borne viruses may be increasing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the frequency of coinfection in nature and its clinical and epidemiologic implications are poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first report of CHIKV and DENV-2 coinfection occurred in 1967 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, coinfections have been reported during various CHIKV/DENV outbreaks, as well as during the recent outbreak of ZIKV in the Americas5,6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A relatively high abundance of CHIKV/DENV-coinfected patients (226.3%) was found in a number of studies, including outbreaks in Madagascar10, Gabon11 and Saint Martin12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in a 2016 clinical study in Nicaragua, 27% of all arbovirus-infected patients were viremic for multiple agents, including all possible combinations of CHIKV, DENV and ZIKV5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these studies suggest that coinfections may be fairly common in endemic and epidemic regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

literature43,44,45,46,47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other countries are also at risk and may have had unreported cases.Full size image', 'Coinfected, viremic patients can expose mosquitoes to multiple viruses at the same time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti mosquitoes to be coinfected and co-transmit arboviruses could have important implications for the epidemiology and evolution of these viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our current understanding of coinfection and co-transmission by Aedes mosquitoes is limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, during an outbreak of CHIKV and DENV-2 in Gabon in 2010, a CHIKV/DENV-2 coinfected Aedes albopictus mosquito was collected around houses of coinfected patients11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One laboratory study suggested that Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti may be refractory to CHIKV/DENV coinfection13, but two others have reported the ability of Aedes mosquitoes to be CHIKV/DENV coinfected and to expectorate both viruses in their saliva14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to a relatively small sample size it was not possible to determine what effect coinfection may have on vector competence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not clear whether coinfection with multiple viruses could result in interspecific competition and interference during various stages of infection, or whether infection with one virus could enhance transmission of another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are several molecular mechanisms supporting the notion that coinfection may influence vector competence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, mosquito antiviral responses such as RNA interference (RNAi), among others16,17, could be activated or suppressed by one of the coinfecting viruses and could thereby indirectly affect replication of another virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanisms for RNAi suppression in flaviviruses include subgenomic flavivirus RNA18,19 and an RNAi suppressor function of NS4B (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, flavivirus NS1 has recently been shown to be important for initial midgut infection by suppression of immune-related gene expression21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, NS1 may not only enhance flavivirus infection but it may also enhance midgut infection of a heterologous virus such as CHIKV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, CHIKV replicates and disseminates faster than the two flaviviruses22,23,24,25 and may thus directly outcompete DENV and ZIKV in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, exposing mosquitoes to two closely related flaviviruses, DENV and ZIKV, could directly impact virus infection, dissemination and transmission through superinfection exclusion26,27,28 or a similar mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus hypothesized that infection of mosquitoes with multiple arboviruses would alter the vector competence for at least one of them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Accordingly, we sought to determine whether Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti mosquitoes are capable of transmitting CHIKV, DENV-2 and ZIKV simultaneously as combinations of two or all three viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also sought to quantify how exposure to more than one arbovirus may affect vector competence for the individual viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, mosquitoes were exposed to CHIKV, DENV-2 and ZIKV individually, in pairs, and in a triple-infected bloodmeal, and vector competence and virus replication was assessed after 3, 7 and 14 days incubation in mosquitoes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that coinfection and co-transmission of all virus pairs by Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti was possible and occurred frequently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After triple exposure to CHIKV/DENV-2/ZIKV, nearly all mosquitoes became infected by all three viruses, and some of these mosquitoes secreted infectious CHIKV, DENV-2 and ZIKV with their saliva.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our results indicate that Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti are capable of co-transmitting all virus pairs as well as the three viruses together, and that coinfection minimally impacts vector competence.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Recent field and clinical data have indicated that in nature, human beings and mosquitoes may be infected by multiple arboviruses more frequently than has been previously appreciated6,7,8,9,29,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, the extent to which coinfecting viruses interfere or synergize with one another in vivo is poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we sought to assess coinfection of Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti mosquitoes with more than one arbovirus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used an Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti colony of Mexican origin and virus isolates from the Americas to mimic the current outbreak in the Americas; however, vector competence for different arboviruses in various Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti populations varies, for example by geographic region, and our study may not be representative of some other mosquito/virus combinations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti (Poza Rica) mosquitoes exposed to more than one arbovirus become coinfected frequently, even at relatively low titres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, exposure to multiple viruses tended not to affect mosquito susceptibility: mosquito midgut infection rates for each virus were similar whether the virus was delivered alone or in combination with another arbovirus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reason for this is likely multifactorial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, it may be that CHIKV, DENV-2 and ZIKV target different cells (or subcellular compartments) within the mosquito midgut.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively (or possibly in addition), it may be that only a small number of cells are initially infected in the midgut35, rendering enhancement and/or superinfection exclusion during coinfection largely irrelevant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it remains unclear whether superinfection exclusion even occurs between these viruses since the literature is somewhat contradictory26,27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, our results allow us to conclude that in most cases arbovirus infection of mosquito midguts is not altered by the presence of coinfecting arboviruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we observed one case where co-exposure appeared to minimally impact infection of mosquito midguts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CHIKV/ZIKV co-exposure resulted in decreased ZIKV infection in mosquitoes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the reduction was statistically significant, it was not dramatic (11.3%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanisms that produced this small effect are unclear at present, but may be related to direct competition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these data suggest that there is likely little interaction between multiple arboviruses during the establishment of infection in Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Following infection of mosquito midguts, arboviruses must disseminate from the midgut and ultimately infect salivary glands and be released into mosquito salivary secretions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modulated immune responses or direct virus competition for resources may suppress or enhance virus replication and dissemination during coinfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we found that dissemination and transmission rates were similar in single and coinfected mosquitoes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only CHIKV/DENV-2 coinfection resulted in any changes in dissemination and transmission dynamics, and these changes were small.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While CHIKV co-exposure significantly reduced DENV-2 dissemination at 7 d.p.i., transmission rates were not significantly reduced and no difference was observed at 14 d.p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, DENV-2 coinfection significantly reduced CHIKV transmission at 14 d.p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  by 27%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, this was the biggest effect that coinfection had on vector competence for any of the viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet taken altogether, these findings indicate how little coinfection affects vector competence and that, for the most part, there appear to be sufficient resources in the mosquito for multiple viruses to replicate systemically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, when we used single transmission proportions to predict how likely co-transmission is, we found that the proportion of mosquitoes that were co-transmitting was either close to the predicted proportion or in some cases higher.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase was probably related to an overlap in high/low vector competence in individual mosquitoes for these viruses; for example, a mosquito more competent for DENV-2 may also be more competent for ZIKV resulting in co-transmission proportions higher than random probability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to the co-transmission numbers, viral GE expectorated with saliva were not significantly different in co-exposed or co-transmitting mosquitoes compared to single infections, suggesting that the transmission potential of single versus dual transmitting mosquitoes is comparable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selected saliva samples were also infectious for more than one virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While we were not able to detect infectious virus in all PCR-positive saliva samples, this was not unexpected due to different sensitivities of various assays and differences in specimen content and handling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, our results clearly establish that Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti mosquitoes have the capability to transmit more than one virus during a single feeding episode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, triple infection with and transmission of CHIKV, DENV-2 and ZIKV was confirmed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Triple infection rates were high and co-transmission rates were comparable to single transmission rates of DENV-2 and ZIKV, but lower for CHIKV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The impact of our observed increase in CHIKV and ZIKV GE in triple positive saliva on transmission to naïve hosts is currently unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While exposure to the three viruses simultaneously is likely to be an extremely rare occurrence, these results support the overall conclusion from much of the work reported here, that multiple arboviruses can be transmitted by a single mosquito during a single feeding episode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The implications of co-exposure and co-transmission on the epidemiology, pathogenesis and evolution of these agents remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to limited clinical information and, most likely, underdiagnosis of coinfections, the extent of coinfections in human beings and mosquitoes under natural conditions is poorly defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, future work will be aimed at understanding the effect of coinfection on pathogenesis in mammals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, coinfection may also play an important role in virus evolution, both in the mammalian host and mosquito vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond the possibility that increased or generally altered immune pressures may drive virus evolution during coinfection, it is unclear whether different viruses may replicate within the same cells allowing for recombination events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus need to improve our understanding of where in the mosquito these viruses replicate during coinfection compared to single infection and how coinfection affects virus evolution in the mosquito and the mammalian host.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another important question is how coinfection and co-transmission rates may differ when mosquitoes are exposed to multiple viruses at different stages of their adult lifein the present study we expose mosquitoes to virus with their first bloodmeal, but we do not know how mosquito age or previous bloodmeals may affect vector competence during coinfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, sequential exposure to multiple viruses will be another aim of future studies and may have a more pronounced effect on vector competence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if coinfection and co-transmission after sequential exposure is also common, it could further increase the number of co-transmitting mosquitoes and the risk of coinfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, this study provides clear evidence that CHIKV, DENV-2 and ZIKV may be co-transmitted by mosquitoes following simultaneous exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The impact of coinfection on the biology of the agents and human health are high priorities for future work.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
