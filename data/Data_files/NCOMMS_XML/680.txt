Sensing of HSV-1 by the cGASSTING pathway in microglia orchestrates antiviral defence in the CNS  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is the most common form of acute viral encephalitis in industrialized countries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Type I interferon (IFN) is important for control of herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) in the central nervous system (CNS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that microglia are the main source of HSV-induced type I IFN expression in CNS cells and these cytokines are induced in a cGASSTING-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, mice defective in cGAS or STING are highly susceptible to acute HSE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although STING is redundant for cell-autonomous antiviral resistance in astrocytes and neurons, viral replication is strongly increased in neurons in STING-deficient mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, HSV-infected microglia confer STING-dependent antiviral activities in neurons and prime type I IFN production in astrocytes through the TLR3 pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, sensing of HSV-1 infection in the CNS by microglia through the cGASSTING pathway orchestrates an antiviral program that includes type I IFNs and immune-priming of other cell types.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Viral infections in the central nervous system (CNS) can result in devastating diseases such as encephalitis, which can cause irreversible damage to the CNS and fatality1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 is a neurotropic virus and is a major cause of CNS infections, including herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE)1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The innate immune response to infection is essential for host control of HSV2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The innate immune system utilizes pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect microbial molecules and stimulate host defense, in which type I interferon (IFN) have a particularly important role in viral infection3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viruses induce type I IFN expression mainly through nucleic acids and (RNA-/DNA-sensing) PRRs, as well as downstream type I IFN-inducing signalling pathways, which are well described4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Genetic studies in humans have led to the identification of defects in the RNA-sensing TLR3 pathway in patients with HSE6,7,8,9,10, and this finding has been confirmed in a mouse model for HSV-2 myelitis, in which astrocytes sense the virus in a TLR3-dependent manner11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, another study using induced pluripotent stem cells derived from patient dermal fibroblasts suggested that neurons and oligodendrocytes control HSV-1 replication in a TLR3-dependent manner in vitro12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the cell-type-specific action of the TLR3 pathway is context dependent and it remains unresolved whether a priming step is needed and also whether TLR3 acts in concert with other innate pathways to exert antiviral activity in the CNS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'HSV-1 carries its genetic information in the form of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and advances in the basic understanding of innate immune sensing have revealed that cytosolic dsDNA is a potent inducer of innate immune responses13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several DNA sensors have been identified, including cyclic GMPAMP synthase (cGAS)14, and all type I IFN-inducing cytoplasmic DNA sensors signal through the adaptor protein stimulator of type I IFN genes (STING)13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reported that HSV-1 entry into macrophages leads to abundant accumulation of viral DNA in the cytoplasm, which is where the DNA is sensed to induce type I IFN expression15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microglia are resident macrophages of the CNS and have important roles in both protective and pathological immune responses in the CNS16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microglia express a wide panel of PRRs and are importance for defense against HSV-1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the well-documented role for DNA sensing in recognition of several pathogens, published data on the mechanisms of action of this pathway in vivo are limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, it is unknown which cell types utilize the STING-dependent DNA-sensing pathway to recognize HSV-1 in vivo and how this may influence the intercellular communication network in the tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this work, we demonstrate that microglia are the main producers of type I IFN after HSV-1 infection and this cytokine production is STING dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cGAS deficiency and STING deficiency renders mice susceptible to HSE after peripheral infection in the eye, and correlates with impaired type I IFN expression in the CNS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro infection of neurons and glia cells reveals that microglia, but not neurons or astrocytes, exhibit increased viral replication in the absence of STING.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, in vivo STING deficiency increases HSV-1 replication in microglia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, HSV-1-infected microglia transfer antiviral activity to neurons in a STING-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, treatment of astrocytes with type I IFN or supernatants from infected wild type (WT), but not STING deficient, microglia induces TLR3 expression by astrocytes, thus enabling a response through these pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data suggest that innate sensing of HSV-1 DNA in the brain by microglia induces a paracrine antiviral type I IFN response and also enables innate sensing pathways in other cell types, including the TLR3 pathway known to be essential for protection against HSE in humans.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mice deficient in cGAS or STING are susceptible to HSE', 'To mimic the natural route of HSV-1 entry into the CNS through retrograde transport we used a model for ocular HSV-1 infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this study, we used cGAS/ and Goldenticket (gt) mice, which harbour a single nucleotide variant (T596A) of STING that functions as a null allele18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By western blotting, we demonstrated the lack of STING expression in the Gt mice, including in the CNS (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When WT, cGAS/ and Stinggt/gt mice were challenged with HSV-1 (strains Mckrae or KOS), we observed severe disease development in mice with a defective cGASSTING pathway, as shown by disease scores reflecting infection in both the eye (Fig 1a; Supplementary Fig 2a,c) and in the CNS (Fig 1b,c, Supplementary Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mice lacking STING also lost weight rapidly after infection with the Mckrae strain (Supplementary Fig 2e), and succumbed to infection on day 6 post infection whereas the WT mice survived through the 8 days of the experiment (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous reports have demonstrated elevated HSV-1 load in the cornea of STING-deficient mice after HSV-1 infection19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When examining viral titres at different locations from the site of inoculation to the CNS (Fig 1e), we were able to detect HSV-1 (Mckrae) in all compartments and consistently found higher viral load in samples from the cGAS- and STING-deficient mice (Fig 1fi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further analysis of the early events in HSV-1 replication in neuronal tissue showed that the levels of HSV-1 in trigeminal ganglia was comparable between WT and STINGgt/gt mice at day 2 post infection, after which we observed significantly elevated viral load in trigeminal ganglia from STING-deficient mice (Supplementary Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While HSV-1 was detectable in the brain stem from day 3 after infection in WT mice, the virus reached the brain stem already on day 2 in STING-deficient mice, and was detected in higher levels than in WT mice from the time of entry into the brain (Supplementary Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection with the HSV-1 KOS strain also led to elevated viral load in the brain stem in the STING-deficient mice, but this strain was unable to spread further in the brains of STING-deficient mice, similar to the WT mice (Supplementary Fig 2h,i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Mice deficient in cGAS or STING are susceptible to HSE and exhibit impaired antiviral responses.Mice were infected in the cornea with 1 × 106 PFU per eye of HSV-1 (strain Mckrae).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On subsequent days, animals were scored for (a) eye swelling, (b) hydrocephalus, and (c) symptoms related to neurological disease and (d) survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Route of virus spread from the eye to the CNS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (fi) Eye washes, trigeminal ganglia, brain stem and brains were isolated on the indicated time points post infection, and viral load was quantified using plaque assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n=9 mice per group (ai).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (j) Tissue section from the brain stem of WT and Stinggt/gt mice infected for 6 days with HSV-1 were stained with anti-HSV-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n=5-6 mice per group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The original magnifications are 2.5 × and 20 × for the zoomed in images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (kl) The number of HSV-1-positive cells in six tissue sections from the medulla and pons were quantified, and presented as means ± s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n=39 per group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (mo) Organotypic brain slices from WT and Stinggt/gt mice were cultured and infected with 5 × 103 PFU of HSV-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The viral load in (n) the culture medium on day 2 and (o) in homogenized brain slices on 6 days post infection was determined by plaque assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are shown as mean values ± s.e.m., n=68 wells with three brain slices in each.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Symbols for P-values used in the figures: *0.01 less_than P less_than 0.05;

Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, in the brains from STING-deficient mice, the virus was not restricted to the area around the medulla, but was widely disseminated to the midbrain, hypothalamus, and the preoptic area (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Since we observed higher viral load in cGAS- and STING-deficient mice already in the eye, and also observed accelerated viral entry in the brain tissue, it remained possible that the elevated viral load in the CNS was due to a requirement of the cGASSTING pathway in the periphery and not within the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we isolated and cultured brain slices from newborn WT and STING-deficient mice, and infected with HSV-1 (Fig 1mo).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The homogenized slices, as well as supernatants isolated from cultures of STING-deficient brains contained significantly more virus than that of WT brain slices, thus suggesting that the brain per se relies on STING to mount a defense against HSV-1 infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Elevated viral load in STING-deficient microglia and neurons', 'To examine the role for STING in cell-autonomous control of HSV-1 replication, we isolated neuronal cells from newborn mice and differentiated cells in vitro into neurons, astrocytes and microglia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The purity of the specific cell types was evaluated to be in the range 8997% depending on the cell type (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the literature on HSV-1 replication in human, in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuronal cells12, HSV-1 replicated very well in WT neurons and astrocytes, but only weakly in microglia (Fig 2ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In neurons and astrocytes, STING deficiency did not lead to elevated viral growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In microglia, STING deficiency was associated with the elevated virus yield (Fig 2c), although the levels of virus were 34 logs lower than in neurons and astrocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that STING is involved in control of HSV-1 replication in microglia, whereas astrocytes and neurons utilize antiviral mechanisms independent of STING in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: STING is essential for restriction of HSV-1 in microglia in vitro and for antiviral control in neurons in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ac) Astrocytes, neurons and microglia from WT and Stinggt/gt mice were cultured in vitro and infected with HSV-1 (MOI 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supernatants were collected 48 h later and virus was quantified by plaque assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are presented as means ± s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  *0.01 less_than P less_than 0.05;

STING-deficient mice, tissue sections from brain stems were stained with antibodies against HSV-1 and cell-type-specific markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, we observed a larger proportion of HSV-1-positive cells in the STING-deficient mice as compared with WT mice (Fig 2dg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The staining for HSV-1 antigens exhibited a preferential nuclear pattern consistent with HSV-1 replication occurring in the nucleus (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we did not observe a higher number of astrocytes containing viral antigen in the brains from STING-deficient mice as compared with WT mice (Fig 2d,e), consistent with the findings in vitro (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, when examining viral antigens in neurons in situ, we observed many more infected Neuronal Nuclei (NeuN)-positive cells in STING-deficient versus WT mice (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of the immunohistochemistry data showed that 12.4±2.6% of S100+ WT cells (astrocytes) were HSV-1+, while 14.9±3.2% of the STING-deficient astrocytes were HSV-1+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the neurons, 9.9±7.7% of WT NeuN+ cells were positive for HSV-1, while 33.7±1.5% of the STING-deficient NeuN+ cells were HSV-1+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With respect to microglia, the data showed a pronounced elevation in the level of viral antigen in cells from STING-deficient mice as compared with WT mice (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the viral antigen in microglia mainly localized to the cytoplasm and not the nucleus, suggesting uptake of viral antigen rather than the productive replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are consistent with the in vitro data showing only modest HSV-1 replication in microglia cells, although this was significantly elevated in the absence of STING (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Altogether, the elevated viral load in STING-deficient neurons in vivo but not in vitro suggests the existence of a STING-dependent intercellular network, which transfers antiviral signals to neurons in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'STING-dependent type I IFN production by microglia', 'The data presented above suggest that microglia rely on STING to activate antiviral defense, and also that there is STING-dependent transfer of antiviral signals through the tissue in the CNS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Type I IFNs are pivotal for control of HSV-1 replication in the CNS, and we therefore wanted to evaluate the expression and function of this class of cytokines in the brain during HSV-1 infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brain stem homogenates from infected mice, significantly reduced induction of IFN- gene expression was observed after HSV-1 infection in mice lacking STING (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This led to the reduced expression of the IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) viperin in the infected tissue in STING-deficient mice (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although viperin has been shown not to have antiviral activity against WT HSV-1 in vitro21, we used it as a marker of ISG expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

isolated supernatants from neurons, astrocytes and microglia infected with HSV-1 and measured type I IFN bioactivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While neurons failed to induce type I IFN in response to HSV-1 infection, astrocytes mounted a clear but modest IFN-/ production (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to this, microglia mounted response to HSV-1 infection with production of high levels of type I IFN, and this was entirely dependent on STING and cGAS (Fig 3c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar data were obtained when we examined IFN- expression at the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in the three cell types with both McKrae strain and with the KOS strain (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given the finding that microglia responded to HSV-1 infection with the most potent type I IFN response in a STING-dependent manner, we wanted to evaluate whether the cGASSTING pathway was more active in this cell type than in astrocytes and neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this, we first determined the expression levels of cGAS and STING in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, and observed that the ability of the cell types tested to produce type I IFN correlated with the expression of cGAS and STING (Fig 3f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with this, and mirroring what was observed after HSV-1 infection, the relative stimulation of type I IFN production by synthetic DNA in the three cell types was neurons less_than astrocytes less_than microglia (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On DNA stimulation, STING translocates to vesicular structures22, and accumulation of perinuclear STING foci is often used as a measure of activation of the STING pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further examine whether the cGASSTING pathway is activated more potently in microglia than astrocytes, we mixed these two cell types, infected with HSV-1, and used formation of STING foci as readout.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with the stronger expression of type I IFNs by microglia cells, we observed formation of STING foci in a significantly higher proportion of the microglia (glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)) as compared with the astrocytes (GFAP+; Fig 3h,i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'HSV-1 can enter most cell types, but only replicates efficiently in a subset of cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data shown in Fig 2a,c demonstrate that among the identified type I IFN-producing cells, HSV-1 replicates efficiently in neurons and astrocytes but less so in microglia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Productive viral replication may impair various cellular functions, including production and responsiveness to type I IFN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we wanted to evaluate whether the establishment of productive replication affected the ability of the different cell types to express IFN-.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, we infected cells with a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) of HSV-1 virus expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) under the control of a constitutive promoter, and sorted GFP+ and GFP cells for further analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Supplementary Fig 6a, expression of GFP correlated with the expression of the late viral protein gB, thus validating that GFP expression was a reasonable measure for productive HSV-1 replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the astrocytes, we found that GFP cells were stimulated to express IFN-, whereas the productively infected astrocytes were unable to produce IFN- (Fig 3j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, microglia produced IFN- in response to HSV-1 infection irrespective of whether the virus had established productive infection or not (Fig 3j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When examining expression of ISGs, we found that astrocytes produced this class of genes even when productively infected (Fig 3k; Supplementary Fig 6b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was seen over a range of infectious doses (Fig 3j,k; Supplementary Fig 6d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that although the productive viral replication impaires production of IFN- in astrocytes, the ability to respond to type I IFNs is retained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Thus, microglia are the main source of type I IFN, during HSV-1 infection of CNS cells and evokes this response in a STING-dependent manner, which is not affected by the establishment of productive infection by the virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'STING-independent recruitment of microglia to infection foci', 'Next, we were interested in evaluating the STING-dependent nature of the accumulation of microglia and expression of type I IFN-stimulated genes in the foci of infection in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we first isolated RNA from the brain stems of WT and STING-deficient mice infected for 6 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As seen in Fig 4a, brain stems of infected mice had higher levels of a microglia marker (Iba1) mRNA than uninfected mice, and this was independent of the genotype of the mice, despite significantly higher levels of viral transcripts in the brain stem of the STING-deficient mice (Fig 4b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the elevation of Iba1 mRNA levels could be caused by either induction of the gene or recruitment or division of Iba1-expressing cells, we also isolated single cells from brain stems of infected WT and STING-deficient mice to perform flow cytometric analysis for Iba1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This revealed comparable results from the two sets of mice, both in terms of cell counts and intensity of the fluorescent signal (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since Iba1 can be expressed by cell types other than microglia, such as bone-marrow-derived macrophages, we determined the cell population expressing CD11b+CD45lo-Medium to define microglia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis showed comparable number of CD11b+CD45lo-Medium in the brain stem of HSV-1-infected WT and STING-deficient mice (Fig 4e; Supplementary Fig 7a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, these data demonstrate that  less_than 2% of the gated single cells in the infected brain stem are CD11b+CD45high as compared with  greater than 15% being CD11b+CD45lo-Medium (Supplementary Fig 7b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that microglia, rather than recruited macrophages, are accumulating in infected areas at the time point examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we stained brain stem tissue sections from untreated and HSV-1-infected mice with anti-Iba1 and analysed microscopically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this approach, we easily observed microglia in the infected areas with no noticeable difference between the genotypes (Fig 4g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, accumulation of microglia in areas of HSV-1 infection in the brain occurs

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A large proportion of the human population is infected with HSV-1, but only a small minority experience HSE23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In recent years, it has emerged that the innate immune system, including the TLR3-type I IFN axis is important for protection against HSV-1 infection in the CNS and prevention of HSE6,7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, we demonstrate that a defective cGASSTING pathway renders mice highly susceptible to HSE-related disease after infection at an epithelial surface in the periphery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we show that among CNS cells, particularly microglia utilize the cGASSTING pathway to orchestrate the antiviral response through at least two mechanisms acting in a paracrine manner: antiviral action of type I IFN, and priming of innate immune sensing pathways, including the TLR3 pathway (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous studies in murine models have suggested that TLR2 deficiency protects against the pathological inflammatory response in the brain after intracranial HSV-1 infection24, whereas lack of TLR9 did not have an impact on the viral replication in the brain after ocular or intracranial infection25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon- (TRIF)-deficient mice exhibited markedly increased susceptibility to HSE-related disease and impaired viral control in the brain after intranasal HSV-1 infection, whereas mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS)-deficient mice had a modest but significant phenotype in the same model27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been reported that cGAS and STING-deficient mice exhibit impaired defense against HSV-1 in the CNS after infection through the intravenous route22,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this model, the entry of the virus into the CNS is not well understood, and includes the hematogenous route29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the natural route of entry for HSV-1 into the CNS is via sensory neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, together with the previous report on HSV-1 infection in the CNS after intranasal infection of TRIF-deficient mice27, and the extensive literature on defects in the TLR3 pathways in HSE patients6,7,8,9,10, the present study corroborates the cGASSTING and the TLR3TRIF pathways as the main innate sensing pathways conferring control of HSV-1 infection in the CNS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we observed very similar phenotypes for cGAS- and STING-deficient mice, it should be mentioned that we cannot formally exclude that STING also has cGAS-independent functions in defense against HSV-1 in the CNS30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Parallel to our work, David Leib and colleagues studied HSV-1 infection in STING-deficient mice20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While Parker et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  used the KOS and 17 strains for their ocular infection experiments, we mainly used the McKrae strain, since it is more neuro-invasive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of our results with the McKrae strain were repeated with the KOS strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that more STING-deficient than WT mice succumbed after ocular infection with the McKrae strain, and Parker et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  found the same for the 17 strain20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both studies show increased viral load in the eyes and trigeminal ganglia of STING-deficient mice after ocular infection with the KOS strain, and also that the KOS strain does not replicate to high titres in the brain even in the absence of STING20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome this, Parker et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injected virus directly into the brain and found lower levels of IFN in the brains of infected Sting/ mice, in agreement with our data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, interestingly, expression of inflammatory cytokines was elevated in corneas of STING-deficient mice20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be induced by other PRRs such as TLRs, which have been reported to be involved in sensing of HSV-1 in the cornea32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, these two studies together establish an essential role of STING in control of HSV-1 after corneal infection, and our choice of the McKrae strain has allowed us focus more on the infection in the CNS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A central finding of the present study is that microglia represent the main source of type I IFN during HSV-1 infection and utilizes the cGASSTING pathway to induce this response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the cGASSTING pathway is important for cell-autonomous control of the viral replication in microglia but not in astrocytes and neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that in the CNS, the cGASSTING pathway is important mainly for the antiviral action of microglia, which in turn disseminate antiviral activities to other cell types of the CNS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The importance of microglia in HSV-1-induced type I IFN production is consistent with work by others17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, we identified two mechanisms through which HSV-infected microglia can transfer antiviral activities to other cell types in a STING-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, microglia-derived type I IFN leads to significant inhibition of HSV-1 replication in the highly permissive neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of type I IFN to inhibit HSV replication in neurons is in agreement with earlier work by us and others11,33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work has demonstrated lower steady state and type I IFN-induced levels of several ISGs associated with cell death in neurons as compared with mitotic cells33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work should resolve whether type I IFN activates a specialized antiviral program in neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we found that type I IFN and supernatants from HSV-infected microglia upregulated TLR3 expression in astrocytes, and this cell type accordingly did acquire elevated responsiveness through the respective pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the well-described role of the TLR3TRIF pathway in control of HSV-1 in the CNS in humans and mice6,7,27, these data suggest that a defective cGASSTING pathway also indirectly hampers the ability to evoke full antiviral activity through the TLR3TRIF pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concept of cross-talk between the type I IFN-inducing pathways in the CNS during HSV-1 infection is further supported by the previous finding that TRIF-deficient mice, along with higher viral load, have significantly elevated IFN- expression in the brain27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of the data in the present work, we suggest that the elevated type I IFN- expression in TRIF-deficient mice is stimulated through the cGASSTING pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is tempting to speculate that the detection of HSV-1 through multiple type I IFN-inducing pathways that interact in a manner involving multiple cell types enables the organism to achieve optimal antiviral activity, with the lowest possible amounts of type I IFN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a scenario would render the host antiviral response less sensitive to viral evasion and targeting of specific cell types or antiviral pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Collectively, this work demonstrates that the STING-dependent DNA-sensing system represents a key pathway to control HSV-1 replication in the CNS, and that this is highly dependent on viral DNA recognition in microglia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, by possession of strong responsiveness through the cGASSTING pathway, microglia act upstream in an intercellular network in the CNS during HSV-1 infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through this network, microglia disseminate antiviral activities through the tissue and also primes select innate pathways in other cell types in the CNS, which together orchestrate the antiviral response.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
