Towards high-resolution laser ionization spectroscopy of the heaviest elements in supersonic gas jet expansion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Resonant laser ionization and spectroscopy are widely used techniques at radioactive ion beam facilities to produce pure beams of exotic nuclei and measure the shape, size, spin and electromagnetic multipole moments of these nuclei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in such measurements it is difficult to combine a high efficiency with a high spectral resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate the on-line application of atomic laser ionization spectroscopy in a supersonic gas jet, a technique suited for high-precision studies of the ground- and isomeric-state properties of nuclei located at the extremes of stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The technique is characterized in a measurement on actinium isotopes around the N=126 neutron shell closure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A significant improvement in the spectral resolution by more than one order of magnitude is achieved in these experiments without loss in efficiency.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The heaviest elements of the periodic table have intriguing atomic and nuclear properties1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Valence-electron configurations and ionization potentials are strongly influenced by relativistic effects directly affecting the elements chemical behaviour and thus its position in the periodic table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In heavy nuclei, a competition between the short-range nuclear attraction and the long-range Coulomb repulsion determines their mere existence and properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Answering questions such as where does Mendeleevs table end and which positions in the periodic table do the heaviest elements occupy need intertwined chemical, atomic and nuclear physics studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Element Z=118 is thus far the heaviest element observed and some of its basic decay properties have been determined2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to the extremely low production rates, crucial information on nuclear excitation energies, spins and parities, electromagnetic moments and charge radii is scarce for the transactinide isotopes (Z104).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even in the actinide region (Z89) such information only exists for selected, often long-lived isotopes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Copernicium (Z=112) is the heaviest element where chemical properties have firmly been established3, whereas lawrencium (Z=103) is the heaviest element where the ionization potential is measured4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Until recently, information on atomic transitions ended at fermium (Z=100)5 but has now been extended to nobelium (Z=102), where an optical ground-state transition has been observed6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Resonant laser ionization is a well-established atomic physics technique to selectively produce radioactive ion beams and then deduce atomic properties such as ionization potentials, atomic levels, transition strengths, isomer and isotope shifts, and hypefine constants7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these atomic observables, nuclear properties such as spins, magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments, and differences in mean-square nuclear charge radii can be deduced in a nuclear-model independent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, current implementation of resonant laser ionization can be limited in the accessibility to all these nuclear observables due to a poor spectral resolutionin the GHz range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the applicability can be hampered for short-lived nuclei, even for certain elements, due to physico-chemical properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study we describe an approach that is efficient, chemically independent and applicable to short-lived isotopes (T1/2 greater than 0.1 s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This major expansion of the so-called in-gas laser ionization and spectroscopy (IGLIS) technique10,11 has been first examined offline on stable 63Cu isotopes12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have validated this technique on-line in the actinide region by performing high-resolution laser-spectroscopy studies on the isotopes 214Ac (T1/2=8.2 s) and 215Ac (T1/2=0.17 s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its projected spectral resolution for heavy elements of 100 MHz fulfils the requirement for accurate extraction of their ground-state nuclear properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, this in-gas-jet laser ionization and spectroscopy method enables the production of extremely pure ion beams, including isomeric beams, which are suitable for further studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By choosing the neutron-deficient isotopes of actinium, the first and name-giving element of the actinide group, as a case study, we addressed all challenges for high-resolution resonance ionization spectroscopy of the heavy elements as follows: limited information on the atomic levels due to the absence of stable isotopes, limited production rates due to the necessity of using heavy-ion-induced fusion reactions on thin targets, large background from stronger reaction channels and the need to slow down the energetic radioactive ion beam and transfer it into a controlled ensemble of cooled atoms in a low-density environment, to minimize Doppler and collisional broadening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Next to the characterization of the technique, we obtained nuclear spins, magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments, and differences in mean-square charge radii of neutron-deficient actinium isotopes around the N=126 shell closure by combining the spectroscopic data with atomic calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparison to large-scale nuclear shell-model calculations provides evidence for the extent of magicity in this region.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Separator On Line facility13 coupled to the CYCLONE accelerator of the Centre de Ressources du Cyclotron (Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction products were thermalized in a gas cell (see Fig 1), filled with 350 mbar purified argon and were evacuated together with the buffer gas through a de Laval (convergentdivergent) nozzle resulting in a collimated supersonic gas jet.

actinium in the low-density, low-temperature supersonic gas-jet expansion (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The photoions were then captured and transported in a radiofrequency ion guide, accelerated, mass separated and subsequently implanted into an -decay detection setup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By recording the -decay spectra as a function of the laser wavelength of the excitation step laser, spectra of the hyperfine structure (hfs) were obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: In-gas-jet laser ionization and spectroscopy setup.Short-lived actinium isotopes are produced in the fusion

experimentally measured hyperfine-splitting constants and the independently measured magnetic dipole or electric quadrupole moment of a known isotope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the only ground-state dipole- and quadrupole-moments available in the literature are, as quoted by the authors, the preliminary values =1.1(1) N and Q=1.7(2) eb for 227Ac (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17) (it is noteworthy that

when comparing our g-factor of the 215Ac ground state with the experimentally known g-factors of all -based states in the N=126 isotones24, with n representing the number of protons occupying the h9/2

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Spatial constraints and limitations of the pumping system in the present setup prevented a high-quality jet formation and, as a consequence, an optimal laser-atom overlap in space and time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These will be overcome in future experiments when dedicated IGLIS setups are in operation at new-generation radioactive beam facilities (see for example, ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table 1 compares the presently obtained in-gas-jet performance (third column) with the projected performance of the technique under optimal conditions (fourth column), which also include a new gas-cell design with better transport and extraction characteristics30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, assuming a duty cycle adapted to the supersonic expansion through a de Laval nozzle with a modest Mach number 10, tuning the background pressure for a pencil-like jet and optimizing the laser interaction zone through a multi-pass mirror system, a final spectral resolution of /1 × 107 (100 MHz FWHM) and an overall efficiency beyond 10% can be obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Combined with the fast and chemically insensitive stopping and transport using a purified noble gas, it becomes possible to measure nuclear properties such as charge radii, electric and magnetic moments, and nuclear spins of all isotopes with half-lives above 100 ms and produced at a rate of only 1 atom every 10 s.

collisional broadening and the natural linewidth (Lorentz) from temperature-associated, laser linewidth and gas-jet divergence broadening (Gauss), see Table 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the spectroscopic measurements, the energy per pulse of the first step was set around 0.8 J.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two broad-bandwidth (4 GHz) pulsed Ti:sapphire lasers were used simultaneously for the second ionization step at 425 and 435 nm with up to 180 J pulse energy (for a detailed description of the laser system see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Operated at 10 kHz pulse repetition rate, the lasers with an effective beam spot area of 4 mm illuminated the atomic jet immediately at the nozzle exit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With these ionization conditions, fixed by limitations in the present experimental setup, only a fraction (1/14) of the atoms in the jet could be irradiated, resulting in an overall efficiency of 0.40(13)% and a selectivity of 121(27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The efficiency in the in-gas-cell experiments, where in contrast all atoms are irradiated, is comparable with the in-gas-jet result.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This points to collisional de-excitation losses in the ionization process due to the high-pressure environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall in-gas-jet efficiency depends on different factors, namely stopping of the reaction products (100% in this case), transport of the atoms towards the de Laval nozzle (35% diffusion losses, 17% decay losses for the 170 ms 215Ac), the availability of actinium in its atomic ground state (losses due to non-neutralized ions ( greater than 10%) and to molecule formation) and the efficiency of the laser ionization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing the average pulse energy of the first step laser to 9 J resulted in a 1.9(2) gain in overall efficiency but the spectral resolution deteriorated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optimizing the gas-jet formation and shaping the laser beam spot area to a sheet 55 mm long and 3 mm wide would result in a 100% duty cycle12,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, an overall efficiency of  greater than 10% and a spectral resolution of 100 MHz (FWHM) can be obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data evaluation', 'For the
