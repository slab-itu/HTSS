Genome-wide RNAi screen reveals ALK1 mediates LDL uptake and transcytosis in endothelial cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In humans and animals lacking functional LDL receptor (LDLR), LDL from plasma still readily traverses the endothelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify the pathways of LDL uptake, a genome-wide RNAi screen was performed in endothelial cells and cross-referenced with GWAS-data sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that the activin-like kinase 1 (ALK1) mediates LDL uptake into endothelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ALK1 binds LDL with lower affinity than LDLR and saturates only at hypercholesterolemic concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ALK1 mediates uptake of LDL into endothelial cells via an unusual endocytic pathway that diverts the ligand from lysosomal degradation and promotes LDL transcytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The endothelium-specific genetic ablation of Alk1 in Ldlr-KO animals leads to less LDL uptake into the aortic endothelium, showing its physiological role in endothelial lipoprotein metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, identification of pathways mediating LDLR-independent uptake of LDL may provide unique opportunities to block the initiation of LDL accumulation in the vessel wall or augment hepatic LDLR-dependent clearance of LDL.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The development of atherosclerosis is triggered by the subendothelial retention of plasma-derived apoB-lipoproteins, particularly LDL and apolipoprotein-B (apoB)-containing remnants1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most effective therapy to date that reduces atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, namely lowering plasma LDL levels, works by decreasing circulating apoB containing lipoprotein levels, thereby reducing the likelihood that these particles will enter and become retained within the arterial wall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this well appreciated series of events leading to disease and effective therapies lowering plasma LDL levels, the molecular mechanisms of how LDL is transported into and across the endothelium have not been elucidated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'LDL in the blood has to enter the endothelium and cross it to reach the subendothelial area, where it is retained and accumulates over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electron microscopy studies have demonstrated that physiological levels of LDL particles can be internalized by two pathways; an LDL receptor (LDLR) dependent and LDLR independent pathways5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LDLR-mediated pathway promotes LDL degradation and is downregulated at the higher concentrations of LDL6 while the latter pathway is enhanced with hypercholesterolemic concentrations of LDL5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional studies have shown that at least 50% of the LDL that is endocytosed by the endothelium traverses the cells to reach the basolateral side via an unknown active transport mechanism7,8 and an LDLR independent initial route of LDL permeation into the artery wall has been previously described9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent paper has described that reducing ApoB containing lipoproteins in an established model of atherosclerosis rapidly reduces LDL permeation into the vessel wall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly the flux of LDL is separable from the total content of LDL in vessel wall and this improved barrier function precedes plaque regression10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the regulated entry of LDL into the vessel wall is essential for both the formation and regression of atheromas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'With this background in mind, we sought to elucidate the genes required for native LDL uptake into endothelial cells using a genome-wide RNAi approach to target over 18,000 genes followed by high content confocal imaging of fluorescent DiI-LDL uptake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary gene hits were further analysed in secondary screens to assess broad effects on endocytosis and sterol sensing permitting the identification of 34 high confidence hits, three of which are unique to the endothelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gene hits were also cross-referenced against publically available genome-wide association studies (GWAS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we characterize one of these hits in detail, ACVRL1 (also called ALK1) which fulfils the criteria for a novel low-affinity, high-capacity receptor for LDL in endothelial cells that functions during hypercholesterolemia and promotes LDL transcytosis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Genome-wide RNAi screen in endothelial cells', 'The uptake, transfer and retention of LDL particles across the endothelial layer of blood vessels is considered a primary mechanism to initiate atherogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, since the LDLR is typically occupied and downregulated when plasma lipids are elevated, we undertook a genome-wide RNAi screen to identify genes involved in native LDL uptake independent of LDLR activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the importance of genetic stability and reproducibility required for a screen of this calibre, the human endothelial cell line, EA.hy926 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11) (Fig 1a) was used and cultured under conditions where endogenous LDLR had been downregulated by excess of the ligand LDL6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the initial screen, run in triplicate over a 3 months period, cells were transfected with a Dharmacon short interfering RNA (siRNA) library containing four pooled siRNAs/gene to silence 18,119 genes in the human genome (Supplementary Data set 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transfected cells were then incubated with excess human LDL (25 g ml1) overnight to downregulate LDLR overnight, before the uptake of fluorescently labelled LDL (DiI-LDL) was examined after 60 min using a 384 well confocal microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results from the screen were fit to an expected inverse sigmoidal robust z-score distribution (Fig 1b), indicating that gene knockdown either increased or decreased DiI-LDL uptake and demonstrated a high level of reproducibility between different data sets (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As seen in Fig 1a, silencing of 887 genes showed an effect on DiI-LDL uptake with a robust z-score 2.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A manual, computer-assisted data clearance algorithm removed promiscuous genes (that typically show up in various screens), toxic genes, and artefacts by visual inspection of the confocal images from individual hits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data were mined to include cell surface molecules and novel gene products, but to exclude genes for transcription factors, obvious components of the endocytic machinery and sterol regulated genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After inspection of individual hits, a final set of 140 genes (Supplementary Data set 2) was re-screened using four individual siRNAs per gene resulting in the confirmation of 55 genes (with 2 siRNAs/gene showing 50% reduction of DiI-LDL uptake) required for DiI-LDL uptake (Fig 1d,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify pathways specific for LDL and not classical cargo molecules, a secondary screen examining the uptake of transferrin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), a marker for clathrin-mediated endocytosis was performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The silencing of 35/55 genes did not affect the uptake of transferrin (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the contribution of LDLR, in conjunction with the newly identified genes, was tested using cells stably expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against LDLR (Supplementary Fig 1) for LDLR messenger RNA and protein levels) and 34 of these genes reduced DiI-LDL uptake independent of LDLR levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, since the original screen was conducted in an endothelial line, the 34 hits identified were retested in primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and all 34 hits were re-confirmed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the 34 genes with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Fig 1g, Supplementary Fig 2 and Supplementary Table 1) showed that 19 hits cluster in metabolic/neurological pathways and 14 belong to lipid/carbohydrate metabolic pathways and only three genes were uniquely expressed in endothelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of publically available GWAS-data sets revealed an association for 14 gene hits in regard to cardiovascular traits and/or lipids (Supplementary Fig 3 and Supplementary Data set 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ACVRL1, ANGPT4 and GPR182 fulfilled all the criteria of the follow-up screen (Fig 1a and Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since ANGPT4 is not well characterized as a ligand and GPR182 is an orphan receptor, the initial follow-up focuses on ALK1 as an LDL-binding protein mediating LDL uptake and transcytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Screen to identify pathways regulation LDL uptake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Summary of the results from the RNAi screen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results from

10 ligands with high affinity12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The receptor is highly expressed in primary human endothelial cells compared primary human hepatocytes (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine how this receptor may regulate LDL uptake, in depth analysis of ALK1 was undertaken in a variety of systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of ALK1 reduced transcript levels in human endothelial cells (Fig 2a) and mouse lung endothelial cells (MLEC; Supplementary Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All four individual siRNAs against human ALK1 from the genome-wide RNAi screen were analysed for their knockdown efficiency, showing that siRNA 06 led to the strongest inhibition (Supplementary Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since several commercially available antibodies do not detect ALK1 protein specifically, we used BMP9 signalling to SMAD1/5 as a surrogate readout for the loss of ALK1 function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, knockdown of ALK1 impaired BMP9 induction of canonical SMAD 1/5 phosphorylation in HUVECs (Fig 2b) and MLEC (Supplementary Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, ALK1 silencing in EA.hy926 cells, primary HUVEC and MLEC resulted in reduced uptake of DiI-LDL (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the sufficiency of ALK1 for LDL uptake, MLEC were isolated from Acvrl1fl/fl, Ldlr/ double knockout (KO) mice, immortalized with middle T antigen13 cultured in lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) overnight to maximize LDL uptake and infected with adenovirus-expressing green fluorescent protein (AdGFP) as a control or adenoviral Cre-recombinase (AdCre) to excise the Acvrl1 allele.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loss of LDLR markedly reduced 125I-LDL uptake into MLEC infected with AdGFP consistent with its known role of LDLR (Fig 2d), however, AdCre-mediated excision of Acvrl1 in cells lacking LDLR further reduced 125I-LDL uptake by 60%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we compared the relative importance of LDLR versus ALK1 in mediating LDL uptake by treating endothelial cells (EC) with siRNAs to LDLR or ALK1 and growing the cells in complete media including serum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions, the loss of LDLR and to a lesser extent ALK1, both reduced LDL uptake over a range of DiI-LDL concentrations (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the specificity of the uptake of ApoB100 rich lipoproteins (LDL and very low-density lipoprotein; VLDL) versus ApoA1 rich lipoproteins (HDL) was tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Silencing of ALK1 inhibited DiI-LDL and DiI-VLDL uptake, but not DiI-HDL uptake (Fig 2f), implying specificity for ApoB100 containing lipoproteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chylomicrons or its remnants were not tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been hypothesized that oxidized LDL (OxLDL) contributes to the development of atherosclerosis, and it is known that the biological behaviour and receptor recognition of OxLDL is significantly different from native LDL14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The uptake of DiI-OxLDL is not affected by the knockdown of ALK1 (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ALK1 is one of seven ALK receptors (ALK1-ALK7) and sequence alignment of this family reveals low homology in the amino-terminal/extracellular domains, but a high homology of the carboxy-terminal/intracellular domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the ligands bind to the amino-terminal domain of the ALK family we compared ALK1 and ALK2, which share 59% homology among the entire protein and just 23% for the extracellular domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas LDLR and ALK1 overexpression increases DiI-LDL uptake we could not detect an effect of ALK2 overexpression on DiI-LDL uptake (Fig 2h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the knockdown of ALK1 in endothelial cells results in less uptake of LDL, the presence of the ALK1-ectodomain (ALK1-Fc) should phenocopy this effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ALK1-Fc reduced DiI-LDL uptake dose-dependently starting at a threshold of 1010 M (Fig 2i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Validation of ALK1 in mediating LDL uptake into endothelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

cholesterol homeostasis is crucial for cell growth and maintenance, cholesterol uptake, synthesis and metabolism, is largely regulated through sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) of sterol responsive genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As seen in Fig 3a, knockdown of dynamin 2 (DNM2) in EA.hy926 cells grown in complete media and serum, did not influence ACVRL1 gene expression but upregulated the transcript levels of several SREBP2-dependent genes (LDLR, HMGCR, INSIG1 and PCSK9), whereas the loss of ACVRL1 did not affect SREBP2-dependent gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A further analysis was performed in EA.hy926 cell cultured in LPDS or LPDS containing LDL (25 g ml1, Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the addition of LDL to LPDS resulted in downregulation of LDLR, HMGCR and INSIG1all SREBP2-dependent genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the loss of DNM2, but not ACVRL1, blunted the ability of LDL to reduce gene expression showing that ALK1 does not influence sterol sensing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, silencing of ACVRL1 had no effect on the total levels of LDLR in cell lysates by western blotting (Fig 3b) or on cell surface LDLR quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the uptake of LDL by the LDLR results in its lysosomal degradation15, we assessed the uptake and degradation of 125I-LDL in cells deficient in LDLR or ACVRL1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EA.hy926 were transfected with control, LDLR or ACVRL1 siRNAs, and then exposed to excess LDL (25 g ml1) overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The next morning, cells were incubated with 125I-LDL and the uptake and degradation (after 4 h) was assessed6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The net uptake of 125I-LDL in LDL pretreated EA.hy926 cells (Fig 3d) was lower than that in MLEC cultured in LPDS, Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of ALK1 in LDL pretreated EA.hy926 cells reduced 125I-LDL internalization, whereas knockdown of LDLR did not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the degradation of 125I-LDL, assessed by free 125I-tyrosine in the medium, was reduced by the loss of LDLR, but not the loss of ALK1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data suggests that the suppression of LDLR by pre-treatment with LDL was incomplete, and so the subsequent addition of siRNA against LDLR further suppressed LDL internalization and degradation via the LDLR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As ALK1-mediated LDL uptake did not affect sterol sensing or LDL degradation, the pool of non-esterified, free cholesterol was analysed using Filipin-III staining (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The knockdown of ACVRL1, LDLR or DNM2 did not increase the pool of free cholesterol, whereas both positive controls (U18666 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16) and NPC2 siRNA) did.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data demonstrate that ALK1 facilitates

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The central goal of this study was to identify the pathways of LDL uptake by the endothelium using an unbiased, genome-wide screening approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rationale for identifying new pathways for LDL transit is predicated on the observations that (1) the uptake, transport and retention of sub-endothelial LDL particles can occur in an LDLR independent manner and contribute to the initiation of atherosclerosis1,2; (2) hypercholesterolemic levels of LDL will downregulate LDLR by SREBP2-dependent suppression of genes controlling intracellular cholesterol levels6 and (3) accelerated atherosclerosis is found in patients harbouring loss of function mutations in LDLR21 implying additional lipoprotein dependent, LDLR independent pathways of vascular disease are operational.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with this hypothesis, we identified several genes that can regulate the internalization of LDL into endothelium and a majority of these genes are implicated in metabolic pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed analysis shows that ALK1 fits the criteria for an endothelial cell specific, LDL-binding protein sufficient to promote LDL uptake and transcytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is supported by knockdown or overexpression studies showing that ALK1 mediates LDL uptake and transcytosis in an LDLR and sterol sensing independent manner by the direct binding of LDL to the ectodomain of ALK1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results define the genetic pathways that promote LDL uptake into endothelium and offers alternative strategies to modify the uptake and transport of LDL from the blood into the vessel wall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The initial screen was designed to identify pathways that mediate rapid (60 min) LDL uptake in endothelial cells previously exposed to an excess of LDL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this approach, we identified multiple genes implicated in the development of atherosclerosis or in regulating cellular cholesterol levels and/or LDL uptake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cross-referencing the genes of the follow-up list with GWAS revealed that ARHGAP9, SDC1 and SLC38A3 are linked to changes in plasma lipids, whereas ATP6V1C1 is associated with variation in the QT-interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'CX3CR1 is a chemokine receptor and genetic or pharmacological inhibition of this receptor attenuates atherosclerosis in mice by reducing inflammatory responses22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Endonuclease G is thought to be involved in DNA fragmentation during apoptosis of cells and a recent study has shown that carbamylated LDL stimulates endonuclease G (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leukaemia inhibiting factor upregulates hepatic LDLR in rabbits and lead to increased cholesterol clearance, resulting in decreased fatty streaks formation in the thoracic aorta26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, similar to findings using a genome wide, RNAi screen for genes regulating cholesterol metabolism in HeLa cells27, BHMT2 and C17orf59 were identified as genes necessary for LDL uptake in endothelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About 20% (7/34) of the genes/proteins identified in the screen cluster in the vesicular trafficking pathway (highlighted in red in Supplementary Fig 2b), indicating that these candidates are involved in intracellular transport of LDL, which could lead to another route affecting net LDL uptake in endothelial cells besides preventing the initial binding to cell membrane proteins such as LDLR or ALK1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work has described a transcytotic route of LDL permeation across endothelial cells via a DMN2 dependent, caveolin-1 (CAV1)-dependent mechanism28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mice deficient in CAV1, albumin and LDL uptake are reduced in isolated aortas and 125I-LDL and DiI-LDL uptake are reduced in vivo28,29 resulting in less atherosclerosis despite elevated lipids28,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since LDL can bind CD36 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31), the reduction in atherosclerosis in CAV1-deficient mice may be due to the reduced CD36 levels observed in Cav1-KO vessels30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, ALK1 has been localized to caveolae and may also contribute to reduced LDL uptake in Cav1-knockout mice32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most recently, the lipoprotein scavenger receptor for HDL, SR-B1, has been identified as a new candidate mediating the uptake and transcytosis of LDL in endothelial cells18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the loss of SR-B1 enhances atherogenesis, possibly by reducing hepatic HDL clearance33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As our study focuses on the endothelium, the expression patterns of the 34 genes identified were analysed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and published work in MEDLINE (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only three genes are uniquely expressed in the endothelium: ACVRL1, ANGPT4 and GPR182.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ANGPT4 is the least characterized member of the angiopoietin/TIE-receptor pathway and is the human ortholog of the murine ANGPT3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the structure of these orthologs differ more from each other than the human and mouse counterparts of Ang1 and Ang2 (refs 34, 35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This explains, why ANGPT4 has not been characterized in depth yet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, GPR182 was found to be upregulated in tumour-specific endothelial cells using a microarray37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This GPCR has no known ligand or function in endothelial cells, but is enriched in the embryonic vasculature38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work will address the relative importance of these endothelial cell specific genes to LDL uptake and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cholesterol is crucial for cell growth and maintenance, but is toxic in excess, therefore, intracellular cholesterol homeostasis is tightly regulated by the transcription factor, SREBP2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As ACVRL1 knockdown leads to decreased internalization of LDL, the regulatory feedback on sterol sensing through SREBP2 was investigated through the expression of SREBP2 regulated genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Silencing of DNM2, effectively blocking endocytosis, leads to increased transcript levels of SREBP2-regulated genes (LDLR, HMGCR, INSIG1 and PCSK9), whereas knockdown of ACVRL1 shows no effect on sterol-mediated gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Varying LDLR expression through siRNA or LDL concentration in the medium did not affect ALK1 expression or signalling, moreover the loss of ALK1 does not influence LDLR levels in extracts or the amount of LDLR on the cell surface detected by FACS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly ALK1-dependent uptake of LDL does not result in its lysosomal degradation (measured by 125iodotyrosine release into the media) implying the route of entry of LDL bound to ALK1 is different from LDL bound to LDLR, thus independently confirm that ALK1 does not affect sterol sensing which requires LDL degradation and metabolism of cholesterol esters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early studies in the field suggested an LDLR independent route can account for 4050% of LDL internalization through a non-lysosomal, non-degradative pathway39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation was corroborated by an EM-study5 and has been observed also in capillary endothelial cells of the bloodbrain-barrier40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Since ALK1 expression in Ldlr-KO MEFs augments LDL uptake, other components of the BMP/ALK1 pathway were examined for their effects on LDL internalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  siRNA silencing of BMPRII, ActRII, GDF2 (BMP9)/BMP10 or ENG (endoglin) in the initial screen did not affect LDL uptake implying specificity for ALK1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ALK2 was overexpressed in HeLa and HCAECs and analysed for its effect on DiI-LDL uptake and transcytosis, but the results indicate a specific effect for ALK1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, ALK1-mediated LDL uptake is not affected by its kinase activity, as overexpression of constitutively active or inactive mutants and pharmacological modulation of ALK1 kinase activity had no effect on LDL uptake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of ALK1 signalling during atherogenesis has been suggested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, ALK1 expression is increased in human coronary atherosclerotic lesions41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, previous studies implicating ALK1 in atherosclerosis mainly focused on signalling of the TGF- family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, independent studies have shown that inhibition of BMP signalling attenuates the formation of atherosclerotic plaques42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because ALK1 mediates LDL uptake through direct binding via its extracellular domain and transduces BMP signalling, ALK1 exerts at least two independent functions during the development of atherosclerosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our data clearly demonstrates a role for ALK1 in the uptake of LDL in endothelial cells in vitro, examining if the loss of ALK1 influences LDL clearance and atherogenesis in vivo is challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genetic deletion of ALK1 causes early embryonic vascular defects44, while conditional, post-natal deletion of ALK1 in endothelial cells also induces death within 810 days due to its critical role in BMP9/10 signalling19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on SPR experiments, LDL and BMP9 bind to discrete sites on LDL since the presence of BMP9 did not compete for the binding of ALK1 to LDL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to compelling in vitro data showing that LDL binds ALK1 and mediates LDL uptake and transcytosis, data in endothelial specific Acvrl1-deficient mice on a Ldlr-KO background demonstrates less LDL uptake into the aortic wall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the lethality of sustained ALK1 inactivation in adult endothelium as seen by others19,20 and confirmed here, we could not examine if the loss of ALK1 would reduce the extent of atherosclerosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies will need to focus on separating the LDL-uptake from the BMP-signalling pathway of ALK1, which may be feasible based on the SPR data presented here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, this work defines new pathways for LDL uptake into endothelial cells and provides a molecular basis to begin unravelling LDL uptake, transcytosis and retention in the vessel wall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although lipid lowering therapy is the mainstay for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic vascular disease45; additional therapeutic approaches targeting the early events of atherogenesis in the vessel wall such as LDL transport, retention or endothelial cell dysfunction are interesting and feasible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, a putative pharmacological treatment that antagonizes the LDL/ALK1 interaction in endothelial cells without affecting BMP9/BMP10-dependent signalling may afford unique and synergistic benefits with lipid lowering therapies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
