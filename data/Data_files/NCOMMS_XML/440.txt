Alterations of the human gut microbiome in multiple sclerosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The gut microbiome plays an important role in immune function and has been implicated in several autoimmune disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use 16S rRNA sequencing to investigate the gut microbiome in subjects with multiple sclerosis (MS, n=60) and healthy controls (n=43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microbiome alterations in MS include increases in Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia and decreases in Butyricimonas, and correlate with variations in the expression of genes involved in dendritic cell maturation, interferon signalling and NF-kB signalling pathways in circulating T cells and monocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients on disease-modifying treatment show increased abundances of Prevotella and Sutterella, and decreased Sarcina, compared with untreated patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MS patients of a second cohort show elevated breath methane compared with controls, consistent with our observation of increased gut Methanobrevibacter in MS in the first cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further study is required to assess whether the observed alterations in the gut microbiome play a role in, or are a consequence of, MS pathogenesis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Microorganisms in the human gut encompass hundreds to thousands of bacterial, archaeal, viral and fungal species, making the human intestinal lumen a rich and dense source of antigenic diversity1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gut mucosal immune system samples and processes these microbial antigens, potentially driving the expansion of particular immune subsets or generating specific immune repertoires2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the intestinal microbiome is an important entity within the host that influences immune responses both locally and systemically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The gut microbiome has been implicated in numerous immunologic disorders, including multiple sclerosis (MS), inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine model for MS, altering the gut microbiome modulates central nervous system (CNS) autoimmunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a relapsingremitting mouse model of spontaneous EAE, transgenic SJL/J mice raised in germ-free conditions were protected against developing the disease, while the introduction of commensal microbiota into the gut restored susceptibility6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While gnotobiotic mice are relatively immunocompromised due to lack of microbial stimulation promoting immune maturation, specific association of germ-free mice with defined commensal species has been shown to modulate the development and severity of EAE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Segmented-filamentous bacteria (SFB) drive expansion of Th17 cell populations and generation of interleukin (IL)-17 in the gut7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mono-colonization of the gut of C57BL/6 mice with segmented-filamentous bacteria promotes Th17 accumulation in the spinal cords of mice and induces the development of EAE8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, treatment of C57BL/6 mice with a polysaccharide from the organism Bacteroides fragilis expands intestinal Foxp3+ CD4 Tregs and protects against the development of CNS autoimmunity9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the case of human autoimmune disease, associations have been reported with different members of the commensal microbiota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a study of 20 MS patients versus 40 healthy controls, Faecalibacterium, Prevotella and Anaerostipes were decreased in MS, but the connection between microbiota, treatment and changes in immunity was not examined11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prevotella copri has been associated in proinflammatory conditions, and has found to be enriched in patients with new-onset rheumatoid arthritis5, or capable of exacerbating dextran sodium sulfate colitis in antibiotic-treated C57BL/6 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Butyrate-producing organisms have protective associations with inflammatory conditions, for example, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii has been shown to be reduced in inflammatory bowel disease12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In neuromyelitis optica, a CNS autoimmune disease directed against aquaporin-4, there are increased antibodies against gastrointestinal antigens and cross-reactivity to a protein belonging to Clostridium perfringens, suggesting that autoimmunity in neuromyelitis optica may be driven by molecular mimicry against microbial antigens13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the autoimmunity associated with GuillainBarre syndrome has been associated with Campylobacter jejuni and the generation of antibodies to microbial components that cross-react with epitopes on the surface of the neuron14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given the importance of the gut microbiome in immune function and autoimmune disease, for the present work we investigated the human gut microbiome in multiple sclerosis (MS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify alterations in the intestinal microbiota and find correlations with MS-associated immune changes and treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If further studies demonstrate that these candidate microorganisms play an active role in either contributing to or ameliorating MS, then there is the potential to develop new diagnostics and therapies to combat the disease.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Subject characteristics', 'Faecal samples were collected from 60 MS patients and 43 healthy controls (Fig 1); details of the study population are provided in Table 1 and in Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MS and control cohorts had comparable demographic characteristics except that the MS cohort had an increased proportion of males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All MS patients had relapsingremitting disease but none had an active relapse at the time of study enrollment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Study design.Faecal samples were collected from MS patients (n=60) and healthy subjects (n=43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microbial DNA was extracted from frozen faecal samples and 16s rDNA sequencing was performed using Roche 454 and Illumina platforms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene expression profiling was performed on circulating monocytes and T cells from MS patients (n=18) and healthy subjects (n=18) using a Nanostring platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from MS patients (n=18) and healthy subjects (n=18) to conduct proliferation and cytokine assays in response to specific microbial stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sera from MS patients (n=45) and healthy subjects (n=16) was collected for ELISA-based techniques to capture serologic activity directed against specific microbes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Breath samples from MS patients (n=41) and healthy subjects (n=32) were collected from a second subject cohort to determine breath methane concentrations.Full size image', 'Table 1 Demographics of study population.Full size table', 'Structure and composition of the gut microbiome in MS', 'Microbial DNA was extracted from faecal samples and 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on the Roche 454 and Illumina MiSeq platforms using primers targeting the V35 or the V4 variable regions, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used two sequencing platforms to avoid platform-specific biases and to provide complementary information: the Roche 454 platform produces longer sequencing reads but fewer reads, whereas the Illumina MiSeq provides shorter reads but greater sequencing depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting sequences were then processed using the mothur software package for quality filtering, removal of artifacts and clustering to operational taxonomic units (OTUs)15 (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Roche 454 sequencing yielded 1,426,326 reads of 450 nucleotides each, with 426 OTUs identified after quality filtering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Illumina MiSeq sequencing yielded 11,498,168 paired-end reads of 150 nucleotides each, with 1,191 OTUs identified after filtering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To assess overall differences in microbial community structure in MS patients and controls, we calculated measures of alpha- and beta-diversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alpha-diversity summarizes the microbial diversity within each sample, whereas beta diversity measures differences between samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shannon entropy, an alpha-diversity measurement of richness and evenness, was measured at multiple sequencing depths using rarefaction curves and was similar between MS patients and healthy controls (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether overall microbial community structure was different between MS patients and controls, we calculated differences in beta-diversity using the weighted and unweighted UniFrac metric.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analyses of the resulting matrices using the analysis of molecular variance technique did not reveal significant differences in overall microbial community structure between the two groups (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'MS-associated microbiota changes at the phylum level', 'At the phylum level, the faecal microbiota of both groups was dominated by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, with smaller contributions of Euryarchaeota, Verrucomicrobia and Proteobacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative abundances of microbiota at the phylum level were compared between the entire MS cohort (both treated and untreated) and controls (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MS patients had a significantly increased relative abundance of the phyla Euryarchaeota and Verrucomicrobia compared to healthy controls (DESeq, BenjaminiHochberg adjusted P value less_than 0.05) by Roche 454 and Illumina sequencing (Fig 2a, Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Compositional differences in faecal

therapy may skew microbiota composition, we separately analysed changes in the microbiota in untreated patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both Euryarchaeota and Verrucomicrobia were similarly elevated in untreated MS patients compared with controls, although changes in Euryarchaeota were only significant on the 454 platform, and trended in the same direction on the MiSeq platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with other microbiota studies in humans, we detected inter-individual variability within control and MS patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we provide rank abundance plots to depict phylum level abundances in each subject (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'MS-associated microbiota changes at the genus level', 'We next investigated whether relative abundances of the microbiota differed between MS (untreated and treated) patients and controls at the genus level (Fig 2b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative abundances of Methanobrevibacter, a genus in the phylum Euryarchaeota, and Akkermansia, a genus in the phylum Verrucomicrobia, were both increased in MS patients compared with controls by Roche 454 sequencing and by Illumina sequencing (Fig 2c, Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Butyricimonas, which belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes had a reduced relative abundance in MS as detected by both sequencing platforms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes were similarly detected in untreated MS patients compared with controls (Fig 2c, Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition Collinsella and Slackia, both belonging to the phylum Actinobacteria, and Prevotella, belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes was decreased in untreated MS patients as detected by both sequencing platforms (Table 2; Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, the results from the two sequencing platforms were concordant, with 98% of the total microbial abundance composed of shared genera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While we were able to detect some primer bias (for example, higher detection of Akkermansia with the MiSeq V4 strategy compared with the 454 V35 strategy) the MS-related changes generally remained the same (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Effect of therapy on gut microbiota', 'We then asked whether immunomodulatory therapy was associated with an altered microbiota in treated versus untreated MS patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that treated patients had increases in the Prevotella and Sutterella as detected by Roche 454 and by Illumina sequencing (Fig 2c, Table 2, Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since these genera are either significantly reduced or show a trend of reduced populations in untreated patients compared with controls, it suggests that treatment with immunomodulatory therapy may normalize some of the MS-related changes in the microbiota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genus Sarcina was reduced in treated versus untreated MS patients by both sequencing platforms (Fig 2b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Sarcina levels were similar between untreated patients and controls, suggesting a treatment-associated effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant differences in the microbiota were noted when MS patients treated with interferon therapy were compared with those treated with glatiramer acetate, although the sample sizes of these subsets were not sufficiently powered to evaluate this comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To determine whether the differences we observed were related to age, gender or body mass index (BMI), we reanalysed our data using a multi-factorial model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all MS patients (treated and untreated) compared with controls, the differences in relative abundances for the genera Methanobrevibacter, Akkermansia and Butyricimonas remained significant with at least one of the sequencing platforms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that treatment-related differences in relative abundances for the genera Prevotella, Sutterella and Sarcina remained significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Phylogenetic placement of 16S rRNA sequences', 'Validating bacterial identification is important to select the optimal bacteria to monitor in translational studies, however, partial 16S rRNA reads do not always provide sufficient information for identification to the species level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, phylogenetic placement of 16S rRNA sequences was used to further identify taxa of interest and to assess the accuracy of identification using pplacer16 (Supplementary Figs 9 and 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The representative sequence from the most prevalent OTU was used for each taxa of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Methanobrevibacter sequence from our study placed most closely to reference M. smithii (placement likelihood (PL)=0.94), Akkermansia placed most closely to A. muciniphila (PL=1.00), and Butyricimonas had a greater likelihood of identification as B. synergistica (PL=0.83) than B. virosa (PL=0.50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For genera found to be different between untreated MS patients and controls, Collinsella placed most closely to C. aerofaciens (PL=0.85), Slackia placed closer to S. isoflavoniconvertens (PL=1.0 than to S. piriformis (PL=0.76), Prevotella placed closer to P. stercorea (PL=1.0) than to two different P. copri reference strains (PL=0.76 and 0.81).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For taxa found to be different between untreated and treated MS patients, Sutterella could not be resolved between S. stercoricanis or S. wadsworthensis (PL=1.0 and 1.0, respectively) and sequences mapped to the genus Sarcina placed closest to S. ventriculi (two sequences placing near S. ventriculi with likelihoods of 0.66 and 0.85).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, pplacer was able to identify the most likely genus and species from currently available reference databases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Gene expression in peripheral blood T cells and monocytes', 'We used the Nanostring immunology panel to measure the expression of 568 immune-related genes from peripheral blood derived CD4+ T cells and CD14+ monocytes from a subset of 18 MS patients and 18 controls subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because Methanobrevibacter was significantly increased in MS patients compared with healthy subjects, and since Methanobrevibacter has been previously implicated as a proinflammatory microbe17, we selected MS patients and healthy subjects from our cohort that had the highest and lowest populations of Methanobrevibacter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The demographics and disease characteristics of MS patients and healthy subjects within this subset were similar to those of the larger group (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We found unique immune transcriptional profiles in T cells and monocytes from MS patients compared with healthy controls (Supplementary Fig 11ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ingenuity pathway analysis was used to identify altered canonical pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both T cells and monocytes were predicted to have activated interferon, NF-KB, Toll-like receptor and IL-6 signalling pathways, and decreased PPAR/RXR, consistent with pathways previously correlated with MS18,19,20,21,22,23 (Fig 3a, Supplementary Fig 11d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Correlations between microbiota

either all MS patients and controls together (All), untreated MS patients alone (MS-U) or healthy controls alone (HC).Full size image', 'We then investigated potential associations between the MS-related microbiota and immune changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We correlated microbial abundance with a set of significantly altered genes biologically curated from the identified canonical pathways (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For T cells from all subjects, we found that both Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia had positive correlations with CASP1, TRAF5 and STAT5B, while Butyricimonas had negative correlations with these genes (Fig 3b), which are implicated in IFN signalling, IL-2 signalling, and PPAR and RXR activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the correlations between microbial populations and immune expression levels could driven by the disease, we examined the correlations within untreated MS patients and within healthy controls separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among untreated MS patients, we again noted that Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia had positive correlations and Butyricimonas had negative correlations with this set of genes, while the correlations were near zero among healthy controls alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia also had negative correlations with TNFA1P3, a known potent anti-inflammatory cytokine in autoimmune demyelination, along with NFKBIA previously known to be underexpressed in MS20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Butyricimonas had positive correlations with these two genes (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In monocytes from MS patients, Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia had positive correlations with MAPK14, MAPK1, LTBR, STAT5B, CASP1 and HLA-DRB1, while Butyricimonas had negative correlations with these genes, which are implicated in dendritic cell maturation, IFN signalling and TREM signalling pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among untreated MS patients, Akkermansia and Butyricimonas had positive and negative correlations, respectively, with this set of genes, whereas these effects were not observed in controls (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia also had negative correlations with HLA-A, HLA-B and BCL2 in untreated MS patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Since we observed correlations between the abundance of specific microbes and gene expression in monocytes and T cells from MS patients, we were interested in determining whether these organisms might drive an altered immunologic response in MS patients and controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because lipids derived from Methanobrevibacter are reported to have adjuvant effects24, we investigated Methanobrevibacter smithii induced proliferation and cytokine production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), but found no difference in the response to Methanobrevibacter in MS patients versus controls or in subjects with high Methanobrevibacter in the gut (Supplementary Fig 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Relationship of the gut microbiome to humoral responses', 'We then examined whether sera from MS patients and healthy subjects contained antibodies reactive to Methanobrevibacter or components of Methanobrevibacter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found anti-Methanobrevibacter IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies (titre  greater than 1:64) as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against lysates of Methanobrevibacter in 33% of MS patients and 28% of controls, with no differences in anti-Methanobrevibacter antibody titres between the two groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Breath methane in MS', 'Because Methanobrevibacter is the dominant methane-producing microbe that inhabits the human gastrointestinal tract, the likely presence of Methanobrevibacter in the gut can be measured indirectly by a breath test, which assesses exhaled methane by gas chromatography25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detection of  greater than 1 parts-per-million of methane in the breath reflects the presence of at least 107108 methanogens per gram of stool and has been shown to be driven by Methanobrevibacter smithii26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After we discovered increased Methanobrevibacter in the gut by 16S rRNA sequencing, we performed a methane breath test on a second cohort of 41 MS patients and 32 controls to determine whether we could verify the presence of methane-producing organisms by a simple and independent in vivo measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second cohort was chosen to resemble our first cohort (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detected the presence of methane in 13/41 MS patients versus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8/32 controls.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Host-commensal interactions have increasingly been shown to play a role in the induction of autoimmunity both in experimental animals and human diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis8,27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The origin of the autoimmune process in multiple sclerosis is still poorly understood and whether the inciting factors that trigger inflammation primarily occur in the central nervous system or in the periphery is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that disease concordance in MS is 25% in monozygotic twins, both genetic and environmental factors likely contribute to the development of disease29, and the gut microbiota might be one such environmental factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We undertook studies to define the community structure of the faecal microbiome in MS patients using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found alterations at the phylum level with increases in Euryarchaeota and Verrucomicrobia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the genus level, more specific shifts were observed, including increases of Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia and reduction in Butyricimonas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that discrepancies may occur due to variability in primer selection and sequencing reads, we utilized two separate sequencing methodologies and observed that the majority of taxonomic shifts were consistent in both platforms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Several of the organisms identified in this study as being altered in MS have been demonstrated to drive inflammation or have been associated with autoimmunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The archaeon Methanobrevibacter has been implicated in inflammation by its capacity to recruit inflammatory cells and activate human dendritic cells17 and its role in inflammatory diseases, including periodontitis, asthma and inflammatory bowel disease24,30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, archaeosomes derived from Methanobrevibacter have potent adjuvant properties secondary to their unique lipid structure and have been used as adjuvants for vaccines32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Methanobrevibacter is distributed throughout the small bowel and colon and is tightly adherent to the mucosa via regulated expression of adhesin-like proteins, placing it in close proximity to the gut-associated lymphoid tissue33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, when mucosa-associated (rather than luminal) microbiota were studied in inflammatory bowel disease, Methanobrevibacter smithii was increased more than threefold in mucosal samples from patients with both Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis compared to controls30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Methanobrevibacter smithii is also recovered more frequently in children with obesity, a known risk factor for the development of MS in adult life34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in a pilot study of pediatric multiple sclerosis, children colonized with Methanobrevibacter had a shorter time to relapse35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We also found that the phylum Verrucomicrobia was increased in MS patients and was driven by the genus Akkermansia, which was also reported in a pilot study of 7 MS patients36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to our findings in MS, Akkermansia species have been reported to be decreased in other autoimmune diseases including psoriatic arthritis37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Akkermansia has been reported to have both regulatory and inflammatory properties, and is a mucin-degrader that converts mucin to short-chain fatty acids that may mediate the immunoregulatory effects38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, Akkermansia has been correlated to proinflammatory pathways including upregulation of genes involved in antigen-presentation, B- and T-cell receptor signalling, and activation of complement and coagulation cascades39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These proinflammatory features may be related to its ability to degrade mucus, leading to breakdown of the gut barrier and increased exposure of resident immune cells to microbial antigens40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We found lower abundances of Butyricimonas, a butyrate-producing genus, in MS patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Butyrate is a short-chain fatty acid produced by microbes that induce colonic regulatory T cells41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reductions in colonic butyrate can disrupt barrier function and promote inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to our findings, reductions in butyrate producers have been noted in numerous autoimmune and inflammatory diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes5,42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We investigated untreated MS patients, to examine the microbiota independent of MS disease-modifying therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the genera that were altered in the entire MS cohort (Methanobrevibacter, Akkermansia and Butyricimonas) were also altered in the untreated population, suggesting that these effects are not specifically correlated with therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, within the untreated MS subset, we observed reductions in genera belonging to the family Coriobacteriaceae, including Collinsella and Slackia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reductions in Coriobacteriaceae have been reported in relatives of patients with inflammatory bowel disease44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Patients on disease-modifying therapy had increased abundances of the genera Prevotella compared with untreated patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Prevotella has been reported to be increased in rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease5, Prevotella has been previously correlated to the intake of high-fibre diets, whose primary substrate, fibre, can drive the generation of the immunoregulatory metabolite butyrate45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that Prevotella was low in untreated MS, and that treatment with disease-modifying therapy was associated with increased relative abundance of Prevotella.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a smaller cohort of 20 MS patients compared with 40 controls in Japan, the authors detected a decrease in Prevotella11 in MS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given this consistent finding, future studies investigating the role of Prevotella in MS are warranted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We also observed increases in the genus Sutterella and decreases in Sarcina in MS patients on therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sutterella was found to be increased in healthy controls compared to patients with new-onset Crohns disease46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sarcina species are reported to be increased in the gut microbiota of autistic patients47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since immunomodulatory treatment in MS was associated with increases in relative abundances of Prevotella and Sutterella and decreases in Sarcina, it is conceivable that treatment may act to normalize a proinflammatory microbiota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our finding that some of MS patients have elevated exhaled methane, a surrogate for levels of Methanobrevibacter in the gut, is consistent with our 16S rRNA sequencing results; it would be interesting to use this rapid, in vivo test to investigate Methanobrevibacter in larger populations of MS patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While we did not measure stool abundance of Methanobrevibacter in this second cohort, previous studies have shown that the amount of breath methane strongly correlates with the quantity of M. smithii in the stool26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other anatomical sites, the presence of particular microbial species can be identified based on their metabolic activity, as is routinely done for diagnosing Helicobacter pylori presence with a positive gastric urease test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies employing simultaneous collection of breath, faecal and blood samples in MS patients will address the potential role of breath methane as a biomarker in MS.', 'The gut microbiota are known to modulate host immune gene expression either by direct contact with cell wall components, or by secretion of factors that can signal through host receptors or through epigenetic modifications that may alter methylation or acetylation of transcriptional promoters48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microbial colonization by a single organism or by groups of organisms into the gut of germ-free mice can modulate the expression of innate and adaptive immune genes as early as 4 days after microbial inoculation in varying cellular compartments48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a study of inflammatory bowel disease in humans, associations between microbes and host gene expression were found in innate and adaptive immune pathways49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We examined relationships between microbial abundance and immune genes implicated in MS pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the inflammatory properties of Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia32,33,34,36,45,46, we found positive correlations with these organisms and gene expression in T cells and monocytes involved in key pathways previously implicated in MS pathogenesis, including increased expression of the MAPK family in monocytes (MAPK1 and MAPK14), genes directly involved in both the initiation phase of innate immunity and activating adaptive immunity50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In T cells, Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia positively correlated with TRAF5, a known regulator of T-cell activation and known to be overexpressed in MS, as well as STAT5B, whose expression is indispensible for the encephalitogenicity of autoreactive CD4+ T cells in EAE50,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Methanobrevibacter or Akkermansia negatively correlated with TNFAIP3, previously shown to have reduced expression in studies of the MS transcriptome21,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of Akkermansia, these relationships were even stronger among untreated MS patients alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Butyricimonas had negative correlations with genes known to be increased in MS among T cells and monocytes, suggesting that reduction in Butyricimonas is associated with increased proinflammatory gene expression, however, directionality cannot be determined from this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These correlations were observed among all subjects and in untreated MS patients, but not in controls alone, suggesting that the relationship between microbial abundance and gene expression was MS-specific, but not solely driven by differences between controls and MS patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we could detect correlation, we cannot determine the causal direction or conclude whether the microbes drive immunological changes, or whether the disease or altered immunity drives changes in the microbiota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While our investigation of the gut microbiota in MS provides initial insights into understanding the potential role for the microbiome in this disease, our study has certain limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we cannot assign a direct cause to the associations we describe in the gut microbiome and the MS immunophenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The altered microbes may play a role in disease-related immunological changes, or MS-related changes in physiology may drive microbial alterations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Methanobrevibacter, for example, is recovered more frequently from individuals with constipation-variant irritable bowel disease52; while we excluded patients with irritable bowel disease from our study, it is possible, for example, that subtle changes in gut motility or in the enteric nervous system in MS patients or co-existing constipation may produce conditions favourable for the growth of this microbe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, our findings could be influenced by cohort-specific confounders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To minimize the effects of confounders, we used strict exclusion criteria eliminating the potential influence of antibiotics, pregnancy or other autoimmune or gastrointestinal conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Medications taken before the window of our studysuch as prior courses of steroidsmay also influence gut microbial populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, MS patients often consume alternative diets that might favour the growth of particular microbial niches53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we did not find any large differences in dietary intake in our cohort, more sensitive assays may reveal dietary variation that may be responsible for the observed changes in the gut microbiome in our disease population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the methodology used to collect stool samples was relatively uniform, variability in time of sample collection and interval of previous dietary intake may have also contributed to changes in microbes recovered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While age, gender and BMI have been previously shown to drive changes in the microbiome, our multi-factorial model suggests that these factors did not confound the observed microbial differences between the groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we did not find a relationship between changes in the gut microbiome and clinical parameters such as disease duration or disability, most of our patients had low levels of disability (average EDSS 1.2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies with larger cohorts and longitudinal collection of samples will be required to investigate these clinical associations, including subjects with progressive forms of the disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, we analysed the microbiota using primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this is useful for providing taxonomic information, shotgun metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and metabolomic profiling of faecal samples may reveal changes in the abundance of microbial genes, their expression or the presence of microbial metabolites that would complement phylogenic and taxonomic data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, our study is limited by the fact that we collected samples after disease onset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that critical changes in the gut microbiome in MS may occur in early or preclinical stages of disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in type 1 diabetes, changes in the gut microbiome were apparent before the onset of illness in high-risk individuals with the concomitant appearance of anti-islet antibodies54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Investigation of the microbiota in paediatric or early-onset MS may provide further evidence of associations between the composition of the gut microbiome and MS pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we have found alterations of the human gut microbiome in MS that correlate with changes in the immune transcriptome and treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that treatment strategies of MS in the future may include therapeutic interventions designed to affect the microbiome such as probiotics, faecal transplantation and delivery of constituents of organisms isolated from the microbiome10, although more work is required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, characterization of the gut microbiome in MS may provide biomarkers for assessing disease activity and could theoretically be an avenue to prevent MS in young at-risk populations.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
