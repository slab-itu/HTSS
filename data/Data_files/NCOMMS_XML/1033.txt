Facile access to potent antiviral quinazoline heterocycles with fluorescence properties via merging metal-free domino reactions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Most of the known approved drugs comprise functionalized heterocyclic compounds as subunits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among them, non-fluorescent quinazolines with four different substitution patterns are found in a variety of clinically used pharmaceuticals, while 4,5,7,8-substituted quinazolines and those displaying their own specific fluorescence, favourable for cellular uptake visualization, have not been described so far.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the development of a one-pot synthetic strategy to access these 4,5,7,8-substituted quinazolines, which are fluorescent and feature strong antiviral properties (EC50 down to 0.6±0.1 M) against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Merging multistep domino processes in one-pot under fully metal-free conditions leads to sustainable, maximum efficient and high-yielding organic synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, generation of artesunic acidquinazoline hybrids and their application against HCMV (EC50 down to 0.1±0.0 M) is demonstrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence of new antiviral hybrids and quinazolines has potential applications in molecular imaging in drug development and mechanistic studies, avoiding requirement of linkage to external fluorescent markers.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Quinazoline heterocycles are ubiquitous in pharmaceutical compounds and drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are important subunits of a broad variety of natural products as well as synthetic pharmaceuticals possessing anti-inflammatory1, antiviral2, antimalarial3 and anticancer4 activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The known quinazoline-based drugs, which are not demonstrating fluorescence properties, can be divided into four groups AD (2,4,6,7-; 4,6,7-; 2,4,5,6- and 2,4,6,7,8-substituted quinazolines), representing four types of existing substitution patterns (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Quinazoline scaffolds with different substitution patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) List of the selected corresponding non-fluorescent quinazoline-marketed drugs: Alfuzosin (adrenergic blocker), Bunazosin (antihypertensive agent), Prazosin (adrenergic blocker), Terazosin (adrenergic blocker), Erlotinib (anticancer agent), Gefitinib (anticancer agent), Vandetanib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor), Trimetrexane (dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor) and Trimazosin (antihypertensive agent).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Antiviral quinazolines with fluorescence properties developed in this work.Full size image', 'The synthesis of known quinazoline heterocycles by conventional ways is a hard work that implies many synthetic steps and expensive starting materials, and involves time-consuming and waste-producing isolation and purification of product intermediates4,5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of synthetic methods to afford quinazolines is, furthermore, restricted to the availability of the appropriate starting compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, development of new efficient and straightforward synthetic methods towards quinazoline heterocyclic compounds of value to medicinal chemistry, starting from simple precursors, is of high current demand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, the class of 4,5,7,8-substituted quinazolines (E-type, Fig 1b) have not been prepared to date because of the lack of a synthetic route towards these compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, no examples of fluorescent quinazolines have been reported so far.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  External fluorescent labels are usually employed to study the functions of quinazoline-based pharmacophores within cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, fluorescent markers can influence or change the properties of studied lead compounds and drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the drug candidate should ideally display its own fluorescence to allow its cellular uptake visualization and without incorporation of external fluorescent labels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The motivation and desire to address these gaps prompted the research work we report here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recently, combined processes, where several fundamentally different catalytic reactions are joined in a one-pot protocol, were introduced9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among known examples are combinations of (i) organocatalysis and transitionmetal catalysis10, (ii) organocatalysis and silver or gold catalysis11,12,13 or (iii) organocatalysis and (photo)redox catalysis14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even more efficient and economical methods towards heterocyclic compounds are domino processes16,17,18,19,20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In terms of efficiency and sustainability, generation of bioactive heterocycles through multicomponent multistep reactions avoiding intermediate isolation and purification steps, is unbeatable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While examples of organocatalysed linear domino reactions17,18,20 and of a single branched domino process21 are known, surprisingly, combining them in one-pot is unprecedented, although such a multistep one-pot process would further reduce costs and waste production in the synthesis of versatile heterocycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Herein, we describe development of a combined process, which joins a new five-step branched domino reaction with two-step linear and subsequent three-step linear domino reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This new metal-free 10-step sequence, with only a single work up procedure and starting from simple and readily available compounds, results in new functionalized quinazolines of type E (Fig 1b), which exceed the antiviral potency of the clinical reference drug ganciclovir23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, selected fluorescent quinazolines were applied for synthesis of first artesunic acidquinazoline hybrids, which are, remarkably, also fluorescent and display superior potency against HCMV (EC50 down to 0.1±0.0 M) compared to that of their parent quinazolines (EC50 down to 4.6±0.9 M) and artesunic acid (EC50 3.8±0.4 M), as well as ganciclovir (EC50 2.6±0.5 M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all quinazoline compounds, cytotoxicity for primary human fibroblasts (HFFs; CC50) was undetectable at concentrations up to 100 M, indicating that the new quinazolines and hybrid compounds are selective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the fluorescent quinazolines could nicely be depicted both in extracellular and intracellular localizations when analysing primary HFFs and virus-infected cells using confocal laser-scanning microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An accumulation of fluorescent quinazolines was mostly observed in cytoplasmic areas, thus visually indicating their efficient cellular uptake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results open up new perspectives for molecular imaging in the drug development process and mechanistic studies, avoiding the requirement of linkage of external fluorescent labels to potential drug molecules.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
