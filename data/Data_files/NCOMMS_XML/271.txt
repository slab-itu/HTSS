Tornado outbreak variability follows Taylors power law of fluctuation scaling and increases dramatically with severity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Tornadoes cause loss of life and damage to property each year in the United States and around the world.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest impacts come from outbreaks consisting of multiple tornadoes closely spaced in time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we find an upward trend in the annual mean number of tornadoes per US tornado outbreak for the period 19542014.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the variance of this quantity is increasing more than four times as fast as the mean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean and variance of the number of tornadoes per outbreak vary according to Taylors power law of fluctuation scaling (TL), with parameters that are consistent with multiplicative growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tornado-related atmospheric proxies show similar power-law scaling and multiplicative growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Path-length-integrated tornado outbreak intensity also follows TL, but with parameters consistent with sampling variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed TL power-law scaling of outbreak severity means that extreme outbreaks are more frequent than would be expected if mean and variance were independent or linearly related.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Hazardous convective weather (tornadoes, hail and damaging wind) associated with severe thunderstorms affects large portions of the United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tornadoes cause particularly intense damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over a recent 10-year period (20052014), tornadoes in the United States resulted in an average of 110 deaths per year and annual losses ranging from $500 million to $9.6 billion1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest societal impacts from tornadoes are from outbreaks in which multiple tornadoes occur in a single weather event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tornado outbreaks across the eastern two-thirds of the United States were associated with 79% of all tornado fatalities over the period 19722010 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2) and are routinely responsible for billion-dollar loss events3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Whether US tornado activity will change in the future remains uncertain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Climate change projections indicate that environments favourable to severe thunderstorms will be more frequent in a warmer climate4, and high-resolution convection-permitting numerical modelling indicates increased activity and year-to-year variability of MarchMay US tornado occurrence as measured by severe weather proxies derived from explicitly depicted storms5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to date, there is no upward trend in the number of reliably reported US tornadoes per year6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interpretation of the US tornado report data requires some caution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the total number of US tornadoes reported each year has increased dramatically over the last half century, but most of that increase is due to more reports of weak tornadoes and is believed to reflect changing reporting practices and other non-meteorological factors rather than increased tornado occurrence7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variability of reported tornado occurrence has increased over the last few decades with more tornadoes being reported on days when tornadoes are observed8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, greater year-to-year variability in the number of tornadoes reported per year has been associated with consistent changes in the monthly averaged atmospheric environments favourable to tornado occurrence10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, US large-event severe thunderstorm losses and the frequency of the most extreme environments have increased11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regional changes in the seasonality of tornado occurrence have also been reported12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite their importance, relatively little is known about the current or projected statistics of tornado outbreak severity beyond their climatology2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most studies have considered only the statistics of tornadoes occurring during a single day14 and have not considered outbreaks over multiple dates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that the annual mean number of tornadoes per outbreak increased during 19542014, and the annual variance increased more than four times faster than the mean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the mean and variance of the number of tornadoes per outbreak are related by Taylors power law of fluctuation scaling (TL)15,16 with parameters that are consistent with multiplicative growth17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TL scaling in tornado outbreak statistics was not previously known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although power-law scaling is present in the probability distributions of various tornado characteristics18,19, the presence of power-law scaling in such probability distributions is neither necessary nor sufficient for TL scaling of the variance in relation to the mean (see also Supplementary Discussion for examples of TL scaling without power-law probability distributions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also find that a tornado-related atmospheric proxy shows a similar power-law scaling and multiplicative growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Path-length-integrated tornado outbreak intensity follows TL as well, but with parameters predicted by sampling variability20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The findings are similar when we restrict the analysis to the more recent period 19772014 and to more intense tornadoes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed TL scaling of outbreak severity means that extreme outbreaks are more frequent than would otherwise be expected if mean and variance were independent or linearly related.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Data and sensitivity analyses', 'We use data from 1954 to 2014, which are generally considered reliable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of concerns regarding the data before 1977 (Methods section, Supplementary Fig 1), we repeat some analysis using the more recent period 19772014 to test the robustness of the results (Supplementary Figs 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We exclude the weakest tornadoes from our analysis and denote the remaining tornadoes as F1+ tornadoes (Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We repeat some of the analysis restricted to more intense tornadoes (F2+; Supplementary Figs 710).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Number of tornadoes per outbreak', 'The annual number of F1+ tornadoes shows no significant trend over the period 19542014 (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generally, trends have not been found in the number of severe tornadoes when severity is defined using the Fujita scale, but upward trends have been found when severity is defined using path length18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentage of F1+ tornadoes that occur in outbreaks (Methods section) is increasing by 0.34 percentage points ±0.13 percentage points per year (Fig 1b), consistent with upward trends in the proportion of tornadoes occurring on days with many tornadoes8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here and in all results, ± intervals are 95% confidence intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fraction of F1+ tornadoes that occur in outbreaks is less than one because not all F1+ tornadoes occur in outbreaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the period 19772014, the number of F1+ tornadoes also shows no significant trend, and the percentage of F1+ tornadoes occurring in outbreaks is also increasing, at a larger estimated rate (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The US tornado reports show no statistically significant trend in the frequency of tornado outbreaks (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the number of F1+ tornadoes and the number of outbreaks are not changing (on average, over time), the increasing percentage of F1+ tornadoes occurring in outbreaks means that the number of F1+ tornadoes per outbreak must be increasing, and indeed, the annual mean number of F1+ tornadoes per outbreak shows a significant upward trend (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The annual mean number of tornadoes per outbreak is increasing by 0.66% ±0.26% per year, and the variance is increasing more than four times as fast, 2.89% ±1.22% per year (Fig 2b,c) over the period 19542014.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The growth rates are greater over the recent period 19772014, with similar ratio between the growth rates of mean and variance (Supplementary

positive mean is the ratio of its variance to its mean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values greater than one (over-dispersion) indicate more clustering than a Poisson variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance,

exponent seldom exceeds 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TL exponent can be greater than 2 for lognormal distributions with changing parameters (Supplementary Discussion and Supplementary Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TL scaling of tornado outbreak severity reveals a remarkably regular relation between annual mean and annual variance that extends over the full range of the data, even for years like 2011 which are extreme in mean and variance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data from 1974 deviate most from TL scaling, with the excessive variance reflecting the 34 April Super Outbreak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The upward trend in the number of tornadoes per outbreak provides an interpretation for the observed TL scaling since TL scaling arises in models of stochastic multiplicative growth17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In such models, the quantity N(t+1) at time t+1 is related to its previous value N(t) by', '', 'where A(t) is the random multiplicative factor by which N(t) grows or declines from one time to the next.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here N(t) is the annual average number of tornadoes per outbreak, and each integer value of t represents one calendar year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LewontinCohen (LC) model for stochastic multiplicative growth assumes that the A(t) are independently and identically distributed for all t0 with finite mean M0 and finite variance V .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If M1, N(t) follows TL asymptotically with17', '', 'Here we estimate (Methods section) M=1.03 and V=0.068, which leads to TL parameters b=3.98 and log(a)= 5.84.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both values are consistent with the least-squares (LS) estimates of the corresponding parameters of TL (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LS estimates are also consistent with the values from LC theory during 19772014 (Supplementary Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  95% confidence intervals for M and V show that the hypothesis of no growth (M=1) under which equation (3) is not valid cannot be rejected (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Supplementary Discussion provides additional description of how the LC model leads to TL scaling with exponent approximately 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Fujita-kilometers per outbreak', 'Another measure of outbreak severity is Fujita-kilometers (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2; F-km) which is the sum (over all tornadoes in an outbreak) of each tornados path length in kilometers multiplied by its Fujita or Enhanced Fujita rating (Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Annual totals of outbreak F-km, mean number of F-km per outbreak and the variance of F-km per outbreak do not show significant trends over the period 19542014 (Fig 3ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean number of F-km per outbreak and the variance of F-km per outbreak show marginally significant trends over the recent period 19772014 (Supplementary

theory is not appropriate to explain the TL scaling of F-km.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, TL scaling also arises from the sampling of stationary skewed distributions20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a distribution

suggest that the unusual values are the result of measurement error.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore TL scaling of F-km per outbreak could be explained by sampling variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A tornado environment proxy', 'A reasonable concern is that the findings here represent properties of the tornado report database that are not meteorological in origin, especially since other prominent features of the tornado report database are not meteorological in origin7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Environmental proxies for tornado occurrence and number of tornadoes per occurrence provide an independent, albeit imperfect, measure of tornado activity for the period 19792013 (Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a minimum, the environmental proxies provide information about the frequency and severity of environments favourable to tornado occurrence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correlation between the annual average number of tornadoes per outbreak and the proxy for number of tornadoes per occurrence is 0.56 (Supplementary Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This correlation falls to 0.34, still significant at the 95% level, when the data from 2011 are excluded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Applying a 5-year moving average to the data highlights their common trends and increases the correlation to 0.88 (Supplementary Fig 6b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The annual mean of the occurrence proxy, a surrogate for number of tornadoes per year, shows a marginally significant upward trend (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The annual mean and annual variance of the proxy for number of tornadoes per occurrence show upward trends of 0.63±0.30% and 2.43±1.12%, respectively (Fig 4b,c), values strikingly similar to those for number of tornadoes per outbreak (Fig 2b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the TL parameters of the proxy for number of tornadoes per occurrence are 3.54±0.42 and log a=5.87±1.43, which are consistent with the LC multiplicative growth theory estimates for the proxy (Fig 4d) and quite similar to those for the number of tornadoes per outbreak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extreme environments associated with tornado occurrence display the TL scaling and multiplicative growth similar to those of the number of tornadoes per outbreak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This similarity plausibly suggests that the changes in the number of tornadoes per outbreak reflect changes in the physical environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "Figure 4:

sensitive to the details of the outbreak definition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assess the robustness of the results to the E/F1 threshold by repeating the analysis with tornadoes rated E/F2 and higher, denoted F2+ (Supplementary Figs 710).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use the period 19772014 because the annual number of F2+ tornadoes display a substantial decrease (not shown) around the 1970s that is likely related to the introduction of the F-scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall the F2+ results are remarkably similar to the F1+ ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The annual number of F2+ tornadoes has an insignificantly negative trend during 19772014 (Supplementary Fig 7a), and the percentage of F2+ tornadoes occurring in F2+ outbreaks has a significant positive trend (Supplementary Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the number of F2+ outbreaks shows no significant trend, the mean number of tornadoes per F2+ outbreak and its variance both have significant upward trends (Supplementary Fig 8ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TL exponent for number of tornadoes per F2+ outbreak is 3.65 and is consistent with LC theory (Supplementary Fig 8d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Annual totals of F2+ outbreak F-km have no significant trend (Supplementary Fig 9a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean F-km per F2+ outbreak does have a significant upward trend, but variance does not (Supplementary Fig 9b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TL scaling of F2+ outbreak F-km (Supplementary Fig 9d) is consistent with sampling variability when 2011 is excluded (Supplementary Fig 10).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'These findings have important implications for tornado risk in the United States and perhaps elsewhere, though we have examined only the US data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the number of tornadoes per outbreak is increasing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there is less evidence that F-km per outbreak are increasing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the number of tornadoes per outbreak and F-km per outbreak follow TL, which relates mean and variance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that TL scaling for the number of tornadoes per outbreak is compatible with multiplicative growth, and that TL scaling for F-km per outbreak could be due to sampling variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the key implication of TL scaling is that both number of tornadoes per outbreak and F-km per outbreak exhibit extreme over-dispersion which increases with mean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the average tornado outbreak severity gets worse, the high extreme of severity rises even faster and the low extreme falls even faster, by either measure of severity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The 95% confidence intervals for the mean and variance of A(t) are computed from 10,000 bootstrap samples and reported in Supplementary Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean and variance of A(t) are used to compute a prediction of the slope b using equation (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TL parameter a is estimated from equation (1) evaluated at the initial year, either 1954 or 1977.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'TL parameters implied by sampling variability', 'There are 1,361 cases of outbreak F-km, and their distribution is highly right-skewed (Supplementary Figs 5a and 10a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The F-km values for the 1974 Super Outbreak and the 2528 April 2011 tornado outbreak are more than 26 standard deviations above the mean of the data on an arithmetic scale and more than six standard deviations above the mean of the log-transformed data, when means and standard deviations are calculated after withholding the two extreme values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These outliers (values that are far from other observations) have a substantial impact on the estimates of the mean, variance and skewness of the F-km distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite their rarity, about 86% (1(12/1,361)1361) of the bootstrap samples will contain one or both of these two events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of the outliers results in bimodal distributions of the TL slope and intercept estimates (Supplementary Figs 5b,c and 10b,c) computed from equation (4), depending on whether or not the outlier values are in the particular bootstrap sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Removal of the outliers results in unimodal distributions, whose ranges are consistent with the least-squares estimates of the TL slope and intercept for F-km (Supplementary Figs 5d,e and 10d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Environmental proxies', 'We use two environmental proxies: one for tornado occurrence and one for the number of tornadoes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tornadoes are often associated with elevated values of convective available potential energy (CAPE; J kg1) and a measure of vertical wind shear, called storm relative helicity (SRH; m2 s2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here 0180 hPa CAPE and 03,000 m SRH data are taken from the North American Regional Reanalysis24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data are interpolated to a 1 × 1 degree latitudelongitude grid over the continental United States and daily averages are computed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The environmental proxy for tornado occurrence is defined using the energy-helicity index25 (EHI), which is the product of CAPE and SRH divided by 160,000 J kg1 m2 s2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values of EHI greater than one indicate the potential for supercell thunderstorms and tornadoes26, and accordingly we take our proxy for tornado occurrence to be the condition that EHI is greater than 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selection of an environmental proxy for the number of tornadoes is more challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only example of a proxy calibrated to predict the number of tornadoes from the surrounding environment uses monthly averaged environment and monthly number of tornadoes27,28, and therefore is not suited for outbreaks, which last much less than a month.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, previous research does provide some indications for the functional form of such a proxy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, on subdaily timescales the likelihood of significant severe weather is nearly twice as sensitive to vertical wind shear as to CAPE29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This sensitivity would argue for a proxy based on the product of CAPE and the square of vertical wind shear or equivalently the product of the square root of CAPE and vertical wind shear31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, proxies for the monthly number of tornadoes contain SRH with an exponent ranging from 1.89 to 4.36 depending on region27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supercell composite parameter32 is used in weather forecasting and is the product of CAPE, SRH and vertical shear, again indicating a scaling of severe weather with the square of vertical wind shear measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of this evidence, we take as the proxy for number of tornadoes', '', 'which differs from the EHI in that the square of SRH appears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The normalizing factor is chosen to match overall annual outbreak numbers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proxy for the number of tornadoes per occurrence is therefore the mean of equation (5) conditional on the occurrence proxy of EHI being greater than one.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
