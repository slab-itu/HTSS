Multiple scattering dynamics of fermions at an isolated p-wave resonance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The wavefunction for indistinguishable fermions is anti-symmetric under particle exchange, which directly leads to the Pauli exclusion principle, and hence underlies the structure of atoms and the properties of almost all materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the dynamics of collisions between two indistinguishable fermions, this requirement strictly prohibits scattering into 90° angles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we experimentally investigate the collisions of ultracold clouds fermionic 40K atoms by directly measuring scattering distributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With increasing collision energy we identify the Wigner threshold for p-wave scattering with its tell-tale dumb-bell shape and no 90° yield.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Above this threshold, effects of multiple scattering become manifest as deviations from the underlying binary p-wave shape, adding particles either isotropically or axially.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A shape resonance for 40K facilitates the separate observation of these two processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The isotropically enhanced multiple scattering mode is a generic p-wave threshold phenomenon, whereas the axially enhanced mode should occur in any colliding particle system with an elastic scattering resonance.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The Pauli exclusion principle1, which forbids two indistinguishable fermions from occupying the same quantum state, is one of the most ubiquitous concepts in physics, underpinning the periodic table, electron transport in condensed-matter systems and the astrophysical phenomena of white dwarf and neutron stars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It arises from the unique quantum phenomenon of indistinguishable particles and a primary difference between the two fundamental types of particlesbosons and fermionslies in their respective symmetrization requirements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given a scattering amplitude f() with polar angle  relative to the collision axis, the properly symmetrized differential cross-section for indistinguishable particles is', '', 'where the symmetric version is for bosons and the anti-symmetric one is for fermions2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, there can be no scattering of indistinguishable fermions into angles 90° from the axis3, regardless of collision energy or the details of the scattering potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For rotationally invariant interactions, one can perform a partial-wave expansion of f() in a sum over Legendre polynomials  indexed by the orbital angular momentum .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the  partial wave is symmetric, the lowest order contribution to the differential cross-section comes from the  partial wave f()cos , giving rise to scattering halos4,5,6,7,8,9 akin to the dumb-bell-shaped p-wave orbitals in atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For sufficiently short-ranged potentials, such as those between non-magnetic atoms, p-wave scattering is strongly suppressed10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Single event dynamics are the starting point when considering the general scattering problem; however, in many situations the response of the particles to the scattering potential has significant contributions from multiple events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple scattering is known to lead to intriguing effects such as Anderson localization11,12,13, coherent backscattering14,15 and random lasing16 in the domain where atoms have a long de Broglie wavelength and a wave-like description.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One may ask whether similar, non-trivial, dynamics can arise in a semiclassical regime, where atoms behave similar to particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, indistinguishable fermions offer a pristine environment in which to investigate multiple scattering, because it is possible to restrict collisions to a single partial wavethe anisotropic p-waveover a wide range of energies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that the inherent binary scattering anisotropy is energy independent, and that energy-dependent deviations in the angular pattern of the scattering halo from its fundamental p-wave shape become a sensitive measure of multiple scattering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, atoms emerging at 90° to the collision axis present a telltale signature for multiple scattering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we employ an optical collider17 to investigate multiple scattering of ultracold clouds of fermionic 40K in the neighbourhood of an isolated p-wave scattering resonance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that above a threshold collision energy the resonance establishes two distinct regions with multi-scattering dynamics driven by cascades to lower collision energies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These regions are identified and contrasted via their isotropic and anisotropic contributions to the underlying pure p-wave binary scattering pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our ability to classify and interpret the scattering dynamics via these residuals is crucially facilitated by every scattering event being exclusively p-wave.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In conclusion, we have analysed the effect of multiple scattering on the particle distributions resulting from spin-polarized 40K collisions in an energy domain where every binary scattering event is exclusively p-wave.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to the notion that fermionic clouds of 40K would not have sufficient densities or inter-atomic interactions to readily observe scattering halos27, we not only directly and clearly image such halos but also observe 90° scattering as a clear indication of multiple scattering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data, along with a numerical simulation of the experiment, enable us to classify the collisions into three regions based on the prevalence and effect of multiple scattering on the angular and radial distributions (Supplementary Note 3 discusses the radial aspect).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Halos with a =90° component belong to a region of isotropically enhanced multiple particle scattering, whereas a region with axial enhancement constitutes a domain for multiple scattering void of this; thus, a =90° component is a sufficient, but not necessary, condition for multiple scattering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Even for the non-degenerate system studied here, the consequences of a simple, fundamental, microscopic rulethe Pauli exclusion principlewhen combined with high atom densities, lead to substantial modification of the macroscopic scattering halo from the binary collision expectation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The p-wave Wigner threshold defines a low-energy suppression region above which multiple scattering drives isotropically and axially enhanced modes, which are generally both present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of the modes of Fig 4b,c can, nevertheless, be favoured individually through the functional dependence of (E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our particular experimental realization using 40K, the isotropically enhanced region stands out because of the p-wave Wigner threshold reigning energetically just below it, whereas the axially enhanced region singles out due to a shape resonance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be stressed, however, that axially favoured multiple scattering via the process of Fig 4c is neither particular to 40K nor to the p-wave nature of the scattering resonance but should happen for a broad class of elastic scattering resonance features in the collision of atomic clouds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, such resonancesa paradigm of scattering physics2,10,28,29are known to exist in many systems in the realm of cold and ultracold collisions30,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the isotropically favoured mode we observe is a generic p-wave threshold phenomenon, which any system of indistinguishable fermions (with sufficiently short-range interactions2) should display.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the future, multiple scattering in two-component collisions, such as between clouds in distinguishable spin states, could transform the bipartite entanglement generated by binary collisions33 into multipartite entanglement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, the insights gained in the present work may indeed prove valuable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On a more immediate note, we point out that experiments colliding dense atomic clouds to infer scattering phase shifts from the angular scattering distributions should ideally take the significant effects of multiple scattering into account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis treatment via DSMC techniques employed in the work presented here may be a first step in this direction.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
