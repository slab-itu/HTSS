Reprogramming the immunological microenvironment through radiation and targeting Axl  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Increasing evidence suggests that ionizing radiation therapy (RT) in combination with checkpoint immunotherapy is highly effective in treating a subset of cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To better understand the limited responses to this combination we analysed the genetic, microenvironmental, and immune factors in tumours derived from a transgenic breast cancer model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified two tumours with similar growth characteristics but different RT responses primarily due to an antitumour immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of RT and checkpoint immunotherapy resulted in cures in the responsive but not the unresponsive tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Profiling the tumours revealed that the Axl receptor tyrosine kinase is overexpressed in the unresponsive tumours, and Axl knockout resulted in slower growth and increased radiosensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes were associated with a CD8+ T-cell response, which was improved in combination with checkpoint immunotherapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest a novel role for Axl in suppressing antigen presentation through MHCI, and enhancing cytokine release, which promotes a suppressive myeloid microenvironment.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In recent years, cancer immunotherapy has demonstrated clinical benefit of targeting immune checkpoints that modulate immune-mediated tumour clearance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CTLA-4 and PD-1 are two negative regulatory immune checkpoints that modulate the T-cell response to antigens presented through the T-cell receptor and blocking antibodies (Ab) to immune checkpoints have led to multiple FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approvals since 2011 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although single-agent immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy responses are limited to 1030% of patients, responses can be dramatic in patients with metastatic disease, leading to extended survival2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interest in combining radiation therapy (RT) with immune checkpoint therapy heightened after a case report by Postow et al.6 indicating that RT to one lesion triggered a systemic response in a melanoma patient who had previously progressed on the CTLA-4 Ab Ipilimumab.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar observations have been published for a small number of patients, and both clinical and preclinical data have validated potential benefits for the combination of RT with CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockade7,8,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is important to understand why many patients do not respond to checkpoint immunotherapy or its combination with RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Factors that may impact efficacy of the combination include limited antigen presentation by tumour cells or antigen-presenting cells, or a tumour-promoting microenvironment that suppresses antitumour immune responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many preclinical models evaluating RT and immunotherapy have focused on immunogenic model antigens, thus bypassing these factors12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is known that RT can enhance antigen presentation by increasing major histocompatibility complex class 1 (MHCI), but responses can be diminished through increased PD-L1 expression, thereby providing a rationale for combination therapy9,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there is a need to identify factors that suppress the immune response, rendering RT or its combination with immune checkpoint therapy ineffective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Stefani et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  recently identified the -catenin signalling pathway that suppresses licensing of dendritic cells through chemokines in melanoma, and we propose that this pathway may also suppress responses to radiation and combination checkpoint therapy16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, targeted therapies have been shown to have independent effects on the immunological compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, MET oncogene inhibition can promote tumour progression through inhibition of antitumour neutrophils, and PI3 kinase inhibitors can block myeloid suppressor cells, thus enhancing antitumour responses17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, little is known about the cellular and microenvironmental factors that influence the immune stimulatory effects of RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we sought to identify tumour cell derived factors that suppress immunological responses and limit the RT response and its combination with checkpoint immunotherapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although some tumours are known to be more radio-responsive than others, comparisons have limited utility due to genetic diversity between different tumour types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we evaluated immune responses after RT using clonal tumours derived from the same parental transgenic mouse model, which would allow comparisons between tumours in a syngeneic setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focused on two tumour clones with unique immune responses after RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These clones represent differences in responses often found in tumours from human patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When evaluating differences between the tumours, we identified Axl, a TAM (Tyro3/Axl/Mer) family receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), to be highly expressed in the radioresistant tumour but not in the responsive tumour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic deletion of Axl in the resistant tumours indicated that loss of Axl enhanced antigen presentation, altered cytokine secretion, and restored radiosensitivity that is largely immunologically mediated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Axl has gained much attention as it has been shown to be a key mediator of invasion and metastasis, is induced by HIF1- and hypoxia, and can promote drug resistance when overexpressed19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Hugo et al.22 recently reported that Axl is a key gene expressed in patients unresponsive to PD-1 immunotherapy, which provides timely clinical relevance of our novel findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe a previously unrecognized role for Axl in immune resistance that licenses an antitumour immune response when genetically targeted on the tumour cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This antitumour response sensitizes tumours to RT and probably additional anticancer therapies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Differential radiosensitivity is not due to classic factors', 'We developed a model of immunological heterogeneity in an isogenic background to study tumour-derived factors that influence immune mediated antitumour responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mammary tumour cell lines from the transgenic model of the mouse mammary tumour virus promoter driving the polyoma middle T antigen (MMTV-PyMT) in a C57Bl/6 background that efficiently form orthotopic tumours in vivo were used to evaluate radiobiological responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Py8119 clone was resistant to 12 and 20 Gy of radiation, whereas the Py117 clone was sensitive to these same doses (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both clones had similar radiosensitivity in cell culture as detected by clonogenic survival (Fig 1b), indicating that tumour cell autonomous factors are not responsible for the differences in radiosensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if extrinsic factors of vascularization and hypoxia influenced the radiation response, we harvested tumours 90 min after injection of the hypoxia marker, pimonidazole (PIMO).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were stained with a MECA-32 antibody and anti-PIMO antibody to evaluate microvessel density and hypoxia, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were no significant differences between the Py117 and Py8119 tumours (Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: PyMT

a greater degree by 10 Gy or IFN- compared with Py8119 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PD-L1 was similar in the untreated cells but had greater induction by radiation in Py8119 cells whereas IFN- stimulated Py117 cells to a greater extent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All error bars, mean and s.d.Full size image', 'The Py117 and Py8119 cells were then evaluated for MHCI and PD-L1 surface expression to test the hypothesis that tumour cell immune mediated factors could be responsible for the differences in the radiation response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although MHCI and PD-L1 were both enhanced by interferon gamma (IFN-), they have competing roles as MHCI promotes antigen-specific effector responses, while PD-L1 renders tumour cells resistant to T-cell effector functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Py117 cells had higher MHCI expression at baseline and after IFN- compared with Py8119 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, PD-L1 expression was low on both cell lines and was induced after radiation or IFN- treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IFN- mediated PD-L1 induction in both cell lines indicates that the adaptive immune resistance pathway is intact (Fig 1e and Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

harvested after 10 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunohistochemistry of CD3 revealed substantial numbers of T-cells in the untreated Py117 tumours that increased after RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, there were few T-cells with or without RT in the Py8119 tumours (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify T-cell infiltrates and leukocyte populations, tumours were dissociated and analysed by flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentage of CD45+ infiltrating leukocytes was similar in both untreated tumours, but increased from 27 to 78% 10 days after radiation in the Py117 tumours (Fig 2b,c).

after radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was almost a complete loss of immature myeloid cells often described as myeloid-derived suppressor cells or PMN-MDSCs with high GR1 expression (iMCs, CD45+CD11b+GR1hi)23 and lower proportion of macrophages (Macs, CD45+CD11b+F4/80+) that increased in Py117 tumours after radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, there was little change in these cell

the immune system, tumours were implanted into athymic nude mice that lack functional T-cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Py117 tumours grew faster in nude mice and were significantly less radiosensitive, confirming much of the sensitivity is due to a T-cell mediated immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Py8119 tumours were equally radioresistant whether in a wild-type or immunodeficient host (Fig 2h).

that MHCI was not significantly increased after radiation but was expressed at 10-fold greater levels in Py117 tumours than Py8119 tumours (Fig 2i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a robust antitumour immune response in Py117 tumours after radiation was supported by increased PD-L1 expression, suggesting adaptive immune resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unchanged levels of PD-L1 in Py8119 tumours after radiation support the lack of an interferon based immune response (Fig 2j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Combination therapy is effective in radiosensitive tumours', 'With the finding of increased CD8+ T-cells, MHCI expression, and induction of PD-L1 after radiation in Py117 tumours we hypothesized that the combination of RT and PD-1 blockade would be highly effective in Py117 tumours, and be of little benefit in the Py8119 tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were treated with 12 Gy of RT, Ab administration began on that day, and Ab was injected every 4 days for 24 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Appropriate controls were included in the experimental scheme (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibition of PD-1 alone had little effect on Py117 tumours, but the combination of anti-PD-1 and RT led to a greater antitumour response, with 25% of the mice having no detectable tumour 80 days after treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To enhance T-cell priming and/or blocking regulatory T-cells (Tregs), a single dose of CTLA-4 Ab was given 3 days before the first RT and anti-PD-1 treatment, which led to a complete response in 75% of Py117 tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of a single dose of CTLA-4 and its combination with radiation was similar to the PD-1 combination but the CTLA-4 and PD-1 combination resulted in more cures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Py8119 tumours did not respond to a single agent or combination therapies (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Py117 tumour curves were modelled using a repeated measures model revealing a significant difference between 12 Gy+isotype versus 12 Gy+PD-1 Ab and 12 Gy+PD-1 Ab+CTLA-4 Ab with P=0.002 and 0.0004, respectively (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antitumour response of combination treatment lead to increased survival of mice with Py117 tumours but not mice with Py8119 tumours (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Py117 mice were then treated with depleting antibodies for CD8+, CD4+ and NK cells to determine the relative importance of each cell type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that CD8+ depletion resulted in a diminished radiation response, depletion of NK cells had no effect, and depletion of CD4+ cells resulted in greater activity (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This confirms the importance of CD8+ effector T-cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite low number of CD4+ T-cells, if they are Tregs, they may blunt the antitumour response, explaining the added benefit of a single CTLA-4 dose24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: RT and immunotherapy leads to cures in the responsive Py117 tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Tumour growth curves treated with and without 12 Gy RT plus isotype control Ab, PD-1 Ab, a single dose of CTLA-4 Ab 3 days before 12 Gy, or CTLA-4 and PD-1 Ab combination revealed cures with RT and PD-1 Ab in Py117 tumours but no

abscopal responses12,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test if mice that had a complete response to combination therapy have lasting immunity, six out of the eight Py117 mice cured with 12 Gy+PD-1 Ab+CTLA-4 Ab were rechallenged in the contralateral fat pad.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was clear that all tumours were growing after 8 days, so PD-1 Ab was initiated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though there was no rejection of the tumours, initiating PD-1 Ab was sufficient to slow tumour growth compared with naive mice treated with PD-1 Ab alone (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test for abscopal responses against a contralateral tumour, two tumours were implanted, one tumour received RT and the other tumour was monitored for growth delay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were treated with 12 Gy or 20 Gy in a single fraction with PD-1 Ab

combination of 20 Gy+PD-1 Ab+3 days pre-CTLA-4 Ab treatment (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, Py117 tumours are responsive to combination therapy, but the response is not sufficient for complete eradication after rechallenge or for a complete response to an unirradiated contralateral tumour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that radiation plays a key role in licensing an immune response that can be enhanced with checkpoint blockade, but is not sufficient for a complete long-term antitumour immune response, which may be due to the absence of a dominant tumour antigen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radiation does not reverse T-cell infiltration in the Py8119 tumours, suggesting a tumour cell intrinsic mechanism of T-cell exclusion may play an important role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Many of the models which describe robust antitumour immune responses, efficient abscopal responses, and resistance to rechallenge, introduce model antigens such as HA, OVA, or SIY peptides12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not perform genetic manipulation of the cells, but we performed whole exome sequencing of the Py117 and Py8119 cells to ensure there was no dramatic difference in mutation burden.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Focusing on mutations unique to each cell line, we found that the Py117 cells contained 83 unique mutations resulting in stop-gain, frameshift or nonsynonymous variants whereas the Py8119 cells contained 66 (Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggests that differences in mutation burden between the two cell lines are unlikely to explain the difference in the immune response we observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kim et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  recently sequenced the poorly immunogenic syngeneic 4T1 breast cancer cell line that contained 47 mutations and the moderately immunogenic CT26 colorectal cancer cell line that contained 683 mutations and despite difference in mapped epitopes on MHCI there was little difference in the immune response generated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They found that pharmacological treatment with epigenetic modulators did not impact antigen presentation as much as they had effects on suppressive myeloid cells, despite a 10-fold difference in mutations between the models17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that the ten-fold difference in MHCI expression (Fig 2i) or other factors are more likely to impact the immune response than the mutational burden.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Axl impacts the immune response and tumour growth', 'To determine differences in signalling pathways between the tumour clones, we used reverse phase protein

correlate with gene expression in human cancer, we investigated the cancer genome atlas (TCGA)30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the breast cancer data set of 1,215 patients, Axl significantly correlates with many of the secreted factors identified on Luminex in addition to Axl associated genes Gas6 and Mer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We generated a gene signature (PyMT Signature) that correlated well with Axl expression (Pearson r value of 0.52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because Axl is important in EMT, we generated an EMT signature adapted from Byers et al.31 and found a significant relationship to Axl expression and our PyMT signature, suggesting that the factors secreted in the presence of Axl signalling are EMT related (Fig 4o).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then checked the PyMT signature against Axl expression in the PanCancer data set of 9,755 patients, subdivided the different disease sites, and evaluated the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia of 967 human cancer cell lines, and found significant correlations

if loss of Axl licenses an antitumour immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Py8119 Axl knockout clones were injected into nude mice and irradiated when tumours were 75125 mm3 to determine if immunodeficiency impacts radiation response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumours derived from both Axl Cr#1 and 2 knockout cells had reduced response to radiation when implanted in nude mice compared with wild-type mice, with the time to doubling volume of 13 days in nude mice versus 25 days in wild-type mice (Fig 5a and Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Py8119 Axl Cr#1 or pooled knockout tumours from untreated or irradiated groups were dissociated 10 days after treatment and compared with the parental Py8119 tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Axl knockout tumours had a greater proportion of CD45+ infiltrates compared with parental tumours without irradiation, which increased after radiation, supporting that loss of Axl results in a greater inflammatory phenotype (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Macrophage infiltration was greater in Axl knockout tumours at baseline given a higher proportion of CD45+ cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the proportion of macrophages in Axl knockout tumours significantly decreased after radiation compared with an increase in parental tumours (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus the loss of Axl results in decreased levels of macrophages in response to radiation and suggests an important role of Axl in the recruitment of macrophages after radiation, which supports the cytokine and chemokine signalling hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Adaptive immune

and MHCII, often considered myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs: CD45+CD11b+CD11c+MHCII+)32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found greater proportion of mDCs in the Axl knockout tumours (Fig 5e and Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, after radiation the mDCs are relatively decreased perhaps due to T-cell influx, diminished myeloid cell recruitment, and a robust Treg response that can suppress mDCs and promote M2-like macrophages33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to antigen presentation and mDC infiltrates there was also an increase in CD8+ T-cells without treatment compared with wild-type tumours, and T-cell infiltrates increased even more after radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fold increases in proportion of CD8+ cells in the Py8119 Axl Cr#1 and Py8119 pool compared with wild-type tumours were 4.9 and 20.6 without RT and 4.5 and 40.7 after RT (Fig 5f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CD8+ T-cells had a high proportion of the Ki-67 proliferation marker in all groups (Fig 5g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon stimulation, the CD8+ T-cells produced TNF- and IFN- supporting a functional phenotype rather than exhausted T-cell phenotype (Fig 5h, Supplementary Fig 9A,B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After initial regression, tumour progression occurred, suggesting that either exhaustion or adaptive immune resistance occurs despite an antitumour response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highest proportion of PD-1+ cells was observed in the wild-type untreated tumours and was lower after radiation and in Axl knockout tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data support that a significant proportion of T-cells may become functionally inactive upon engagement with the PD-L1 ligand (Supplementary Fig 10A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We next evaluated the impact of Axl on CD4+ T-cells to determine if these cells support a TH-1 antitumour phenotype or whether they augment the antitumour response through Treg recruitment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, CD4+ cells were at a low abundance in wild-type Py8119 tumours and further decreased 10 days after radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of CD4+ cells was initially higher then increased after radiation in the Axl Cr#1 tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison, CD4+ cells were high with or without radiation in the responsive pooled knockout tumours (Fig 5i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion of CD4+ cells that secrete TNF- and IFN- upon stimulation decreased after radiation in both tumours suggesting a decreased TH-1 response (Fig 5k and Supplementary Fig 9C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The abundance of FoxP3+ Treg cells increased in wild-type tumours after radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, there was no relative increase in Tregs in knockout tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tregs were abundant after radiation but more so in Axl Cr#1 compared with the pooled tumours given the increased CD4+ infiltrates (Fig 5l).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in FoxP3+ Tregs in the Axl knockout tumours suggests an adaptive immune resistance mechanism after radiation that is greater in the less responsive Axl Cr#1 tumours compared with the pooled Axl CRISPR tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism may explain why tumours recur rather than resolve despite the robust CD8+ T-cell response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evaluation of PD-L1 levels in CD45 tumour cells indicated the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway may also be a second mechanism of adaptive resistance (Fig 5m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall the pooled Axl CRISPR tumours had the slowest growth and were the most sensitive to radiation, suggesting a greater immune response than the single Axl Cr #1 clone, which could be explained by greater CD45+ cells, mDCs, CD8+ cells, CD4+ cells and relatively fewer Tregs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, improved overall antitumour T-cell response in the pooled Axl CRISPR tumours is also supported by an enhanced CD8+ to Treg ratio (Supplementary Fig 10B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Because of elevated Tregs and PD-L1 expression, we hypothesized that targeting Tregs with CTLA-4 and PD-L1 with a PD-1 blocking antibody would lead to a greater antitumour immune response after radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PD-1 antibody alone had little effect on tumour growth, and the combination of PD-1 Ab and 20 Gy was no better than radiation alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the combination of CTLA-4 Ab, PD-1 Ab, and radiation resulted in a greater response than 20 Gy and 20 Gy+PD-1 Ab (Fig 5n).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was little to no response to this combination therapy in wild-type Py8119 tumours (Supplementary Fig 11).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'With the expanding role of immune checkpoint therapies and their clinical impact, much attention has been focused on the immune system and its potential to eradicate cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there is a need to understand how tumours evade an immune response, often rendering checkpoint therapies ineffective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we used tumour clones from a transgenic mouse model to discover factors that contribute to immune resistance after radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 6 depicts our current understanding of how tumour Axl impacts the immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic deletion of Axl in the resistant tumour cells leads to an increase in MHCI and myeloid promoting cytokines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, these key molecular findings correlate with Axl expression in the TCGA breast cancer data set, and our molecular signature correlates with Axl and an EMT gene signature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this model system, loss of Axl allows the development of antitumour immune response where it was previously suppressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RT results in greater CD45+, mDC, CD8+ cells, but decreased macrophage infiltration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The immune response generated by loss of Axl leads to adaptive immune resistance through PD-L1 expression and Treg infiltration and tumours became sensitive to checkpoint immunotherapy when they were previously resistant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Loss of Axl enables licensing an antitumour immune response after RT.With high expression of Axl, there is low MHCI expression and tumour cells release myeloid promoting cytokines and chemokines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the loss of Axl, MHCI expression increases and cytokine signaling is diminished leading to an immune response with increased CD11c+ and MHCII+ antigen presenting cells (mDC) and T-cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The addition of RT licenses a robust antitumour immune response with decreased macrophages (Mac), increased proportion of antigen presenting cells, and a greater recruitment of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells.Full size image', 'Our findings provide complementary insight to Hugo et al., who showed that Axl and other EMT genes are correlated with resistance to PD-1 immunotherapy in melanoma patients22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that in some tumours anti-Axl therapy will enhance antitumour immune responses to overcome therapeutic resistance, while at the same time decrease invasion, and metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, RT or other conventional therapies may optimally combine with Axl inhibition in order generate an immune response that may otherwise be suppressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In recent years, Axl has been identified as a therapeutic target for its role in cancer progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple therapeutics directed against Axl are in development including kinase inhibitors, soluble receptors, and antibodies35,36,37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is growing recognition that TAM family RTKs, including Axl and Mer play important roles not only in invasion and metastasis and therapeutic resistance but also in the generation of an anti-inflammatory immunosuppressive environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Axl has suppressive effects through the inhibition of dendritic cell activation and along with Mer can decrease NK cell antitumour activity resulting in increased metastasis26,39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Mer is important in efferocytosis or clearance of dead cells by phagocytosis, suppression of macrophage cytokine responses, promoting an M2 macrophage phenotype, promoting B-cell tolerance, and T-cell mediated suppression of antigen-presenting cells21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'MHCI expression was one of the biggest differences between the PyMT tumour cell clones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even with IFN- stimulation, MHCI levels could not be restored in Py8119 cells to the levels observed in the Py117 cells (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that invading cells with an EMT phenotype like Py8119 need to escape immune surveillance, and kinases such as EGFR have been implicated in suppressing MHCI, we hypothesized that Axl may suppress MHCI29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CRISPR knockouts of Axl resulted in an increase in MHCI that could be induced to levels higher than IFN- stimulated parental cells (Fig 4k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effects impact both STAT1 translation and phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, Axl seems to play a role in regulating antigen presentation and studies are ongoing to better understand this observation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The role of NF-B activation and induction of inflammatory cytokines likely contributes to a tumour promoting microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both TNF- and IL-6 have been previously reported to be associated with TAM RTK signalling41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we found that both TNF- and IL-6 production by tumour cells is diminished upon Axl knockout.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we found a significant decrease in CSF1, CSF2, CSF3, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5 and IL1- in Axl knockout cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cytokines and chemokines each play a role in supporting myeloid cell infiltration in the tumour microenvironment and may explain high levels of macrophages that increase after radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Axl knockout tumours, the macrophages decreased after radiation despite an absolute increase in leukocytes before therapy (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, there was an increase in the number of myeloid dendritic cells that may prime T-cells and in irradiated tumours result in T-cell infiltration and immune dependent radiosensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This study reinforces the concept that immune checkpoint therapies are not effective unless an antitumour immune response is generated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Py117 tumour cells have high levels of MHCI expression and infiltrating T-cells at baseline, but established Py117 tumours are not responsive to PD-1 therapy alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This unresponsiveness may be due to the lack of dominant antigens to activate a robust T-cell response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that radiation serves as a catalyst to remove suppressive factors, release tumour antigens, and kill tumour cells enabling an adaptive immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this setting, anti-PD1 therapy provides additional benefit to block adaptive resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Axl expressing Py8119 tumours, we observed a limited initial immune response, which was not improved by radiation, thereby making combination with checkpoint therapy ineffective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, Axl directed therapy in Axl expressing tumours could reprogram resistant tumours when combined with radiation or chemotherapy and immunotherapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings have significant clinical implications, and it will be important to more completely elucidate the major effects of Axl inhibition in various contexts as we begin to propose anti-Axl therapy in combination with immunotherapies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
