A human genome-wide loss-of-function screen identifies effective chikungunya antiviral drugs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a globally spreading alphavirus against which there is no commercially available vaccine or therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use a genome-wide siRNA screen to identify 156 proviral and 41 antiviral host factors affecting CHIKV replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyse the cellular pathways in which human proviral genes are involved and identify druggable targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty-one small-molecule inhibitors, some of which are FDA approved, targeting six proviral factors or pathways, have high antiviral activity in vitro, with low toxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three identified inhibitors have prophylactic antiviral effects in mouse models of chikungunya infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two of them, the calmodulin inhibitor pimozide and the fatty acid synthesis inhibitor TOFA, have a therapeutic effect in vivo when combined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate the value of loss-of-function screening and pathway analysis for the rational identification of small molecules with therapeutic potential and pave the way for the development of new, host-directed, antiviral agents.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus that causes chikungunya fever, an acute infection characterized by arthralgia and frequently complicated by chronic joint symptoms1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Originating from Africa, CHIKV has spread to Asia, emerged in Southern Europe and reached the Americas1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite its severe health and economic impact, little is known about the cell biology of CHIKV infection and, as for all emerging infections, neither prophylactic nor therapeutic strategies are available on the market1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of available therapeutics and vaccines, there is an urgent need for antimicrobial agents to combat emerging infections2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As illustrated by the latest generation of drugs available to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected or hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients, deciphering that the biology of infections has proven successful for the development of highly effective drugs targeting different viral proteins3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this virus-directed strategy for drug discovery is time-consuming and not rapidly applicable to emerged pathogens2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the context of emerging infections, targeting host factors critical to infection is a promising approach5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, this host-directed antiviral design can be coupled with a drug repositioning strategy8 that could lead to the rapid identification of antiviral agents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated loss-of-function screens have enabled the identification of novel host factors and pathways that are either important for replication (proviral) or limit replication (antiviral) of different viruses9,10,11,12,13,14, and therefore represent potential target for therapeutic purposes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we perform a host genome-wide loss-of-function screen to identify the host factors implicated in CHIKV replication in human cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyse the cellular pathways and factors necessary for CHIKV infection and identify antiviral drugs with both in vitro and in vivo efficacy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Identification of CHIKV pro- and anti-viral factors', 'A host genome-wide loss-of-function screen was performed by reversely transfecting a genome-wide library of 60,000 short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting 17,000 annotated and 6,000 predicted genes into CHIKV-permissive human cells (HEK-293) for 3 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transfected cells were infected with a recombinant CHIKV-expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (CHIKV-GFP) in infected cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 18 h post infection (p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), cells were fixed and analysed by automatic fluorescence microscopy to quantify the ratio of infected to uninfected cells (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To reduce the number of false-positive hits, 7,561 non-expressed genes (Supplementary Fig 1a) and 3,274 toxic siRNAs (Supplementary Fig 1b,c) were excluded following transcriptional microarray and viability analyses, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNAi data were then analysed statistically using cellHTS2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15), and normalized using as positive control, an siRNA targeting the viral E1 gene, and as negative control AllStars siRNA (Supplementary Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Z-score transformation was applied to center and scale the plate-wise data (Supplementary Fig 1d), and the medians of resulting values of at least three independent replicates were used for redundant siRNA activity (RSA) analysis16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using RSA log P values of 2 as cutoff, we identified 279 proviral and 269 antiviral factors (Supplementary Fig 1e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To minimize off-target false positives, we further validated these hits with three additional siRNAs per gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of the calculated cSSMD (collective strictly standardized mean difference) values, which reflect effect strength and significance17 (Supplementary Fig 1g,h), we validated 156 proviral and 41 antiviral host factors (Fig 1b;

lincs.hms.harvard.edu/kinomescan28; www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl29), linking several drugs to their experimentally proven target proteins/genes, and identified 52 compounds interacting with the gene products of 14 distinct CHIKV proviral genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we generated three compounds against the CDC-like kinase 1 (CLK1), a proviral factor for CHIKV, IAV and WNV (Fig 1c;

'Despite major outbreaks over the past decade in Africa, the Indian Ocean and Asia and its recent emergence in the Americas, still little is known regarding CHIKV cell biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CHIKV infection in human is associated with acute and chronic symptoms, which pathophysiology remains incompletely understood, and there is no commercially available vaccine or drugs to tackle this global public health issue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To better characterize CHIKV interaction with human cells, we performed a genome-wide RNAi screen and report here on the identification of 156 cellular factors required for CHIKV life cycle and 46 antiviral factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, follow-up studies of those hits led to the identification of molecular pathways and cellular functions required for multiple steps of CHIKV life cycle, from viral entry, replication to viral release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, we demonstrated the critical role of the vacuolar ATPase in viral entry, and lipid biosynthesis in vRNA replication and release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our study represents a major advance in the field of CHIVK cell biology, and will pave the way for detailed mechanistic studies for each of the pro- and anti-CHIKV host factors we have identified, similarly to other loss-of-function screens published for other human viruses9,10,11,13,14,18,19,20,21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We followed an innovative translational approach by directly exploiting the results of the genome-wide loss-of-function screen to identify druggable pathways and corresponding antiviral compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, using a drug repositioning strategy, we identified a series of chemical inhibitors, directed against five druggable proviral hits, with in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity, either alone or in combination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since some of the drugs are already Food and Drug Administration approved for other diseases, this has the potential to considerably shorten the time-consuming and expensive hit-to-lead and lead-optimization phases, making our approach of particular interest for antiviral drug discovery in the field of emerging infectious diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, most of the identified proviral hits and all druggable targets we followed up are also critical for the replication of other very diverse viral species (including IAV, SINV, HIV-1 and HCV; see Fig 1c), highlighting the relevance of this strategy for the identification of broad-spectrum antiviral compounds and the potential for broadly active, host-directed, antiviral therapies (for example, pimozide that had an antiviral effect both for CHIKV and HSV-1 in Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This proof-of-concept study, based on a genome-wide loss-of-function screen, led to the identification of antiviral targets, pathways and compounds for which antiviral efficacy was proven in vitro, as well as in vivo, although it did not completely block viral replication in this setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional studies will be required for the selection of the best target inhibitors and lead optimization, before clinical development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since our approach led to the selection of a number of independent targets and pathways, and for each of those to the identification of multiple antiviral compounds, pre-clinical studies may exploit the potential synergistic effect of drug combination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this in mind, we showed that the combination of two drugs targeting independent cellular pathways (TOFA and pimozide) have an increased activity when combined in vitro as well as in vivo, where it exhibits a therapeutic antiviral effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we have demonstrated here the significance of host genome-wide loss-of-function screens for the rational identification of antiviral targets and their accelerated in vitro and in vivo validation for emerging pathogens, for which therapeutics and vaccines are critically missing1,2.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
