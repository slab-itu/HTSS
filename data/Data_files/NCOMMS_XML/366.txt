Innate olfactory preferences for flowers matching proboscis length ensure optimal energy gain in a hawkmoth  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cost efficient foraging is of especial importance for animals like hawkmoths or hummingbirds that are feeding on the wing, making their foraging energetically demanding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The economic decisions made by these animals have a strong influence on the plants they pollinate and floral volatiles are often guiding these decisions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that the hawkmoth Manduca sexta exhibits an innate preference for volatiles of those Nicotiana flowers, which match the length of the moths proboscis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This preference becomes apparent already at the initial inflight encounter, with the odour plume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Free-flight respiration analyses combined with nectar calorimetry revealed a significant caloric gain per invested flight energy only for preferredmatchingflowers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data therefore support Darwins initial hypothesis on the coevolution of flower length and moth proboscis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that this interaction is mediated by an adaptive and hardwired olfactory preference of the moth for flowers offering the highest net-energy reward.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'When foraging, pollinators have to balance their energy expenditure against their energy gain to maximize their reproductive success1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through these energetic economic decisions pollinators are not only influencing their own ecology, but do also alter their evolutionary relationship with the flowers they pollinate3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Darwin was among the first to propose a coevolution between pollinators and flowers, based on pollen transfer and increased nectar uptake4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of his initial observation that red clover flowers can only be pollinated by long-tongued bumblebees, Darwin suggested that the morphology of pollinators and flowers has coevolved   in the most perfect manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this initial hypothesis, it has been argued that pollinators would forage most effectively on flowers matching their morphological, as well as their sensory requirements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereby pollinators would drive the evolution of floral traits, leading to the development of pollination syndromes, where phylogenetically unrelated flowers match the preference of their pollinators in form, colour and scent4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, long-tongued hawkmoths and other pollinators with a specialized morphology have frequently been observed foraging on flowers not matching their morphological traits7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This generalization among pollinators raises the question how specialized pollination systems can evolve and persist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Floral volatiles have been argued to inform a pollinator about the potential energy gain to be obtained from a flower, allowing the pollinator to recognise a most rewarding flower among others and thereby facilitating a coevolution of plants and pollinators9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pollinators are faced with the dilemma that they cannot infer directly about the nectar amount of a certain flower10 and even less about the specific foraging costs associated with that flower.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, pollinators have to rely on indirect cues, such as odour or colour to predict the reward value of a flower.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hawkmoth Manduca sexta has been shown to innately prefer flowers emitting oxygenated aromatic compounds and certain terpenes11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, even among these flowers, corolla morphology and nectar energy varies greatly13 and studies correlating olfactory preferences of a pollinator and the reward value of different flowers are still scarce.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, flowers not emitting volatiles have been shown to receive less pollination service by M. sexta than those emitting volatiles, but lacking nectar, indicating that floral scent might indeed be a more important predictor for a nectar reward, than the reward itself14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In those cases, in which pollinators do strongly rely on volatiles to predict the energy gain of a flower, volatiles might indeed support the establishment and stabilization of specialized plantpollinator interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Floral volatiles typical for a hawkmoth pollination syndrome are often associated with a long slender shape of the corolla, seemingly fitting the proboscis of a hawkmoth15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, evidence that individual pollinators might be foraging more efficiently on flowers matching their proboscis length has rarely been presented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a competitive situation between several bee species, each one utilizes mainly those flowers matching its proboscis, suggesting that each bee species might have a foraging advantage on its matching flower16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, it has been shown that long-tongued individuals sometimes have longer handling times than short-tongued individuals, indicating that simply increasing the proboscis length might not be an evolutionary stable strategy2,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, a study on hummingbirds using artificial flowers found that birds foraging on matching flowers exhibited the shortest handling times18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these studies provide a good indication that foraging on matching flowers is energetically advantageous for a pollinator, a full energy balance on natural flowers might be required to draw further conclusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most studies on energy use have inferred energetic cost only indirectly, for example, by measuring foraging time19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the question whether the need to optimize foraging has indeed influenced the coevolution of matching proboscis and flowers, still remains controversial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On the basis of these previous findings, we aimed to test whether the hawkmoth M. sexta does exhibit a behavioural preference towards volatiles emitted by flowers matching its proboscis and whether this preference is indeed adaptive for the moth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'M.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sexta has a close association with different plant species of the Nicotiana genus, thereby offering an attractive system for the study of plantpollinator interactions21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We selected seven Nicotiana species that overlap in geographic range with the distribution of M. sexta and are known to be moth pollinated23,24,25, but vary in corolla lengths (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using wind tunnel assays and three-dimensional (3D) video tracking, we tested whether M. sexta has an innate preference for those flowers most closely matching its proboscis in length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we performed inflight respiration measurements and nectar calorimetry to investigate whether M. sexta does indeed forage most optimally on the one flower directly matching its proboscis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our results demonstrate that M. sexta exhibits an innate preference for Nicotiana flowers matching its proboscis, and only these flowers contribute significantly to the energy gain of the moth during foraging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through these results, we show how coadaptation mediated by floral volatiles can arise even in apparently generalized pollination systems, supporting Darwins hypothesis on the coevolution of pollinators and flowers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Corolla and proboscis lengths of seven Nicotiana species and the potential pollinator Manduca sexta.Grey boxes indicate corolla lengths that significantly differ

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Morphological match', 'The flowers of all tested Nicotiana species emit volatiles that can be detected by M. sexta and have previously been argued to be associated with moth pollination25,26 (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, while the corollas of six species are either significantly shorter (four species) or longer (two species) than the proboscis of M. sexta, only the corolla of Nicotiana alata matches the proboscis length (median N. alata=7.5 cm, n=21; median M. sexta=7.5 cm, n=42; corrected Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P=0.2568; Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Flight behaviour and olfactory preference', 'By characterizing the odour filament distribution within the plume (Fig 2a), using a photoionization device (200 A miniPID, Aurora) and by analysing the moths flight patterns with a custom-built 3D tracking system, we were able to estimate the odour encounter rate for each moth and flight (Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the odour encounter rate was highest in the core of the plume, only animals approaching the source on a direct path would experience a high encounter rate (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantification of odour encounters by a flying moth, hence, informs about the moths motivation and performance to focus on the core of the plume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we calculated the odour encounter rate per second of flight, most flowers differed significantly from the no-flower control (n=2227, KruskalWallis test, P less_than 0.0001), with the highest odour encounter rates being observed for N. alata (median=1.60%, n=27, corrected Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P less_than 0.001) and N. sylvestris (median=1.49%, n=27, corrected Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P less_than 0.001;

Fig 2c), while none of the other tested flower odours induced significantly increased upwind speed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the flower odour plumes of N. alata and N. sylvestris were the only ones that resulted in significantly more animals, reaching the source as compared with the control (N. alata: median=48.15%, n=27, corrected Fishers exact test, P=0.0043; N. sylvestris: median=37.04%, n=27, corrected Fishers exact test, P=0.044).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, we conclude that although most of the tested Nicotiana species triggered behavioural responses, only the odours of N. alata and to a lesser extent N. sylvestris, that is, those species whose corollae exhibit the best fit to the M. sexta proboscis, provoked behaviour that finally guided M. sexta moths to the source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Nectar amount and calorific value', 'Since not nectar volume, but energy content is of ultimate importance for the moth, we analysed the calorific value of the nectar in each tested species, using a gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GCMS)-based approach (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the nectar volume was related to the flower length (Supplementary Fig 2a), the nectar of longer flowers was often less concentrated (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the energy provided by flowers of different length was mostly similar and unrelated to flower length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, nectar energy on its own did not explain the moths foraging preference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Costbenefit analyses of Manduca sexta flower handling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Total amount of energy per flower provided by the different plant species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Letters indicate significant differences (P less_than 0.05, KruskalWallis test (P less_than 0.0001) followed by corrected Wilcoxon test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Black points indicate outliers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Schematic drawing of the set-up used for measuring foraging efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pictures show M. sexta foraging on N. alata and below N. obtusifolia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Gross-energy gain (J) of M. sexta when foraging on different flowers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Grey colour, P less_than 0.05 (one-sided Wilcoxon test against zero).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Energy balance (J) of M. sexta after foraging on different Nicotiana plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Light grey colour indicates flowers significantly greater than zero;

Supplementary Movie 2), which allowed us to measure the ambient CO2 increase during a single-flower approach in free flight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we calculated the net-energy gain (that is, balanced the gross-energy gain per flower visit against the rate of energy spent), the moths preference for N. alata turned out to be highly adaptive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only feeding on flowers from N. alata resulted in a significantly positive net-energy gain (median=28.27 J, n=10, corrected Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P=0.014; Fig 3d), indicating that N. alata would indeed be the optimal and most reliable foraging choice.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Pollinators and plants have coevolved with respect to certain traits such as morphology, colour or scent, leading to so-called pollination syndromes27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This coadaptation within multiple traits has often been argued to lead to a specific advantage for a suiting pollinator, driving the evolution of such specialist pollination systems6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we show that M. sexta has an innate olfactory preference for those flowers whose corolla length matches the length of the moths proboscis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When analysing foraging costs and gains of naive moths at flowers with differing corolla lengths, we found that only matching flowers significantly contributed to the moths net-energy gain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, this study provides new evidence on how specialized pollination systems can be stabilized through physiological advantages and how this specialization is strengthened by the sensory system of the animal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Floral volatiles are of particular importance to night-active pollinators such as M. sexta to effectively locate a suitable flower28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mechanisms by which pollinators use volatiles to find and assess flowers are still far less understood than the use of visual cues in plantpollinator interactions9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flying insects following an odour plume usually navigate, using the frequency of odour encounters (that is, the percentage of time during which the moth encounters the odour) rather than the odour concentration29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, odour filaments maintain the specific volatile composition emitted by the flower and would thereby allow the pollinator to recognise the identity of a flower also at a distance30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results highlight the importance of the odour encounter rate for M. sexta to navigate towards a flower in the absence of informative visual cues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we found that already the first encounter with the odour plume did enhance the upwind movement of the moth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extent of the upwind movement depended on the presented flower, indicating that flower-specific differences in the detection and/or valence of floral volatiles were already established at a distance of  greater than 1 m. These results are coherent with pheromone-induced flight behaviour, where a single encounter with the pheromone plume does already trigger a rapid upwind surge of a male moth31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M. sexta responds to the loss of an odour plume with casting flights, that is, zig-zag flights perpendicular to the wind direction33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correspondingly, we found a fast increase in upwind speed upon plume encounter, which was sustained for 2 s. Rapid turns and sudden increases in flight speed are complex behavioural tasks, which involve sensory feedback from the antenna34 and the wings35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the interaction between flight control and the olfactory system is not fully understood36, and further work might be needed to test the adaptations of M. sexta to track the complex odour plumes of flowers in flight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Similarly, to pheromone communication between male and female moths, a strong preference towards certain floral volatiles could lead to the development of a private channel between a pollinator and a flower, which would then further increase coadaptation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, such a development is often limited by phylogenetic constraints both on the evolution of olfactory genes in the moth, as well as on the development of genes regulating volatile production in the flower25,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the physiologically active compounds that were emitted by the flowers tested in our study (for example, benzyl alcohol or different aldoximes) derive from the amino acid phenylalanine26,38, indicating that many of these plants use similar pathways for the production of floral volatiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, all plants also emitted unique compounds, which should allow the moth to discriminate between the different plants (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Petunia axillaris another flower that has repeatedly been found to be pollinated by M. sexta does match the moths proboscis in a similar way as N. alata and also emits a similar volatile profile39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Petunia, the synthesis of these volatiles is mainly regulated by a single transcription factor41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correspondingly, recent work on the M. sexta olfactory genes has revealed several lineage specific expansions42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These genetic duplication events might have increased the sensitivity of sphingid moths towards specific floral volatiles, parallel to what has been suggested for the Drosophila genus43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus private channels between pollinators and plants could evolve based on the relatively small genetic changes, which would then allow a coadaptation to take place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given the high spatial and temporal variability of floral resources, it has been a longstanding question under which circumstances pollinators should have developed a behavioural preference, that is, become specialized8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most flowers in our study provided a similar amount of nectar energy, suggesting that the interaction between M. sexta and the different Nicotiana flowers was not determined by any flower-specific differences in nectar gain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore asked, whether flower-specific foraging costs might play a role in shaping the interaction between M. sexta and the different plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Foraging costs are particularly high for species feeding on the wing such as bats, hummingbirds and especially hawkmoths3,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to this, foraging costs may vary considerably depending on the nectar load or environmental conditions45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, direct energy measurements were needed to fully determine the impact of foraging costs, especially on the behaviour of hovering pollinators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, we found hovering costs ranging from 0.26 W g1 for matching flowers to 0.54 W g1 for too long or too short flowers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hovering costs at flowers with a corolla lengths similar to the length of the moths proboscis were not different from the reported energy expenditure of M. sexta during hovering without flower handling of 0.23 W g1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the energy consumption was significantly higher at the two shortest and the longest flowers (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While high costs at the longest flower, N. longiflora, might have resulted from the constant attempt to reach the nectar source, high costs at the too short flowers might arise because these flowers provided less stabilization for the inserted proboscis and thereby a less stable hovering flight, which has been shown to increase the energy consumption due to a constant need for acceleration and deceleration48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, it has to be taken into account that on the shorter flowers moths had a success rate of only 20%, which again increased foraging costs, as the moths were forced to invest several costly attempts before reaching the nectar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, the high hovering costs and the low success rates significantly influenced the foraging outcome of the moths when visiting the different flowers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we only tested naive hawkmoth during their first contact with a flower and as it has been shown that experience can improve flower handling performance49, one can assume that repeated contact even with the morphologically less fitting flowers could result in a positive energetic outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the preference for matching flowers should not prevent the moth from visiting other flowers, in case matching flowers are absent in a habitat or so far apart that travelling costs exceed flower handling costs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, in the absence of innately preferred flowers, M. sexta has been shown to flexibly widen its foraging scope, but also returns to its innately preferred flower when these become again available11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as experience could also improve the handling efficiency on matching flowers, one would assume that the relative order of the flower preference and the net energy gained from the different flowers would remain also for experienced moth or would even be further strengthened, as it has been shown that the learning rate of insect pollinators also depends on the gained energy reward50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As Waser et al.8 pointed out, a flower preference in pollinators becomes beneficial when travel costs are low compared with the costs for flower handling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Willmott and Ellington46,51 calculated the cost of forward flight for M. sexta at travelling speed (3 m s1) to be 0.13 W g1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, different from the bumblebee where the cost of hovering and forward flight have been found to be similar52, hawkmoths experience 24.2 times higher costs while handling a flower than while travelling between flowers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, the energetic characteristics of the interaction between M. sexta and the different Nicotiana species might indeed facilitate the development and maintenance of a strong receiver bias by Manduca towards volatiles of matching flowers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results suggest that the difference in net-energy gain of M. sexta obtained from different flowers has influenced the coevolution between Nicotiana flowers and one of their main pollinators, M. sexta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, energy gain might not always translate into direct fitness advantages, since other factors such as predation and mating success might further influence the life history of an animal53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aerially foraging bats, present a major predation threat to nectar-foraging moths during the search for suitable flowers54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A reduced searching time due to an increased detectability or valence of floral volatiles, such as we found in this study might therefore not only increase the energy gain, but could also reduce predation risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, nectar feeding in hawkmoths leads to a fivefold increase in female fecundity55 and it has even been suggested that carbon availability limits the life history of nectar-feeding lepidopteran to an even greater extent than nitrogen limitations56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, behavioural preference towards flowers with a higher energy gain could indeed lead to fitness differences for hawkmoth foraging on different flowers, even though such a preference might also render this pollination system more vulnerable to environmental and climatic changes57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In On the Origin of species Darwin wrote: Thus I can understand how a flower and a bee might slowly become, either simultaneously or one after the other, modified and adapted to each other in the most perfect manner, ., suggesting for the first time a coevolution of plants and pollinators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study shows that, although M. sexta might potentially forage on a variety of flowers, only those flowers matching the specific morphology of this pollinator contribute significantly to their energy gain during nectar foraging, supporting Darwins initial hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We furthermore demonstrate that this interaction of moth and flower is mediated by the olfactory preference of the moth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Potentially, this reciprocal interaction between morphological fit and chemical communication of flowers and moths was the precursor of the evolution of numerous specialist pollination systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results therefore stress the importance of chemical communication for pollination and conservation ecology.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

charcoal-filtered air at a rate of 0.9 l min1 into the chamber, while simultaneously pulling 0.7 l min1 out of the chamber and into the wind tunnel using teflon tubing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the wind tunnel, the plant headspace was released through a small opening (Ø 4 mm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slight overpressure was applied to exclude contamination with green leave volatiles from the plant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All flowers were placed at least 1 h before the start of the experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through this set-up, we aimed to present the most natural olfactory stimulus possible to maintain the exact blend composition and emission rate of every flower.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a previous study using a similar set-up has highlighted the importance of the blend composition over the blend strength58, we cannot conclude whether the here-described preference for N. alata is solely based on the blend composition or also on the emission rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, our data show a clear preference just based on the headspace of a single flower with its natural characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Odour plume reconstruction', 'Odour distribution and pulse dynamics in the wind tunnel were measured using a Photo-Ionization Detector (200 A miniPID, Aurora Scientific, Canada) and acetone as a tracer gas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the close vicinity of the source (020 cm), we measured the concentrations in steps of 5 cm along the x, y and z axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With greater distances from the source, we decreased the measuring steps to 20 cm along the three axes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At each point in space we recorded for 2 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data acquisition and storage was done via LabVIEW (National Instruments, USA), further analyses were performed using Matlab (Mathworks, USA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine odour filament frequency and the percentage of odour presents, we set a threshold of 1 eV and counted the number of signals above this threshold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of these values, we derived an odour intermittency value for every point in the wind tunnel by linear interpolation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', '3D tracking of moth flights', 'Hawkmoth inflight response to floral volatiles was analysed in a wind tunnel (plexiglass, 220 × 90 × 90 cm3) set at a constant airflow of 0.4 m s1, 0.5 lux light, 25 °C and 70% humidity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flight paths were captured using a custom-built tracking system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial images were recorded at 30 Hz by four cameras (Logitech), two positioned on top and two at the side of the wind tunnel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cameras were set to a resolution of 800 × 600 pixels, with each pixel having a size of 0.3 cm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The position of the moth was calculated at a rate of 10 Hz based on a background subtraction algorithm implemented in C. Further analyses of tracking data were performed using custom-written Matlab scripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual hawkmoths were kept in small mash tubes (diameter, 13 cm; height, 15 cm) in a pre-exposure chamber at the same temperature, humidity and light as in the wind tunnel for about 1 h before the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For testing, the opened mash tubes were inserted into the wind tunnel onto a take-off platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each moth was given 5 min to initiate wing fanning to be considered for analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After taking flight moths were recorded for 4 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All experiments were performed within the last 2 h of the moths scotophase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Flights within plume', 'By aligning the odour filament distribution within the plume with the 3D tracked flight patterns, we estimated the number of odour signal contacted for each moth and flight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the odour signal was highest in the core of the plume, only animals approaching the source on a direct path would have encountered a high number of odour encounters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantification of odour signal detected by a flying moth, hence, informed about the moths motivation and performance to focus on the core of the plume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Plume-induced upwind flights', 'We analysed the upwind speed of the moth shortly after the encounter of the odour plume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, the recorded flight tracks were combined with the reconstructed odour plume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first determined the first point at which a moth based on the reconstructed plume would have encountered the odour signal above 1 eV (noise threshold), during the 4 min of free flight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starting from this point, we calculated the mean upwind speed over the next 0.5 s, resulting in a single value for each animal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then compared the upwind speeds of moths tested with flower plumes with those of moths tested with an empty control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Nectar analyses and net-energy calculation', 'The energetic outcome of the moth foraging flight is affected by the moths energy invested and the energy gained through the nectar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we investigated the nectar energy provided by the flowers of different plant species, using a GCMS-based approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we collected nectar from flowers 59 h after the onset of anthesis, using 35 plants per species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do so, all flowers of one plant were collected and the corolla tube was cut at half length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then placed the flower part containing the nectaries upside down in a 50-ml reaction tube and centrifuged for 2 min at 1,000 r.p.m., which caused the nectar to accumulate at the bottom of the reaction tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, the fresh weight of the nectar was noted and the sample was freeze-dried overnight at 80 °C and 0.014 mbar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dried samples were weighted again and dissolved in a ratio of 1 mg:1 ml in pyridine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To increase the nectar volatility, we derivatized our samples by taking a 40 l aliquot of the sample and adding 50 l BSTFA (N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide) supplemented with 1% TMCS (trimethylchlorosilane).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, 10 l phenyl-ß-D-glucoside (Fisher Scientific) dissolved in 1 mg:1 ml pyridine was added as internal standard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample was then shaken for 90 min at 37 °C and 225 r.p.m., before being further diluted by adding 900 l pyridine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After derivatization, we injected 1 l of our sample into the GCMS (Agilent Technologies 7890 A, Aglient, USA), using a non-polar HP-5 column (30 m, 0.25 mm ID and 0.25-m film thickness; Agilent, USA) and operating in split-less mode, with the injection port set to 240 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Helium was used as a carrier gas (1.1 ml min1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The program started at an initial temperature of 60 °C for 3 min and was increased by 4 °C per min to a final temperature of 300 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify and quantify the outcome of the GCMS analyses, we used concentration curves of pure sugars (fructose, glucose and sucrose at 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 15 and 20 l).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then calculated the total energy per mg fresh mass of nectar for each plant species by summing the amount of all sugars multiplied with their specific energy content59, and by multiplying this value with the dry to fresh mass ratio of each species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated the mean total energy content for each species by taking the mean amount of nectar fresh mass from 20 additional flowers of each species and multiplied this value by the mean energy value of 1 mg of nectar from that species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The net energy of every foraging flight was derived by subtracting the energetic costs measured by respirometry from the mean energy content calculated for the specific flower species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For those flowers, where there was still nectar remaining in the flower after foraging, we subtracted the amount of the remaining nectar from the mean nectar value of the plant species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Respiration measurements', 'Energy expenditure by the pollinator is a crucial factor when addressing the outcome of a flowerpollinator interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore measured the CO2 exhaled by M. sexta during flower handling via a flow-through respirometry system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have often measured O2 in addition to CO2 to determine the substrate of the energy production by the animal60,61,62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as O2 is present at a high background concentration, it is often difficult to be measured accurately for small animals, such as M. sexta at a high temporal resolution63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since our study aimed to analyse energy expenditure at a relatively high temporal resolution, we have focus on measuring CO2 emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The system was set up within a fully controllable climate chamber and consisted of a sealed glass cylinder (49 × Ø34 cm) from which the air was pumped into a closed loop through a non-dispersive infrared analyser (Li-820, Licor GmbH, Germany) and back into the cylinder at a rate of 2 l min1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since temperature and humidity might influence the CO2 measurements, we simultaneously recorded these two parameters in the air stream ahead of the CO2 measurement (Sensirion SHT 75, Switzerland).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both sensors were connected to a PC outside the chamber and operated via LabVIEW (National Instruments, USA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before every experiment, we placed an intact flower inside the chamber in such a way that the flower remained attached to the plant, but no leaf tissue was enclosed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies on Datura wrigthii flowers have shown that these flowers emit considerable amounts of CO2 directly after opening, which then decline until 4 h after anthesis64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To exclude any influence of the flower respiration on our measurements, we used only flowers 59 h after anthesis and analysed the emissions of several single flowers of each species and a resting moth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these measurements did not show any CO2 emissions detectable by our system (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After setting up the system in this way, we allowed the open cylinder and the surrounding air to equilibrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As soon as the CO2 concentration within the chamber remained constant, a moth was placed into the cylinder and the front was resealed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The moth was then allowed 5 min to initiate wing fanning and 4 min to approach the flower.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During these periods the moth behaviour was constantly monitored using two cameras (Logitech C615, USA), at a resolution of 800 × 600 pixel and 30 frames per second (FPS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Videos were streamed and recorded using Noldus Media Recorder (Noldus, The Netherlands).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals, which did not start wing fanning within this time limits, were regarded as non-responders and excluded from the statistical analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In case the moth fed from the flower before the 4 min had elapsed, the measurement was stopped as soon as the moth had left the flower.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we recorded CO2 production of each moth during a single flower visit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Directly after the experiment the length of the moth proboscis was measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The length of the corolla tube for each flower was measured as the distance between corolla base and corolla disc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To check for the amount of remaining nectar, the base of the flower was carefully opened, the nectar was sucked out using a capillary and the amount of nectar was determined with an electronic balance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining nectar amount in visited flowers was compared with the amount of nectar in non-visited flowers (see above) to calculate the nectar uptake per visit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Volatile collection', 'For
