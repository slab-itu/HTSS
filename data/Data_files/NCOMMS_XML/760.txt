Germline BRCA2 mutations drive prostate cancers with distinct evolutionary trajectories  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Germline mutations in the BRCA2 tumour suppressor are associated with both an increased lifetime risk of developing prostate cancer (PCa) and increased risk of aggressive disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand this aggression, here we profile the genomes and methylomes of localized PCa from 14 carriers of deleterious germline BRCA2 mutations (BRCA2-mutant PCa).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that BRCA2-mutant PCa harbour increased genomic instability and a mutational profile that more closely resembles metastastic than localized disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BRCA2-mutant PCa shows genomic and epigenomic dysregulation of the MED12L/MED12 axis, which is frequently dysregulated in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This dysregulation is enriched in BRCA2-mutant PCa harbouring intraductal carcinoma (IDC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microdissection and sequencing of IDC and juxtaposed adjacent non-IDC invasive carcinoma in 10 patients demonstrates a common ancestor to both histopathologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall we show that localized castration-sensitive BRCA2-mutant tumours are uniquely aggressive, due to de novo aberration in genes usually associated with metastatic disease, justifying aggressive initial treatment.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Germline mutation of the BRCA2 tumour suppressor gene substantially increases the lifetime risk of developing prostate cancer (PCa)1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In BRCA2-mutation carriers, localized PCa rapidly progresses to metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with 5-year cancer-specific survival rates of 5060% (refs 1, 3, 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BRCA2-mutant tumours also exhibit an increased frequency of intraductal carcinoma (IDC), a pathology that predicts adverse outcome in both familial5 and sporadic PCa6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prostate tumours arising in men with an inactivating BRCA2 germline mutation (BRCA2-mutant PCa) are uniquely aggressive, associated with younger age of onset, have higher rates of lymph node and distant metastasis, and increased mortality relative to sporadic, non-BRCA2-mutant disease3,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Precision surgery or radiotherapy with curative intent inexplicably fails, with a rapid onset of incurable mCRPC in BRCA2-mutant PCa7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecular origins of the clinical aggressiveness of BRCA2-mutant PCa are unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding them may allow better treatment decision-making; for example, given their DNA repair deficient genotype, these cancers may be amenable to treatment with PARP inhibitors, based on genetic synthetic lethality10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, to identify the drivers of aggression in BRCA2-mutant PCa, we characterized genomic alterations in localized PCa tumour specimens from 14 men carrying a deleterious germline mutant BRCA2 allele using either whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and/or SNP array-based copy-number analyses (CNAs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that BRCA2-mutant PCa harbours a mutational profile more akin to that of mCRPC than localized sporadic PCa, and shows broad dysregulation of pathways associated with aggressive disease, including the MED12/MED12L axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Micro-dissection and subclonal reconstruction shows distinct evolutionary trajectories and identifies a common precursor to IDC and adjacent invasive carcinoma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data demonstrate the genomic correlates underlying aggressive BRCA2-mutant PCa.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'The Mutational Landscape of BRCA2-mutant PCa', 'To address intra-prostatic and intra-lesion heterogeneity, we microdissected regions of invasive carcinoma (IC) and of IDC from five tumours, resulting in 19 PCa specimens (Supplementary Table 1;

3/12 versus 68/200; P=0.74, proportion test; Supplementary Table 1), we identified several GRs in BRCA2-mutant PCa (Fig 2b; Supplementary Fig 7; Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most prominent of these was an inversion on 3p26.1 which occurred in 4/12 BRCA2-mutant specimens but 0/200 sporadic PCa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This region contains only four genes: a metabotropic glutamate receptor (GRM7) and two of its antisense RNAs, along with a mitochondrial ribosomal pseudogene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GRM7 inactivation suggests loss of negative regulation of NMDA signaling, as previously associated with the neuroendocrine disease (NED) phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NED commonly arises in late-stage disease and is associated with treatment resistance and poor prognosis18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was also a recurrent translocation on chromosome 7q in a non-genic region proximal to several solute carriers and membrane proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BRCA2-mutant PCa tumours showed similar chromothriptic character to sporadic disease (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Genomic rearrangements in BRCA2-mutant prostate cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Survey of genome-wide somatic genomic rearrangements (GRs) in BRCA2-mutant tumour PCa from seven patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CTXinter-chromosomal translocation;

Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other hypomethylated NED-related genes include modulators of WNT signaling (for example, AXIN, APC, ROCK1/2), IL6 signaling (for example, IL6ST, BMP6), and mTOR signaling (for example, TSC2), and many of these genes were also altered by CNAs (Supplementary Fig 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 3 UTR of the BRCA2 locus was hypomethylated in BRCA2-mutant PCa specimens (Supplementary Fig 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'MED12/MED12L amplification is associated with aggressive PCa', 'To identify other driver events that might help explain the aggressiveness of BRCA2-mutant PCa, we investigated the amplification of a region on chromosome 3q (Fig 1b) that is common in BRCA2-mutant PCa (11/18; 61%), but rare in sporadic PCa (55/809; 6.8% P=1.64 × 109, two-sided proportion test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The consensus amplicon of this locus contains the WNT/-catenin pathway modulator MED12L (Supplementary Data 4 and 7), as well as ATR, which encodes the DNA damage response factor ataxia telangiectasia-and-Rad3 related protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the MED12L homolog, MED12 (chromosome Xq13.1), is amplified in 44% of BRCA2-mutant PCa specimens (8/18) compared with only 0.1% of localized sporadic PCa (1/809, P=3.64 × 1044, two-sided proportion test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, MED12L (but not MED12) showed frequent amplification in distant metastases from metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients (7/37 cases, 19%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supporting this model, four loci within the MED12L gene were significantly hypomethylated in BRCA2-mutant versus sporadic PCa (Fig 3a; Supplementary Fig 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with their alteration at the copy-number and methylation levels in aggressive BRCA2-mutant PCa, MED12/MED12L are also amplified and/or show elevated RNA expression levels in 18% (26/150) of mCRPC6 but only 7.5% (25/333) of sporadic, localized PCa18 (P=0.002, proportion test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus MED12L/MED12 amplifications are preferentially mutated in aggressive diseaseboth BRCA2-driven primary tumours and sporadic mCRPC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: BRCA2-mutant PCa harbours multiple hallmarks of aggressive disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) CNA, SNV and methylation profiles for MED12L and MED12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients are sorted based on MED12L CNA, methylation and SNV status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -values are median dichotomized, as reflected by the background shading of each cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The covariate bar at the top of the graph indicates BRCA2 status and Gleason score.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Multiple genes show differential rates of CNAs in tumours harbouring IDC and those not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rows are genes, columns are samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Red indicates copy-number gain;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'While the clinical aggressiveness of germline BRCA2-mutant PCa remains unexplained, it is distinguished from sporadic PCa by a unique mutational profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BRCA2-mutant PCa is characterized by elevated global genomic instability, which is a well-established biomarker of biochemical failure and metastasis14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BRCA2-mutant PCa harboured specific mutations that are rarely, if ever, observed in sporadic localized PCa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These lead to dysregulation of pathways associated with NED and mCRPC, despite no exposure to androgen deprivation therapy in these patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations help rationalize our recent clinical association between disease outcome and the presence of IDC5, in part, with increased activation of the MED12L/MED12 axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, and counter to previous expectations, the IDC and IC components share a common precursor, and share a large portion of their mutational profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'MED12L/MED12 are components of the mediator complex and important regulators of the WNT pathway, which has been implicated in cell proliferation and neuroendocrine differentiation in PCa22,23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MED12L/MED12 axis is implicated in metastatic sporadic PCa, with MED12 nuclear overexpression common in mCRPC and localized recurrent PCa but not in localized primary PCa or benign prostate tissue26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MED12 SNVs, which occur in both localized and advanced PCa, are also implicated in prostate tumourigenesis27 and genome instability28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'BRCA2-mutant PCa are also enriched for aberrant DNA methylation in genes involved in neurogenesis and neuron development, consistent with recent reports that autonomic nerve development contributes to PCa progression and metastasis30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, our data strongly support a model in which germline BRCA2-mutant PCa are genotypically-similar to mCRPC and frequently harbour genomic aberrations in key pathways (for example, WNT/APC, IL6-BMP6, mTOR, ATR, MYCN, and so on; Supplementary Data 6; Fig 4c) leading to genomic instability, NED, castrate-resistance and metastasis, together explaining adverse patient prognosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains to be shown if the temporal change in genomic stability of BRCA2-mutation carrier PCa tumours is relevant to other solid tumours with specific pre-dispositions for aggressive disease such as those arising in breast, colon and pancreas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Collectively, our data provide genome-wide, nucleotide-resolution characterization of the molecular architecture of localized PCa and IDC that develops in men who harbour a mutant germline BRCA2 allele.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the population frequency is relatively low ( less_than 1%)31, the aggressive natural history of localized tumours may justify a change in clinical management to a more intensified approach including upfront use of PARP inhibitors10 and chemotherapy (for example, success of CHAARTED, STAMPEDE trials)32 in addition to ADT to block the rapid progression to mCRPC observed in these patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our provocative data, trials could also explore molecular inhibition of ATR, mTOR and GSK3A pathways in these patients, especially when IDC is present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results may ultimately help to elucidate multiple key pathways to therapeutically target men who are carriers of a BRCA2 mutation with PCa to increase rates of cure by preventing rapid progression to mCRPC.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

further filtered using a consolidated list of structural variants from 124 normal samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify genes affected by the genomic rearrangements, bed files were generated for each sample from deleted regions, and breakpoints from inversions, inter-chromosomal translocations, and tandem duplications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resultant bed files were examined with SnpEff (v3.5)46 and gene names were subsequently extracted for downstream analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recurrent translocation events were visualized using Circos (v0.67-4)47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Input files were bed files

five clonal clusters, on each sample and the CNA segments associated with the run having lowest S_Dbw validity index was used for further analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the predicted SNVs, a multi-sample PhyloWGS20 run was conducted on each subject to cluster the SNV frequencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PhyloWGS Witness was used to view and determine the consensus phylogenetic tree from the many sampled trees, summarizing the co-evolution of IDC and IC (Fig 4; Supplementary Data 5 and 6) from the normal sample (gray).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each tree, blue denotes IC while gold denotes IDC, and
