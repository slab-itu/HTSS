Unravelling the electrochemical double layer by direct probing of the solid/liquid interface  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The electrochemical double layer plays a critical role in electrochemical processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whilst there have been many theoretical models predicting structural and electrical organization of the electrochemical double layer, the experimental verification of these models has been challenging due to the limitations of available experimental techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The induced potential drop in the electrolyte has never been directly observed and verified experimentally, to the best of our knowledge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we report the direct probing of the potential drop as well as the potential of zero charge by means of ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy performed under polarization conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By analyzing the spectra of the solvent (water) and a spectator neutral molecule with numerical simulations of the electric field, we discern the shape of the electrochemical double layer profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we determine how the electrochemical double layer changes as a function of both the electrolyte concentration and applied potential.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The electrochemical double layer (EDL), originally conceived by Hermann von Helmholtz in the nineteenth century, constitutes a key concept in modern electrochemistry of electrified interfaces1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Researchers4,5 have produced many refinements of Helmholtzs early theoretical work, eventually leading to the well-known GouyChapman6 (GC) and GouyChapmanStern6 (GCS) modelling of the EDL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent studies based on electrochemical measurements have been performed by Gurney7, Grahame4,8, Parsons5,8, Bockris9 and most recently by Trasatti10,11 and Conway12, with the aim of addressing common limitations of the three aforementioned models, such as the lack of detailed knowledge of the specific interactions between the ionic species in the bulk solution as well as within the electrified layers near the metal electrode, which are considered purely Coulombic in the GC or GCS models13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The properties of the interface formed by a charged electrode surface immersed in an electrolyte governs the charge transfer processes through the interface itself, thus influencing the electrochemical responses of the electrode/electrolyte system14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These concepts and models together serve as the foundation of modern electrochemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comprehensive investigation of the EDL structure and associated charge transfer processes constitutes an essential step towards understanding and improvement of a variety of electrochemical processes, such as electrocatalysis, electrochemical energy storage, ion transport through biological membranes and corrosion4,5,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Various electrochemical approaches5,8,17,18 have been utilized to experimentally investigate EDL properties, such as the study of the electrocapillarity4 and the influence of surface adsorbates19 with different binding strengths5,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Investigations of the EDL have re-emerged on account of new spectroscopy techniques such as optical-vibrational spectroscopies based on infrared absorption20 and Raman scattering21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the pioneering studies of Kolb, Wagner and Ross on immersed electrodes, several groups have employed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements not under polarization conditions, showing that it is possible to study the specific adsorption of ions at the Inner Helmholtz Plane (IHP)23,24,25,26,27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, Siretanu et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  investigated the ionic structure within the Stern layer by studying the corresponding force field with scanning probe microscopies29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synchrotron X-ray characterization techniques have also been utilized27,28,29,30,31,32: Bedzyk et al.30 used X-ray standing waves (SW) to show that the cation distribution in the liquid phase obeys the GCS model, while Velasco-Velez et al.31, using X-ray absorption spectroscopy, reported on the strength of the hydrogen bonds in water molecules at the IHP, highlighting significant differences compared with bulk water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'However, despite these initial studies on the EDL structure18,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30, the information of the electrical potential profile at the solid/liquid-electrified interface, particularly as a function of the applied potential, was still elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this work, we report the direct probing of the potential drop (PD) as well as the potential of zero charge (PZC) by means of ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) performed under polarization conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By analyzing the spectra of the solvent (water) and a spectator neutral molecule with numerical simulations of the electric field, we discern the shape of the EDL profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we determine how the EDL changes as a function of both the electrolyte concentration and applied potential.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

consequently, the corresponding escaping O 1s or N 1s photoelectrons are characterized by different apparent binding energies (referenced to the Fermi level of the WE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final result of the convolution of the single shifted O 1s and/or N 1s core-level photoelectron peaks (Fig 1c) leads to the experimentally observed spectral broadening (an increase in the FWHM), which becomes broader the larger the electrode potential for a given EDL thickness (that is, the higher the PD within the double layer, compared with the PZC conditions, Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The intensity-normalized N 1s and O 1s core-level peaks are shown in Fig 2a,b (with an applied vertical offset for clarity) as a function of the applied potential, from 400 to +600 mV within the double-layer capacitance region (see Supplementary Fig 5 for all spectra).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The N 1s raw spectra possess two different identifiable components: the low BE feature centred at 399.7 eV is attributed to pyrazine molecules at the electrode/electrolyte interface (which we will refer to as pyrazine at the electrode surface, PyESF), while the high BE component corresponds to the solvated pyrazine molecules present in the liquid, hereafter labelled as liquid phase pyrazine, LPPy N 1s (further details regarding the PyESF characterization are reported in Supplementary Figs 69 and Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the O 1s spectra were de-convoluted by using three different chemically shifted components attributed to gas phase water (GPW), liquid phase water (LPW) and adsorbed hydroxyls34,36 at the solid/liquid interface (from highest to lowest BE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these data, we can observe that the PyESF and the adsorbed hydroxyls do not shift in BE with the applied potential, meaning that the corresponding species are electrically connected to the grounded gold WE (see the energy diagram reported in Supplementary Fig 4 for further details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, as the potential is applied with respect to the open circuit potential (OCP), the LPPy N 1s and LPW O 1s peak positions shift in BE and undergo a FWHM broadening, as schematically reported in Fig 1b,c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed spectral broadening and BE shifts for the components within the liquid phase (that is, within the EDL) constitute the essential results of this work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Electrochemical double layer probing from the spectral broadening of pyrazine and water core levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) Representative intensity-normalized N 1s and O 1s core-level peaks, respectively, acquired at different applied potentials to the working electrode (WE) in a KOH 0.4 mM aqueous solution (dEDL=15.2 nm) containing 1.0 M pyrazine (OCP, open circuit potential, APXPS, ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, LPPy, liquid phase pyrazine, GPW, gas phase water, LPW, liquid phase water, and BG, background) and (c) double-layer capacitance (obtained from electrochemical characterization) as a function of the applied potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The double layer capacitance trend has been fitted within a range of 400 mV centred on the PZC, by using both GouyChapman (GC) and GouyChapmanStern (GCS) models6,18;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Future improvements of the experimental set-up will enhance spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio, which will improve our ability to discern the fine features of the PD functional dependency carried by the core-level spectral broadening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulations of the PD profiles, similarly to what has been experimentally performed, have been generated as a function of the applied potential for different electrolyte concentrations (that is, for different EDL thicknesses).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparison between the experimental and simulated FWHM provides the ability to directly access and visualize the PD within the EDL that leads to the observed spectral broadening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting simulated exponential potential profiles are reported in Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This possibility paves the way toward a new type of EDL (and its inherent properties such as the PD) investigations under real electrochemical and photoelectrochemical reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, for KOH concentrations higher than those shown in Fig 4, the de-convolution of O 1s spectra from LPW and N 1s spectra from the pyrazine probe molecules showed that the contribution from the molecules within the bulk electrolyte dominates, leading to a rigid spectral shift and only to a weaker broadening of the core levels as a function of the applied potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A specific example for a KOH concentration of 80 mM is reported in Supplementary Fig 12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is consistent with a thinner EDL that can be expected from an increased ionic strength of the supporting electrolyte.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is not enough signal from the molecules in the EDL to be resolved from the total O 1s and N 1s photoelectron intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Therefore, there is a concentration limit for this technique to discern the electrical potential profile within the EDL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The schematization reported in Supplementary Fig 13 illustrates this limitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, future experimental and instrumental modifications previously mentioned (that is, SW-APXPS) will allow us to overcome these current limitations42,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we have experimentally probed the potential distribution in the EDL at an electrified solid/liquid interface by means of APXPS performed under polarization conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method has general applicability and is not restricted to one specific class of solids or liquids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have shown that the FWHM trend of the core-level peaks of electrolyte as a function of the applied potential is strongly correlated to the double-layer capacitance trend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have also demonstrated that the PZC obtained from spectroscopy is in line with the electrochemically-derived values, providing a synergistic correlation between electrochemistry and photoelectron spectroscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exploiting the element-specificity and potential-sensitivity of photoelectron spectroscopy, we have directly probed the PD within the EDL by studying the broadening of the core-level photoelectron spectra of the elements belonging to the liquid phase, as a function of the applied potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, by using numerical simulations, we have shown that our method provides the ability to identify the functional dependency that describes the PD within the double layer, providing a spectroscopic support for the current electrified interface theories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A schematic representation of our combined experimental and simulation-based approach is reported in Supplementary Fig 14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coupling between our APXPS performed under polarization conditions with the use of a solvent- or an independent probe-related core level, sets a paradigm for probing the properties of the EDL under realistic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current results may open the door for studying the EDL dynamics in more complicated systems, such as redox reactions at photoactive semiconductor interfaces and in non-aqueous electrolytes, to name a few (see Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The knowledge gained from this method may thus impact a wide range of scientific fields, including electrochemical conversion and storage of energy, environmental sciences and biology14,15,16.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
