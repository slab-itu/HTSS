Controllable conversion of quasi-freestanding polymer chains to graphene nanoribbons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In the bottom-up synthesis of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) from self-assembled linear polymer intermediates, surface-assisted cyclodehydrogenations usually take place on catalytic metal surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate the formation of GNRs from quasi-freestanding polymers assisted by hole injections from a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While catalytic cyclodehydrogenations typically occur in a domino-like conversion process during the thermal annealing, the hole-injection-assisted reactions happen at selective molecular sites controlled by the STM tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The charge injections lower the cyclodehydrogenation barrier in the catalyst-free formation of graphitic lattices, and the orbital symmetry conservation rules favour hole rather than electron injections for the GNR formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The created polymerGNR intraribbon heterostructures have a type-I energy level alignment and strongly localized interfacial states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding points to a new route towards controllable synthesis of freestanding graphitic layers, facilitating the design of on-surface reactions for GNR-based structures.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In the pursuit of atomically precise and bottom-up fabrication of graphene-based electronics1,2,3, graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with a variety of widths4,5, edge structures6,7 and heterojunctions8,9 have been synthesized with self-assembled molecular precursors on different catalytic metal substrates, such as Au (refs 10, 11, 12), Ag (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13) and Cu (refs 14, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surface-assisted cyclodehydrogenations16,17,18, a key step in GNR formation, appear to take place only on the catalytic metal substrates19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Efforts of growing GNRs from molecular precursors directly on an insulating TiO2 substrate only succeeded in deriving polymerization but not the cyclodehydrogenation20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The metallic substrates are found to be essential not only for the GNR growth process, but also for the electronic behaviours of synthesized GNRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orbital hybridization between substrate and edge atoms can largely affect the predicted edge states and magnetism of GNRs21,22, and the dielectric screening interaction from the substrate can greatly modify the quasiparticle bandgaps of GNRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the armchair GNRs with a width of seven carbon (7-aGNRs) on Au(111) are reported to have an energy gap ranging from 1.8 to 2.8 eV (refs 4, 10, 13, 23, 24, 25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values are much smaller than expected from electronic structure calculations within many-body perturbation theory in the GW approximation, which predicts a gap of 3.7 eV (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Controlling the substrate interaction is thus considered a prerequisite for studying the on-surface synthesis process and accessing the intrinsic electronic structure of GNRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we focus on the controllable conversion of quasi-freestanding polymers to form atomically precise armchair graphene nanoribbons, 7-aGNRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To decouple their electronic structure from the metal substrate, we grow the polymers atop first-layer (1st-layer) GNRs that are in direct contact with the metal substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The polymers are isolated from the metal substrate by the 1st-layer GNRs, leading to their quasi-freestanding nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), we find that electronic decoupling of the polymer can greatly slow down the cyclodehydrogenation and an STM tip can be used to inject charges at the selected molecular sites to trigger the reaction and thus create intraribbon heterojunctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on nudged elastic band (NEB) simulations, we reveal a hole-assisted cyclodehydrogenation reaction path that points to an avenue towards the controllable on-surface synthesis of freestanding GNRs and precise intraribbon heterojunctions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

1st-layer polymer directly adsorbed on Au (3.9 Å, Supplementary Fig 3), and so is the 2nd-layer GNR (2.9 Å) as compared to the 1st-layer GNR (2.1 Å).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2b shows the tunnelling

acquired at Vs=2 V is very close to the HOCOp and thus it reflects the intrinsic electronic structures of the polymer chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the 1st-layer GNR (location 4), the HOCOg and LUCOg are located at Vs=0.9 and +1.4 V, respectively, with a bandgap about 2.3 eV, consistent with previous reports24,25,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2nd-layer GNR (location 2) shows a larger gap of about 2.6 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is found that the gap in the 2nd-layer GNR is generally about 0.10.4 eV greater than that in the 1st-layer GNR, where the gap difference between the two layers is comparable with previously reported difference (0.5 eV) between GNR on an insulator NaCl (with a bandgap 2.8 eV)29 and on Au (with a bandgap 2.3 eV)24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the dI/dV spectra from both the 2nd-layer polymer and the 2nd-layer GNR show cleaner gaps with lower densities of in-gap states than the 1st-layer GNR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus the 1st-layer GNR, similar to graphene30, can largely isolate the 2nd layers from the Au(111) substrate and render the 2nd-layer polymers quasi-freestanding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Domino-like thermally induced cyclodehydrogenation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

cyclodehydrogenation reactions in the 2nd-layer polymers, which facilitates the control and evaluation of the cyclodehydrogenation process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After annealing at 670 K, polymers only exist on the 2nd layer atop the GNRs, while the 1st-layer polymers have all been converted into GNRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full conversion of the 2nd-layer GNRs can occur when they have direct local contacts with the Au substrate, such as location 3 in Fig 2a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dI/dV curve measured at location 3 (Fig 2b) is similar to that of the 1st-layer GNRs (location 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without the direct Au contact, only partially converted 2nd-layer polymers are observed with GNR tails (Fig 2c, more examples in Supplementary Fig 4), which may be attributed to a charge transfer effect promoted by work function mismatch between the polymer, GNR and the Au substrate (as explained in the Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GNR tail has the characteristic height (2.9 Å) and tunnelling spectra of the 2nd-layer GNR (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the GNR tail shows enhanced DOS at the edges compared to the 1st-layer GNR, similarly to the GNR on an insulating substrate29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GNR segment always appears at an end of the polymer chain, indicating that the cyclodehydrogenation prefers to start at the polymer end and then propagate along the polymer chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a domino-like cyclodehydrogenation process can drastically lower the reaction energy barrier31 during thermal annealing as illustrated in Fig 2d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is in contrast with the previously reported one-side-domino conversions for polymers directly adsorbed on Au(111) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32; Supplementary Fig 6).

47, corresponding to the LUCOg of the GNR in curves 810 (marked with red dashed line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus at locations 47 near the end of the polymer chain, the polymer has been converted into GNR during the dI/dV measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, a GNR tail becomes discernable after the dI/dV measurements as shown in Fig 3c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The local conversion of the polymer creates a

Obvious drops of the current from terrace 1 to terrace 3 with a non-zero smaller value are observed in all three curves, indicating the occurrence of the cyclodehydrogenation event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional terrace, terrace 2, is seen in one of the curves (red), suggesting an additional state in the cyclodehydrogenation process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the polymer is slightly taller than the GNR,

three-state reaction path for the cyclodehydrogenations rationalized by NEB simulations34, in correspondence with the observed three terraces in the Itt curves (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides the three main reaction states, multiple transition states (TS) and intermediate states (int) are identified based on the NEB simulations in vacuum (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the initial state 1, the neighbouring anthrylene units first rotate around the single CC bond, allowing two benzyne groups (C6H4) on the same side to form a single CC bond giving int1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This step is followed by a 1,3-sigmatropic H migration to an edge C atom giving int2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, the elimination of a H2 molecule leads to the rearomatization of the system giving state 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, the benzyne groups on the other side repeat the process to form a graphitic lattice in state 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 4d shows the corresponding reaction energy diagrams for the neutral and two-electron- and two-hole-assisted bianthrylenes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared to the neutral case, the total barrier from state 1 to state 2 can be reduced from 4.5 to 2.8 eV by injecting two holes, whereas the barrier remains essentially the same for the electron injection case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the key step of the CC bond formation (state 1 to int1), hole injections reduce the barrier from 2.5 to 1.2 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although electron injections can also reduce this barrier, the corresponding int1 would not be stable because the transition from int1 back to state 1 has a zero-energy barrier, similarly to the neutral case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, hole injections can significantly facilitate cyclodehydrogenations as compared to neutral and electron injection processes, as observed in the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the subsequent reaction from state 2 to state 3, the unphysical neutral and electron injection processes are excluded from the discussion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the hole injection case, the highest barrier is comparable to that from state 1 to state 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, state 3 is stabilized with respect to state 2 by about 0.7 eV, even more than that between state 2 and state 1 (0.3 eV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that state 3 can be thermodynamically favoured over state 2, implying that once state 2 is formed, it may be converted to state 3 with ease, showing a cooperative cyclodehydrogenation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, state 2 corresponding to the terrace 2 in the Itt curve is rarely detected when state 3 is observed during the tip treatment (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also calculated the single-charge injection cases and found that the two-hole injection mechanism is more favourable (Supplementary Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The hole-assisted cyclodehydrogenations are believed to be associated with inelastic tunnelling at the polymer HOCOp resonance state35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 4e shows the simulated charge density distribution of LUCOp and HOCOp in a polymer, where the different signs as represented by blue and red colours are adopted from the orbital wavefunctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the WoodwardHoffmann rules for orbital symmetry conservation in pericyclic reactions36,37, the formation of a CC bond through electron injections into the LUCOp state is symmetry forbidden (red arrows) due to the opposite phase relationship of wavefunctions, while it is symmetry allowed (green arrows) through hole injections into the HOCOp state as the involved wavefunctions have the same phase relationship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a difference in orbital symmetries may be responsible for the different reaction barriers shown in Fig 4d, especially between state 1 and int1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the hole-assisted cyclodehydrogenations are similar to the well-known Scholl reaction38 (Supplementary Fig 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In organic chemistry, oxidants such as FeCl3 are often used to extract electrons (inject holes) in the Scholl reaction39,40, with which GNRs have been synthesized in liquid41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of controlling the cyclodehydrogenations at selected molecular sites with an STM tip, even without a catalytic metal substrate or oxidants, provides an opportunity to synthesize freestanding GNRs and create novel

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have established how the bottom-up synthesis of a graphene nanoribbon can be controlled by charge injections from an STM tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From our experiments and first-principles calculations, it was found that the hole injections from an STM tip can trigger a cooperative domino-like cyclodehydrogenation even when the polymers are quasi-freestanding with suppressed substrate effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hole injections greatly reduce the energy barrier in the key step of the CC bond formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The H atoms migrate to the edge and dissociate into the vacuum as H2 molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cylodehydrogenation process can be traced back to the classical WoodwardHoffmann rules, showing that the formation of a CC bond is symmetry allowed with hole injections but is instead symmetry forbidden with electron injections due to the phase mismatch of wavefunctions, corroborating the experimental observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the STM tip treatment can be performed at selective molecular sites without involving a catalytic effect from the metal substrate, the results point to a new way for bottom-up and controllable synthesis of freestanding GNRs and heterojunctions, which is critical for practical GNR-based nanodevices.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

They dehalogenate upon adsorption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample is subsequently annealed at 470 and 670 K for 30 min, respectively, to induce colligation/polymerization (at 470 K) and cyclodehydrogenation/graphitization (at 670 K), resulting in polyanthrylene chains on 7-aGNRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The STM characterizations are performed with a homemade variable temperature system at 105 K under ultrahigh vacuum conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A cleaned commercial PtIr tip is used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All STM images are acquired in a constant-current mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dI/dV spectra are recorded using a lock-in amplifier with a sinusoidal modulation (f=1,000 Hz, Vmod=20 mV) by turning off the feedback loop-gain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The polarity of the applied voltage refers to the sample bias with respect to the tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Calculation methods', 'The ab initio calculations are performed with the Quantum Espresso code43, using ultrasoft pseudopotentials44 and PerdewBurkeErnzerhof (PBE) exchange correlation functional45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PBE0 hybrid exchange correlation functional is used to correct the band gap46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The energy cutoff for the plane wave basis of KohnSham wavefunctions is 24 Ry, and that for the charge density is 200 Ry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structures are relaxed until forces on atoms reach a threshold of 0.026 eV Å1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The adsorption energies of the polymer and the GNR on the metal substrate are calculated by using a non-local van der Waals correction47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The charge density distributions are acquired as the square of the wavefunctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The STM images are simulated based on Tersoffs method48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The energy barriers of the reaction are calculated using the NEB method34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The forces on images are relaxed until they reach a threshold of 0.1 eV Å1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'The data that support the findings of this study, including the Supplementary Information, are available from the corresponding author A.-P.L.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  on request.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
