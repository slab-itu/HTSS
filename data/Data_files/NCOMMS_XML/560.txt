The RNA-binding protein vigilin regulates VLDL secretion through modulation of Apob mRNA translation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The liver is essential for the synthesis of plasma proteins and integration of lipid metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the role of transcriptional networks in these processes is increasingly understood, less is known about post-transcriptional control of gene expression by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that the RBP vigilin is upregulated in livers of obese mice and in patients with fatty liver disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using in vivo, biochemical and genomic approaches, we demonstrate that vigilin controls very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion through the modulation of apolipoproteinB/Apob mRNA translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crosslinking studies reveal that vigilin binds to CU-rich regions in the mRNA coding sequence of Apob and other proatherogenic secreted proteins, including apolipoproteinC-III/Apoc3 and fibronectin/Fn1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, hepatic vigilin knockdown decreases VLDL/low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels and formation of atherosclerotic plaques in Ldlr/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies uncover a role for vigilin as a key regulator of hepatic Apob translation and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of inhibiting vigilin for cardiovascular diseases.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Vigilin (official gene symbol Hdlpb) is the largest RNA-binding protein of the KH domain family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is conserved from human to yeast and has a unique structure of 14 imperfect tandem repeats of 70 amino acids that contain KH domains, sequence motifs that are usually found in RNA-binding proteins1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some KH domains in vigilin have been shown to have nucleotide-binding activities4, and vigilin has been found to be associated with cytoplasmic mRNA5 and tRNA6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vigilin has been implicated in diverse biological processes such as sterol metabolism5,7,8,9,10, carcinogenesis11,12, control of translation13,14, formation of heterochromatin15,16,17, nuclear export of tRNA18, cytoplasmic transport of RNA19 and metabolism of specific mRNAs7,20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, very few mRNA targets and no precise RNA recognition element (RRE) have been reported in mammals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, its function in mice and human has not been addressed in a systematic and unbiased manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, through unbiased approaches using photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP), RNA sequencing, as well as label-free quantification by mass spectrometry, we identify vigilin as a translational regulator of a subset of genes encoding for secreted liver proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report that vigilin binds to CU-rich regions in the mRNA coding sequence of Apob and other proatherogenic secreted proteins, including apolipoproteinC-III/Apoc3 and fibronectin/Fn1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of vigilin also correlated with lipid accumulation in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) as well as livers of insulin-resistant obese mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, we show that silencing of vigilin in the liver reduces atherosclerotic plaque formation in Ldlr/ mice, suggesting a critical role of vigilin in hepatic metabolism and a possible therapeutic approach for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Vigilin regulates hepatic lipid metabolism', 'Vigilin is ubiquitously expressed with highest levels in organs with preferential endodermal cell origin, including the liver (Fig 1a), and is predominantly localized to the cytoplasm in hepatocytes (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess its relevance in metabolic disorders, we investigated if vigilin was deregulated in obese, insulin-resistant mice and measured its expression in livers of diet-induced obese C57Bl/6J (DIO) as well as ob/ob mice (Supplementary Fig 1ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While vigilin mRNA levels were similar (Supplementary Fig 1d), hepatic protein levels of vigilin, but not other RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) with moderate and high expression levels such as HuR/Elavl1 and Rbm47, were markedly increased in obese mice compared with chow-fed control animals (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, plasma triglycerides, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and cholesterol correlated significantly with hepatic vigilin levels (Fig 1df).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also compared vigilin protein levels in liver biopsies of 5 healthy, 10 NAFLD and 10 NASH patients (Supplementary Table 1) and found a strong positive correlation between the subjects vigilin levels and their degree of liver steatosis (Fig 1f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Correlation of vigilin levels with liver steatosis and plasma lipid levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Western blot analysis of vigilin in mouse tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from primary mouse hepatocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Immunoblot analysis of hepatic vigilin levels in 20-week-old chow-fed (Chow) or high-fat diet C57BL/6 (DIO) and in 23 week old ob/ob mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correlation between hepatic vigilin expression quantified by densitometry from c (n=6 per group) and (d) plasma triglyceride, (e) non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) and (f) cholesterol levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correlation between (g) degree of hepatic steatosis and (h) clinical/histological diagnosis with hepatic vigilin expression quantified by immunoblotting and densitometry from human liver biopsies, including 5 healthy, 10 non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and 10 non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values in h are expressed as mean±s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  *P0.05, **P0.01, ***P0.001;

Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes in the lipid profile were also reflected by increased very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels as well as by oil red O stainings in the liver (Fig 2e; Supplementary Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No changes in plasma glucose, insulin, cholesterol and alanine transaminase (ALT) were observed, indicating that increased hepatic vigilin expression does not affect glucose metabolism or cause hepatocellular injury (Fig 2d; Supplementary Fig 2df).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data show that vigilin expression is increased in steatotic livers of insulin-resistant subjects and that elevated hepatic vigilin levels increase triglyceride metabolism and VLDL secretion from the liver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "Figure 2: Hepatic modulation of vigilin regulates lipid metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Relative expression of vigilin in livers of 810-week-old C57BL/6 mice injected with Ad-GFP or Ad-VIGILIN (n=5 per group).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values are relative densitometric readouts normalized to -tubulin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Plasma triglyceride, (c) NEFA and (d) cholesterol levels of mice from a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Plasma from mice injected with Ad-GFP or Ad-VIGILIN was fractionated into very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and quantified through measurements of triglyceride and cholesterol levels in each fraction and used for western blot analysis of VLDL/LDL (apoB48/100) as well as HDL (apoA-I) markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) Relative expression of vigilin in livers of 10-week-old chow-fed and 20-week-old high-fed diet C57BL/6 mice (DIO) with Ad-shCtrl (n=6 for WT, n=8 for DIO), Ad-shVig (n=6 for WT, n=8 for DIO) or PBS (n=3 for WT, n=5 for DIO).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values are relative densitometric readouts normalized to -tubulin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (g) Plasma triglyceride, (h) NEFA and (i) cholesterol levels of DIO mice treated as in f.

resulted in a  greater than 90% reduction of hepatic vigilin in both chow and high-fat diet (DIO) C57Bl/6 mice when compared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or control adenovirus injected mice expressing a nonfunctional shRNA (Ad-shCtrl; Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of vigilin was restricted to the liver (Supplementary Fig 2g) and both inflammation and hepatotoxicity markers Nfkb, Tnfa, Il6 and ALT, respectively, remained in a normal range in adenovirus and PBS-injected mice (Supplementary Fig 2hj).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the gain-of-function study, knockdown of hepatic vigilin did not affect glucose metabolism since no significant changes in blood glucose and insulin levels could be determined in chow or DIO mice under ad libitum fed conditions (Supplementary Fig 2kn).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However in contrast to the hepatic vigilin overexpression, silencing of vigilin in chow diet mice resulted in increased liver triglyceride content and decreased plasma triglyceride as well as NEFA levels (Fig 2g,h; Supplementary Fig 2or).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of vigilin in DIO mice also lowered cholesterol levels through VLDL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles when compared to Ad-shCtrl-injected control mice (Fig 2i-j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with these observations, the correlations of vigilin expression levels with plasma triglyceride, NEFA and cholesterol levels were reversed upon knockdown of vigilin (Supplementary Fig 2s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Genome-wide identification of vigilin targets', 'To gain mechanistic insights into how vigilin influences lipid metabolism, we aimed to identify the direct targets of vigilin by performing PAR-CLIP in primary hepatocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PAR-CLIP takes advantage of T-to-C conversions that are created during reverse transcription as a result of incorporated 4-thiouridine (4SU) being covalently UV crosslinked to the RBP23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, RNA sequences obtained from PAR-CLIP intrinsically contain the information of specific crosslinking events and distinguish true RNAprotein interactions from background RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ad-VIGILIN-infected primary hepatocytes were cultured with 4SU before UV-irradiation to induce crosslinking of vigilin to the labelled cellular RNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoprecipitation of the radiolabeled VIGILINRNA complex showed a distinct crosslink at 150 kDa (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RNA from this complex was converted into a cDNA library and analysed by deep sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used PARalyzer, an algorithm that calculates the density of T-to-C conversions in PAR-CLIP reads, to detect binding sites in two biological replicates24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Keeping only targets found in both replicates, vigilin crosslinked to 755 gene transcripts of which 744 were mRNAs, corresponding to 6% of the murine liver transcriptome (Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 1,401 binding sites were identified, 1,165 of which were in mature mRNAs (Fig 3a; Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vigilin-binding sites predominantly resided in the coding sequence (CDS; 956) comprising RNA recognition elements of CHHC or CHYC sequence segments (H=A/C/U and Y=C/U; Fig 3bd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These PAR-CLIP binding sites were evenly distributed along the CDS of targets (Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further in silico analysis of the motif revealed a preferred binding of vigilin to a tandem of CHHC or CHYC 4mers spaced by 2, 5 or 8 nt (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We validated this putative RRE by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) using recombinant full-length human VIGILIN and synthetic single-strand RNAs comprising a panel of 18-nt di- and tri-nucleotide repeats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the PAR-CLIP-derived RRE, RNA shifts were observed for CU-rich motifs, while insertions of A and G nucleotides resulted in decreased binding affinity (Fig 3f; Supplementary Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, when testing RNAs of different lengths we found that oligonucleotides of 18 nt were required to observe RNAprotein shifts, suggesting that, in addition to the RRE, RNA backbone contacts outside of the RRE are necessary for binding in vitro (Supplementary Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While its precise molecular function remains elusive, vigilin has been implicated in many cellular processes, including the stabilization and destabilization of specific mRNA targets25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate vigilins impact on its mRNA targets on a genome-wide scale, we profiled the transcriptome of livers by RNA sequencing upon overexpression and knockdown of vigilin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, mRNA levels of the targets identified by PAR-CLIP did not change significantly under gain- or loss-of-function conditions (Fig 3g,h), indicating that vigilin is not involved in direct stabilization or destabilization of its mRNA substrates.

replicates, grey line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The median transcript abundance change is indicated by a dot on the x axis.Full size image', 'Analysis of the PAR-CLIP data revealed that 99 of the top 100 target transcripts crosslinked with vigilin in the CDS and 78 harboured signal peptides, transmembrane domains or both, pointing towards a function for vigilin in the secretory pathway (Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This notion is consistent with the reported role of the yeast homologue SCP160 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13), but distinct from that of other RBPs recently proposed to participate in translocation of alternative 3 UTRs to the cell surface27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, 393 of the 2,250 liver-expressed secretory pathway proteins (17.5%) were captured as targets with 4 T-to-C crosslinked reads in both PAR-CLIP replicates, indicating that only a specific subset of this class of proteins was targeted by vigilin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess if vigilin regulates the expression of secreted proteins on the protein level, we harvested the secretome from the medium of primary hepatocytes that were infected with either Ad-shCtrl or Ad-shVig and performed label-free quantification by mass spectrometry (MS-LFQ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured reduced levels of vigilin targets identified by PAR-CLIP in hepatocytes in which vigilin was silenced (Fig 4a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the regulation of these proteins correlated with the number of crosslinked reads found in the PAR-CLIP analysis (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed reduction of protein levels in MS-LFQ was validated for six metabolically relevant targets in the medium of Ad-shVig-treated primary hepatocytes by immunoblotting (Supplementary Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five of them were also significantly regulated in the blood of mice upon adenovirus-mediated gain- and loss-of-function of vigilin (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These targets included apoB, apoC-III, fetuin-A, alpha1-antitrypsin and orosomucoid with vigilin-binding sites evenly distributed along their CDS (Supplementary Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since we used primary hepatocytes as an autonomous ex vivo system to study vigilin in the liver, the unchanged levels of fibronectin in the blood of mice with reduced hepatic vigilin expression is most likely due to compensatory secretion from extrahepatic tissues28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the mRNA expression levels of these targets remained unperturbed upon overexpression or silencing of vigilin, thereby validating our genome-wide transcript analysis in hepatocytes with altered vigilin expression (Supplementary Fig 4d,e; Fig 3g,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Vigilin controls levels of secretory proatherogenic proteins.Secretome of

are produced and secreted from the liver and supply peripheral tissues with triglycerides and cholesterol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With one copy per particle, apoB100 is an essential protein for the formation and secretion of VLDLs and LDLs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second truncated isoform, apoB48, is the main apolipoprotein component of chylomicrons secreted from the intestine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to

inflammatory cytokine signalling in adipose tissue30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, increase of both apoB and fetuin-A protein levels correlated with elevated expression of vigilin in DIO and ob/ob mice (Supplementary Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We employed apoB and fetuin-A as regulated proteins with strong PAR-CLIP signals as representatives for large and small transcript vigilin substrates, respectively, to study vigilins interaction with their binding sites in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we performed EMSAs to validate the affinity of vigilin to the respective PARalyzer determined mRNA binding sites identified by PAR-CLIP (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the wild-type sequences of respective binding regions induced a shift in electrophoretic mobility of recombinant, RNA-depleted VIGILIN, mutations of the identified RRE and scrambled sequences of these sites exhibited decreased or no binding affinity by human VIGILIN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given the reported association of the yeast22 and vertebrate homologues34 with ribosomes and our observation that vigilin positively regulates its targets post-transcriptionally, we hypothesized that vigilin influences protein production of a specific subset of proteins in the secretory pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore investigated if vigilin was required for efficient translation of its targets by reconstructing translation in vitro using a cell-free system from liver extracts and fetuin-A as a model target followed by immunopurification of the translated protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro transcribed mRNAs of V5-tagged fetuin-A and apoM (as a non-vigilin-target) were efficiently translated and immunopurified under wild-type conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, liver extracts with shRNA-mediated depletion of vigilin showed decreased translation of fetuin-A, but not apoM (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these extracts, fetuin-A production could be rescued by the addition of recombinant human VIGILIN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro translation of apoB was technically not feasible due to its 14 kb long mRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to provide further evidence that vigilin constitutes a positive regulator of translation for its targets, we performed metabolic labelling studies using 35S-methionine/cysteine to pulse primary hepatocytes that were isolated from Ad-VIGILIN or Ad-shVig-injected mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following immunoprecipitation of the radiolabeled targets, the effect of vigilin on target protein synthesis was quantified via scintillation counting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the regulation of protein amounts in vivo, overexpression of vigilin led to increased target protein synthesis, while knockdown of vigilin resulted in decreased protein synthesis (Fig 5b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also investigated if vigilin influences post-translational degradation pathways that are known to determine the rate of secretion of apoB from the liver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test if vigilin caused the observed regulation of apoB and fetuin-A by influencing proteolysis, we monitored half-lives of these proteins upon knockdown of vigilin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supporting vigilins primary role in protein synthesis, half-lives of both apoB and fetuin-A remained unchanged in primary hepatocytes upon cycloheximide-mediated translational inhibition (Supplementary Fig 5a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data support the role of vigilin as a translational enhancer and illustrate that protein synthesis of vigilin targets is directly affected by the amount of vigilin protein present during translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "Figure 5: Vigilin enhances translation of its mRNA targets and lipid secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Autoradiograph of in

efficient ligand for clathrin-mediated endocytosis through the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested two siVig-GalNAc conjugates (GalNAc#1 and GalNAc#2) for activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GalNAc#1 was less potent than adenovirus delivered shRNA (Ad-shVig) and weekly subcutaneous administration for 18 weeks resulted in a 7080% reduction of hepatic vigilin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second GalNAc-conjugated siRNA sequence (GalNAc#2) revealed no significant silencing activity and was used to control for chemistry-related effects (Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of vigilin using GalNAc#1 was specific for the liver and showed no signs of liver toxicity (Supplementary Fig 6a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next measured the expression of vigilin targets in the plasma of siVig-GalNAc-treated mice by immunoblotting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vigilin targets fetuin-A, alpha1-antitrypsin, orosomucoid and the proatherogenic apoB, apoC-III and fibronectin were decreased in siVig-GalNAc#1-treated mice compared with control animals with no changes in apoA-I and apoM (Fig 6b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasma cholesterol and triglycerides were decreased in GalNAc#1 treated mice compared with PBS and GalNAc#2-injected control animals (Fig 6c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, plasma NEFA were reduced and lipid profiling of FPLC-separated lipoprotein fractions in plasma of these

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Through the combination of in vivo gain- and loss-of-function studies, PAR-CLIP as well as label-free quantification of secreted proteins by mass spectrometry, the present study investigated the molecular and physiological role of vigilin in the liver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify vigilin as a positive regulator of translation for mRNAs coding for a subset of proteins of the secretory pathway by binding to an RRE consisting of a tandem repeat of CHHC separated by 28 nt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, only a fraction (17.5%) of all liver-expressed secretory pathway proteins were targeted by vigilin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the identified RRE is also present in other abundant mRNAs that are not bound by vigilin, the specific regulatory role of vigilin in protein translation may be dependent on additional protein interactions with the ribosome and other regulatory factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these findings indicate a role of vigilin at the site of protein synthesis and are in good accordance with the recently proposed function of the yeast homologue SCP160 as a translational enhancer for proteins of the secretory pathway13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our data revealed apoB among the strongest targets of hepatic vigilin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the core protein of VLDL and LDL particles, apoB is of paramount importance for maintaining triglyceride balance within the liver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although regulation of apoB by post-translational degradation pathways within the ER, post-ER36, and by autophagy37,38 is well established, translational regulatory mechanisms that govern apoB expression are poorly understood39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study demonstrates that vigilin is a major determinant of apoB translation and VLDL secretion by hepatocytes without affecting VLDL clearance and therefore a regulator of net triglyceride secretion by the liver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our current understanding of VLDL synthesis and regulation indicates that lipid availability constitutes the limiting factor for the synthesis of functional apoB100, and thus, for the assembly of secretion-competent VLDL within the ER lumen40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We would therefore expect a higher impact of vigilin on VLDL secretion in obese states, when lipids are abundant and less limiting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, our results indicate that increased expression of vigilin enhances apoB synthesis in conditions of lipid availability (i.e., in obesity) to further promote VLDL secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed we noticed a larger reduction of VLDL and apoB amounts upon knockdown of vigilin in DIO mice when compared with chow-fed animals (33% versus 51%, respectively), underlining the importance of lipid availability for apoB/VLDL secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Short-term and strong ( greater than 90%) silencing of vigilin (using Ad-shVig) in the liver was accompanied by mild steatosis, consistent with studies in which Apob was silenced using shRNAs41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long-term knockdown of vigilin via GalNAc-conjugated siRNAs did not result in a steatotic liver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protection against hepatic triglyceride accumulation is likely due to other vigilin targets and associated mechanisms, such as the reduction of apoC-III, which increases the catabolism of triglyceride rich particles and lowers plasma triglyceride levels in mice and humans42,43,44,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long-term silencing of hepatic vigilin in Ldlr/ mice was also sufficient to lower VLDL and LDL levels and reduce atherosclerotic plaque formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The anti-atherogenic effects resulting from the inhibition of vigilin expression are likely mediated mainly by apoB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However we cannot exclude systemic synergy of other vigilin targets such as apoC-III, fibronectin and possibly others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fetuin-A has been reported to inhibit insulin and proinflammatory cytokine signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet as a mineral carrying protein, it also plays an important role in inhibiting systemic calcification and therefore might have facultative effects on atherosclerosis46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will therefore be important to address possible synergism of vigilin targets by performing simultaneous knockdowns of these targets in the liver in relevant atherosclerosis models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Knockdown of vigilin resulted in substantially decreased protein levels of its targets without affecting mRNA levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, other highly expressed liver secreted proteins that were not identified as targets in both PAR-CLIP replicates such as fetuin-B or the lipoprotein apoE, showed no significant perturbation upon vigilin knockdown, further substantiating vigilins specificity for a distinct subset of metabolic transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, our findings support the emerging view of RBPs organizing nascent RNA transcripts into functional groups that are coordinately regulated, especially at the level of mRNA stability and translation48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combinatorial binding of additional RBPs to these mRNAs and their controlled proteasomal degradation may provide a mechanism for multi-dimensional regulation of protein fates and explain (1) the general poor correlation between the mRNA and protein pools in eukaryotic cells49,50 and (2) the low susceptibility of some targets towards a vigilin knockdown ex and in vivo as observed for apoA-I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targets that remained unchanged upon vigilin silencing may be subject to further regulatory mechanisms controlling their protein levels or be due to secondary effects of the resulting phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Taken together, we provide first evidence that the mammalian vigilin is involved in translational regulation of mRNA targets encoding for proteins of the secretory pathway, including the proatherogenic proteins apoB, apoC-III and fibronectin, and thereby serves as an important regulator of protein production and lipid secretion from the liver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we uncover a primary role in lipid metabolism and hepatic steatosis in mice and humans to be mediated by an RNA-binding protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increased expression of vigilin in patients with hepatic steatosis may contribute to the overproduction and secretion of VLDL in obese, insulin-resistant subjects51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the high association between NAFLD/NASH and cardiovascular diseases53,54, increased levels of vigilin in hepatic steatosis may therefore provide a potential link to increased risks for cardiovascular diseases.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
