Total biosynthesis of opiates by stepwise fermentation using engineered Escherichia coli  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Opiates such as morphine and codeine are mainly obtained by extraction from opium poppies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fermentative opiate production in microbes has also been investigated, and complete biosynthesis of opiates from a simple carbon source has recently been accomplished in yeast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate that Escherichia coli serves as an efficient, robust and flexible platform for total opiate synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thebaine, the most important raw material in opioid preparations, is produced by stepwise culture of four engineered strains at yields of 2.1 mg l1 from glycerol, corresponding to a 300-fold increase from recently developed yeast systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This improvement is presumably due to strong activity of enzymes related to thebaine synthesis from (R)-reticuline in E. coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, by adding two genes to the thebaine production system, we demonstrate the biosynthesis of hydrocodone, a clinically important opioid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Improvements in opiate production in this E. coli system represent a major step towards the development of alternative opiate production systems.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Opiates are commonly used painkillers that are prescribed for illnesses ranging from cancer to rheumatism and toothaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are typically extracted from plants, and more efficient production of opiate has been attempted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biotechnology methods for poppy cultivation to increase yields have been studied extensively1,2,3; however, complex and unknown mechanisms that regulate biosynthetic pathways might make it difficult to increase opiate yields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there are several examples of successful chemical opiate synthesis4, cost-effective methods have not been established because of the complex molecular structure of opiates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, as a next-generation strategy, complete biosynthesis of opiates via microbes has also attracted attention because it does not require specific substrates other than inexpensive carbon sources (for example, glucose or glycerol)5,6,7,8, and has potential for improvements in quality and quantity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The complete biosynthesis of the opiate thebaine and opioid hydrocodone in yeast are the first examples of successful production from simple substrates8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The yeast fermentation system is sophisticated; however, thebaine and hydrocodone yields are still limited in that system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Material production using engineered E. coli has been studied extensively since the 1960s9, and information related to metabolic engineering has accumulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The major production targets are primary metabolites, including amino acids, which have yields of 1 mol l1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because opiates are synthesized from two L-tyrosine molecules, high amino-acid productivity by E. coli would be helpful to construct a practical production system for opiates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E. coli exhibits higher productivity of opiate intermediates, such as L-tyrosine10, L-dopa5,11, tetrahydropapaveroline (THP)12 and reticuline12, than yeast systems6,7,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, to construct a practical opiate production system, we chose E. coli as a production host.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we demonstrate the total synthesis of opiates using four E. coli strains.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'(R)-reticuline production by methyltransferases', 'Previously, we achieved the total biosynthesis of (S)-reticuline, a precursor of thebaine, from glycerol in a shake-flask culture (yield, 103 M) using an engineered E. coli strain15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have shown that the synthesis of the R-form of reticuline should be the initial production step (Fig 1 and Supplementary Fig 1)5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To produce (R)-reticuline, we examined the combination of three methyltransferases derived from Coptis japonica: 6-O-methyltransferase (6OMT)16, coclaurine N-methyltransferase (CNMT)17 and 4-O-methyltransferase (4OMT)18; these would theoretically synthesize racemic forms of reticuline from (R,S)-THP (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, only the S-form is produced by the strain that expresses the three methyltransferases (AN1752) cultured in (R,S)-THP-supplemented medium (Fig 2b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After extensive empirical trials, we found that the CNMT- and 4OMT-expressing strain (AN1600) could produce R-form reticuline (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because it has been reported that 4OMT has 6OMT activity towards norcoclaurine3, we speculated that 4OMT has 6OMT activity towards THP as well as norcoclaurine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify this, an enzyme assay was conducted with crude extract from 6OMT- or 4OMT-expressing strains (AN1472 or AN1028, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When 4OMT was incubated with THP, both 6-O-methyl THP and 4-O-methyl THP were synthesized, whereas only 6-O-methyl THP was detected in the reaction containing the 6OMT crude extract (Supplementary Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, 6,4-O-dimethyl THP was synthesized by 4OMT only (Supplementary Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggested that 4OMT has 6OMT activity towards THP, and consequently, reticuline could be produced without 6OMT (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it was not clear why the R-form of reticuline was produced by the CNMT and 4OMT expression strains, and further investigations are required to resolve this issue (described in the Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Total biosynthesis of thebaine using four-step culture.The brackets indicate the reactions in the individual strain of each culture step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ATR2, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase 2;

therefore, NADPHase activity was observed, even in the control sample (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the activity of PsCPR was almost identical to that of the control, others had significant activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because ATR2 activity was strongest, it was used as a reductase partner of P450 enzymes in opiate production by E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Functional expression of STORR in E. coli', 'Generally, P450 expression is difficult in E. coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because some P450 enzymes are successfully expressed in E. coli only after the deletion of their N-terminus23,24,25,26, N-terminal-deleted STORR (STORRNcut) was constructed in addition to full-length STORR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These STORRs were expressed with ATR2 and cultured in medium containing (S)-reticuline, which was biosynthesized from glycerol as described previously15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) analysis showed that the deletion of N-terminus was effective for protein expression (Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, neither STORR expression strain produced detectable R-form reticuline (Supplementary Fig 3bd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because P450 is a haemoprotein, the addition of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), a precursor of haeme, is sometimes required for functional expression in E. coli27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, 5-ALA was added to the culture medium at the same time as isopropyl--D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, small amount of (R)-reticuline was detected in the culture medium of the STORRNcut expression strain, indicating that STORR was functional in E. coli, although the N-terminal deletion and 5-ALA addition were required (Supplementary Fig 3e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, (R)-reticuline production by STORR was low (Supplementary Fig 3f, less than 10 M) and required the addition of an expensive compound, 5-ALA; therefore, it is not applicable for the practical production of opiates in current conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, to construct an opiate production system in E. coli, we attempted to develop (R,S)-reticuline production using two methyltransferases from (R,S)-THP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Functional expression of SalS in E. coli', 'The next step required for the production of opiates is the conversion of (R)-reticuline to salutaridine, which is catalysed by the P450 enzyme salutaridine synthase (SalS; Fig 1, Supplementary Fig 1)28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human P450s, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 also have SalS activity, and have been successfully expressed in E. coli27,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because these P450s produce undesirable by-products29, they are unsuitable for the practical production of opiates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we attempted functional expression of SalS in E. coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We constructed two SalS variants, full-length SalS (SalS) and N-terminus deleted (SalSNcut), as in the case of STORR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These SalS proteins were expressed with ATR2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SDSPAGE analysis showed that SalSNcut was expressed in E. coli, whereas the wild-type SalS was not, suggesting that the N-terminus sequence negatively affected SalS expression in E. coli, similar to STORR (Supplementary Figs 2a and 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These strains were grown on medium containing pure (R,S)-reticuline, and we measured the production of salutaridine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis, the specific peak was observed in the medium of the SalSNcut-expressing strain, and the tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) fragment pattern of the peak was almost identical to that of pure salutaridine (Supplementary Fig 4b,c), indicating that SalSNcut had salutaridine synthetase activity in E. coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the medium of the full-length SalS-expressing strains, a significant peak was observed at the same retention time as the salutaridine standard (an asterisk in Supplementary Fig 4b); however, we could not confirm their identity because the MS/MS fragment patterns of the peak was ambiguous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to STORR, the addition of 5-ALA was not required for salutaridine synthetic activity of SalS (Supplementary Fig 5), indicating that this property of SalSNcut is adequate for the practical production of opiates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we decided to use SalSNcut for the total biosynthesis of opiates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Thebaine production from authentic (R,S)-reticuline', 'To validate the activities of salutaridine reductase (SalR)31 and salutaridinol 7-O-acetyltransferase (SalAT)32, the last two enzymes in the thebaine synthetic pathway (Fig 1 and Supplementary Fig 1), their corresponding genes were expressed in the salutaridine-producing E. coli strain AN1096 to generate the thebaine-producing strain AN1829.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurement of thebaine production from authentic (R,S)-reticuline showed a thebaine-specific peak at m/z=312 (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MS/MS fragment pattern of the peak was almost identical to that of pure thebaine (Fig 3b), indicating that both SalR and SalAT were functional in E. coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thebaine yield was 57±4.6 M using pure (R,S)-reticuline at 200 M, containing the R-form at 100 M.', 'Figure 3: Thebaine production from pure (R,S)-reticuline or (R,S)-reticuline synthesized by total biosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) LC-MS analysis of thebaine (m/z=312) from the culture of the parental strain (salutaridine producer, AN1096;

therefore, we speculated that opposing effects of IPTG on (R,S)-reticuline and thebaine productions resulted in the low productivity of AN1998 strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, (R,S)-reticuline production step would better be separated from the thebaine production step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we decided to construct the total biosynthesis system using a four-step culture method using four strains: AN1126, AN1055, the (R,S)-reticuline producer AN1600 and AN1829, which produces thebaine from (R,S)-reticuline (Fig 1 and Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Thebaine biosynthesis using a four-step culture system', 'For the first and second steps, total biosynthesis of (R,S)-THP was performed as described previously12, and the (R,S)-THP yield was 983 M (282 mg l1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the third step, a one-eighth volume of (R,S)-THP (109 M) was added to the (R,S)-reticuline production culture, yielding 16.9 M (R)-reticuline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the fourth step, the same volume of (R,S)-reticuline-containing supernatant (final concentration, 8.5 M) was added to the culture of the thebaine producer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A thebaine yield of 6.8±0.67 M (2.1±0.21 mg l1) was obtained 15 h post initiation of the fourth step (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The yields achieved were a 300-fold improvement compared with those of the latest yeast system8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Hydrocodone biosynthesis using a four-step culture system', 'Hydrocodone is one of the most frequently used opioids and can be produced from thebaine using two enzymes, thebaine 6-O-demethylase and morphinone reductase (MorB;33 Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the ability of the thebaine total biosynthesis system to produce medical opioids, we constructed a hydrocodone producer by introducing the genes encoding the two enzymes into the thebaine producer, resulting in strain AN1942 (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The four-step culture system was used for hydrocodone production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A specific peak in the AN1942 culture was observed, and the MS/MS fragment pattern was identical to that of the hydrocodone standard (Fig 4b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hydrocodone-producing culture yielded 1.2±0.50 M (0.36±0.15 mg l1) codeine equivalents of hydrocodone, indicating that the thebaine total biosynthesis system was applicable for the biosynthesis of opioids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Total biosynthesis of hydrocodone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic representation of the total biosynthesis of hydrocodone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) LC-MS analysis of hydrocodone (m/z=300) from the culture of the parental strain (thebaine producer, AN1829;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The E. coli opiate production system developed in this study does not require specific substrates and resulted in 2.1 mg l1 thebaine production, which is a 300-fold improvement compared with the reported yeast system8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This large improvement is associated with high enzyme activity in E. coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the yeast system, thebaine titres are 0.2 M from 1 mM (R,S)-THP; the conversion efficiency is typically only 0.02% (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the E. coli system, the conversion efficiency of thebaine from (R,S)-THP was 12.5% (6.8 M thebaine was produced from 54.5 M (R,S)-THP diluted via stepwise culture).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the (R,S)-reticuline production system in yeast exhibits a 10% conversion efficiency of (R,S)-reticuline from (R,S)-THP34, the large difference in thebaine productivity between E. coli and yeast can be attributed to the activity of SalS, SalR and SalAT, which are required for thebaine synthesis from (R)-reticuline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In another yeast system, the thebaine conversion efficiency from (R)-reticuline is only 1% (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conversion efficiency of thebaine from biosynthesized (R)-reticuline reached 80% in the E. coli system, indicating that the activity of SalS, SalR and SalAT was much stronger in E. coli than in yeast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strong activity may be related to high expression of these enzymes or high productivity of co-factor(s), for example, haeme, NADPH and/or acetyl-CoA in E. coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrated that E. coli is suitable for opiate production, despite concerns related to the difficulty in expressing plant genes in the species13,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite the high conversion efficiency of thebaine from (R)-reticuline, the production yield of thebaine was relatively low in this total biosynthesis system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggested that the productivity of (R)-reticuline is a major rate-limiting step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To develop a practical production system for opioids, increasing the productivity of (R)-reticuline is the greatest challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated two ways to produce (R)-reticuline, that is, using STORR or the irregular activity of a methyltransferase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the conversion of racemic THP via methyltransferases was used to reconstruct opiate biosynthesis in this study, half of the reticuline that was produced, (S)-reticuline, was not used for opiate production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, STORR has low activity in E. coli, even after the addition of an expensive cofactor for (R)-reticuline production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To improve (R)-reticuline productivity, these drawbacks should be overcome by metabolic engineering strategies such as protein engineering for practical production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Engineered yeast can convert thebaine into various opiates such as morphine33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theoretically, other opioids in addition to hydrocodone can be produced by integrating opioid biosynthetic enzymes such as codeinone reductase (COR), codeine demethylase and morphine dehydrogenase into our thebaine total biosynthesis system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, a hybrid E. coli-yeast system could enable opioid production35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is possible, in principle, to produce various opioids from a simple carbon source using microbes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Stepwise culture has some advantages over single-step culture in the thebaine production system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because tyrosinase degrades THP, dividing the THP production pathway into two parts enables efficient THP production12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, stepwise culture bypasses undesirable reactions in which upstream enzymes act on downstream compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other benefit of stepwise culture is that it permits the individual optimization of each culture step, like chemical synthesis methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, IPTG had a positive effect on thebaine production, although it diminished (R)-reticuline production (Supplementary Figs 5 and 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, dividing the thebaine synthetic pathway from (R,S)-THP into two parts via stepwise culture enabled successful opiate production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it was not clear why IPTG had the opposite effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To construct a practical production system, we aim to verify the necessity of separating this step by elucidating the exact mechanism that does not allow the production of thebaine with (R,S)-reticuline production in our future research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recently, microbial production of plant secondary metabolites has attracted attention5,6,8,13,36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These compounds require multistep reactions from a simple carbon source, and are associated with undesirable reactions and enzyme inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The efficient production of these compounds may be achieved using stepwise culture, which would minimize problems that arise in multi-step reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a stepwise culture method enables the segmentation of a synthetic pathway, and that facilitates the production of similar compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the central intermediate in benzylisoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis, (S)-reticuline, is used for the production of protoberberine with the berberine bridge enzyme, scoulerine O-methyltransferase and CYP719A1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, aporphine alkaloids are produced from (S)-reticuline with CYP80G2 and CNMT enzymes35, whereas benzophenanthridine alkaloids are produced via scoulerine with CYP719A5, CYP719A3, TNMT, MSH and P6H39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By constructing these enzyme expression strains, and using an (S)-reticuline production step, a stepwise culture method can enable the production of various kinds of alkaloids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, stepwise culture methods enable flexibility in the production of various compounds, similar to conventional chemical synthesis methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The E. coli
