The biogeography of red snow microbiomes and their role in melting arctic glaciers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The Arctic is melting at an unprecedented rate and key drivers are changes in snow and ice albedo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that red snow, a common algal habitat blooming after the onset of melting, plays a crucial role in decreasing albedo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data reveal that red pigmented snow algae are cosmopolitan as well as independent of location-specific geochemical and mineralogical factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The patterns for snow algal diversity, pigmentation and, consequently albedo, are ubiquitous across the Arctic and the reduction in albedo accelerates snow melt and increases the time and area of exposed bare ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated that the overall decrease in snow albedo by red pigmented snow algal blooms over the course of one melt season can be 13%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This will invariably result in higher melt rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We argue that such a bio-albedo effect has to be considered in climate models.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Glaciers are important components of Earths climate and hydrologic system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Arctic is being disproportionately affected by global warming, which in turn provides a strong feedback on the climate system1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the key parameters in the increase of glacial melt is albedo change2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The physical and chemical characteristics of snow and ice have been studied intensively; however, the field of glacial microbiology is still in its infancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Snow and ice surfaces have been considered barren until recently, yet distinct habitats harbour species of all three domains of life3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far, most attention has been paid to cryoconite holes4,5,6,7, which are dominated by bacteria8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are, however, only active once the long-lasting snow cover has melted away, and their coverage on glaciated areas usually reaches a maximum of only 10% (refs 3, 4, 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, little is known about the diversity or function of snow algae, nor their global effect on albedo and hence glacial melting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is despite the fact that coloured snow algal blooms have been known since Aristotle10, and that they dominate primary production on snow and ice fields11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For most of the year, the largest proportion of the glacial surfaces in the Arctic is covered by snow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, permanent and seasonal snow can cover up to 35% of the entire Earths surface13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have recently shown that snow algae are critical players in glacial surface habitats and the dominating biomass immediately after the onset of melting11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Snow algae are prolific primary colonizers and producers that can form extensive blooms in spring and summer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such snow algal blooms can substantially darken the surface of glaciers because of their red pigmentation (secondary carotenoids), which the algae produce as a protection mechanism (for example, from high levels of irradiation)14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have shown that this phenomenon, known as red snow, can reduce the surface albedo locally by up to 20%, which in turn further increases melting rates of snow11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have been unable to generalize this effect because of a lack of information on the distribution, and controls on red snow ecology and physiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies have so far focussed on describing algae primarily through classical microbiological approaches16,17,18 (for example, microscopy).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in the current study, we have employed high-throughput sequencing to characterize these cryophilic micro-eukaryotes and their associated microbiota, that is, bacteria and archaea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluated the diversity and functionality of the red snow algal habitat in four geographically well-separated glacial systems across the Arctic, comprising of 40 red snow sites on 16 glaciers and snow fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This way, we have produced the first large-scale biogeographical data set for red pigmented snow algae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knowledge of the global distribution of species and their underlying spatial patterns and processes (that is, their biogeography) has long been assumed irrelevant for microbial communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recently documented rapid changes in diversity across many ecosystems have led to an increased focus on biogeographical patterns and traits in microorganisms19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identifying patterns can help to better understand their ecology within a specific ecosystem and make predictions about their role on a larger scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We cross-correlated the marker gene data with geochemical and metabolic measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These parameters were then used to evaluate the environmental forcing factors on the snow microbial community composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Furthermore, recent snow-albedo models for Greenland22 suggest that melting accelerates largely due to increased contributions from light-absorbing impurities, with impurities being primarily considered to be anthropogenic, forest fire-derived black carbon, Saharan or pro-glacial mineral dust23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the contribution of coloured algae to changing albedo and melt rates has not previously been considered24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, based on our albedo measurements on red snow and comparing with literature data for algae-free snow, we have estimated the reduction of albedo caused by microbial darkening of glacial surfaces (inferring higher melting rates).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This will help to improve our understanding of the response of glacial systems to a warming climate.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Supplementary Tables 12 and 13) and mineralogy (Supplementary Table 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, they represent a good range of differing local snow environments across the Arctic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations varied significantly between locations (Supplementary Fig 1 and Supplementary Tables 3 and 12), with up to five times higher values in snow from Northern Sweden in comparison to Svalbard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, concentrations of easily leachable elements (Ca, Cl, Mg, Mn, Na and K) were on average 10 times higher in red snow from Svalbard in comparison to Northern Sweden (Supplementary Table 12), whereas in Iceland the red snow samples contained up to 100 times higher iron concentrations than any of the other localities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences appear to be linked to the higher concentrations of more easily dissolvable mineral phases in Svalbard in comparison to Northern Sweden, and the higher Fe content in basaltic rocks from Iceland in comparison to the other sites (Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, none of the essential nutrients (that is, NO3, PO4) showed any statistically relevant differences among locations (Supplementary Tables 3 and 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mirroring the DOC trend, the total particulate carbon (TC) values as well as the total solid phase carbon to nitrogen (C/N) and carbon to phosphorous (C/P) ratios (Supplementary Table 13) were on average two or three times higher in Northern Sweden in comparison to Svalbard, whereas the 13C values of bulk organic matter were significantly lower in Svalbard in comparison to Northern Sweden.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both locations, the C/N ratios were below the Redfield ratio but C/P values below Redfield were only present in samples from Northern Sweden (Supplementary Table 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high TC, DOC and 13C values in the snow samples from Northern Sweden likely document a higher amount of allochthonous carbon potentially derived from higher plants, and the large amounts of pine pollen blown onto the glaciers and snow fields from the lower parts of the Tarfala valley.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, all red snow samples, regardless of location, were characterized by similar, predominantly negative organic 15N values indicative of an atmospheric source (Supplementary Table 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Geochemical and mineralogical parameters varied dramatically between locations, yet no correlations between algal species distribution and these characteristics were found (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the uniform algal species composition remained unaffected by and independent of the local geochemical and mineralogical parameters in each site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In contrast, our data show a clear links between the bacterial community composition and geochemical parameters, with the most positive correlation found between the carbon species (TC and DOC; Supplementary Fig 3) and Sphingobacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is not surprising as Sphingobacteria are known to be capable of degrading complex organic structures32, and their abundance in Northern Sweden is consistent with the local high DOC and TC values (Supplementary Tables 12 and 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all samples and in total contrast to the algae, the bacteria are seemingly subjected to a much higher location-specific selection pressure and appeared more affected by the availability of allochthonous carbon and the local geology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Algae decrease surface albedo', 'The above documented high algal biomass primarily made up of highly red pigmented algae, will invariably affect the amount of light that is reflected from the surface of snow fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our albedo measurements (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1) showed a clear decrease in surface albedo in comparison to algal-free snow sites (0.90±0.05; Table 1)11,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured decrease where red pigmented algae were present was similar in all sites, independent of the local environment with albedo values reaching between 0.50 and 0.75 (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we found a significant (P=0.008) negative correlation between algal biomass and surface albedo (Fig 4), which clearly supports our assertion of the crucial role of red pigmented snow algae in decreasing surface albedo and increasing melting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is also on par with the results by Painter et al.34 and Aoki et al.35, who showed that the strong light absorption is due to algal pigments in the 400600 nm (carotenoids and chlorophylls) and 600700 nm (chlorophylls) range, which is much stronger in comparison to absorption by mineral dust or black carbon if biomass is as high as in our documented red algal blooms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Integrated albedo change.Full size table', 'Figure 4: Algal biomass and albedo.Plot shows a significant negative correlation (Pearson correlation factor: r=0.65, P=0.008) between algal biomass and surface albedo measured in red snow sites in Svalbard and Northern Sweden.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This underpins the role of red pigmented snow algae in decreasing surface albedo and in turn melting.Full size image', 'The above described ubiquitous distribution, low diversity and similarity in snow algal community compositions and metabolic functions combined with the analogous values measured for the red snow algae induced albedo reduction (Supplementary Table 1), allow us to compare the impact that the red pigmented snow algae have on albedo in comparison to snow surfaces free of algae over an estimated 100-day scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the beginning of a melting season, we assume all glacier surfaces are covered by dry clean snow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using values for albedo for such snow from the literature2,22,36,37 (0.90±0.05; Table 1) allowed us to linearly integrate the change in albedo of snow colonized by red pigmented algae versus algae-free snow surfaces for the season-long transition from dry clean snow to wet clean snow (0.75±0.05) and to red snow (0.65±0.12; Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show a square root dependence between albedo values and time and applied a simple one-dimensional moving boundary approach to our data38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our fit of the integrated albedo change with time (100 days) shows a 13% larger effect in the presence of red pigmented algal blooms in comparison to clean snow that has undergone a purely physical albedo change due to melting, and change of snow crystal size and structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This 13% integrated change in albedo is an estimate for the overall effect of snow algal communities during an entire melt season and compares well with the single time-point albedo reduction of up to 20%, that we and others have previously measured on red pigmented algal snow sites11,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, with further melting dirty ice and cryoconite holes will be exposed earlier and their albedo values can drop by an additional 20% to 0.34±0.15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This will likely culminate in even higher melt rates, which has also recently been shown in laboratory experiments40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A quantitative value for the area of Arctic glaciers and the Greenland Ice Sheet covered by snow algae during a melt season is still lacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as we infer from our data, melting is one major driver for snow algal growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extreme melt events like that in 2012, when 97% of the entire Greenland Ice Sheet was affected by surface melting41, are likely to re-occur with increasing frequency in the near future as a consequence of global warming42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, such extreme melting events are likely to even further intensify the effect of snow algae on surface albedo, and in turn melting rates43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'With this work, we show that snow algae are ubiquitous and have little diversity across the Arctic, despite variations in environmental parameters that significantly impact the bacterial community composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we may not have captured all environmental parameters, the patterns we observed occur on all studied glaciers regardless their geochemical and mineralogical compositions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further investigations are needed to explore the validity of these findings for mid latitudes and the southern hemisphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, red snow is a ubiquitous phenomenon in Arctic sites (glaciers and permanent snow fields).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The similarity in snow algal community composition, metabolic function and impact on albedo of snow habitats allows the upscaling of our findings and make predictions about the influence of snow algae on melt rates of glaciers across the Arctic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data show that the overall decrease in snow albedo by red pigmented snow algal blooms over an entire melt season can be 13%, likely leading to earlier exposure of dirty ice with an even lower surface albedo culminating in a further increase in melt rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work paves the way for a universal model of algalalbedo interaction and a quantification of additional melting caused by algal blooms to be included in future climate models.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Field sites', 'A total of 40 red snow samples was collected from four well-separated Arctic locations on 16 glaciers and permanent snow fields: Svalbard (SVA, n=12), Northern Sweden (TAR, n=24), Greenland (MIT, n=2) and Iceland (ICE, n=2; Fig 1; Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These localities were chosen as they represent different geographical settings including low (67.9°N) versus high (78.9 N) latitude, low (150400 m) versus high (1,2001,400 m) elevation, and maritime versus continental settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vestre Brøggerbreen, Midtre Lovénbreen, Austre Brøggerbreen,

specific photosynthetic active radiation (PMA2132), ultraviolet-A (PMA2110) and ultraviolet-B (PMA2106) sensors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Albedo was calculated by taking the ratio of reflected to incident radiation (400700 nm range) and measuring the values always in the same position to the sun.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reading of the sensor was not affected by shading by the observer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

less important in changing albedo measurements in red snow surface samples in comparison to the pigment distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Aoki et al.35 and Painter et al.34 showed that red snow

'In addition, only selected samples in Greenland11 and Iceland33 were included in the comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because at both sites samples were collected at different stages in the melt

increase in carotenoid content could be observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This led to our conclusion that there is a great heterogeneity in pigment composition both in space and time11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the few samples collected at the end of the study showed similar carotenoid contents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This end-of-season homogeneity in the red snow samples was the reason why in the current study we focused solely on samples from late in the melt season, which is the dominant red snow stage with the largest impact on albedo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we only included two DNA samples from Greenland.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly in Iceland33, most of the samples were collected earlier in the year (JuneJuly) and those samples were described as less typical of red snow patches33.
