Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Understanding the factors that limit and regulate wildlife populations requires insight into demographic and environmental processes acting throughout the annual cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we combine multi-year tracking data of individual birds with a 26-year demographic study of a migratory songbird to evaluate the relative effects of density and weather at the breeding and wintering grounds on population growth rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results reveal clear support for opposing forces of winter temperature and breeding density driving population dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Above-average temperatures at the wintering grounds lead to higher population growth, primarily through their strong positive effects on survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, population growth is regulated over the long term by strong negative effects of breeding density on both fecundity and adult male survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such knowledge of how year-round factors influence population growth, and the demographic mechanisms through which they act, will vastly improve our ability to predict species responses to environmental change and develop effective conservation strategies for migratory animals.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Understanding the factors that limit and regulate wildlife populations requires insight into interactions among demographic and environmental processes throughout the annual cycle1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For migratory species, quantifying seasonal effects of density-dependent and density-independent factors on population dynamics is particularly challenging due to the difficulty of following individuals between their distinct and often distant breeding and non-breeding grounds3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In birds, variation in the non-breeding environment has been shown to influence individual condition5, migration timing6,7 and subsequent reproductive success6, as well as some components of population growth rate, such as survival and fecundity8,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the extent to which density-dependent and -independent effects during the non-breeding period scale up from the individual to affect population growth rate, and the magnitude of these effects relative to those that occur during the breeding period, are unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Filling this void requires a full-annual-cycle approach that includes linking the breeding and non-breeding grounds, knowing how density-dependent and -independent factors during different periods of the year influence vital rates, and understanding the relative contribution of those vital rates to population growth rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this paper, we couple multi-year individual tracking data with long-term demographic data for a migratory population of Savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis) breeding on Kent Island (44.48 °N, 66.79 °W) in the Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick, Canada (Fig 1) to quantify the relative effects of weather and density at the breeding and population-specific wintering grounds on population growth rate via the vital rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide evidence that conditions outside the breeding season limit population growth rate and demonstrate the demographic mechanisms through which limitation occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Winter distribution and breeding ground study site of Savannah sparrows from Kent Island.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Winter distribution (blue contours) of Savannah sparrows from a breeding population on Kent Island, NB, Canada (orange arrow) inferred from geolocator tracking data collected from 2011 to 2014.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blue contours delineate the 30, 50 and 75% kernel densities estimated from the winter locations of 38 individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Embedded photo shows a colour-banded Savannah sparrow (photo courtesy of S.

'Modelling approach and geolocator results', 'To quantify the relative effects of weather and density during the breeding and non-breeding seasons on population growth rate, we first estimated annual vital rates (age- and sex-specific apparent survival, fecundity and sex-specific immigration) and population growth rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vital rates and population growth rate were estimated from 26 years of capture-recapture/resighting, population census, and reproductive success data collected on the breeding grounds using an integrated population model (IPM) fitted in a Bayesian framework using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) simulations12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then used a novel path analysis approach to estimate (i) direct effects of the different vital rates on population growth rate and (ii) indirect effects of densities (Fig 2a,b) and weather (daily mean temperature and precipitation;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A growing body of evidence suggests that non-breeding conditions can have a significant impact on individual success within and across seasons in migratory animals5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results reveal that variation in the non-breeding environment can also scale up to limit population growth rate and, in doing so, strengthen recent calls to approach the study of migratory species from a full-annual-cycle perspective1,2,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are currently amid a new era of tracking long-distance migration due to the development of miniaturized tracking devices24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Major advances in our understanding of the ecology and evolution of migratory species will hinge on how these movement data are integrated with demographic data from both the breeding and non-breeding grounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach of coupling integrated population modelling with path analysis is an intuitive means by which to quantify the contributions of density-dependent and density-independent factors throughout the annual cycle on population growth rate, while explicitly incorporating uncertainty in parameter estimation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By accounting for the relative effects of each vital rate on population growth rate, our approach filters out factors that may have a strong direct effect on a given vital rate but that ultimately play a minor role in driving annual variation in population growth rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the relative contributions of vital rates to population growth rate is important not only for understanding species population dynamics, but can also help to improve the efficiency of conservation efforts by providing the components of populations, or periods of the annual cycle, on which targeted conservation actions are likely to have the greatest effect in sustaining populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, warming temperatures are known to influence some migratory animals by altering their timing of breeding in relation to peak food supply for provisioning young25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If fecundity contributes strongly to variation in population growth rate, then the fate of a population or species may hinge on its ability to cope with, or adjust to, long-term warming trends and conservation resources should be allocated to ensure successful reproduction26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, if fecundity contributes relatively little to population growth rate relative to survival, then conservation efforts will be more impactful during the period(s) of the annual cycle that have the greatest influence on survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although our study focused on a single population of a broadly distributed songbird, variation in the non-breeding environment likely plays a primary role in limiting population growth rates of a wide range of migratory birds20,27, given that non-breeding grounds are typically used during resource-poor periods of the year and that survival is a key vital rate driving population growth in birds28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That males and females had similar survival probabilities even though temperatures were, on average, 5 °C higher at the female- versus male-specific wintering grounds, suggests that temperature was not the only environmental factor influencing this vital rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other factors, such as differences in landscape cover on the wintering grounds, may also be contributing to variation in annual survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, lower survival of females during other periods of the annual cycle, such as migration or the post-breeding, pre-migration period, relative to males could cause annual survival estimates of the two sexes to balance out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Whereas density-dependent processes have been shown to regulate other bird populations within and across seasons11,17,18,19,29,30, we only found clear evidence for breeding density-dependence regulating population growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that our study was of a highly philopatric island population could have influenced the strength of density-dependence we observed at the breeding grounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, density-dependence might be stronger in island populations if dispersal-limitation forces individuals to breed at high densities rather than disperse to areas of lower density where resource competition is relaxed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, lower species diversity on islands could lead to differences in the strength of density-dependence between island and mainland populations through reduced interspecific competition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences in dispersal rates could also explain why we observed density-dependence on the breeding grounds but not at the wintering grounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the breeding season, territoriality confines individuals to relatively small areas, leading to frequent aggressive interactions with neighbors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, during the winter, Savannah sparrows are generally not territorial13 and thus, have greater flexibility to disperse away from areas of high density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, it is important to recognize that single breeding populations typically share their non-breeding ranges with individuals from other breeding populations and vice versa31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Formation of such migratory networks can lead to dynamics being linked across breeding and non-breeding populations32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, decomposing drivers of dynamics within migratory networks will require information on movements of individuals between breeding and non-breeding grounds as well as between populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a full-annual-cycle, multi-population approach will be critical for predicting how species respond to environmental changes and stressors across their entire ranges2.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Study population and field methods', 'Savannah sparrows (Fig 1a) are migratory songbirds that occupy all-purpose territories in grasslands and other open habitats across Canada and the northern USA during the breeding season, and form loose flocks across the southern USA and Mexico, as well as parts of Central America during the winter13,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although still abundant, Breeding Bird Survey data suggest that Savannah sparrow populations are declining34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The causes of these declines are unknown, but may be related to intensification of agricultural practices, urbanization, and forest regeneration in parts of their range13,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The population of Savannah sparrows we studied breeds in a 10-ha study area on Kent Island (44.48 °N, 66.79 °W) and has been monitored annually since 1987, except for a three-year period from 2005 to 2007.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Annual monitoring of the population takes place between late May and the end of July and involves capturing and colour-banding new members of the study population, re-sighting returning colour-banded individuals, mapping breeding territories, finding nests, and banding nestlings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All capturing of adults and independent juveniles is done using mist-nets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individuals entering the study population whose natal origins are unknown (immigrants) are marked with a USFWS/CWS aluminum leg-band and a unique random combination of three colour leg-bands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nestlings born in the study population are first banded in the nest on the seventh day after hatching with a USFWS/CWS aluminum leg-band and one colour leg-band.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those that return to the study population in a subsequent year (local recruits) are re-captured and given a complete three-colour leg-band combination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sex of immigrants and local recruits is determined at the time of capture by the presence of a cloacal protuberance (males) or brood patch (females).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The age of local recruits is known to the day, whereas immigrants are only known to be one year or older.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Breeding territories are determined from daily observations of individual behaviours (for example, locations of singing males) and movements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Savannah sparrows on Kent Island typically form socially monogamous breeding pairs, but a variable fraction of males (1543%) will secure more than one female37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nests within each territory are typically found at the beginning of incubation and are checked every second day to determine fledging or failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incubation lasts an average of 12 days and the nestlings remain in the nest for 911 days38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On average (±s.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), in each year, 91±2% of females successfully fledge at least one nest (range=69100%) and 26±2% (range=1248%) successfully fledge a second clutch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both sexes feed young whereas only females build nests and incubate eggs13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Collectively, these monitoring activities have produced 26 years of capture-recapture/resighting (CR), reproductive success, and count data for the population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'All applicable institutional and federal regulations and guidelines for the care and use of animals were followed throughout the execution of this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Geolocators', 'Geolocators are archival, battery-powered, animal-borne devices that measure light intensity over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When recovered from an animal, downloaded light records can be used to determine day length and times of solar noon and midnight, which, in turn, can be used to estimate latitude and longitude for every 12-h period39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the primary wintering grounds of our study population, we deployed 163 geolocators (nadults=111 68%;
