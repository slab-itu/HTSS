Colloidal crystals with diamond symmetry at optical lengthscales  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Future optical materials promise to do for photonics what semiconductors did for electronics, but the challenge has long been in creating the structure they requirea regular, three-dimensional array of transparent microspheres arranged like the atoms in a diamond crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate a simple approach for spontaneously growing double-diamond (or B32) crystals that contain a suitable diamond structure, using DNA to direct the self-assembly process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While diamond symmetry crystals have been grown from much smaller nanoparticles, none of those previous methods suffice for the larger particles needed for photonic applications, whose size must be comparable to the wavelength of visible light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, the crystals we observe do not readily form in previously validated simulations; nor have they been predicted theoretically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggests that other unexpected microstructures may be accessible using this approach and bodes well for future efforts to inexpensively mass-produce metamaterials for an array of photonic applications.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Metamaterials, typically consisting of optical wavelength-sized building blocks arranged in periodic arrays, promise the creation of unique photonic technologies1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A particularly favourable three-dimensional metamaterial consists of transparent spheres arranged on a cubic diamond lattice2, which has led to a multi-decade effort to form diamond structures using lithography3, micromanipulation4 or holography5 as well as self-assembly approaches based upon liquid crystals6, nanoparticles7,8,9 or colloidal crystallization10,11,12,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The notorious difficulty of forming a diamond lattice using colloidal crystallization is due to the structures low filling fraction and mechanical instability; colloids with short-ranged and isotropic attractive interactions will favour a denser and more highly coordinated structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different proposed approaches for self-assembling colloidal diamond crystals are summarized in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One approach is to use isotropic interactions that combine a long-range repulsion with a short-ranged attraction10,13,14 (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this approach has led to the experimental formation of diamond-like crystals of oppositely charged nanoparticles7, it does not appear to be adaptable to the larger scales required for photonic materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second proposed approach uses patchy colloids that only interact through small patches on their surfaces16 (Fig 1b) to mimic the tetrahedral directional interactions of carbon atoms in a diamond lattice, but is challenging due to competition with a thermodynamically preferred amorphous tetrahedral liquid or gel17,18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A third approach is to form a denser and more highly coordinated structure that contains a diamond lattice of one compositionally distinct species, which has a second lattice or scaffold of another species in its interstitial space, which prevents the diamond lattice from collapsing or rearranging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One example is isomorphic to the MgCu2 Laves phase12,21 (Fig 1c), in which the scaffold consists of smaller Cu spheres11 arranged into a second diamond lattice of tetrahedral clusters of spheres15 (also known as the pyrochlore lattice).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Proposed approaches for making diamond-like colloidal crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) A simple diamond lattice can be stabilized by oppositely charged particles occupying alternating lattice sites, or with a single particle type having a short ranged attraction and long-ranged repulsion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Particles that adhere through tetrahedrally arranged patches may form a diamond lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) An MgCu2 Laves phase consists of a diamond lattice (red) surrounded by a scaffold of small spheres (green) arranged in tetrahedra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Our approach forms a double diamond (DD) (or B32) lattice consisting of two interpenetrating diamond lattices (red and green).Full size image', 'Here we demonstrate a simple self-assembly method for growing scaffolded diamond crystallites from roughly 400 nm diameter polymer microspheres, with a lattice spacing comparable to that of visible light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we prepare two slightly different-sized species of microspheres with complementary DNA strands grafted to their surfaces22, which form molecular bridges23,24,25 between them when they come within 30 nm of contact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under conditions where the DNA bridge formation is rapid and reversible26, the spheres experience a short-ranged attraction that drives the spontaneous nucleation and growth of large colloidal crystals23,27,28,29,30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of the resulting crystals have a well-ordered double diamond (DD) or B32 structurewhere the scaffold is simply a second diamond lattice of smaller and different-composition spheres (Fig 1d) interpenetrating the first.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This structure is isomorphic to the NaTl Zintl phase32 in atomic solids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observation of such a DD or B32 lattice has not been predicted for this system and is completely unexpected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this structure has been reported once in a nanoparticle system8, its thermodynamic stability requires next-nearest neighbour interactions32,33 that are not present with DNA colloids32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, simulations show that the binding energy of our DD crystallites is smaller than for co-occurring crystallites having a CsCl structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, matched simulations fail to nucleate or grow such DD crystals directly from a fluid phase, suggesting non-classical mechanisms for both processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This explanation is supported by the crystallites extreme structural deformability and the experimental observation of reconstructed surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crosslinking34 such crystals and dissolving the smaller scaffold species could provide a facile and scalable route for self-assembling diamond crystals that would have interesting and useful metamaterial properties.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Formation and imaging of binary colloidal crystals', 'To form DD crystals, we use an aqueous suspension containing two types of similarly sized microspheres with diameters of roughly 400 nm, which have been engineered to have controllable and chemically specific interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the two species A and B, our four adjustable parameters are two like attraction strengths, UAA and UBB, one unlike one, UAB=UBA, (defined as positive-valued parameters) and the spheres diameter ratio, A/B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interactions are realized and modulated by grafting various amounts of complementary DNA strands to the two particle species surfaces22,23, see Methods for details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When two microspheres bearing complementary DNA sequences come near contact, DNA hybridization leads to molecular bridges that pull the spheres together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At sufficiently high DNA density26,31 the attraction resembles an isotropic, reversible interaction potential24,25 with a range of about 30 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All particle pairs also exhibit a soft repulsion near contact due to the compression of their DNA brushes17, having a range of roughly 10 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since both length scales are much shorter than a particle radius, we consider the particles to act nearly as sticky hard spheres, whose packing is determined by the size of their hard cores, but with an additional energy benefit when spheres with complementary DNA are in contact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temperature provides a convenient means to modulate the colloidal interactions, since DNA bridges dissociate at elevated temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To form crystals, we place a binary suspension of 20% total particle volume fraction in a slowly cooling hot water bath.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the temperature falls, the attractive interactions become gradually stronger until crystals form by homogeneous nucleation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The resulting, typically polyhedral29 crystallites are permanently crosslinked by enzymatic ligation34, mounted in a high-index mounting medium and imaged on a confocal microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two particle types are stained with different dyes: smaller A spheres in green, and larger B spheres in red, which can be imaged separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the particle sizes and mounting medium we use, the crystallites are effectively transparent, and we can observe both their global shape and lattice structure throughout their depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While confocal microscopy cannot resolve the three-dimensional structure of sub-micron lattices in the depth direction, it can resolve the particle arrangement and spacing in two-dimensional focal plane slices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting images resemble the superposition of two adjacent crystal planes parallel to the focal plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By matching these patterns to computer-rendered lattice models from different viewing angles, for an ensemble of crystallites and two colour channels, the three-dimensional lattice structures can be reliably inferred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Structure and incidence of DD crystals', 'Many DD crystallites we observe have the form of a cuboctahedron having square (100) and triangular (111) faces, shown in Fig 2 and Supplementary Fig 1, and contain order 104 microspheres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystallites sediment and typically come to rest on a flat facet, aligning the focal plane with the faceting lattice directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diamond structure is determined from images that show the expected lattice symmetry, orientation and spacing when the focal plane is parallel to (100) and (111) facets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the two different particle species consistently show the same lattice symmetry, orientation and spacing, indicating our crystallites consist of two interpenetrating, identical diamond lattices, see Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other DD crystallites are somewhat less regularly shaped and display prominent faces normal to (211) lattice directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lattice here resembles a rectangular array of doublets (foreshortened pairs of spheres), that also closely matches computer-generated models for the DD lattice along the (211) direction, in both colour channels, shown in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A larger set of DD crystal micrographs are displayed in Supplementary Figs 2 and 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A large number of alternative structures were examined to see if they could explain our images (see Methods for listing), none were even able to qualitatively capture the results, let alone do so with the correct lattice spacings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Polyhedral crystallites have a double-diamond structure.

the incidence of DD crystals under different conditions is summarized in Supplementary Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reproducibility was excellent; all dozen experiments satisfying the conditions above, across several different particle formulations yielded DD crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The DD crystal has very low nearest-neighbour coordination compared with CsCl (in which every A and B particle has eight AB contacts with neighbours).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For an ideal diamond structure of B spheres, each B sphere has only four (weak) BB contacts; since the A spheres are smaller than the tetrahedral interstice of Bs surrounding them, each A can only form at most two (strong) AB contacts simultaneously in an undistorted DD lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, this presents a puzzle: it would appear that the binding energy of DD crystallites due to short-ranged attractions is significantly less than that of CsCl crystals, and yet they both form under similar conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Simulated DD crystals are deformable', 'To understand the occurrence and apparent stability of DD crystals, we performed a series of Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations using realistic and validated DNA interaction potentials24, bracketing the range of interaction strengths expected in the experiments, see Methods and Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we constructed spherical and octahedral crystallites initialized to an ideal DD structure (with the smaller A spheres slightly shifted to form two AB contacts each), Fig 4a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For sufficiently strong interactions (UBB greater than 3 kBT, UAB greater than 6 kBT) the crystallites were morphologically stable upon thermalization but also exhibited moderate densification that reduced the mean size of the tetrahedral interstices occupied by A particles, and increased the mean number of AB contacts (from 2 to an average of 4.64 in the bulk), see Fig 4b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This densification is one manifestation of a preponderance of zero-energy or floppy modes in the DD structure, corresponding to deformations that have zero associated energy penalty because they do not stretch or break favoured spheresphere contacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inspired by our prior work29 in other floppy crystals of DNA colloids, we evolved the ideal DD crystal along an arbitrarily chosen shear-like floppy mode35 until a more highly coordinated lattice was reached (with 4AB contacts per B particle in the bulk), see Fig 4c and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On thermalization, this new sheared DD structure reached a coordination that was still higher (to 5.4AB contacts per B particle in the bulk), Fig 4d, but which was still far short of that afforded by the CsCl structure (8AB contacts).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, 50% of our experimental crystallites show clear lattice distortions (bond angles deviate ±10°, and lattice spacings deviate ±10%), that qualitatively resemble those of the sheared DD structure (Fig 4d and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggests that some of our DD crystals may have transformed, as seen in other floppy crystals29,35, but the volume of our experimental data is not sufficient to allow meaningful statistical tests of this idea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Double-diamond crystals are stable in simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Rendering of the large, 445 nm diameter particles in an ideal DD lattice (100) orientation, size ratio 0.88.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Snapshot of the same lattice as a after thermalization in a BD simulation, with interactions UBB=3 kBT, UAB=6 kBT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) A lower energy lattice resulting from shearing the ideal DD lattice along a zero-energy mode until it achieves more AB-type contacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Snapshot of the same lattice as c after thermalization.Full size image', 'DD crystals do not nucleate in simulation', 'Given the apparent energetic unfavourability of the DD lattice (with or without densification or transformation), the experimental observations could be explained were the DD crystal kinetically favoured, exhibiting faster nucleation or growth rates than CsCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, BD simulations seeded with the above ideal and sheared DD crystallites showed no significant growth for any plausible particle interactions or volume fractions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The volume fractions tested ranged from 1.25 to 40%, with BB binding strengths ranging from 0 to 20 kBT, AA binding strengths ranging from 0 to 10 kBT and AB binding strengths ranging from 0 to 30 kBT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While some AA contacts were observed in the densified configurations, the stability of the crystallites was essentially independent of the AA binding strength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystallite seeds were generally found to melt for AB binding strengths below 5 kT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to attempts at growing DD seeds with direct BD simulations, umbrella sampling simulations also were performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these simulations, a bias potential of the form UB=k(nnT)2 was imposed on the system, where n is the total number of particles in a DD seed and nT is a target value for the seed size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bias potential is designed to drive the simulation towards configurations that correspond to the target DD crystallite size and allows for the extraction of the free energy of the crystallite at that size36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of particles in the crystallite at any given configuration was determined on the basis of a Steinhardt bond-orientational order parameter38; see Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystallites of various sizes (containing up to 400 particles) in both sheared and unsheared DD configurations were used as initial seeds and allowed to evolve in the umbrella sampling simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all initial configurations and binding energies in the ranges noted above, the equilibrium crystallite size was found to be smaller than the target, suggesting that the crystallites were sub-critical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparison, the critical nucleus size for CsCl crystallites with comparable AB binding energies is an order-of-magnitude smallerconsistent with the fact that CsCl is observed to nucleate and grow spontaneously in simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations do not conclusively rule out direct homogeneous nucleation of DD: it is possible that the order parameters we considered are not optimally aligned with the growing structure, or that the same kinetic barriers that were operational in the direct growth simulations also prevented proper equilibration in the umbrella sampling runs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, previous simulations8 of the nanoparticle analogue of our system (which is energetically favourable) also fail to show spontaneous nucleation or growth of the DD structure.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Taken together, the experiments and matched simulations present a conundrum; despite the simulations being broadly successful at capturing the behaviour of these DNA-colloid systems for forming other crystals28,35,39,40, they fail to capture the experimental occurrence of DD crystallites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility is that the phase that nucleates and grows initially is not DD, but an unknown parent phase that transforms to the DD structure once the crystallite has grown to a finite size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Motivating this possibility is the observation of similar Martensitic transformations in other DNA-colloid29,35 and DNA-nanoparticle41 crystallites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis would suggest that the nucleating configuration is governed by subtle rearrangements that have relaxed out in the fully grown crystallite, but which must be known to reliably compute nucleation barriers using current methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Predicting suitable rearrangements a priori is made difficult by the extreme floppiness of the DD lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in a cubic crystallite with 432 particles, the DD lattice exhibits 631 floppy modes, compared with only 93 for the CsCl lattice we studied previously35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternative but related explanation is suggested from experiment: the (111) facets in the DD crystallites consistently display clear reconstruction near the surface, resulting in a banded structure, while the crystal deeper inside remains well ordered, as shown in Fig 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presumably, reconstructions such as these allow the formation of additional AB contacts, reducing the surface-free energy in a similar manner to the well-studied reconstructions in diamond-like atomic systems such as silicon42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It seems possible that similar reconstructions in the critical nucleus could lower the nucleation barrier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the lack of observation of DD crystals when using same-sized A and B spheres, and their maximum occurrence at size ratio 0.88 may provide useful clues for future elucidation of the structure of the critical nuclei or transformational intermediates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Crystallites surfaces display lattice reconstruction.On the surface of (111) crystallite facets, pairs of smaller, A particles appear to draw together, forming doublets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gives rise to a banded or striped density modulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ad) In some crystallites, this banding is incoherent or can exist in multiple directions resulting in small rhombi of four particles, as in b upper right.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (eh) In other crystallites, the banding is more coherent, spanning the crystals surface and penetrating deeper into the interior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No obvious reconstructions are apparent for (100) or (211) facets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images show confocal sections separated by 0.5 m in depth, lightly processed with a digital sharpen filter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar is 2 m.Full size image', 'Scale-up of our DD crystallites to macroscopic materials would likely benefit from controlled nucleation on a microfabricated template11, perhaps along the (100) or (211) growth faces that are nearly flat and appear to display little surface reconstruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photonic applications will also require the substitution of high refractive index microspheres as well as the cross-linking, chemical removal of the smaller spheres and freeze- or critical-drying.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond such engineering concerns, discovering the relevant nucleation pathway and surface relaxation processes for our observed DD crystals will require further experiments and simulations, but whose resolution may open up currently unanticipated pathways for self-assembling other diamond-like or perhaps even more exotic structures.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
