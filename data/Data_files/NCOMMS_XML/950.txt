Measurement of the cosmic optical background using the long range reconnaissance imager on New Horizons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The cosmic optical background is an important observable that constrains energy production in stars and more exotic physical processes in the universe, and provides a crucial cosmological benchmark against which to judge theories of structure formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurement of the absolute brightness of this background is complicated by local foregrounds like the Earths atmosphere and sunlight reflected from local interplanetary dust, and large discrepancies in the inferred brightness of the optical background have resulted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Observations from probes far from the Earth are not affected by these bright foregrounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we analyse the data from the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) instrument on NASAs New Horizons mission acquired during cruise phase outside the orbit of Jupiter, and find a statistical upper limit on the optical backgrounds brightness similar to the integrated light from galaxies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that a carefully performed survey with LORRI could yield uncertainties comparable to those from galaxy counting measurements.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The cosmic optical background (COB) is the summed emission from all sources outside of our Milky Way galaxy emitted at wavelengths roughly corresponding to those visible with the human eye.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is a powerful diagnostic of the emission from known astrophysical processes in galaxies including stellar nucleosynthesis, mass accretion onto black holes and the gravitational collapse of stars1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparison of the COB intensity to the surface brightness arising from known galaxy populations can reveal the presence of diffuse backgrounds produced by more exotic phenomena such as the decay of particle species outside the standard model or light from objects outside of galaxies4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Direct photometric measurement of the COB has proven to be challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The earths atmosphere is several orders of magnitude brighter than the COB, and accounting for the various relevant emission, absorption, and scattering effects is a daunting task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sunlight scattered from interplanetary dust (IPD) particles in the Solar system, known as Zodiacal light when viewed from the earth, also produces a large foreground to direct measurement of the COB from vantage points in the inner Solar system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though progress has been made in carefully accounting for the atmosphere and Zodiacal light in the optical7,8 and into the near-IR9,10,11,12,13,14, as it is typically  greater than 100 times brighter than the COB small errors in this accountancy propagate to large errors on the COB15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is thus desirable to measure the COB from vantage points where the earths atmosphere and the light from IPD are not appreciable components of the diffuse sky brightness, such as the outer parts of our Solar system17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though many planetary probes have had optical-wavelength cameras, they are rarely designed with the demands of extragalactic astronomical observations in mind.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Two exceptions to this are the early NASA probes Pioneer 10 and 11, which were instrumented with imaging photopolarimeters (IPPs) that returned measurements of the sky brightness ranging from 1 to 5.3 a.u.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data have been used to measure both the decrease in the IPD light with heliocentric distance19, diffuse light from the Galaxy20,21 and the brightness of the COB itself22,23 using the two IPP bands spanning 390500 and 600720 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Pioneer measurements remain the most stringent constraints of the COB23, and have uncertainties dominated by errors associated with subtracting galactic components including the integrated light from stars (ISL) and diffuse galactic light (DGL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'NASAs New Horizons spacecraft24 recently performed the first detailed reconnaissance of the PlutoCharon system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It includes as part of its instrument package the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager25,26,27 (LORRI), an optical camera with sensitivity over a broad 440870 nm half-sensitivity passband.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, rather than a scanning photometer like the IPP, LORRI is a Newtonian telescope with characteristics including excellent pointing stability, a 20.8 cm diameter Ritchey-Chrétien telescope, an 0°.3 × 0°.3 instantaneous field of view, 1 × 1 pixels, and (crucially) real-time dark current monitoring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The achieved point source sensitivity of LORRI is V=17 in a 10 s exposure in 4 × 4 pixel on-chip rebinning mode, making it a sensitive astronomical instrument.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result of this sensitivity and angular resolution, much of the starlight that challenged the earlier Pioneer measurements can be resolved out in LORRI images, providing a relatively clean measurement of diffuse astrophysical emission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this paper, we use archival data from the New Horizons checkout and cruise phases to measure the COB from several vantage points in the Solar system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We correct for dark current in the detectors, mask bright stars from the images, assess the amplitude of residual starlight, sunlight from interplanetary dust and diffuse galactic light, and correct for galactic extinction to measure =4.7±7.3(stat.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nW m2 sr1, giving a 2 statistical upper limit of  nW m2 sr1, which excludes some of the early results in the literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This measurement is based on a very limited data set with characteristics that complicate astrophysical examination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that a carefully designed survey of the COB from LORRI beyond the orbit of Pluto has the potential of definitively measuring its surface brightness away from the complicating effects of the earths local interplanetary dust cloud.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Data set', 'In this study we concentrate on the 4 × 4 pixel rebinned LORRI exposures, for which on-chip summing has been used to improve the surface brightness sensitivity over the native-resolution data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This rebinning mode is particularly advantageous in the small signal regime where the read noise penalty is large.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rebinned images have spatial resolution of 4.3 over a full 256 × 256 (super-)pixel frame.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We term magnitudes in this LORRI band RL, as it is close to (though much broader than) the Johnson-Cousins R-band at 640 nm (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28); in fact the LORRI bandpass covers essentially all of astronomical V, R and I bands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'New Horizons was launched 19 January 2006.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The path of New Horizons through the Solar system is summarized in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 90 days after launch, some 359 dark data sets were acquired by LORRI while approximately 1.9 a.u.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  from the sun.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During this time, the LORRI dust cover was in place over the telescope aperture, providing close to optically dark conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cover was ejected on 2006 August 29, and shortly thereafter a series of images of the open star cluster Messier 7 were acquired.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these data, the New Horizons team determined a preliminary photometric calibration, a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) pointing jitter of 0.45 pixels, and geometric distortion  less_than 0.2 pixels across the field of view27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following this, a series of short exposure test images was acquired, and at the beginning of 2007 the first science image was taken of Callirrhoe, a small irregular moon of Jupiter, with a full 10 s exposure time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A series of images of Jupiter and its immediate environment were then acquired during an encounter, which we do not consider here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Closest approach to Jupiter occurred on 28 February 2007.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the Jupiter encounter, New Horizons entered cruise phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LORRI data were acquired on an approximately annual basis, and consisted of 10 s observations of distant Solar system objects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current public archival data records end 20 July 2014, approximately a year before the Pluto encounter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: The trajectory of New Horizons through the solar system.Data collection periods of relevance to this study are indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the xy and rz planes are shown (a,b, respectively), with the axes in solar ecliptic units and .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  New Horizons was launched from Earth at 1 a.u., and the data with the LORRI dust cover in place were acquired at 1.9 a.u., just beyond Mars orbit at 1.5 a.u.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (inner blue dotted lines).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dust cover was ejected near 3.6 a.u., and the data were acquired before and during an encounter with Jupiter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data considered here were taken between 2007 and 2010 while New Horizons was in cruise phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The red vectors indicate the relative positions of fields 14 compared to the sun and plane of the ecliptic.Full size image', 'We cut the data using requirements on integration time, solar elongation and thermal dust emission, following which we are left with fields 14 whose characteristics are summarized in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Data sets used in this analysis.Full size table', 'COB measurement', 'The brightness in an arbitrary image of the astronomical sky acquired above the Earths atmosphere  can be expressed as:', '', 'where  is the brightness associated with interplanetary dust,  is the brightness associated with resolved stars,  is the brightness associated with residual starlight from stars too faint to be detected individually or the faint wings of masked sources,  is the brightness of the DGL,  is the brightness of the COB,  is a factor accounting for absorption in galactic dust, and  is brightness associated with the instrument including all potential contributions to the measured zero-point offset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The major difficulty with COB measurements is that, with the exception of , each of these sources can have an isotropic component, which is problematic since the COB itself is isotropic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, care must be taken to understand and correct for the brightness of each component, particularly those that appear constant over angular scales similar to the field of view of the instrument.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We isolate  using three basic steps: mask stars near or brighter than the detection threshold to remove the effect of ;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'These data show the power of LORRI for precise, low-foreground measurements of the COB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measurement presented here is not consistent with the earlier HST-WFPC2 constraints7, but is consistent with both the Pioneer23 and dark cloud8 measurements, as well as the -ray inference29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This measurement constrains the possibility of a COB significantly in excess of the expectation from IGL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Though the bandwidth required to telemeter the data from the outer Solar system constrains the number of observations possible, with a carefully designed survey we should be able to produce a definitive measurement of the diffuse light in the local universe, and a tight constraint on the light from galaxies in the optical wavebands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LORRIs ability to resolve much of the starlight has significantly reduced the potential for foreground contamination compared to measurements from the Pioneer IPP, and the LORRI field is small enough that bespoke ground-based assessments of the faint starlight in each field are conceivable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, a future LORRI survey would benefit from careful design and pre facto observations of the survey fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the total integration time used in this measurement was only 260 s, a total integration time of 4.5 h would allow us to achieve 1 nW m2 sr1 statistical uncertainties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because LORRI can allow 30 s integrations, this hypothetical measurement would require 500 integrations, which is not prohibitive in terms of data storage nor telemetry requirements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It would be particularly useful to observe high galactic latitude fields at a variety of ecliptic latitudes and solar elongations to search for IPD light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though likely to be too faint to detect, models suggest there may be an increase in the IPD population towards the Kuiper Belt from collisional material30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase may be observable in the IPD light intensity with a carefully designed, deep survey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the very least, observations of the inner Solar system from New Horizons perspective may provide useful new information about the global structure of the IPD cloud.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, currently unpublished instrument calibration information such as susceptibility to off-axis light and detailed pointing stability assessments could improve the accuracy of this kind of measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A primary lesson learned from this analysis is that, following the accurate removal of ISL, the DGL estimate becomes the largest source of uncertainty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the uncertainty in the measured 100 m background level, the DGL-I100 m scaling, and the galactic latitude dependence of the scattering, this component varies by approximately the expected brightness of the IGL in each of our fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Field 1 is very close to the galactic pole where the DGL should be faint, but even here the models and observations suggest the DGL brightness could vary from 4 to 11 nW m2 sr1 at one s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future observations with LORRI should concentrate on the lowest I100 m fields available on the sky to minimize the uncertainty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If many statistically independent fields are sampled, the DGL-I100 m linear regression technique we briefly explore should permit measurement of the optical-thermal infrared correlation precise enough to allow sub- nW m2 sr1 determination of the COB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Improved DGL characterization using other techniques are also of continuing importance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This measurement of the COB brightness, while not currently as precise as those from Pioneer23, is important as it suffers from completely different instrumental and foreground uncertainties as the existing measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also the only measurement sensitive to the I-band 700900 nm wavelength range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though some challenges remain, further data from LORRI could provide a definitive measurement of the extragalactic background light at optical wavelengths, and may be instrumental in completing our understanding of the history of stars and galaxies in the universe.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Observational data', 'The basic New Horizons flight timeline is given in Supplementary Table 1, including a summary of the data taken during the checkout and cruise phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LORRI bandpass has an effective wavelength of =655 nm for a flat-spectrum source, with half power response from 440870 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementary Table 1 indicates the dates of the observations, the notional targets, the number of integrations available, the exposure time per integration, as well as astrophysical information like the heliocentric distance , solar elongation , and the 100 m specific intensity I100m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, we refer to each data set with a field number, running over D14, R110 and 14, using the numbering scheme presented below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We performed cuts on the full data set to account for various factors affecting the data quality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we restricted our attention to the data with integration times tint greater than 1 s, eliminating sets R14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, because the large-angle response of the LORRI telescope shows response from diffuse scattering of sunlight illuminating the light baffle31, we remove data for which e less_than 90°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, many of these LORRI data sets are taken at low galactic latitudes where the DGL is bright.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We exclude data sets for which I100m greater than 10 MJy sr1, which removes fields R5 and R710 from analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though excluding much of the most useful data is not ideal, these fields are measured very close to the Galactic plane where the contamination from the local environment precludes careful measurement of the faint signals from either the COB or interplanetary dust in reflection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data reduction', 'The archival LORRI data are available in a format in which they have already been processed through several instrument calibration steps including bias correction, smear correction and relative pixel response correction27,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, the raw data consists of voltages measured at the end of the exposure reported in data numbers (DN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first step of the processing, the median of the dark reference pixels is used to subtract the global reference voltage, and a reference super-bias frame measured during ground testing is used to correct for bias variations over the array.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, image smearing and flat field corrections measured during ground calibration are used to account for image smearing and relative pixel response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The files that are input to our processing have units data number per integration time and, though they have been partially processed, must be: astrometrically registered; masked for known detector defects, transients, and bright astronomical objects; corrected for instrumental effects; and calibrated to photometric units.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Example images of the four science fields in this study are shown in Supplementary Fig 1, calibrated to I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Astrometric registration', 'Astrometric registration is required to allow masking of bright stars, which is necessary to account for .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functionally, this means we want to ensure that each pixel in an image is accurately associated with a pair of right ascension and declination coordinates, (, ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determine the orientation and the scale of each image using the publicly available astrometric calibration software package http://astrometry.net33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The algorithm uses a four-step procedure in which: bright sources in each image are detected; the detected sources are divided into subsets whose relative positions are recorded and matched against a pre-built index; the solution is verified using predictive star position checks; and, the final alignment information is returned to the user in a Flexible Image Transport System (fits) header for each file.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the LORRI data, this algorithm successfully solved the astrometric registration for each field independently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, constant parameters of the instrument like the pixel size and image distortions are found to be consistent between observations over the entire data set, with very small uncertainties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The registration information returned by the software package is used to calculate (, ) for every pixel in each image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Masking', 'To reliably measure the diffuse sky brightness, it is necessary to exclude residual instrumental signal and detectable point sources from the images that contribute to  and , respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We implement image masks to remove brightness associated with: stars near or brighter than the detection limit; pixels that may suffer from electronic or optical pathologies; and cosmic rays and other transient events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To mask stars, we use the USNO-B1 catalog34, which provides photometric fluxes in approximately Johnson-Cousins B, R and I bands over the entire sky.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though in some regions this catalog reaches completeness of V=21, it is nonuniform and source fluxes are calibrated to only 0.25 mag accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We synthesize the RL flux by fitting a linear model to the USNO-B1 measurements and compute the LORRI band-weighted integral of the flux for each source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compromise between maximal removal of stars and minimal removal of galaxies that contribute to the COB, we mask the fields at a flux limit of RL=17.75, which is 1 mag below the 1 point source sensitivity in the images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This threshold has the added benefit of moving the mask flux threshold away from the USNO-B1 catalog completeness limit where the survey uniformity is problematic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given LORRIs small field of view, we calculate that the error introduced in the final COB estimates due to accidentally masking galaxies at the bright end of the number counts35 is 0.006 nW m2 sr1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A search of the available optical data in these fields is consistent with the number counts, and we find that no exceptionally bright galaxies fall into these fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To build an appropriate source mask, we also require accurate knowledge of the instrument point spread function (PSF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use a stacking method36 to sum the emission from all RL less_than 16 sources in the image to form an estimate of the LORRI PSF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, for each source brighter than the magnitude limit, we interpolate the image onto a ten times finer grid centered on the cataloged source position, and sum all such postage-stamp images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each postage-stamp image, pixels far from any star images or masked pixels are used to calculate the zero point of the image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No lower magnitude limit is required as none of the images contain stars bright enough to induce non-linear response in the detector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stacked PSF is shown in Supplementary Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compute the uncertainty in the PSF by performing two stacks, one stacking on a random half of the sources in the catalog and the other on the other half.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find a FHWM of 1.53±0.05, consistent with both laboratory26 and in-flight37 measurements of the PSF of 1.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We mask stars in each LORRI image by using the band-weighted magnitude estimate m to calculate a radius around each source to exclude from analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This radius r(m) is computed from:', '', 'where the free parameters are determined empirically from the data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, mlim=17.7 at RL-band and r(m) has units of pixels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the efficacy of this mask as a function of magnitude, we simulate noiseless images of the stars in each field per magnitude bin, apply the mask, and then calculate the residual surface brightness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find the largest contribution to the residual brightness is from stars near the limiting magnitude, which contribute at most 0.15 pW m2 sr1 per source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brighter sources have larger masks and contribute less total surface brightness as there are fewer of them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculate the total flux left in the images from residual unmasked star flux as part of the ISL assessment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The data used in our COB study have a variety of Solar system objects as their primary targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though Haumea and Makemake should be faint in the optical (R greater than 15), even at a distance of 23.2 a.u.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neptune appears bright in the LORRI images (R7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To account for this, we uniformly mask the central 2.3 × 2.3 from each of the science images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of Neptune, this corresponds to 35R, which is significantly beyond the outermost known ring at 2.6R and the brightest moons (including Triton at 14.3R).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Neptunian system does extend further, with a small moon orbiting 2,000R (at this distance 2°.2) from the planet, and we cannot exclude the possibility that a dust halo far from the planet is reflecting sunlight and increasing the surface brightness in the LORRI image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We do not observe residual structure in these images, so any such contamination from a circum-Neptunian dust cloud is relatively faint.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In principle, Haumea and Makemake may have their own dust clouds, and we cannot exclude the possibility from these data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result of these considerations, formally our measurements must be considered to be upper limits to the surface brightness of the COB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future observations away from known Solar system objects would be beneficial in this regard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For the Neptune field, the image of the planet is bright enough to induce charge transfer artifacts in the detector, so we mask three pixel wide stripes in both the vertical and horizontal directions of each image.

the ghosts in the field 1 images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To reduce contamination from known defects, we mask both the outermost five pixels in the image, as well as pixels that are consistently non-responsive or saturated in the images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we apply a clip mask which excludes pixels  greater than 3 from the mean value of each image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This excludes pixels with transient contaminants like electrical or digitization error and cosmic rays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On average, we exclude only 100 pixels in this -clipping step, corresponding to a % loss.

approximately isotropic component of .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The operating temperature of the LORRI charge coupled device (CCD) is 200 K, so based on the performance of similar devices we might expect the dark current to be negligible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the COB measurement is more robust if the dark current contribution can be completely characterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An important feature of the LORRI CCD is the presence of rows of 4 × 1,024 (or 1 × 256 in rebinned mode) dark pixels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are optically active pixels that are shielded from incident light by means of a metal lip, but are otherwise identical to the optically active pixels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These pixels are used in the LORRI data reduction pipeline to remove the combination of dark current and voltage bias in the images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, these have the added benefit of giving a fixed reference of the detector array performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To characterize the long-term performance and stability of the detector, we compare the measurements performed with the dust cover in place against those taken with the dust cover off.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The photocurrent in the

calibration after the flat field correction and we are not interested in the spatial structure of the images, errors in the applied pixel-to-pixel response should have a negligible effect on the final result.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only situation in which such an error could have a measurable impact is if the regions immediately surrounding the calibration stars had some local inter-pixel response different from the bulk of the detector array, and different than that measured during laboratory testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To guard against this, we used calibration stars in random positions on the
