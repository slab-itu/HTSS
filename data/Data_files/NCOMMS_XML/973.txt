Climate warming reduces the temporal stability of plant community biomass production  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Anthropogenic climate change has emerged as a critical environmental problem, prompting frequent investigations into its consequences for various ecological systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Few studies, however, have explored the effect of climate change on ecological stability and the underlying mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conduct a field experiment to assess the influence of warming and altered precipitation on the temporal stability of plant community biomass in an alpine grassland located on the Tibetan Plateau.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that whereas precipitation alteration does not influence biomass temporal stability, warming lowers stability through reducing the degree of species asynchrony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, biomass temporal stability is not influenced by plant species diversity, but is largely determined by the temporal stability of dominant species and asynchronous population dynamics among the coexisting species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that ongoing and future climate change may alter stability properties of ecological communities, potentially hindering their ability to provide ecosystem services for humanity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'One of the basic attributes of an ecological system is its stability1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since stable ecosystems are important for providing sustainable ecosystem functioning and services to humanity3, understanding the drivers of ecological stability has emerged as a pressing issue in a period when many ecosystems are experiencing significant anthropogenic change4,5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Much recent attention has focused on the temporal stability of community biomass production, known to be influenced by several mutually nonexclusive mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, changes in biodiversity may result in changes in biomass temporal stability6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the one hand, biodiversity may influence biomass temporal stability because more diverse communities are more likely to contain species that are resistant to environmental fluctuations (the sampling effect9,10,11,12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, biodiversity can have a positive influence on biomass stability via promoting asynchronous population dynamics among species13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, absent biodiversity change, variation in the degree of asynchrony in population dynamics, in response to variation in abiotic and biotic conditions, may also lead to changes in community biomass stability6,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, the population stability of dominant species may strongly influence community biomass stability, especially when communities are dominated by a small number of species18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, climate change that alters biodiversity, the degree of species asynchrony and/or the stability of dominant species may have the potential to alter the temporal stability of community biomass production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The average global temperature has increased by 0.065 °C per decade since 1880, accompanied by significant changes in precipitation patterns21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These rapid climate changes, unprecedented in human history, are likely to profoundly affect the functioning of Earths ecosystems22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Climate warming has been demonstrated to influence community structure24,25,26 and species interactions27,28,29 that could potentially translate into changes in community biomass stability30,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, changes in precipitation could alter community biomass production33, species diversity34 and species relative abundance patterns35 that may also have consequences for biomass stability16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the effects of climate warming and altered precipitation on community properties, including stability, may not be independent of each other, given that warming is expected to impose its strongest effect under drought conditions33,36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies manipulating both warming and precipitation to assess their influence on community biomass stability are vital for predicting ecosystem dynamics under future climate change scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we report on a 5-year field experiment investigating the influence of climate warming and altered precipitation on the temporal stability of plant biomass production of an alpine grassland on the Tibetan Plateau (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Tibetan Plateau has an area of 2.5 million km2, with 64% of this region occupied by alpine grassland that provides essential ecosystem services for humans living in the region38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the worlds highest plateau (4,500 m above sea level on average), the Tibetan Plateau has experienced more rapid climate warming (0.4 °C per decade over the past 50 years) than average, coupled with increasing and greater interannual variation in precipitation38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Climate warming and altered precipitation are known to influence net primary production24, biogeochemical cycles38, litter decomposition40 and rangeland quality41 in this region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, their effects on the temporal stability of this important ecosystem are unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We aimed to explore how future climate change would affect biomass temporal stability and elucidate the role of potential mechanisms in driving the observed stability response to climate change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that climate warming reduces the temporal stability of community biomass via reducing the degree of species asynchrony, independent of precipitation effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that ongoing and future climate change may reduce the ability of the alpine grassland and other similar ecosystems to provide reliable ecosystem services for humanity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Much of the Earth is experiencing climate warming and change in precipitation patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ecologists have just begun to explore their consequences for ecological stability; three aspects of our study, however, distinguish it from the few previous studies on this topic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, while the few studies of climate change effects on temporal stability have considered either warming31,32 or precipitation16,17, our study examines both warming and precipitation effects in a single experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, our study was conducted on the Tibetan Plateau that, as the worlds largest and highest plateau, is considered highly susceptible to climate change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study thus represents a rare exploration of climate change impacts on stability in an ecologically important but vulnerable habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third and most important, our study demonstrated that climate warming could reduce biomass temporal stability via reducing species asynchrony, independent of precipitation effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Many studies, including field observations42,43, experiments that directly manipulated diversity8,44,45,46 and theoretical models47,48,49, have shown that increasing species diversity tends to increase biomass temporal stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, we also found a significant positive relationship between species diversity and biomass temporal stability as revealed by linear regression (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that climate warming reduced species diversity in our experiment, as also found in other studies conducted in the same ecosystem24,50, one might think warming-induced diversity decline contributed to the decline in biomass stability under warming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, species diversity was not retained in the SEM as a significant predictor of biomass stability (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, increasing precipitation significantly increased species diversity, but precipitation alteration did not affect biomass stability (Figs 1 and 4 and Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possible explanation for the lack of species diversity effect on biomass stability in our experiment is that changes in species richness (24 species) under our experimental treatments were relatively small compared with community-level species richness (26 Sp.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Probably more importantly, most of the lost/gained species in response to our experimental treatments were rare species that accounted for only a small fraction of community biomass (Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These rare species contributed relatively little to community biomass stability compared with species asynchrony and the stability of dominant species (see below), making species diversity an unimportant driver of community biomass stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Asynchrony in population dynamics across species is a common feature of ecological communities51,52 and could be attributed to asynchronous species responses to environmental fluctuations2,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most important finding of our study is that climate warming reduced species asynchrony, translating into reduced community biomass stability under warming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under climate warming, a few species, including Helictotrichon tibeticum and Medicago archiducis-nicolai, increased in abundance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the majority of species, which constituted 75% of community members, declined in abundance under warming, resulting in less asynchronous population dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result contrasts with that of a warming experiment in a temperate steppe, where neither daytime nor nighttime warming altered species asynchrony32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discrepancy may be explained by temperature being a stronger limiting factor (that is, cold temperature constrains biological processes29) in the alpine grassland than the temperate steppe, translating into stronger species responses to the same amount of warming in the alpine grassland.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Probably also because of the limitation of plant growth by cold temperatures, we found that precipitation alteration did not influence species asynchrony or biomass stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This contrasts with the results of several studies conducted in temperature grasslands, where increased precipitation was found to promote species asynchrony16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results highlight the context dependency of how climate changes influence biomass stability and associated mechanisms, emphasizing the need to explore the combined effects of warming and altered precipitation in other ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A growing body of evidence suggests that community biomass stability tends to show positive associations with the stability of dominant species5,17,19,53,54,55,56 that may even constrain the effects of species diversity on biomass stability57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings reinforce these ideas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important characteristic of dominant species in our study is their greater temporal stability than less abundant species (Supplementary Fig 2), a finding that has also been reported by several other studies32,54,57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, neither climate warming nor altered precipitation affected the temporal stability of these dominant species that exhibited strong positive relationships with community biomass stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our experiment, the two dominant species, Stipa aliena and Elymus nutans, accounted for approximately half (48.7%) of community biomass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were relatively insensitive to environment fluctuations, probably because of their greater nutrient acquisition ability through well-developed root systems, and their greater light acquisition ability through taller canopy and larger specific leaf area in this alpine region24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Common and rare species represented 30.2% and 66.0% of species richness, respectively, but they accounted for only 40.1% and 11.2% of community biomass, respectively (Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, there was no significant relationship between community temporal stability and common or rare species stability in our experiment (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the significant positive relationship between dominant species stability and community biomass stability supports the mass ratio hypothesis58, highlighting the importance of dominant species for ecosystem functioning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our study provides new empirical evidence that climate warming can have a negative effect on the temporal stability of community biomass production, independent of precipitation scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that future climate change may reduce the ability of our study system, the alpine grassland that covers much of the Tibetan Plateau, to provide reliable ecosystem services for humanity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies should assess the generality of this result to other ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our study identified weakened species asynchrony as the main reason of why warming reduced the temporal stability of community biomass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elucidating how population dynamics of individual species respond to climate change in a community context thus holds the key to understanding changes in community stability properties under future climate scenarios.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Study site', 'Our study site is located at the Haibei Alpine Grassland Ecosystem Research Station (101°12E, 37°37N, and 3,200 m above sea level) on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau in Qinghai Province, China.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This area has a continental monsoon climate, with a 6-month growing season (from mid-April to mid-October).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean annual temperature is 1.1 °C, with an extreme maximum air temperature of 27.6 °C in July, and an extreme minimum temperature of 37.1 °C in January.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean annual precipitation is 485 mm, with  greater than 80% of the precipitation falling in the growing season.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The soil is classified as Mat-Gryic Cambisol, with the average pH value of surface soil (010 cm) being 6.4 (refs 59, 60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The alpine grassland is dominated by perennial plants, including S. aliena, E. nutans, H. tibeticum, Kobresia capillifolia, Carex przewalskii, Poa annua, M. archiducis-nicolai, Tibetia ruthenia, Gentiana straminea and Saussurea superba.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These species together account for 70% of aboveground net primary production (g m2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Experimental design', 'Our experimental plots were established within an area of 50 m × 110 m in 2011, using a randomized block design with warming and altered precipitation as main treatment factors (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each block contained six treatments, crossing two levels of warming (no warming, warming) and three levels of precipitation (no precipitation, drought (50% precipitation reduction) and wet (50% precipitation addition)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each treatment had five replicates, resulting in 30 plots; each plot was 1.8 m × 2.2 m.
