A rheostat mechanism governs the bifurcation of carbon flux in mycobacteria  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Fatty acid metabolism is an important feature of the pathogenicity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis during infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consumption of fatty acids requires regulation of carbon flux bifurcation between the oxidative TCA cycle and the glyoxylate shunt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Escherichia coli, flux bifurcation is regulated by phosphorylation-mediated inhibition of isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICD), a paradigmatic example of post-translational mechanisms governing metabolic fluxes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that, in contrast to E. coli, carbon flux bifurcation in mycobacteria is regulated not by phosphorylation but through metabolic cross-activation of ICD by glyoxylate, which is produced by the glyoxylate shunt enzyme isocitrate lyase (ICL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This regulatory circuit maintains stable partitioning of fluxes, thus ensuring a balance between anaplerosis, energy production, and precursor biosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rheostat-like mechanism of metabolite-mediated control of flux partitioning demonstrates the importance of allosteric regulation during metabolic steady-state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sensitivity of this regulatory mechanism to perturbations presents a potentially attractive target for chemotherapy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, shares with HIV and malaria the distinction of being one of the deadliest infectious diseases of our time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lipids and fatty acids are thought to serve as important sources of carbon and energy for M. tuberculosis during infection1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dual use of these substrates places a premium on metabolic regulatory mechanisms to ensure a balance between metabolite oxidation for energy gain and metabolite conservation for biomass production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle that are diverted into biosynthetic pathways must be replenished by anaplerotic reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During growth on glycolytic substrates, anaplerosis involves transformation of glycolytic intermediates (C3-units) into TCA cycle intermediates (C4-units).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These fluxes are absent during growth on fatty acids, which enter central carbon metabolism mainly as acetyl-CoA (C2-units).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, a fraction of the TCA cycle intermediate isocitrate is diverted into the glyoxylate shunt, bypassing the oxidative decarboxylation steps in the TCA cycle and replenishing intermediates that are used for biosynthesis of cellular constituents3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since both pathways are essential under these conditionsthe glyxoylate shunt for anaplerosis, the oxidative TCA cycle for energy and biosynthetic precursorsbalancing the flux ratio at the bifurcation of these pathways is critical4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In enteric bacteria, the glyoxylate shunt is activated by transcriptional induction of the catabolite-repressed genes encoding isocitrate lyase (ICL) and malate synthase (MLS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After such transcriptional activation, the flux ratio between the oxidative TCA cycle and the glyoxylate shunt is controlled by post-translational regulation mediated by reversible phosphorylation5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This regulation is achieved by partial inactivation of isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICD), which competes with ICL for their shared substrate (isocitrate)8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bifunctional enzyme AceK catalyzes both the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of ICD to render the enzyme inactive and active, respectively8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In contrast to E. coli, the molecular mechanisms that control partitioning of carbon fluxes between the TCA cycle and glyoxylate shunt are not understood in mycobacteria, despite the important role of flux bifurcation in M. tuberculosis pathogenicity10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report that phosphorylation of ICD does not play a role in controlling the bifurcation of isocitrate fluxes between the TCA cycle and glyoxylate shunt in M. smegmatis, which encodes only one ICD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In M. tuberculosis and M. bovis BCG, which encode two ICD isoforms12,13, we demonstrate that only ICD2 (homologue of ICD in M. smegmatis) has an important physiological role under the tested growth conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of ICD phosphorylation, we present evidence that flux partitioning between the TCA cycle and the glyoxylate shunt is mediated by cross-activation of ICD by glyoxylate produced by ICL.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'ICD2 is exclusively required for oxidative TCA cycle flux', 'M.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  tuberculosis and M. bovis BCG encode two distinct isoforms of ICD: ICD1 (409 AA) and ICD2 (745 AA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The M. smegmatis genome encodes a single ICD (743 AA), a homologue of ICD2 in M. tuberculosis and M. bovis BCG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both isoenzymes (ICD1 and ICD2) are biochemically active in vitro14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To study the relative contributions of the isoenzymes to oxidative TCA cycle fluxes in vivo, we generated gene deletion strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ICD activity is undetectable in ICD2-deficient M. smegmatis and ICD2-deficient M. bovis BCG but is indistinguishable from wild-type in ICD1-deficient M. bovis BCG (Table 1; Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An ICD2-deficient strain of M. smegmatis cultured in Middlebrook 7H9 medium shows a late growth phenotype that coincides with depletion of glutamate from the culture medium (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glutamate auxotrophy of the ICD2-deficient strain was confirmed by demonstrating that ICD2 is required for growth on minimal medium lacking glutamate (Fig 1b; Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incubation of ICD2-deficient bacteria in minimal medium without glutamate supplementation leads to decreased levels of metabolites downstream of ICD (-ketoglutarate and glutamate) (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, loss of ICD2 increases the levels of metabolites upstream of ICD (citrate/isocitrate) compared with wild-type and complemented bacteria cultivated in media devoid of glutamic acid (Fig 1c), as expected upon perturbation of a metabolic enzyme15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In M. bovis BCG, deletion of icd2 results in glutamate auxotrophy, whereas deletion of icd1 has no effect (Fig 1d; Supplementary Table 1), and glutamate prototrophy is restored by complementation of the icd2 strain with a plasmid encoding icd2 (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ICD2-deficient M. smegmatis and M. bovis BCG lose viability

activity, we evaluated whether partitioning of fluxes between the TCA cycle and the glyoxylate shunt occurs in mycobacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used dynamic 13C-tracing to estimate the flux ratio between the two competing pathways23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conversion of isocitrate to succinate is either through the oxidative branch of the TCA cycle or through the glyoxylate shunt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since both pathways conserve the two carbon atoms of acetyl-CoA, the initial dynamics of the M+2 mass isomer of succinate (before extensive reshuffling of labelled carbons) after shifting cells from unlabelled acetate to U-13C-acetate are informative to determine the relative contributions of the two converging metabolic fluxes (Fig 4a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shifting cells from unlabelled glucose to U-13C-glucose resulted in similar dynamics of the M+2 isomer fraction of -ketoglutarate and succinate over the first 320 s that were comparable between wild-type (Fig 4c) and ICL-deficient (icl1 icl2)

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Despite the importance of fatty acid catabolism during M. tuberculosis infection10, the mechanisms that regulate the partitioning of metabolite fluxes at the bifurcation of the oxidative TCA cycle and the glyoxylate shunt remain unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strict regulation of fluxes at this metabolic branch-point is essential during catabolism of C2-units derived from fatty acids in order to balance anaplerotic fluxes (glyoxylate shunt) and fluxes generating energy and biosynthetic precursors (TCA cycle) (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that this balance is mediated by metabolite-based regulation of ICD2 activity, whereas imbalancing of branch-point fluxes by overexpression of ICD1 inhibits growth on acetate (Fig 6a; Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This growth-inhibitory effect is presumably caused by directing too much flux into the oxidative TCA cycle at the expense of the glyoxylate shunt, analogous to E. coli mutants deficient in phosphorylation-mediated inhibition of ICD29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interpretation is consistent with limited viable flux combinations of ICL and ICD on acetate compared with glucose, as modelled by computational flux-balance analysis using either of these two substrates as the sole carbon source (Fig 6b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of ICD activity not only impairs growth on media with acetate as the sole carbon source but also leads to the loss of viability over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that perturbation of flux partitioning at the branch-point of the TCA cycle and glyoxylate shunt might present a potential strategy for chemotherapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could be achieved by modulating the metabolic fluxes to favour the TCA cycle over the glyoxylate shunt, which would impair anaplerosis in cells catabolizing fatty acid substrates during infection in vivo30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Dysregulation of the ICL/ICD rheostat balance impairs growth on acetate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Growth of wild-type, attB::Pnpicd1 and attB::Phspicd1 strains of M. bovis BCG in glucose-based (left) or acetate-based (right) minimal medium without glutamate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The attB::Pnpicd1 strain expresses icd1 from the native promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The attB::Phspicd1 strain overexpresses icd1 from the strong hsp60 promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are means±s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (n=3 independent experiments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Computationally modelled phase planes of carbon flux between ICD and ICL in glucose-based (left) or acetate-based (right) medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heat maps show scales of predicted growth (maroon, best growth;

initial ligand file (sdf file, two-dimensional structure) was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The glyoxylate was prepared for ligand docking using LigPrep from the Schrodinger suite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Default parameters in the ligand preparation process were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single low energy conformer with proper bond lengths and angles was generated from the two-dimensional structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protonation state was adjusted to match a pH of 7.4, tautomeric states were explored, and a final minimization step was performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glyoxylate was then docked inside the rigid 3D structure of the protein receptor (ICD), previously prepared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glyoxylate was docked in the binding pocket and no other possible poses were found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An extra precision-docking revealed a binding energy of 6 kcal mol1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)', 'ITC experiments were conducted on an

injected into a solution of MsmICD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the competitive titration experiment, glyoxylate was injected into a solution of the enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Titrations were carried out with a stirring speed of 750 r.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and 300-s intervals between 4 l injections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first four injections were excluded from data fitting because effective mixing in the cell took longer than the injection intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Titrations were run past the point of enzyme saturation to correct for heats of dilution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimental data were fit to a theoretical titration curve using the Origin software package (version 7.0) provided with the instrument to afford values of KA (the association constant in M1), n (stoichiometry of binding), and H
