Circadian deep sequencing reveals stress-response genes that adopt robust rhythmic expression during aging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Disruption of the circadian clock, which directs rhythmic expression of numerous output genes, accelerates aging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To enquire how the circadian system protects aging organisms, here we compare circadian transcriptomes in heads of young and old Drosophila melanogaster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The core clock and most output genes remained robustly rhythmic in old flies, while others lost rhythmicity with age, resulting in constitutive over- or under-expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, we identify a subset of genes that adopted increased or de novo rhythmicity during aging, enriched for stress-response functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These genes, termed late-life cyclers, were also rhythmically induced in young flies by constant exposure to exogenous oxidative stress, and this upregulation is CLOCK-dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also identify age-onset rhythmicity in several putative primary piRNA transcripts overlapping antisense transposons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that, as organisms age, the circadian system shifts greater regulatory priority to the mitigation of accumulating cellular stress.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The circadian system confers integrated temporal control to organismal processes at the molecular, cellular, physiological and behavioural levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cellular clocks are based on negative feedback loops driven by core clock genes, which oscillate with 24 h periodicity and are largely conserved from flies to mammals1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Drosophila, two transcription factors encoded by the genes Clock (Clk) and cycle (cyc) form the positive arm of the clock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Active CLK-CYC heterodimers stimulate transcription of target genes including the negative clock components encoded by period (per) and timeless (tim), which repress CLK-CYC activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Entrainment of clock oscillations to LD cycles involves the photoreceptive protein CRY, which initiates degradation of TIM (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oscillating clock components impose rhythmic expression on a diverse portfolio of target clock-controlled genes (CCGs) that continues to expand as sensitivity of detection techniques improve2,3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These CCGs ultimately generate molecular and cellular rhythms, which profoundly influence metabolism and tissue homoeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disruption of the clock is associated with accelerated aging in mice, manifested in metabolic dysregulation7 and impairments of learning and memory8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the core molecular oscillator plays a conserved role in regulating the response to oxidative stress9,10,11, which increases during aging12 and contributes to age-related pathologies13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, clock disruption also leads to increased oxidative damage and susceptibility to neurodegeneration in brains of aging Drosophila14,15 and mice16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite substantial evidence that circadian disruption shortens healthspan, the mechanisms by which the clock protects aging organisms are not understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this question, here we conduct an RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) study and compared diurnal expression of clock genes and CCGs in heads of young and old female flies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detect dynamic reprogramming of the circadian transcriptome with some CCGs showing dampened or abolished oscillations in old flies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, a large subset of CCGs showed significantly larger expression amplitudes or de novo rhythmicity in old flies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stress-response genes were enriched among transcripts with age-induced rhythmicity, hereafter called late-life cyclers (LLCs), and we show that exogenous oxidative stress can induce rhythmic LLC expression in young flies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that LLC activation is a strategy by which the clock helps organisms adapt to their changing cellular environments during aging.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Pervasive alterations in rhythmic gene expression', 'To identify age-dependent changes in diurnal gene expression, we performed RNA-seq with RNA from heads of 5- or 55-day-old w1118 (w) females collected every 4 h for one daily cycle in two biological replicates in light-dark (LD) 12:12 h. Gene expression, quantified in units of Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM) using the Tuxedo suite18,19 (Supplementary Table 1), showed high correlations between biological replicates in both young and old flies (Supplementary Fig 1; Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using ARSER (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20), we identified 2,036 genes to be rhythmic in young flies, including 67% of genes previously deemed rhythmic at the messenger RNA (mRNA) level in heads of male flies3; this overlap is substantial considering differences in sex and periodicity detection methods (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ARSER classified 1,887 genes to be rhythmic in old, including 922 that were also rhythmic in young (Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although many CCGs maintained similar rhythmicity patterns throughout aging, a substantial number of genes showed marked changes in phase, amplitude or statistical rhythmic status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, 297 genes rhythmic in both young and old flies exhibited a 2 h shift in their time of peak expression (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, 48 genes were highly rhythmic in young flies but arrhythmic in old, while 38 genes were highly rhythmic in old and arrhythmic in young flies (Fig 1a, Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examples of other age-related expression changes are shown in Fig 1be.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA-seq expression plots for all FlyBase genes and isoforms are available at: http://hendrixlab.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/youngAndOldExpression.html.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: RNA-seq reveals diverse classes of age-dependent rhythmicity changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Heat map representing loss or gain of gene expression rhythmicity with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each column represents a single-time-point for a single-replicate sampled at 4 h intervals starting at Zeitgeber Time (ZT) 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hue represents the Z-score (FPKM minus mean over s.d.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of each gene (row) at each time point (column) for a given biological replicate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes in the top half are rhythmic in young and arrhythmic in old;

however, qRT-PCR with RNA from 75-day-old flies corroborated prior reports of a decline in Clk levels in very old age21 (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast with prior qPCR data21,22, RNA-seq revealed per peak expression to increase with age, and this was confirmed by qPCR (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, PER protein levels decreased significantly by day 55 (Fig 2c,d; Supplementary Fig 3), consistent with previous reports21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the opposite age-dependent changes in per and tim RNA levels suggest that the core circadian mechanism known in young flies may be altered during aging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Core clock gene expression in young and old flies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Age-dependent expression of three clock genes (RNA-seq).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each period of ZT 020 represents a distinct biological replicate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals reported by Cuffdiff.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) qRT-PCR expression of per, tim and Clk in heads of females aged to 5, 55 and 75 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression is reported as per cent of peak expression in day 5 flies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are mean (from two cycles)±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) PER western blot from heads of young or old w flies collected at indicated ZT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The arrow indicates PER protein, with estimated molecular weight of 127-130 kDA, depending on the phosphorylation status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) PER levels (mean±s.e.m.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  from western blot in c;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'This genome-wide study uncovers the diverse changes in daily RNA expression patterns that occur in heads of aging flies and provides new insights into mechanisms linking clock function and protection from oxidative damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that during aging, several LLCs adopt de novo transcriptional rhythms that can also be induced in young flies by exogenous oxidative stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because OS directly promotes neurodegeneration in flies26 and mice16, LLCs may be a missing link underlying observations that age-related increases in OS are exacerbated by disruption of circadian clocks8,14, and that clock mutations accelerate OS-induced neurodegeneration in aging flies15 and mice16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, a recent postmortem study of gene expression in the human brain reported some daily transcript levels to show significantly better correlations with sinusoidal curves in the 60-yr-old group than in the  less_than 40-yr-old group35, suggesting potential conservation of the LLC phenomenon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to identifying numerous annotated genes with de novo rhythmicity in old flies, we also identified LLC-like putative primary piRNAs overlapping transposons in antisense.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because transposon mobilization increases during aging and may contribute to age-related neuronal decline in Drosophila36, we propose that late-life activation of circadian piRNA expression is a novel strategy by which the molecular oscillator preserves genomic integrity during aging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our study provides first insights into the mechanism of LLC regulation, which involves CLK, the rate-limiting master regulator of circadian transcription in Drosophila37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data support a model in which the circadian system enlists LLCs late in life to mitigate damage resulting from potentially diverse sources of cellular and genotoxic stress that accumulate during aging.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

genes and isoforms, separately from those annotated in the FlyBase genome annotation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that expression of some de novo assembled transcripts, including the four LLC-like putative primary piRNA transcripts (Fig 5), could not be reliably quantified because most of their reads aligned with high per cent identity to multiple genomic loci according to Bowtie 2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, each of these four assembled transcripts aligned only once with 100% identity according to the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics BLAT tool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Because of their short length resulting in unstable FPKM calculations, pre-microRNA hairpins were excluded from all subsequent analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'All genome browser tracks showing RNA-seq

daily cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The P value used as a significance threshold for empirical JTK_CYCLE was the empirical P value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes reported as rhythmic have a median expression 1 FPKM, a max/min fold-change 1.5 and a P value0.05 in accordance with published thresholds for rhythmicity detection5,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although all three methods showed substantial agreement (Supplementary Fig 10), ARSER showed the strongest proportional overlap between genes rhythmic in old versus young flies (Supplementary Table 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, to be conservative when identifying age-dependent changes in rhythmicity, we used ARSER output for subsequent analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For basic comparisons, we define highly rhythmic as P value0.01, and arrhythmic as P greater than 0.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison of overlap between our set of genes rhythmic in young females and genes reported by others as rhythmic in heads of young males3, we evaluated the per cent overlap with genes that mapped to IDs in Flybase release 6.06.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Differential rhythmicity analysis', 'We assigned an SDR to each gene having an ARSER P value less_than 1 and median expression 1 FPKM in young or old flies, and nonzero expression in at least one time point in young and old flies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then assigned P values to these normally distributed SDR values and subsequently computed their false discovery rates (FDRs) using the BH procedure to adjust for multiple hypothesis testing (Supplementary Fig 4a and b)23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the resulting set of significantly (FDR 0.05) differentially rhythmic genes, we defined our top LLCs as those rhythmic in old flies (max/min fold-change1.5 and ARSER P value0.05) with at least one isoform satisfying the rhythmicity criteria imposed at the gene level in old flies (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'When identifying genes with the strongest improvements in rhythmicity with age, we found that many genes either showed trivial expression levels and low peak/trough fold change in young but robust amplitudes in old, or showed enhanced precision in the periodicity of their expression with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A few, including ImpL3, fell into both of these categories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We sought to define a metric that would incorporate these two patterns of differential rhythmicity, and to this end we developed a differential rhythmicity score calculated as follows:', '', 'SDR is the sum of two Z-scores divided by ; the factor of  in the denominator ensures that it obeys a standard normal distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first term, ZP, is a Z-score computed for the age-dependent change in periodicity, , using the P values from ARSER in young and old.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second

average expression over samples for a given age, and to identify significantly differentially expressed genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using all the samples for a given age in a batch analysis using Cuffdiff
