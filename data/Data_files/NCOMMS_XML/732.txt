L-type calcium channels regulate filopodia stability and cancer cell invasion downstream of integrin signalling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mounting in vitro, in vivo and clinical evidence suggest an important role for filopodia in driving cancer cell invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a high-throughput microscopic-based drug screen, we identify FDA-approved calcium channel blockers (CCBs) as potent inhibitors of filopodia formation in cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, we discover that L-type calcium channels are functional and frequently expressed in cancer cells suggesting a previously unappreciated role for these channels during tumorigenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further demonstrate that, at filopodia, L-type calcium channels are activated by integrin inside-out signalling, integrin activation and Src.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, L-type calcium channels promote filopodia stability and maturation into talin-rich adhesions through the spatially restricted regulation of calcium entry and subsequent activation of the protease calpain-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether we uncover a novel and clinically relevant signalling pathway that regulates filopodia formation in cancer cells and propose that cycles of filopodia stabilization, followed by maturation into focal adhesions, directs cancer cell migration and invasion.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cell motility is involved at every stage of tumorigenesis and contributes to primary tumour growth, cancer cell dissemination and metastasis formation1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As metastasis remains the leading cause of cancer-related morbidity in patients with solid tumours3, there is an immediate need to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the cellular structures and signalling pathways that drive cancer cell migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To migrate, cells interact and sense the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) via transmembrane adhesion receptors such as integrins4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Integrin function is controlled by a conformational switch between active and inactive states that determine ECM ligand interaction and subsequent receptor signalling5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Integrin activation from within the cell (integrin inside-out signalling) is promoted by several mechanisms including the Rap1-RIAM-talin pathway and leads to integrin-ECM engagement (integrin outside-in signalling) and the recruitment and activation of a large number of proteins including the oncogenic kinases focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src to the integrin4,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Filopodia are actin-rich finger-like protrusions that extend from the plasma membrane and have been implicated in cell migration and invasion both in vitro and in vivo8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Filopodia are assembled at the front of invading cancer cells8,9,10 and filopodia-like structures promote cancer cell survival at metastatic sites11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several filopodia-inducing proteins such as the molecular motor myosin-X (MYO10) or the actin-bundling protein fascin promote cancer cell invasion both in vitro and in mouse models and are associated with poor patient prognosis in multiple carcinoma types8,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, interfering with filopodia formation could be a viable strategy to inhibit cancer metastasis in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MYO10 is a homodimeric molecular motor which is upregulated in breast cancer where its expression correlates with mutant p53, poor prognosis and increased metastatic potential13,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monomeric MYO10 is inactive and localizes to the cytosol or to Rab7-positive vesicles16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MYO10 activation, promoted by PI(3,4,5)P3, results in motor dimerization and drives filopodia formation by transporting actin regulators, cellcell adhesion receptors and integrins to filopodia tips.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we describe a novel druggable and clinically relevant pathway regulating MYO10-positive filopodia formation and stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unbiased high-throughput microscopy screens reveal that L-type calcium channels, through regulation of calcium entry at filopodia tips, drive filopodia stabilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, L-type calcium channels are expressed and frequently altered in many human cancers and contribute to cancer cell invasion by regulating filopodia downstream of 1 integrin and Src activation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'L-type calcium channel blockers inhibit filopodia formation', 'To identify novel regulators of filopodia formation, cancer cells expressing MYO10-GFP (to induce and visualize filopodia) were treated with a library comprising over 500 compounds for 1 h and imaged using high-throughput microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of MYO10-positive spots was automatically quantified to determine the average number of filopodia per cell (Supplementary Fig 1AD, see methods for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this screen, several L-type calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were identified as compounds that consistently inhibit filopodia formation (Supplementary Figs 1D and 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In validation experiments, four structurally distinct CCBs (amlodipine besylate, felodipine, manidipine dichloride and cilnidipine) were demonstrated to significantly reduce the number of MYO10-induced filopodia in breast cancer cells as efficiently as a PI3K inhibitor (positive control to block MYO10 activity16), whereas a treatment with zonisamide (inhibits t-type calcium channels, voltage-gated sodium channels and carbonic anhydrase) or bumetanide (inhibits the Na+/K+/2Cl cotransporter) failed to affect filopodia number (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained in pancreatic cancer cells following CCB treatment (Supplementary Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, overall inhibition of calcium entry into cells by EGTA-mediated chelation of extracellular calcium dramatically reduced the number of MYO10-induced filopodia (Supplementary Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data indicate that calcium entry into cells via L-type calcium channels positively regulates filopodia formation in cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: L-type calcium channel blockers (CCBs) inhibit filopodia formation and L-type calcium channels are functional in cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) MDA-MB-231 cells transiently expressing MYO10-GFP and adhering to fibronectin (FN) were treated with various compounds (10 M) for 1 h, fixed, stained for actin and imaged on a TIRF microscope (scale bar, 20 m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of MYO10-positive filopodia was counted for each cell and displayed as a box plot (three biological repeats, n greater than 100 cells, ***P value less_than 8.3 × 1017).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Relative expression of the four genes encoding the L-type calcium channel 1 subunit across 676 commonly used cancer cell lines19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene expression read counts are displayed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The value 7.99 corresponds to non-detected (ND).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selected cell lines are annotated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) MDA-MB-231 cells transiently expressing the calcium probe (pGP-CMV-GCaMP6s) and adhering to FN were treated with an L-type calcium channel activator (BAY K8644;

PDAC, P53R172H; Su.86.86, P53G245S) significantly impaired cancer cell invasion (Fig 2ac), in a concentration-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig 5A,B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, treatment with zonisamide or bumetanide had no effect on cancer cell invasion (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, upregulation of MYO10 expression lead to filopodia formation and was sufficient to drive cancer cell invasion in non-invasive cell lines in a CCB sensitive manner (Fig 2d; Supplementary Fig 5C,D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional L-type calcium channels and PI3K activity were also important for regulation of directionality during 3D cell migration on cell-derived matrices (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, MYO10 expression facilitates filopodia formation and invasion whereas inhibition of L-type calcium channels using CCBs or inhibition of PI3K impedes filopodia formation, directional cell migration and cancer cell invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: L-type calcium channels regulate filopodia formation and cancer cell invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded into an inverted invasion assay in the presence of various compounds (10 M) where indicated for 48 h.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Here, we define the foundation of a druggable and clinically relevant signalling pathway (Fig 8c) that regulates filopodia formation and stability in cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, L-type calcium channels are expressed in human cancer and targeting their function with FDA-approved CCBs impairs filopodia formation and blocks cancer cell invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistically, we establish a link between a localized increase in calcium concentration at filopodia tips, mediated by L-type calcium channels and filopodia stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, integrin inside-out activation and ligand binding is indispensable for filopodia formation and appears to be the first critical step in this process following MYO10-dependent delivery of integrins to filopodia tips.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent steps require integrin outside-in signalling to trigger Src activation and the spatially restricted calcium entry at filopodia tips and the activation of the calcium-regulated protease calpain-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we demonstrate that filopodia stabilization appears to precede focal adhesion maturation and propose that cycles of filopodia stabilization and focal adhesion maturation direct cell migration and invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The central position of L-type calcium channels in cancer cell invasion was very unexpected as these voltage-gated channels (expression and activity) are considered to be restricted to excitable cells (neuronal and muscle cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, several studies report roles for L-type calcium channels in many other cell types including fibroblasts, kidney cells and endometrial and prostate cancer cells36,37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, analyses of available gene expression data sets by us (this study) and others25 revealed a wide expression of L-type calcium channels in many cancer cell lines and clinical samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, CACNA1D, which localizes to filopodia tips and contributes to cancer cell invasion in vitro (shown in this study), was found to be expressed in patient samples in all major breast cancer subtypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The pathway delineated here as fundamental for filopodia formation in cancer cells shares some similarities with calcium-regulated processes identified in normal excitable cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In rat smooth muscle cells 51 integrin signalling has been described to promote CACNA1C-mediated calcium entry in cells through Src phosphorylation of CACNA1C on Y2122 (refs 39, 40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hovewer, this phosphosite does not appear to be conserved in the CACNA1D or CACNA1S isoforms identified in our study as drivers of filopodia formation in cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether integrins promote calcium entry through another, yet unidentifed, Src phosphorylation site within CACNA1D or CACNA1S or through another mechanism remains to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In neurons, calcium signalling, and in particular L-type calcium channels and calpains, have been implicated in filopodia formation and stability in growth cones42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our discovery that non-excitable carcinoma cells have the potential to employ these calcium-dependent processes in malignant invasion was unanticipated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the relationship between calcium concentration at filopodia tips and filopodia stability in cancer cells is intriguing and appears to be important for directing the migratory process during cancer cell invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In neurons, the formation of dendritic filopodia is induced by small local spikes in calcium concentration and is further stabilized by accumulation of calcium in the newly formed filopodia43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parallels between filopodia formation and stability in neurons and cancer cells could be another example of how cancer cells can hijack physiological pathways to favourably promote the metastatic process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that inhibition of other calcium-regulated proteins, associated with filopodia processes in neurons, such as calcineurin and calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (refs 44, 45) does not affect filopodia formation in the MDA-MB-231 cancer cells used in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the future, it will be important to define the calpain-1 target/s involved in filopodia stabilization in cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'L-type calcium channels are primarily activated by depolarizing membrane potentials, raising important questions on how these channels may be regulated in non-excitable cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, L-type calcium channels can be activated by rather weak depolarization events (55mV to positive)18 and cancer cells have been reported to have depolarized membrane potential compared with their healthy counterparts46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, MDA-MB-231 cells used in this study have a resting membrane potential of around 20 mV (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  47) which may facilitate the activation of L-type calcium channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would suggest that, in cancer cells with depolarized membrane potential, L-type calcium channels could be constitutively open, easily activated by small changes in membrane potential or regulated by other cues (such as activation of 1 integrin and/or Src signalling).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, a recent study identified an interaction between 1 integrin and one of the L-type calcium channel regulatory subunits in Hela cells48, suggesting that, in addition to roles in L-type calcium channel activation, 1 integrins could also dictate L-type calcium channel sub-cellular localization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we present evidence that a pathway integral to filopodia stability is clinically relevant in breast cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pathway involving integrin-driven stabilization of filopodia is potentially relevant to other carcinomas, in particular cancers harbouring p53 mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously demonstrated that MYO10 levels correlate with gain of function p53 mutations in human breast tumours, increased metastasis and poor prognosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, a gain of function mutation of p53 is sufficient to promote MYO10 expression13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are in conjunction with the observation that p53-mutated cancer cells display a high number of filopodia at the cell front during cell invasion9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another mechanism whereby mutant p53 drives cell invasion is by promoting the co-recycling of 51 integrin and growth factor receptors, such as EGFR, to the cell front6,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased EGFR signalling leads to the local activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway which, in turn, promotes filopodia formation in a RhoA- and FHOD3 formin-dependent manner9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased PI3K activity downstream of EGFR signalling may also support filopodia formation by promoting PIP3 production and MYO10 activation16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, increased 51 integrin recycling to the cell front and downstream signalling (shown in this study) will ultimately lead to an upregulation of Src activity which will enhance filopodia formation and stabilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we propose that filopodia stability directs cell migration and promotes cancer cell invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of filopodia to drive directional translocation of cells is probably linked to our observation that adhesions formed at filopodia tips are followed by formation of focal adhesions upon membrane advancement and subsequently give rise to new filopodia which stem from the newly formed adhesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that filopodia are involved in many biological processes ranging from the development of the nervous system, to angiogenesis and cancer invasion, the delineation of a pathway regulating the individual steps of filopodia kinetics may have wide therapeutic implications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, as inhibition of L-type calcium channels blocks cancer cell invasion in vitro, it will be important to focus further studies on the potential of these channels as cancer targets using pre-clinical cancer models.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
