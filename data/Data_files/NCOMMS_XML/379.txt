A microfluidics-based in vitro model of the gastrointestinal humanmicrobe interface  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Changes in the human gastrointestinal microbiome are associated with several diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To infer causality, experiments in representative models are essential, but widely used animal models exhibit limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present a modular, microfluidics-based model (HuMiX, humanmicrobial crosstalk), which allows co-culture of human and microbial cells under conditions representative of the gastrointestinal humanmicrobe interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate the ability of HuMiX to recapitulate in vivo transcriptional, metabolic and immunological responses in human intestinal epithelial cells following their co-culture with the commensal Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) grown under anaerobic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we show that the co-culture of human epithelial cells with the obligate anaerobe Bacteroides caccae and LGG results in a transcriptional response, which is distinct from that of a co-culture solely comprising LGG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HuMiX facilitates investigations of hostmicrobe molecular interactions and provides insights into a range of fundamental research questions linking the gastrointestinal microbiome to human health and disease.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The human microbiome is emerging as a key player governing human health and disease1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent high-resolution molecular analyses have linked microbial community disequilibria (dysbiosis), primarily in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), to several idiopathic diseases, including diabetes3, obesity4, inflammatory bowel disease5, cancer6 and, most recently, neurodegenerative diseases7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a detailed understanding of the fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying hostmicrobe interactions and their potential impact on immune regulation, drug metabolism, nutrition and infection remain largely elusive8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, patterns of association between distinct microorganisms, their traits and disease states resolved using meta-omics do not allow direct causal inference, and thus experimental validation is essential10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, robust experimental models that allow the systematic manipulation of variables are required to test the multitude of hypotheses that arise from the generated high-dimensional data sets10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animal models used in human microbiome research are physiologically not representative11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro models that mimic microbial processes along the GIT allow the simulation of luminal microbial communities12,13,14 and/or mucus-adherent microbiota15,16, but typically do not include provisions for assessing human host responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Host responses to GIT microbiota have traditionally been assessed following the exposure of cultured human cells to bacteria-free supernatants17 or through short-term direct-contact co-cultures involving, for example, Transwell systems18, microcarrier beads19 or mouse gut organoid models20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent advances in multi-layer microfluidics have led to the development of a gut-on-a-chip model that includes a provision for peristalsis21 and that has been used to study intestinal inflammation on a chip22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These humanmicrobial co-culture approaches are, however, limited in their scope because they only allow experiments with commensal and/or mutualistic microorganisms growing under aerobic conditions21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome these limitations, the recently introduced hostmicrobiota interaction (HMI) module, which interfaces with the in vitro simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem model, incorporates a semi-permeable membrane between co-cultured human enterocytes and bacteria23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through inclusion of a partitioning membrane between the human and microbial culture chambers, the HMI module allows the co-culture of intestinal cells with complex microbial communities under microaerophilic conditions23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This two-chamber design requires intermittent perfusion of the human cell culture medium to the apical surface of the epithelial cells, which is not representative of the continuous supply of nutrients to the basal membrane seen in vivo24,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of modularity makes it difficult to include additional cell types of relevance to the GIT in the HMI module, for example, immune cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it prevents the extraction of biomolecular fractions from the individual co-cultured cell contingents following specific experimental regimes and thereby renders the HMI module incompatible with downstream high-resolution molecular analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the HMI module currently is the most representative in vitro model of gastrointestinal hostmicrobial interactions, there still remains an unmet need for a modular, representative in vitro model of the gastrointestinal humanmicrobe interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we present a modular microfluidics-based humanmicrobial co-culture model, HuMiX, which overcomes the majority of the limitations of existing in vitro models and allows the partitioned yet proximal co-culture of representative human and microbial cells followed by downstream molecular analyses of the individual cell contingents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, we demonstrate the viable co-culture of differentiated human epithelial cells (Caco-2) with either a facultative anaerobe, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), grown solely under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, or grown in combination with an obligate anaerobe, Bacteroides caccae, under anaerobic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-culture experiments were followed by detailed molecular analyses of the effects of the induced co-cultures on the physiology of human and bacterial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of our results with published in vitro and in vivo data sets demonstrates the ability of HuMiX to representatively mimic the gastrointestinal humanmicrobe interface.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results and Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Design and characterisation of the HuMiX model', 'To overcome the limitations of existing in vitro models10,23, we developed a modular microfluidics-based device, which allows the establishment of a model of the gastrointestinal humanmicrobe interface, named HuMiX (human-microbial crosstalk) (Fig 1ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The device consists of three co-laminar microchannels: a medium perfusion microchamber (henceforth referred to as the perfusion microchamber), a human epithelial cell culture microchamber (henceforth referred to as the human microchamber) and a microbial culture microchamber (henceforth referred to as the microbial microchamber; Fig 1a,b; Supplementary Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each microchamber has a dedicated inlet and outlet for the inoculation of cells as well as for the precise control of physicochemical parameters through the perfusion of laminar streams of dedicated culture media (Fig 1d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dedicated outlets provide means to collect eluates from the individual chambers for downstream characterisation (Fig 1d; Supplementary Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By juxtaposing the human and microbial cell contingents at a distance of 0.5-1 mm across a separatory nanoporous membrane, the HuMiX model is representative of a healthy intact epithelial barrier10 (Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the model integrates oxygen sensors (optodes) for the real-time monitoring of the dissolved oxygen concentrations within the device (Fig 1a,b,d; Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the challenges associated with measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) on a chip27, a specially designed version of HuMiX, which allows the insertion of a commercial chopstick style electrode (STX2; Millipore), was fabricated to monitor TEER for the characterisation of cell growth and differentiation within the device (Fig 1d; Supplementary Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: The HuMiX model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Conceptual diagram of the HuMiX model for the representative co-culture of human epithelial cells with gastrointestinal microbiota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Annotated exploded view of the HuMiX device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The device is composed of a modular stacked assembly of elastomeric gaskets (thickness: 700 m) sandwiched between two polycarbonate (PC) enclosures, and each gasket defines a distinct spiral-shaped microchannel with the following characteristics: length of 200 mm, width of 4 mm and height of 0.5 mm, amounting to a total volume of 400 l per channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Semi-permeable membranes affixed to the elastomeric gaskets demarcate the channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pore sizes of the membranes were chosen for their intended functionality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A microporous membrane (pore diameter of 1 m), which allows diffusion-dominant perfusion to the human cells, is used to partition the perfusion and human microchambers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A nanoporous membrane (pore diameter of 50 nm) partitions the human and microbial microchambers to prevent the infiltration of microorganisms, including viruses, into the human microchamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Photograph of the

the medium with dinitrogen gas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Diagrammatic overview of the HuMiX co-culture protocol.Full size image', 'Following the conceptualisation and engineering of the HuMiX model (Supplementary Note 1), we developed an optimised protocol for the co-culture of human epithelial cells with gastrointestinal microbes (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The human cell line and bacterial isolates used for the co-culture experiments were originally obtained from the human large intestine and, together with the physical characteristics of the model (Supplementary Note 1), allowed the assembly of a model representing the humanmicrobe interface of the human colon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, given the modularity of the device and the flexibility of its set-up, other sections of the human GIT may also be modelled following appropriate modifications to the presented model (Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protocol includes an extensive sterilisation and handling procedure that enables the culture of human epithelial cells (Caco-2) in antibiotic-free DMEM medium to allow their subsequent co-culture with bacteria in HuMiX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Caco-2 cell line was chosen because it represents the most widely used model for the human gastrointestinal epithelial barrier, as it exhibits essential functional and physiological traits of the intestinal epithelium25,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differentiation of the epithelial cells was evaluated by measuring TEER of the Caco-2 cell monolayer (Fig 2a) and through microscopic observation of the expression of the tight junction protein occludin (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: In vitro co-culture of human and microbial cells inside the HuMiX device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Characterisation of

monolayers, we initiated co-cultures of these cells with LGG grown in anoxic DMEM medium (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LGG of the phylum Firmicutes was chosen, as it represents a commensal facultative anaerobic bacterium originally isolated from the human GIT29,30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, extensive data exist on its physiological impacts on mammalian mucosal tissues in vivo32,33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The developed co-culture protocol (Fig 1e) first results in the establishment and maintenance of an epithelial cell monolayer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Caco-2 cells adhere to the collagen-coated microporous membrane (Fig 1a,e; Supplementary Note 1), proliferate and differentiate into confluent cell monolayers that form tight junctions between adjacent cells (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diffusion-based perfusion of the cell culture medium to the basal side of the Caco-2 cells through the microporous membrane mimics the intestinal blood supply and provides shear-free conditions accelerating the growth of the human cells35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Co-culture with LGG was initiated after 7 days of epithelial cell culture (day 9 of the HuMiX co-culture protocol; Figs 1e and 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This first involved the introduction of anaerobically grown LGG cell suspensions into the microbial microchamber through the port on a three-way connector (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Following the co-culture, the modular device architecture allows access to individual cell contingents on disassembly, whereby one half of each of the cell contingents can be used for microscopic evaluation and the other half can be used for the extraction of intracellular biomolecules (DNA, RNA, proteins and metabolites) for subsequent high-resolution molecular analyses36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The viability of the co-cultured contingents was determined via livedead staining and subsequent fluorescence microscopy, demonstrating that no apparent cytotoxic effects were induced in either cell contingent following their co-culture (Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA electropherograms confirmed that high-quality biomolecular fractions were obtained from the individual co-cultured contingents (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Due to the laminar flow profiles within the microchambers, eluate samples (Fig 2f) can be recovered from each microchamber, thereby providing a means to continually monitor the effects of the co-culture on the individual co-cultured cell contingents through various analyses, such as the use of cytokine assays and metabolomic profiling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Visible differences in the eluates from the three proximal microchambers support the notion of distinct microenvironments in each of the microchambers (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Integrated oxygen sensors (optodes) allow continuous monitoring of the dissolved oxygen concentrations in the perfusion and microbial microchambers (Fig 1e; Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simultaneous perfusion of oxic (21% dissolved O2) and anoxic (0.1% O2) media through the perfusion microchamber and the microbial microchamber, respectively, allowed the establishment and maintenance of an oxygen gradient representative of the in vivo situation (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured dissolved oxygen concentrations in the perfusion microchamber stabilised to 5.43±0.137% for the final 12 h of co-culture between the Caco-2 cells and LGG, which is comparable to the actual recorded concentrations in human intestinal tissues, that is, 4.6% (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  37; Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oxygen profiles in the microbial microchamber were characterised by a rapid decrease in the oxygen concentration (from 2.6 to 0.8% of dissolved oxygen), following an intermittent spike due to the introduction of small amounts of oxygen into the microbial microchamber during the inoculation process of LGG (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The established anoxic conditions are analogous to those observed in vivo between the mucus layer and the luminal anaerobic zone (0.88%; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38) and such oxygen concentrations have been reported to be favourable for the growth of diverse microbiota, including obligate anaerobes39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gradient of oxygen in the HuMiX model was maintained through the continuous perfusion of anoxic media (0.1%) into the microbial microchamber and further shaped by the consumption of oxygen by Caco-2 cells and the facultative anaerobe LGG (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Through the consumption of oxygen, anaerobic niches are established in the microbial microchamber, which subsequently allow colonisation of the microbial microchamber by obligate anaerobes40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To showcase the ability of HuMiX to sustain culture of an obligate anaerobe, we initiated co-cultures using a simple microbial consortium comprising LGG in combination with B. caccae (Supplementary Figs 2b and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  B. caccae was chosen as it represents an obligate anaerobic commensal that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes, the other dominant phylum apart from the Firmicutes (LGG) constituting the human GIT microbiome41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both organisms were inoculated in equal starting proportions (optical density (OD) 1) and co-cultured with Caco-2 cells for 24 h (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The consortium was sustained via continuous perfusion of anoxic DMEM medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The consortium structure was determined using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing after 24 h of co-culture, and the relative abundances of Bacteroides spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and Lactobacillus spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  were found to be 69 and 31%, respectively (Fig 2h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results confirm the ability of the HuMiX model to support the growth of an obligate anaerobic microbial strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human cells still exhibited tight junctions (Supplementary Fig 3a) and both contingents were viable (Supplementary Fig 3b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It follows from these experiments that the inclusion of more complex communities into the HuMiX model is possible but goes beyond the scope of the reported proof-of-concept experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Furthermore, to demonstrate the ability to incorporate other cell types within HuMiX, we cultured non-cancerous colonic cells, i.e., CCD-18Co, in the human microchamber (Supplementary Fig 4a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, to demonstrate that HuMiX can be used in a three-layered set-up for addressing specific research questions, we cultured primary CD4+ T cells in the perfusion microchamber of HuMiX (Supplementary Fig 4c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primary CD4+ T cells were cultured in the absence (Supplementary Fig 4c,d) or presence of LGG (Supplementary Fig 4e,f) over 48 h and did not exhibit any significant differences in terms of cell viability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments highlight the potential of HuMiX to be used for investigating the cellular mechanisms involved in the interplay between GIT bacteria and different human cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, HuMiX exhibits the following essential characteristics: (1) modular microfluidic device architecture consisting of three microchambers engineered to facilitate the proximal co-culture of human and microbial cells; (2) ability to perfuse the device with dedicated culture media to allow the establishment of aerobic conditions for human cell culture and anaerobic conditions for GIT bacteria; (3) real-time monitoring of oxygen concentrations; (4) easy access to the individual cell contingents following specific experimental regimes; and (5) compatibility with end point microscopic assays as well as high-resolution multi-omic analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'HuMiX recapitulates in vivo responses', 'Given the demonstrated ability to establish conditions representative of the human GIT in HuMiX, we conducted further validation experiments to assess the human cellular responses with respect to different co-culture conditions in HuMiX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LGG has been widely used in several human clinical trials aimed at understanding the efficacy of probiotic treatments in humans32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, gene expression differences have been documented in human intestinal mucosal biopsy samples after the administration of LGG to either healthy subjects32 or as a therapeutic supplement for male individuals suffering from esophagitis33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, to validate our in vitro co-culture approach, we performed detailed experiments involving the co-culture of Caco-2 cells maintained under aerobic conditions with LGG cultured under anaerobic conditions (Supplementary Fig 2a) and compared the resulting Caco-2 gene expression data with reference data from clinical studies32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, total RNA was first extracted from Caco-2 cells following their co-culture with LGG grown under anaerobic conditions as well as their corresponding LGG-free controls (anoxic medium was perfused through the microbial microchamber, but no bacteria were inoculated, Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RNA was then subjected to DNA microarray-based messenger RNA and microRNA (miRNA) profiling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Overall, we identified 208 genes that were differentially expressed following co-culture with LGG grown under anaerobic conditions (fold change (FC) greater than 1.5 and equivalently with swapped conditions for decreased expression, P less_than 0.01, empirical Bayes moderated t-statistic (BtS); Fig 3a; Supplementary Fig 5a; Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the lack of detail regarding the identities of the majority of genes found to be differentially expressed in vivo, we limited our subsequent analyses and discussions to genes that were explicitly highlighted in the in vivo clinical studies and that showed statistically significant differences in our study (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the top differentially expressed genes, we validated the gene expression of four genesccl2, pi3, egr1 and mt2ausing quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RTqPCR) analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RTqPCR results showed differential expression patterns analogous to those observed in the microarray data

through the comparison of HuMiX-based co-cultures with LGG grown under anaerobic conditions compared with the corresponding LGG-free controls32,33 (Table 1; Supplementary Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The co-culture involving LGG in HuMiX resulted in the up- and downregulation of 127 and 81 genes in the Caco-2 cells, respectively (Supplementary Table 1; FC greater than 1.5 and P less_than 0.01, BtS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the co-culture of Caco-2 with LGG resulted in the differential expression of eight genes (egr1, ccl2, slc9a1, ubd, cxcr4, mybl2, pim1 and cyp1a1 (Table 1; Supplementary Fig 5a: Supplementary Note 2; P less_than 0.05, BtS)), which had also been found to be differentially expressed in human intestinal biopsy samples after the administration of LGG32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the genes described above, we also identified four (elf3, cdk9, gadd45b and pilrb) genes, previously highlighted as responsive to LGG in human subjects32,33 (Table 1), but the expression of these genes was found to be disparate when comparing our results to the in vivo expression data (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highlighted differences in the expression of these four genes are likely due to the reduced complexity of the microenvironment, the human epithelial cells and the microbiota used in our proof-of-concept experiments compared with the in vivo situation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we found a high degree of concordance in responsive pathways (for example, interferon response, calcium signalling and ion homeostasis) in Caco-2 cells following their co-culture with LGG grown under anaerobic conditions when compared to the available in vivo mucosal transcriptomic data32,33 (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3; Supplementary Note 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The inoculation of HuMiX with LGG is more similar to the primocolonisation of germ-free animals than its introduction into an already mature GIT microbiome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At present, the only systematic in vivo study highlighting the host transcriptomic response to the primocolonisation by LGG was conducted in germ-free piglets34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with the findings from the latter study, our data also highlight a differential expression in eight genes (all P less_than 0.03, BtS; Table 1; Supplementary Note 4), which also exhibited an altered transcriptional response in mucosal tissues of gnotobiotic piglets 24 h after their inoculation with LGG34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Caco-2 cells are known to secrete distinct cytokines analogous to immune cells when they are challenged with different microbial stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-8 (IL-8) and CCL20 by Caco-2 cells following direct co-culture with microbial strains42,43 or the application of cell-free microbial supernatants and/or other microbial products is well established44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, they represent a good model for assessing the specific immunological responses to different microorganisms and their products18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test for similar responses in Caco-2 cells when co-cultured in HuMiX, we sampled eluate from the perfusion microchamber (which is in contact with the basal side of the Caco-2 cells) before and 24 h after co-culture with LGG grown under anaerobic conditions, and we screened for immunological markers, including IL-8 and CCL20 (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No statistically significant increase (paired Students t-test (StT); P less_than 0.3) but an apparent slight decrease (Fig 3b) in the pro-inflammatory cytokines released by the human epithelial cells was observed when they were co-cultured for 24 h with LGG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation (Fig 3b) is in agreement with previous findings, suggesting a subtle anti-inflammatory effect by LGG on human epithelial cells44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to the highlighted cytokine and transcriptional responses of Caco-2 cells, the proximal co-culture of host and microbial cells has the potential to elucidate the complex molecular crosstalk that may induce metabolic changes in the host and microbial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, to demonstrate the potential of HuMiX for investigating metabolic interactions between human and microbial cells and for assessing the impact of co-culture on human cellular metabolism, we conducted metabolomic analyses of the intracellular metabolite fractions from the Caco-2 cells when these were co-cultured with LGG growing under anaerobic conditions (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 24 h of co-culture, of the 313 metabolites detected, 214 (14 of which were statistically significant (P less_than 0.1, StT)) were more and 99 (5 of which were statistically significant (P less_than 0.1, StT)) were less abundant in the co-cultured Caco-2 intracellular metabolite fractions when compared with their levels in the corresponding controls (Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
