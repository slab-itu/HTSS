Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Two-dimensional layered transition-metal dichalcogenides have attracted considerable interest for their unique layer-number-dependent properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, vertical integration of these two-dimensional crystals to form van der Waals heterostructures can open up a new dimension for the design of functional electronic and optoelectronic devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the layer-number-dependent photocurrent generation in graphene/MoS2/graphene heterostructures by creating a device with two distinct regions containing one-layer and seven-layer MoS2 to exclude other extrinsic factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photoresponse studies reveal that photoresponsivity in one-layer MoS2 is surprisingly higher than that in seven-layer MoS2 by seven times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spectral-dependent studies further show that the internal quantum efficiency in one-layer MoS2 can reach a maximum of 65%, far higher than the 7% in seven-layer MoS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our theoretical modelling shows that asymmetric potential barriers in the top and bottom interfaces of the graphene/one-layer MoS2/graphene heterojunction enable asymmetric carrier tunnelling, to generate usually high photoresponsivity in one-layer MoS2 device.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The two-dimensional (2D) layered materials such as graphene and semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) can exhibit peculiar electronic properties depending on their exact composition, thickness and geometry1,2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the broad possibility to combine different materials in van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) can create a new paradigm in materials science with unprecedented flexibility to integrate highly disparate materials and enable unique functions, as exemplified by the recent demonstration of vertical tunnelling transistors and vertical field-effect transistors for ultra-thin and flexible devices6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 Graphene/multi-layer (ML)-TMD/graphene stack has also been shown to function as a unique photodiode for photocurrent generation or photodetection7,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a direct band gap in monolayer TMD and ultra-fast carrier transfer (1 ps) rate14, vdWHs with ultra-thin TMDs have attracted considerable interest for photovoltaic applications15,16 and ultra-fast photodetection17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, classical charge transport theory for bulk semiconductors was often employed to interpret the electron transport in ultra-thin vdWHs even though it is well expected to exhibit completely different photocurrent generation characteristics7,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, an atomically thin graphene/WSe2/MoS2/graphene pn heterojonction has been investigated for photocurrent generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, ShocklyReadHall recombination and Langevin recombination in the WSe2/MoS2 pn junction could compromise the carrier extraction performance13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unique characteristics of ultrathin vdWHs are insufficiently explored to date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, a systematic investigation of layer-number-dependent studies is lacking due to complications from highly variable nature of the van der Waals interfaces and extrinsic factors in creating vdWH devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report a layer-number-dependent photocurrent generation in graphene/MoS2/graphene vdWHs by creating a device with two distinct regions containing one-layer (1L) and seven-layer (7L)-MoS2 to exclude extrinsic device factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significantly, we discover a surprisingly higher photoresponsivity and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) by going from ML MoS2 device to a monolayer device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discretized electrostatic potential barriers were introduced to interpret the photocarrier tunneLling and extracting in ultrathin vdWHs.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

enhanced photoresponsivity of 1L-MoS2 may be attributed to two potential factors: higher photocarrier generation rate in the monolayer MoS2 and higher photocarrier extraction/collection efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We will discuss the influence of each factor below, first by modelling the transition probability and subsequently by comparing the internal and external quantum efficiencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two lines of reasoning will show that at peak IQE (633 nm and 1.96 eV), the second factor (that is, the improved collection) dominates in our device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In general, the spectral dependence of the photocarrier generation rate can be estimated from first principles, using the Fermi golden rule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probability of transition from a valence band state () to a conduction band state (c) is thus given (in 2D) by', '', 'where k2 is the imaginary part of the dielectric function,  is the plank constant,  is the frequency of the incident radiation, me and q are the electron mass and charge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In MoS2, k2 diverges because the conduction and valence bands run nearly parallel in some regions of the reciprocal space (that is, band nesting19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be noticed in Fig 3c where we compare the imaginary part of the dielectric function, obtained from relativistic first-principles calculations, for 1L and thick multilayer (bulk) MoS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, W increases with the excitation energy up to the energy of the first peak, which is at 2.4 eV for the bulk and 2.8 eV for the monolayer, respectively19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of band-nesting is more pronounced in monolayer, because this system is closer to the 2D limit and is responsible for a raise in the absorption coefficient in that spectral region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To separate the effects of enhanced photon absorption from carrier collection, we have also conducted the photocurrent studies under difference excitation photon energies and determined the corresponding EQE (, as defined by the number of carriers produced per incident photon20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wavelength-dependent studies indicate the EQE of 1L-MoS2 increases with decreasing photon energy and can reach as high as 2.5% at 633 nm (1.96 eV; Fig 3d), whereas the EQE of 7L-MoS2 maintains a relatively low value of 0.30.4% throughout the entire measured wavelength range (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the increased EQE does not follow the trend of k2 that increases with increasing photon energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the enhanced absorbance is not the primary factor responsible for the maximum EQE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other factors such as carrier collection should be considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Further insight is given by the IQE, which can be obtained by dividing the EQE by the optical absorbance of 7L- and 1L-MoS2 (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the maximum IQE in 1L-MoS2 can reach up to 65%, far exceeding to IQE in 7L-MoS2 ( less_than 7%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also noted that the IQE in 1L-MoS2 region steadily increases when the photon energy is reduced to approach the bandgap of 1L-MoS2 (1.82 eV (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highest IQE reached 65% at 633 nm (1.96 eV), very close to the optical absorption edge of 1L-MoS2 (1.82 eV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that in this region k2 is nearly independent on the thickness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the theoretical calculations, 1L-MoS2 has a much larger density of states near the band edges, at the valence band top due to the heavier hole masses, and near the conduction band edge, due to the presence of the 2D van-Hove singularities (Fig 3f), increasing the probability of transfer to the graphene electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Photocarrier extraction mechanism', 'Photocarrier transport in bulk MoS2 is driven by diffusion and drift process, which is dictated by different band bending at GrT and GrB MoS2 interface (originated from the difference of GrT and GrB doping densities)7,12 (Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The photo-carrier extraction in atomically thin vdWHs is predicted to be completely different from that in bulk heterojunctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike bulk MoS2 having a continuous band bending (Supplementary Fig 3a), atomically thin vdWH has discrete energy states in the vertical direction (Supplementary Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The classical semiconductor charge transport modelthe charge drifts downhill following the band slopecannot describe photocurrent generation phenomena via such discrete energy states in vdW heterojunctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we introduce a tunnelling transport model to describe the photocarrier tunnelling through electrostatic potential barriers formed at the atomically thin vdW heterojunctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electrostatic potential barriers of 1L-MoS2 heterostructures are calculated by density functional theory (DFT; Supplementary Fig 4 and Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large electrostatic potential barriers are discretely constructed between GrT/GrB and MoS2 interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The barrier heights at the top and bottom junctions are symmetric because of symmetric environmental conditions imposed in the DFT calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In real device, the different environmental conditions of GrT and GrB result in asymmetric doping between GrT and GrB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Doping characteristics of GrT and GrB were confirmed by 2D peak shift in Raman spectrum of another graphene/1L-MoS2/graphene heterostructure device (Supplementary Fig 5 and Supplementary Note 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With n- or p-type doping, the 2D Raman band exhibits a red or blue shift, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our device, the GrT is more p-type doped than GrB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such doping difference generates internal field, leading to asymmetric barrier height between top and bottom junctions (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, the photo-excited electrons can effectively tunnel to lower barrier at GrT/MoS2 interface, whereas higher barrier at GrB/MoS2 interface can block the electron tunnelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Asymmetric tunnelling to top and bottom barrier thus generates photocurrent in vdWH device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that the delta-function potential barriers for hole carriers are formed at the graphene/MoS2 interface, allowing hole tunnelling from MoS2 to GrB by built-in electric field21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

tunnelling probability to top (TT) and bottom junction barrier (TB) (I)=(TTTB)/(TT+TB)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The potential barrier was sliced to thin square barriers with width of 0.01 nm and then the

varied by applied gate voltage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This factor is considered in the simulation and schematics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, the gate voltage can more efficiently modulate the GrB EF than

or band slope that leads to change in Voc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the ML-MoS2 device, the gate electric field primarily modulates the Fermi level (EF) of the GrB due to the relatively strong electrostatic screening by ML-MoS2 (Fig 7d), leading to a large modulation of the band slope in ML-MoS2 and thus a substantial modulation of the Voc and photocurrent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast for the monolayer device, the gate electric field can effectively modulate both bottom and GrT EF because of much weaker screening effect by the ultra-thin 1L-MoS2 (Fig 7c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, both top and bottom potential barrier are modulated together in the graphene/1L-MoS2/graphene device, leading to much smaller dependence of potential offset and photocarrier extraction rate on the gate voltage.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In summary, we have reported an unusually efficient photocarrier generation from monolayer MoS2 in graphene/MoS2/gaphene vdWHs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to intrinsically slow layer-to-layer charge transport in TMD materials, the carrier mobility in the vertical direction is usually several orders of magnitudes lower than that in lateral direction, which can seriously slow down the charge separation process in the vertical heterostructures, leading to undesired photocarrier recombination in MoS2 before they arrive at the current collector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we show that this drawback can be largely overcome by using atomically thin MoS2 to enable an unusually high photoresponsivity up to 68 mA W1 with 65% of IQE in monolayer MoS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was congruent with carrier tunnelling through asymmetric electrostatic potential barriers that exist discretely in vdWHs with monolayer MoS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, the symmetric potential barrier in ML MoS2 reduces photocurrent via carrier tunnelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proposed quantum mechanical-based tunnelling mechanism provides a new theoretical framework to understand van der Waals interaction in vdWHs and to design the next generation of atomically thin optoelectronics including photodetectors and photovoltaic devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that the 2.5% EQE achieved in our graphene/1L-MoS2/graphene devices are comparable to the 2.4% value achieved in graphene/1L-WSe2/1L-MoS2/graphene pn heterojonctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the absorbance in two layers stack (MoS2/WSe2) is approximately twice of that in single layer (MoS2), the IQE in our device is about twice higher.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lower IQE in in graphene/1L-WSe2/1L-MoS2/graphene pn heterojunctions may be partially attributed to ShocklyReadHall recombination and Langevin recombination, which is not present in graphene/1L-MoS2/graphene devices.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
