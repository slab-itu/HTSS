Increased amyloidogenic APP processing in APOE 4-negative individuals with cerebral -amyloidosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
"Increased APP (amyloid precursor protein) processing causes -amyloid (A) accumulation in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (AD), but it is unclear if it also affects sporadic A accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested healthy controls and patients with mild cognitive symptoms (N=331) in the BioFINDER study, using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A40 as a surrogate for amyloidogenic APP processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that levels of brain A fibrils (measured by 18F-flutemetamol PET) are independently associated with high CSF A40 (P less_than 0.001) and APOE 4 (P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The association between CSF A40 and brain A is stronger in APOE 4-negative than in positive people (P=0.0080).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are similar for CSF A38 and for a combination of CSF A38 and CSF A40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, sporadic A accumulation may be partly associated with increased amyloidogenic APP production, especially in APOE 4-negative subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The risk for sporadic AD may consequently depend on increased A production, in addition to decreased A clearance."  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Brain accumulation of amyloid  (A) is a hallmark of Alzheimers disease (AD) which may precede dementia by up to two decades1,2,3 and be quantified by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers or positron emission tomography (PET) imaging4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A accumulation is thought to be caused by an imbalance of A production and clearance from the brain6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The APOE 4 allele is the main genetic susceptibility factor for late-onset AD and sporadic A pathology7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is likely because the APOE 4 gene product apoE4 has reduced capacity to clear A peptides from the brain8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, A accumulation also occurs in the absence of APOE 4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7) and 4050% of AD patients lack the APOE 4 allele9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In autosomal dominant forms of AD, A pathology is believed to be caused by increased amyloidogenic processing of APP (amyloid precursor protein), that is, increased A production10 but variations in APP processing have not been thoroughly explored as risk factors in sporadic AD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a large cohort of non-demented subjects, the aim of this study was to test if APOE 4 and biomarker surrogates of amyloidogenic APP processing were independently associated with brain A accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used CSF levels of A40 to estimate amyloidogenic APP processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rationale for this was that A40 is a major A isoforms produced by neurons by concerted - and -secretase cleavages of APP (the same processing pathway that results in A42)11 but is generally not related to A plaque pathology (in contrast to CSF A42, which is reduced in the presence of A plaques12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that previous studies testing the correlation between CSF A40 and PET A have not co-varied for the presence of APOE 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that there would be independent correlations between A accumulation and the predictors APOE 4 and CSF A40, and that increased amyloidogenic APP processing would be related to A accumulation mainly in APOE 4-negative subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also hypothesized that CSF A40 would not be associated with APOE 4 (that is, CSF A40 would not be affected by apoE4-mediated impaired A clearance).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we hypothesized to see similar results when using CSF A38 instead of CSF A40 to estimate amyloidogenic APP processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results confirmed our hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that 18F-flutemetamol PET levels are independently associated with high CSF A40 (P less_than 0.001) and APOE 4 (P less_than 0.001) and that the association between CSF A40 and brain A is stronger in APOE 4-negative than in positive people (P=0.0080).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are similar when using CSF A38 or a combination of CSF A38 and CSF A40 to estimate amyloidogenic APP production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that sporadic A accumulation may be partly associated with increased amyloidogenic APP production, especially in APOE 4-negative subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the risk for sporadic AD may partly depend on increased A production, in addition to decreased A clearance.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We tested the hypothesis that biomarker surrogates of amyloidogenic APP processing (CSF A40 and A38) and APOE 4 were independent predictors of brain A fibril accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with our hypotheses, CSF A40 (and A38 in a secondary analysis) and APOE 4 were independent predictors of PET A, and the effect of CSF A40 was strongest in the APOE 4-negative individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that increased A production are associated with increased risk for sporadic brain A accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These novel results provide indirect evidence that brain A pathology in humans may arise from two pathways, where one involves the APOE 4 allele (likely causing reduced apoE4-mediated A42 clearance), and the other involves increased amyloidogenic processing of APP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may correspond to two pathways to sporadic AD, namely reduced clearance and increased production of A peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The amyloid cascade hypothesis postulates that A pathology arises due to an imbalance between A production and clearance6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been suggested that sporadic AD is mainly caused by poor clearance of peptides from the brain, whereas autosomal dominant AD is mainly caused by increased A production, especially the A42 variant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is supported by a metabolic labelling study showing reduced A clearance in sporadic AD dementia14, and studies showing increased amyloidogenic APP processing in early stages of autosomal dominant AD10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main cause of reduced A clearance in sporadic AD is likely APOE 4, since the apoE4 protein isoform has reduced capacity to clear A peptides compared with other apoE isoforms8, although it is possible that APOE 4 may also contribute to increased AD risk by other mechanisms, for example, by affecting inflammation and neuronal repair15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, one APP gene polymorphism which reduces A production is associated with reduced risk of AD in the general population17, which provides genetic evidence that variations in APP processing may also affect the risk for sporadic AD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The main limitation of this paper was that we used an indirect measure of APP processing, which was estimated by CSF A40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rationale for this approach was that A40 is a major A isoform produced by neurons11, which is not directly influenced by the presence of A plaque pathology12, and is not influenced by APOE 4-mediated impaired A clearance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The later was demonstrated by our finding that there was no overall difference in CSF A40 depending on APOE 4 status (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alterations in CSF A40 are therefore more likely to reflect differences in amyloidogenic APP processing rather than differences in A clearance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we acknowledge that there may be variations in APP processing that are not captured by CSF A40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also performed analyses using CSF A38 (another highly expressed A isoform) and a combination of CSF A38 and CSF A40 (based on their molar amounts), with very similar results as when using CSF A40 alone, which support our findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more direct estimate of A production may be done by metabolic labelling14, but such methods are liable to bias due to the longitudinal drift of CSF biomarkers during continuous CSF sampling that depends on sampling frequency and volume18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another limitation is that there may be other factors affecting CSF A40 besides variations in APP processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, reduced CSF A40 is associated with chronic WML19, and WML may also be associated with A pathology (although this is more common in MCI20 and AD dementia20 than in non-demented people21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not clear if the association between CSF A40 and WML is due to a direct link between A production and WML or if lower CSF A40 levels reflect reduced neuronal A secretion due to decreased brain activity in the presence of WML.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, our results remained significant when adjusting for WML.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theoretically, CSF A40 could also be influenced by peripheral APP processing, but our results were stable when adjusting for plasma A40, suggesting that the effects did not depend on peripheral APP processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not measure all other possible factors besides increased amyloidogenic APP that may contribute to A deposition in APOE 4-negative subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, other AD risk genes (including CLU and CR1) may impact A clearance in APOE 4-negative subjects22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We included several different diagnostic groups, including a SCD group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We noted that the frequency of A positivity in our SCD subjects (37%) was higher than in a recent large meta-analysis by Jansen et al.3 where 22% of SCD subjects were A-positive, compared with 25% of CN subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reason for this difference is not clear, but we noted that our SCD subjects were on average 6 years older than the Jansen subjects, which may contribute to higher frequency of A pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, all our SCD subjects were referred to specialized memory clinics because of cognitive symptoms, while some of the Jansen SCD subjects may have been seen at other health care facilities, opening for the possibility that they had less severe complaints than the SCD subjects in our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another recent study on PET A positivity in memory clinic SCD subjects found that 57% of SCD subjects were A-positive compared with 31% of CN, which more resembles the findings in our cohort23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we did not include an AD dementia group, since we know from a previous study that patients with severe AD dementia have lower CSF A40 than patients with mild dementia (this may reflect reduced capacity to produce A peptides as the disease progresses)24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Including an AD dementia group in this study would therefore risk confounding the relationship between CSF A40 and PET A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Until now, there have been few attempts to examine the independent roles of APOE 4 and APP processing in the development of brain A pathology in non-demented subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies did not find correlations between CSF A40 (or A38) and PET A (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is likely because they did not co-vary for APOE 4 (and/or CSF A42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adjusting for APOE 4 is important since the relationship between CSF A40 and PET A differs between APOE 4-positive and -negative individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, adjusting for APOE 4 and CSF A42 reduces the residual errors of the models, and some of this error may contribute to the variance of CSF A40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once this error is removed the correlation between CSF A40 and PET A can be better estimated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results add novel information and point to different possible pathways to A pathology in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In sum, our results support the idea that sporadic A accumulation may be partly associated with increased amyloidogenic APP production, especially in APOE 4-negative subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The risk for sporadic AD may consequently depend on increased A production, in addition to decreased A clearance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provides novel insight into disease mechanisms in AD and may be important for development of drugs targeting A metabolism in early stages of AD.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
