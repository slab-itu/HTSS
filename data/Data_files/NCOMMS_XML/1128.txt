Pericyte-expressed Tie2 controls angiogenesis and vessel maturation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The Tie receptors with their Angiopoietin ligands act as regulators of angiogenesis and vessel maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tie2 exerts its functions through its supposed endothelial-specific expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, Tie2 is also expressed at lower levels by pericytes and it has not been unravelled through which mechanisms pericyte Angiopoietin/Tie signalling affects angiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that human and murine pericytes express functional Tie2 receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Silencing of Tie2 in pericytes results in a pro-migratory phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pericyte Tie2 controls sprouting angiogenesis in in vitro sprouting and in vivo spheroid assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tie2 downstream signalling in pericytes involves Calpain, Akt and FOXO3A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ng2-Cre-driven deletion of pericyte-expressed Tie2 in mice transiently delays postnatal retinal angiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, Tie2 deletion in pericytes results in a pronounced pro-angiogenic effect leading to enhanced tumour growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, the data expand and revise the current concepts on vascular Angiopoietin/Tie signalling and propose a bidirectional, reciprocal EC-pericyte model of Tie2 signalling.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The formation of new blood vessels from existing vessels, known as angiogenesis, depends on a sequential process that involves endothelial cells (EC) and pericytes1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The VEGF-dependent initiation of endothelial sprouting requires the detachment of pericytes to enable EC migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vice versa, pericyte recruitment by nascent vessels occurs during the later steps of the angiogenic cascade providing stabilization and maturation signals2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pericytes contribute to vessel maturation by direct, basement-membrane penetrating contacts with EC and through the release of paracrine-acting growth factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extent of pericyte coverage is an important marker of vessel maturation3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, pericyte coverage in resting vessels varies widely in different organs and with type of microvasculature (continuous versus discontinuous versus fenestrated).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different molecules have been proposed as pericyte markers, including PDGFRb, CSPG4 (NG2), ACTA2 (SMA), Desmin and CD248 (refs 3, 4, 5, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression of these markers depends on tissue, type of vessel and maturation state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'PDGFb, secreted by angiogenic EC, acts as the best characterized growth factor recruiting PDGFRb expressing pericytes7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Angiopoietin/Tie (Ang/Tie) signalling similarly controls the association of EC and pericytes8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, its molecular mechanism-of-action is much less well understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tie2 expressed by EC is activated by pericyte-expressed Ang1, which contributes to maintaining the quiescent EC phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ang1-driven phosphorylation of Tie2 results in the activation of downstream pathways mediating survival, proliferation, migration and anti-inflammatory signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, vessel stabilization/survival involves AKT-dependent FOXO1 regulation9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the second angiopoietin ligand, Ang2 acts as partial agonist of Tie2, that is, it inhibits Tie2 signalling in the presence of Ang1 and weakly activates Tie2 in the absence of Ang1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, Ang2 is produced, stored and upon stimulation released by EC, thereby acting as autocrine regulator of Ang/Tie2 signalling11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recombinant or transgenic Ang2 application results in pericyte drop-out in the mouse retina leading to vessel destabilization12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Taken together, there is strong evidence that Ang/Tie2 signalling affects pericyte function, but the established endothelial-centric model of paracrine acting Ang1 and autocrine acting Ang2 is not sufficient to explain how Ang/Tie2 signalling affects pericyte function and EC-pericyte association.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EC may be the primary target cell of Ang/Tie2 signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, work performed during the last 10 years has provided evidence that Tie2 is not exclusively an EC-specific receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tie2 expression and function has been established in hematopoietic stem cells13, macrophages14, muscle satellite cells15, neural cells16 and tumour cells17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, scattered reports have described Tie2 expression by vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have in the present study validated weak, but consistently detectable expression of functional Tie2 receptor on different pericyte populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these findings, we hypothesized that pericyte-expressed Tie2 may directly control pericyte function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cellular, biochemical and genetic experiments collectively establish a role of pericyte-expressed Tie2 in the control of angiogenesis and vascular maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic inactivation of Tie2 in pericytes leads to strongly enhanced tumour growth, demonstrating that Tie2 in pericytes affects the plasticity window of the tumour-associated vasculature.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Pericytes express functional Tie2 receptor', 'To assess the expression of Tie2 and other Ang/Tie signalling molecules on human pericytes, a microarray-based expression profiling of human brain pericytes (BP), placenta pericytes, pancreas pericytes (PA), lung pericytes (LP), muscle pericytes (MP) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TEK (Tie2) expression was highest in HUVEC, but also detectable at lower level in all analysed pericyte lines (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The microarray data were also used to validate the identity of the employed pericyte populations (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We included human dermal fibroblasts (Fib) in these validation experiments in recognition of the overlapping marker profiles of pericytes

#@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunocytochemistry and FACS analysis identified lower, albeit consistently detectable levels of Tie2 protein by BP compared to EC (Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stimulation of BP with the Tie2 ligand Ang1 resulted in detectable Tie2 phosphorylation, albeit again at considerably lower levels as in EC (Fig 1eh).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ang1, but not Ang2, induced phosphorylation of the Tie2

#@NEW_LINE#@#  Stimulation of pericytes with supernatants from either Ang2 overexpressing HUVEC or supernatants from control HUVEC resulted in significantly increased pericyte migration following Ang2

Tie2-mediated AKT signal transduction26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FOXO3A has been shown to be regulated by calpain1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our microarray experiments had identified strong FOXO3A and weak FOXO1 expression in pericytes (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot experiments verified strong FOXO3A expression in pericytes, but only weak expression in EC (Supplementary Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consequently stimulated cultured BP with either Ang1 or Ang2, to study if Tie2 signalling in pericytes controlled FOXO3A phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ang1 stimulation resulted in increased FOXO3A phosphorylation, whereas Ang2 reduced FOXO3A phosphorylation (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphorylation leads to FOXO3A inactivation and cytoplasmic retention29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correspondingly, immunocytochemical analysis of FOXO3A localization identified prominent nuclear FOXO3A in cultured pericytes upon Ang2 stimulation (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data suggest that Tie2 in pericytes influences FOXO3A-dependent signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To further assess the effect of Tie2 in pericytes on EC-pericyte intercellular signalling, we performed a phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase array of BP and HUVEC co-cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eph receptor and ephrin ligand signalling has been implicated in vascular development and in in vivo models of angiogenesis where bi-directional signalling mediates juxtracrine cellcell contact, cell adhesion to extracellular matrix and cell migration30,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Eph signalling in mural cells has been shown to control cell motility and adhesion as well as pericyte-EC assembly33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both EC and pericytes expressed Eph receptors and ephrin ligands (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-culture of Tie2-silenced pericytes with EC resulted in reduced EphA2, EphB2 and EphB4 phosphorylation in the co-culture lysates (Fig 2h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, the

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The Angiopoietin-Tie system was originally discovered as EC-specific signalling pathway, playing a fundamental role during embryonic vessel assembly and maturation as well as vessel maintenance in adults8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, global deletion of Tie2 results in embryonic lethality around E10.5 as a result of remodelling and maturation defects of the embryonic vasculature38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correspondingly, endothelial-specific deletion of Tie2 using Ve-cad-Cre driver mice, pursued in validating the Tie2fl/fl mice used in this study, essentially phenocopied the global Tie2 KO phenotype with embryonic lethality around E10.5 (Supplementary Fig 13), confirming the key role of endothelial Tie2 during embryonic development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tie2 is, however, not exclusively expressed by EC13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the results of a systematic expression profiling screen of cultured pericytes isolated from different organs (Fig 1a), the present study was aimed at analysing the contribution of pericyte-expressed Tie2 to vascular function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Employing a combination of cellular, biochemical and genetic experiments, we showed that (i) human and murine pericytes express functional Tie2 receptor, (ii) Tie2-silenced pericytes have a pro-migratory phenotype, (iii) Tie2 downstream signalling in pericytes involves Calpain, Akt and FOXO3A, (iv) Ng2-Cre-driven deletion of pericyte-expressed Tie2 delays developmental angiogenesis and vessel maturation, and (v) Tie2 deletion in pericytes results in a pro-angiogenic tumour vasculature with enhanced tumour growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, the data expand and revise the current concepts on vascular Ang-Tie signalling and propose a bidirectional, reciprocal EC-pericyte model of Tie2 signalling (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: Model of vascular Ang/Tie signalling.The schematic representation shows the established endothelial-centric model of Ang/Tie signalling (left) and the revised bi-directional, reciprocal EC-pericyte model of vascular Tie2 signalling as derived from the findings of this study (right; red routes show newly identified pathways).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vascular Ang/Tie2 signalling has so far exclusively been related to Tie2 expression by EC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ang1 acts paracrine and is secreted by pericytes and other cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ang2 is almost exclusively expressed by EC and thereby acts as dynamic autocrine modulator of Ang1/Tie2 signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extending this model, the findings of this study demonstrate that functional Tie2 receptors are also expressed by pericytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, Ang1 expressed by pericytes (and likely other cells) activates pericyte Tie2 and contributes thereby to vascular maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ang2 is produced by EC and acts paracrine on pericytes, thereby contributing to vascular destabilization through direct pericyte effects.Full size image', 'The results of the present study have shed unexpected light into the mechanisms of vascular Ang/Tie signalling that may help to answer a number of enigmatic questions in the Ang/Tie field and that may have implications for the therapeutic exploitation of Ang-Tie signalling, particularly in the context of tumour angiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we identified Tie2 expression in cultured pericytes isolated from different organs and established cellular and signalling readouts of Ang-Tie signalling in cultured pericytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings hinted at a functional role of pericyte-expressed Tie2 in regulating vascular function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the intensity of Tie2 expression and pTie2 level were considerably lower compared to EC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, only the conditional cell type-specific genetic in vivo approach yielded definite and unambiguous insights into pericyte Tie2 function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We employed towards this end Ng2-Cre mice39 as most robust and cell type selective driver for pericyte-specific mutagenesis experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The choice of Ng2-Cre was based on reporter gene experiments (Supplementary Fig 6) as well as the surprising finding that Pdgfrb-Cre mice33 did not prove suitable to pericyte-specifically delete Tie2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, Pdgfrb-Tie2KO mice died around E10.5 similar to Ve-cad-Tie2KO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of Pdgfrb-Cre-mediated conditional mutagenesis revealed germline expression of Pdgfrb-Cre in both male and female mice resulting first in a heterozygous and following a second round of breeding a homozygous global deletion of Tie2 (Supplementary Fig 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, efforts to breed Pdgfrb-Tie2KO mice homozygous on the Tie2 allele resulted in death of homozygous mice due to a global Tie2 deletion at E10.5 similar as it has been described before38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ng2-Cre is known to be expressed in the male germline, which needs to be considered in using Ng2-Cre mice for cell type-specific conditional mutagenesis experiments, but the germline expression of Pdgfrb-Cre in both sexes limits the use of Pdgfrb-Cre as deleter for pericyte-related experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Second, Tie2 deletion in pericytes caused a mild and transient developmental delay of postnatal retinal angiogenesis and vessel maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In turn, tumour experiments in pericyte Tie2 null mice resulted in a sustained pro-angiogenic tumour vessel phenotype with strongly enhanced tumour growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This apparent difference between developmental and tumour angiogenesis may be related to differences in physiological and pathological angiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Embryonic and postnatal angiogenesis is a developmental program leading to a remodelled and fully mature vasculature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this scenario, pericyte Tie2 deletion leads to a transient delay first, of angiogenesis (P4) and second, of vessel maturation (P6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, this delay of retinal angiogenesis can be compensated and pericyte Tie2 appears to be dispensable for homeostatic maintenance of the vasculature in adult mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In turn, tumour angiogenesis is characterized by a pathological patency of the angiogenic stimulus resulting in a chaotropic, pro-angiogenic and permanently immature vasculature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, loss of pericyte Tie2 had a durable effect that was not compensated over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tumour phenotype thereby corresponded to the cellular and spheroid co-culture transplantation experiments that had revealed a restraining phenotype of Tie2 expressing pericytes on sprouting angiogenesis (Figs 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the higher density of smaller diameter blood vessels in the tumour experiments resulted in enhanced tumour growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in contrast to the complete ablation of pericytes in tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ng2 promoter-driven thymidine kinase-mediated (tk) depletion of pericytes has recently been shown to result in reduced tumour angiogenesis and correspondingly tumour growth40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of this study suggest that loss of pericyte Tie2 distinctly interferes with ECpericyte interactions and does not globally impair all pericyte-mediated vascular stabilization functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Third, the tumour phenotype of mice with genetic deletion of Tie2 in pericytes warrants some careful reconsideration of the concepts of therapeutic angiopoietin targeting to interfere with tumour angiogenesis and for the future design of anti-angiogenic combination therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genetic strategy employed in the present study had yielded on average a reduction of pericyte Tie2 mRNA and protein of only around 50%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, this deletion was sufficient to yield a substantial acceleration of tumour growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If anything, the incomplete recombination of Tie2 in pericytes would have underestimated the effect of Tie2 deletion on tumour angiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ang/Tie pathway targeting therapies have so far focussed on Ang2 whose inhibition affects tumour angiogenesis by contextually interfering with EC sprouting angiogenesis and by promoting vessel maturation (and thereby normalization) of the remodelling, pericyte-associating vasculature42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model may still be correct, but the therapeutic mechanism may not solely be due to EC targeting effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, the pericyte Tie2 KO tumour growth and tumour vascular phenotype has striking parallels to the phenotype of tumours grown in Ang2-deficient mice43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the loss of Ang2 results in a transient reduction of tumour growth rates43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tumour phenotype in the present study was correspondingly characterized by a transient increase in tumour growth rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apparent temporally identical and phenotypically opposing tumour vessel phenotypes may relate to the cellular findings of the present study, in which the pericyte Tie2 loss-of-function phenotype phenocopied the Ang2 gain of function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The findings of the present study make it likely that the benefit of pharmaceutical Ang2 targeting may not just affect EC, but at least in part also be attributed to targeting pericyte Ang/Tie signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Fourth, the cellular and biochemical analyses of the present study suggest that paracrine Ang2 (produced by EC) may in an antagonistic manner interfere with autocrine Ang1/Tie2 signalling in pericytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ang2 has been shown to act as partial agonist of Tie2, that is, it is an antagonist of Tie2 activation in the presence of Ang1 and a weak agonist in the absence of Ang1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the orphan receptor Tie1 has been suggested to be involved in Ang2 agonistic effects on Tie2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This concept has recently been validated in definite in vivo experiments establishing a critical role of Tie1 in mediating agonistic effects of Ang2 on Tie2 (refs 45, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the microarray experiments pursued in the present study had identified low levels of Tie2 expression in all analysed pericyte populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, none of the analysed pericyte populations expressed Tie1, which could explain why Ang2 would act strictly as an antagonist of Ang1/Tie2 signalling in pericytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Taken together, the present study expands the current concepts of vascular Ang/Tie signalling by establishing the contribution of pericyte Tie2 signalling to vascular maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, we conclude that the classical endotheliocentric view of Tie2 signalling with Ang1 acting in a paracrine manner and Ang2 through an autocrine loop needs to be revised in favour of a bi-directional reciprocal model in which the EC signalling is complemented reciprocally by an autocrine Ang1/Tie2 loop in pericytes and paracrine acting Ang2 (Fig 7).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
