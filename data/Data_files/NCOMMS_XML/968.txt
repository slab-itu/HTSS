Pore configuration landscape of granular crystallization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Uncovering grain-scale mechanisms that underlie the disorderorder transition in assemblies of dissipative, athermal particles is a fundamental problem with technological relevance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, the study of granular crystallization has mainly focussed on the symmetry of crystalline patterns while their emergence and growth from irregular clusters of grains remains largely unexplored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here crystallization of three-dimensional packings of frictional spheres is studied at the grain-scale using X-ray tomography and persistent homology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter produces a map of the topological configurations of grains within static partially crystallized packings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using numerical simulations, we show that similar maps are measured dynamically during the melting of a perfect crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This map encodes new information on the formation process of tetrahedral and octahedral pores, the building blocks of perfect crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four key formation mechanisms of these pores reproduce the main changes of the map during crystallization and provide continuous deformation pathways representative of the crystallization dynamics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Ordering and crystallization in a thermal system can be achieved by cooling it down; in contrast, in macroscopic sphere packings high levels of energy need to be injected to overcome the natural propensity of these materials to form amorphous structures1,2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the significance of regular packings in a wide range of fields, from fundamental physics to granular processing6,7, the basic mechanism of crystallization in this highly dissipative material is still unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed the transition from disordered to ordered packings triggers a wide range of geometrical, topological and mechanical changes at multiple length scales, some of which have just recently been uncovered4,8,9,10,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To describe this complexity and since sphere packings are comprised of numerous particles, it is tempting to use a statistical approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In analogy with equilibrium statistical mechanics, Edwards and co-workers have laid the foundations of a statistical mechanics for amorphous jammed packings14,15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since macroscopic granular packings are dissipative due to friction, it has been argued that the volume of the system and a variable characterizing the mechanical state should replace the energy as key macroscopic descriptors18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a statistical approach hinges on the definition of the space of the possible jammed configurations of grains16,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This space can be considered as the analogue of the phase space in equilibrium thermodynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless drawing this analogy is no trivial matter, because in granular materials, friction introduces a sharp nonlinearity in grain contact laws, which challenges our understanding of mechanically stable structures21,22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, the nature and description of the space of stable jammed states remain outstanding questions16,19,25,26,27,28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Even less is known about packings with larger densities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These packings are usually formed under strong vibrations and a sharp structural transition is observed at Bernals density (Bernal0.64)4,11,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter signals the appearance of crystalline clusters in the bead assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent advances show that the formation of a granular crystal might be described according to a thermodynamic-like process in idealistic three-dimensional (3D) packings10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, experimental studies on the disorderorder transition in 2D granular layers have demonstrated both striking resemblances and profound differences with thermal systems30,31,32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To better understand and support any thermodynamic-like approach, it would be interesting to be able to measure the phase space of the grain configurations representative of the crystallization of realistic packings (that is, polydisperse and frictional).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a measurement is an important prerequisite to the definition of a robust statistical description.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we experimentally study 3D packings made of cohesionless macroscopic spheres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent developments in X-ray computed tomography (XCT)4,12,13,34 and topological data analysis35,36 are utilized to describe at the grain-scale the cavities that exist and are mechanically stable in large partially crystallized packings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis is based on persistent homology (PH), a technique that allows the characterization and quantification of geometrical shapes in structure37,38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison with classical spatial tessellation techniques (such as Voronoi or Delaunay methods), PH offers a clearer description of the population of cavities and a more comprehensive view of crystallization-driven structural changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More precisely, it gives us persistence diagrams, akin to a topological phase space, that represent all the grain configurations and patterns within a packing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we explore and characterize the topological changes of partially crystallized packings at mechanical equilibrium over the density range =(0.60, 0.72).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shape of the diagrams highlights four key ordering mechanisms that govern the formation of regular tetrahedral and octahedral patterns of grains: the two basic components of perfect crystalline arrangements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using numerical simulations, we show that these mechanisms are relevant to describe the dynamics of the quasi-static melting of a granular crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the context of our experimental results, it shows that persistence diagrams are able to capture interesting features of the crystallization dynamics despite being computed on static mechanically stable states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discuss some of the consequences of these findings in terms of the ergodicity of this out-of-equilibrium transition.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Experimental procedure', 'Six experimental granular packings are produced each containing monosized acrylic beads (diameter D=1 or 1.62 mm, polydispersity=0.025 mm, polydispersity is defined as the standard deviation in grains effective diameters, see details in Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table 1 provides experimental details on each packings analysed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we have analysed: (i) a fully disordered packing with a packing density of =0.635, produced by pouring beads into a cylindrical container and (ii) partially ordered packings produced in cylindrical and spherical containers using a vibrational protocol (see Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly a cylindrical packing and a spherical one have the same packing density of =0.685.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

heterogeneity in its structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the subsets extracted from it have a wide range of density ranging from =0.58 to =0.73.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Homology and PH', 'Homology is an algebraic method for studying topological features of geometrical objects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The starting point for computing homology is a complex, , essentially a collection of building blocks whose union is the shape of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a simplicial complex, the building blocks are points, edges, triangles, tetrahedra and higher k-dimensional simplices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A k-chain is a formal sum of k-dimensional simplices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A k-cycle is a chain whose boundary is empty (the sum of its faces cancel out).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The homology groups Hk encode equivalence classes of these k-cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In more physical terms, homology groups Hk describe the presence of k-dimensional holes in an object (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the H2 group describes the presence of 2-cycles, that is, enclosed cavities, within a structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this work, we are interested in the properties of the H2 group obtained from sphere packings and its varying properties as the packing density increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, the concept of PH is used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PH extends traditional homology by tracking how the homology groups change when a control parameter  is varied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This control parameter is known as the filtration parameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PH has become an increasingly useful tool for studying the shape of data in a broad range of areas, such as sensor networks40, high-dimensional data mining35, digital images41,42,43, biochemistry44, materials science39,45 and recently for describing granular materials46,47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Let us illustrate how the method works in the case of bead packings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'First, the packing data are specified by the coordinates of the centre of each bead and its measured radius r, extracted from micro-CT images26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main idea is now to consider that the bead radius is a free variable while the bead centres remain fixed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a sense, we obtain a virtual packing, where the virtual bead radius is now the filtration parameter  that can vary freely from 0 to .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mathematical terms, the problem concerns the characterization of the union of balls of radius  growing around each experimentally measured bead centre x: X()= B(x, ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PH tracks the changes in the topology of X() that occur as the ball radius increases from zero to .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For 0 less_than  less_than r, X() is a disjoint union of balls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For r, bead contacts are resolved and X() becomes connected, initially with many cavities, which are then filled in as  increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the physics viewpoint, it is important to note that PH characterizes primarily the presence of cavities and as such balls are considered as transparent objects that can overlap (see Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Persistence diagrams.

death value =d (when its surrounding beads become so large that the cavity is filled).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is common practice to represent the birth and death value for each cavity in a persistence diagram, named PD2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PD2 contains all the (b,d) pairs of a given packing, each corresponding to topologically distinct cavities that exists in the interstices between the beads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PD2 contains information not only about the number of cavities but also on the nature of each cavity/pore or on the frequency of occurence of patterns (regular-distorted) that have been detected within the packing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, PD2 offers new ways to describe the phase space of stable grain configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An interesting asset of PD2 is that certain local cavities with a specific motif can be clearly and simultaneously identified in the same diagram.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the simplest and smallest pore is that formed inside four beads closely packed as a regular tetrahedron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a topological viewpoint, a tetrahedral pore is born when  (the filtration parameter) reaches the circumradius of an equilateral triangle and dies when  is the circumradius of the regular tetrahedron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mathematical definition ensures that a regular tetrahedral cavity is uniquely identified by the point  in PD2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another simple pore is that formed by six beads closely packed as a regular octahedron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This type of cavity is uniquely identified by the point  in PD2 (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On a technical note, the persistence diagrams presented here are computed using a weighted alpha filtration related to a weighted Voronoi decomposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It uses the power distance instead of the absolute distance between the bead centres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach allows us to take into account the small, yet finite, polydispersity of the grains.

tetrahedra ordered by their circumradii) and therefore it integrates the geometry as well as local topology of grain structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In short, PH naturally incorporates the relevant local correlations in bead positions to reveal short- and medium-range order and even some global structures (such as percolating length scales48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another asset of the PH approach is that the detection of cavities is a robust process that is only weakly affected by the finite resolution and precision of our experimental measurements47,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the following section, we

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The persistence diagram can unambiguously identify the presence of tetrahedral and octahedral cavities in packings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evolution of PD2 seen in Fig 4, however, shows that there are populated regions in both disordered and partially ordered packings that do not correspond to regular cavities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To shed light on the origin of this configuration landscape, we now consider basic formation/deformation mechanisms of tetrahedral and octahedral cavities and investigate their signatures in PD2 as the packing density changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the evolution of (b, d) coordinates of these four cavity deformations can be derived analytically using a combination of dihedral angles and grain radius (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We begin by considering two types of tetrahedral deformation: ', '

paths that are statistically representative of the crystallization dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On a related note, recent experimental studies on the same packings by some of the authors have reported some analogies between the crystallization-driven changes in the packing mechanical structure and a first-order transition12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we have tested other pore deformation mechanisms that allow more contacts to be modified, but none of them describe accurately the evolution of PD2; for most of them, the birthdeath curve was outside the domain of existence.

that the D3 curve is made of two branches, one of which is similar to the D1 curve and ends at the tetrahedral hot spot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We emphasize that the highlighted boundaries correspond to the most populated curves that reflects their importance in the densification process via crystallization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By combining these new topological data and recent discoveries in the geometry of

cavities transform into initially distorted octahedra and with further increase of , they form regular octahedra as grains are forced to compact closely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The D3 scenario reveals that edge-connected tetrahedra play a role in the crystal formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This role was not considered in recent characterization of packings based on geometrically frustrated patterns, that is, patterns that are made of face-adjacent tetrahedra4,11,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that the distinction between face-adjacent and edge-connected tetrahedra is instrumental in detecting the presence of either hexagonal closely packed or FCC crystalline patterns (hexagonal closely packed and FCC patterns are, respectively, built upon face-adjacent or edge-connected tetrahedra).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, the selection of one pattern or the other remains an outstanding question for crystal formation in athermal systems8,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies on macroscopic packings have revealed that both crystalline motifs coexist in highly crystalline packings with a slight preference for the FCC pattern3,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our polycrystalline packings, the average ratio of FCC motifs over the total number of crystalline motifs is 2/3 beyond  greater than 0.72 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this polycrystalline picture in mind, we note that there is something singular about the scenario D3: its extremal states (an octahedral cavity and two edge-connected tetrahedra) can exist in perfect crystalline arrangements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scenario D3 is therefore reversible and it suggests that edge-adjacent tetrahedra can be formed via the distortion of octahedral cavities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a tantalizing grain-scale mechanism to understand the prevalence of FCC crystal at high packing density in our packings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we have shown that important features of the configurational landscape of 3D granular packings
