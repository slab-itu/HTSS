Direct identification of clinically relevant neoepitopes presented on native human melanoma tissue by mass spectrometry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Although mutations may represent attractive targets for immunotherapy, direct identification of mutated peptide ligands isolated from human leucocyte antigens (HLA) on the surface of native tumour tissue has so far not been successful.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using advanced mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, we survey the melanoma-associated immunopeptidome to a depth of 95,500 patient-presented peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thereby discover a large spectrum of attractive target antigen candidates including cancer testis antigens and phosphopeptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, we identify peptide ligands presented on native tumour tissue samples harbouring somatic mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four of eleven mutated ligands prove to be immunogenic by neoantigen-specific T-cell responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, tumour-reactive T cells with specificity for selected neoantigens identified by MS are detected in the patients tumour and peripheral blood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that direct identification of mutated peptide ligands from primary tumour material by MS is possible and yields true neoepitopes with high relevance for immunotherapeutic strategies in cancer.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cancer immunotherapy has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in a large variety of neoplasms and is currently revolutionizing the treatment of malignant diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immune checkpoint modulation, in particular, is emerging as a highly effective therapeutic strategy in an increasing number of cancer entities1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further improve current immunotherapeutic approaches, understanding the nature of immunological tumour recognition is of utmost importance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be important also for the identification of suitable biomarkers influencing decisions regarding therapeutic sequences and combinations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of tumour-associated antigens (TAA) have been evaluated as target antigens in clinical investigations especially in patients with melanoma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include antigens derived from differentiation antigens and cancer testis antigens3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, so far these approaches showed only limited efficacy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adoptive transfer of T cells transgenic for T-cell receptors (TCR) specific for selected TAA seem to be a reasonable and effective therapeutic development especially using affinity maturated TCR or ones selected from a non-self environment5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, severe or even fatal side effects have been observed5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Response rates observed following treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated that effective immune responses can be induced in an autologous environment in a significant proportion of melanoma patients9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Response rates correlate to the mutational load of patients tumours as shown for melanoma and lung cancer, demonstrating that neoantigens comprising such mutations play a crucial role in anti-cancer immunoreactivity12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cancer genomics allows us to precisely determine the landscape of tumour-specific mutations from which such neoantigens may derive15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our knowledge about defined and clinically relevant tumour-specific antigens (TSA) presented by human leucocyte antigens (HLA) and recognizable by T cells is still very limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most efforts to define such antigens in humans and mice currently employ exome and transcriptome analyses followed by in silico epitope prediction and large-scale immunogenicity assays16,17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach results in many predicted peptide ligands, only few of which have proven to be immunogenic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peptide ligands selected for therapeutic targeting by prediction may therefore not be clinically effective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct identification of neoantigens by tumour-infiltrating T cells is highly laborious and time-consuming20, and therefore less suitable for clinical translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are few reports about the direct identification of neoantigens by the analysis of the tumour ligandome using mass spectrometry (MS) and subsequent matching with exome and transcriptome data21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, this approach resulted in the direct identification of therapeutically relevant TSA in two murine models21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, so far mutated peptide ligands identified by MS were derived from analyses of monoclonal cell lines only21,22,23, not representing the complex heterogeneity of native tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereby, especially those clonal mutations representing particular promising target antigens for prolonged tumour rejection24 may be missed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct identification of neoantigens from native tumour tissue samples was so far impeded by limitations in sensitivity and bioinformatics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, translated to human patients, this would represent a major advance for clinical translation of neoantigen-directed immunotherapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We hereby report on the application of our recently developed high sensitivity mass spectrometry workflow25 to the analysis of 25 human native tumour specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide an unprecedented depth of the tumour-derived ligandome harbouring a broad spectrum of attractive tumour-associated antigens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, we discover tumour-specific neoantigens in selected patients validated by the proof of potent patients derived neoantigen-specific anti-tumour immune responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, these data demonstrate that high sensitivity MS is a powerful tool to identify neoantigens highly relevant for the development and optimization of personalized immunotherapies in patients with cancer.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In-depth immunopeptidomics on native melanoma tissue samples', 'Tumour tissue samples from 25 melanoma patients (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2) were used for analysis of biochemically purified HLA class I and II binding peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, we performed 140 MS measurements of purified peptides by LCMS/MS analysis (Supplementary Data 1) using a state-of-the-art mass spectrometer, followed by stringent bio(informatics) analyses in the MaxQuant environment26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify 95,662 unique peptide sequences with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% (Fig 1a, Supplementary Data 2) and report in total 99,355 peptide forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discover 78,605 peptides in the HLA class I peptidome from 12,663 proteins and 15,009 in the HLA class II peptidome from 2,832 proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, 2,048 peptides from 746 proteins are detected in both classes I and II peptidome samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large variability in the number of eluted peptides per patient is in agreement with the amount of eluted HLA complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate this by showing significant positive correlation between the number of identified peptides in HLA class I peptidome and the amount of recovered beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) in each tissue (Supplementary Fig 1a and b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eluted peptides show the characteristic length distribution and the MS-data itself assigns to proper anchor residues of defined HLA allotypes as exemplarily shown for two patients in Fig 1b,c using the Gibbs clustering approach27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of the longer peptides (up to 15 amino acids) identified among the eluted HLA class I peptides still show the typical anchor motifs and are therefore likely binders and not contaminants (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another common approach used to assess purity and overall performance of elution of HLA peptides is the estimation of the affinity of the eluted peptides to the respective HLA molecules by predicting binding affinities25,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis, however, depends very much on the performance of the prediction programs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We predicted the binding affinity of eluted HLA-I peptides from patients Mel15 and Mel16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the difficulty in assignment of peptides with multiple potential restrictions, we filtered the list of peptides to include only 9-mer peptides that bind to only one defined HLA allotype according to the minimum predicted affinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead of using the 500 nM threshold commonly used for peptide binding prediction, we set the threshold for a binding as rank  less_than 2% (standard settings in NetMHC4.0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using our dataset, we observed that a considerable amount of peptides that was assigned as HLA-B3503 binders fit the binding motif (Pro and Ala in the second position and Leu in the last position).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the predicted affinities of these binders (rank  less_than 2%) were extremely low, with median predicted affinity of 2,806 nM (n=581) (Fig 1d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results differ substantially from analysis of HLA-I peptides assigned to HLA-B0702, an allotype with a rather similar motif, for which we observed a median predicted affinity of 17.7 nM of associated peptides (n=1,191) eluted from the tumour of patient Mel16.

ligandome analysis is demonstrated by the identification of a large number of both known and novel peptide ligands derived from described melanocyte-associated differentiation and cancer testis antigens (Fig 2; Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detected the highest number of TAA-derived peptide ligands for the well-known melanoma-associated antigen PMEL (gp100), (64 HLA I and 46 HLA II ligands) a few of which were detected in both classes I and II peptidome samples (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PMEL-derived peptide ligands were distributed over the entire protein but showed hot spot sequences presented by a large number of patients (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We normalized for each patient the number of peptides derived from three selected TAA (PMEL, tyrosinase and PRAME) to the total amount of eluted peptides from the respective patient and correlated peptide presentation to RNA and protein expression of the defined TAA (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These analyses resulted in a statistically significant correlation in case of PMEL (Fig 2dg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed again that, with respect to peptide prediction, many eluted peptide ligands have predicted binding scores of  greater than 500 nM according to NetMHC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, they are still considered among the top 2% (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29) (Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2:

are detected without enrichment', 'We performed a database search by enabling phosphorylation as a variable modification and although we did not specifically enrich for them, we detected a substantial fraction of phospho-HLA peptides within the eluted immunopeptidome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We filtered the list of identified phospho-HLA peptides by restricting the delta score to  greater than 15 and the localization probabilities to  greater than 0.75.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After applying such stringent filters, we identified 365 phospho-HLA-I and 25 phospho-HLA-II peptides (Supplementary Data 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About a quarter of the phospho-HLA binding peptides are shared among at least two patients and 6% of the phospho-HLA peptides have been identified independently in four or more patients tumour samples (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One third of the sites have not been previously described in the PhosphoSitePlus database30 (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional relevant information with respect to these sites is provided in Supplementary Data 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed phosphorylation in 78% of the peptides on Serine and in 19% of the peptides on Threonine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining 3% are on Tyrosine (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To independently check the accuracy of identification of the phospho-HLA peptides, we synthesized 10 of them and all produced identical MS-fragmentation patterns as compared with the patient derived peptides (Supplementary Figs 211).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the position of these phosphorylations, HLA-I peptides were grouped according to their length, as presented in Fig 3d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, independent of the broad spectrum of HLA allotypes, the modification is most prominent on the fourth position of 911 mer HLA-I peptides and on the fourth and sixth positions of 12 mer peptides (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we observed a preferential usage of Arginine and Lysine on position 1 (Fig 3e) as previously reported for phospho-HLA peptides31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, a clear signature of proline-directed phosphorylation is apparent in the sequence logos of the phospho-HLA binding peptides (Fig 3e) as was reported before32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These features therefore seem to be rather HLA allotype-independent and make them attractive to be tested as common target antigen candidates in a broader patient population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken altogether, our direct approach provides data about a large melanoma-associated phosphopeptide ligandome potentially attractive for targeted immunotherapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Characterization of phosphorylation on eluted HLA peptides.Percentage of phospho-HLA peptides commonly detected in two or more patients (a) as well as

depth to identify peptide ligands possibly comprising mutations, as well as validating them as neoantigens (Fig 4a), we first performed exome sequencing of the DNA extracted from five patients' tumours exemplarily selected due to variable responses to immune checkpoint modulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed information about patients and the course of disease is provided in Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig 12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stringent somatic single nucleotide variant (SNV) calling was conducted to define each patient's mutational load and to mimic the state-of-the-art approach for neoepitope prediction (Fig 4b and Supplementary Data 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations previously known in selected tumour probes such as cKIT (P10721.1, L576P; Mel8) and BRAF (P15056.1, V600E; Mel16) were detected by this analysis (Supplementary Data 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, the mutational load among the five patients differed substantially and neither correlated with the number of identified mutated peptide ligands (r=0.65, 95% CI: 053 to 0.98) nor with the response to immune checkpoint modulation (r=0.03, 95% CI: 0.89 to 0.88) (Fig 4b, Supplementary Fig 12 and Supplementary Data 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In parallel, we developed a new module in the MaxQuant software that performs mutations calling from NGS data and generates a customized personalized reference database containing all protein isoforms where a detected SNV alters the amino acid sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then performed a non-stringent mutation calling to avoid loss of SNV during database search.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This resulted in a high number of non-synonymous mutations in all patients ( greater than 15,000 per tumour sample).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We searched the raw MS data from the 5 selected patients against this database and, for the first time, directly identified 11 peptide ligands harbouring mutations from primary human cancer tissues (Table 1, Supplementary Data 6 and Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutated peptide ligands have different intensity ranks in the patients' specific tumour ligandomes, and most are within the second and third quartiles of the intensity distribution (Fig 4c-e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eight mutated peptide ligands have been identified in the tumour of one single patient (Mel15), a tumour sample for which a large peptidome has been discovered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this patient, four tumour-derived tissue sections have been processed in parallel for the elution of peptides that afterwards were measured sequentially.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most mutated peptide ligands from patient Mel15 were independently identified in several MS measurements, supporting that they are well detected and well presented in the tumour of this patient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, SYTL4S363F, RBPMSP46L, SEC23AP52L, MAPK3K9E689K and H3F3CT4I were identified in all four tissue probes, while NCAPG2P333L and AKAP6M1482I were detected in three and two probes, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We synthesized peptides for all HLA ligands representing mutations and found their MS/MS spectra and elution times to be identical to the endogenous ones (Supplementary Fig 1324 and Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, all of the somatic mutations of the 11 neoepitopes were also detected by the stringent SNV calling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some cases, we detected the wildtype (wt) peptides, either in the same sample, like wt SYTL4 in Mel15 and wt GABPA and wt SEPT2 in Mel5, or in several other patients samples, for example GABPA and SEPT2 (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might indicate that they are located within hot spots for HLA peptide biogenesis, and since the peptides have been purified from a tissue that contains also healthy cells to a variable degree, presentation of the wt peptides is expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ", "Figure 4: Identification of mutated peptide ligands by matching exome sequencing and mass spectrometry

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We hereby present for the first time integrative classes I and II immunopeptidomes of native melanoma tissue samples resulting in the identification of almost 100,000 peptide ligands naturally presented on the tumour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With our methodology  greater than 95% of the peptides fit the binding motifs of the different HLA-I allotypes25, supporting the high yield and purity of the eluted peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, among the long HLA-I peptides, many seem to fit well to the distinct binding motifs as shown for Mel15 and Mel16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in concord to other reports about long HLA-I binders33,34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that identical peptides that have been detected in both the class I and II peptidome may be related to common cellular processing which need to be tested in future studies36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The depth of the ligandome is highlighted by the large number of both, known and novel peptide ligands derived from previously described tumour and melanoma-associated antigens like PMEL, tyrosinase, MELAN-A, NY-ESO-1 and several proteins of the MAGE superfamily of cancer testis antigens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In case of PMEL, from which we detected almost 100 different peptide sequences, the magnitude of presentation, estimated by the number of unique peptide ligands per peptidome sample correlated with messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alignment of the PMEL derived HLA peptides on the PMEL protein sequence revealed that several domains along the protein sequence are sources of multiple class I and II peptides in several tumour samples derived from diverse patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We collectively name such domains as hot spots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other domains may not be as efficiently accessible for the antigen processing and presentation machinery and those were either not presented at all by any of the 25 studied melanoma tumours, or their resulting peptides were below our detection limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeting of PMEL by peptide-based vaccination showed only limited clinical success when compared with results of checkpoint modulation4 and combination of anti-CTLA-4 treatment with PMEL vaccination did not enhance anti-tumour activity9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that our large dataset might shed light on the extent these peptides are presented in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the two nonameric peptides, P209 and P280, used previously for vaccination were eluted only from tumour probes of Mel27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of P209, the nonamer peptide sequence is indeed located in the most dominant hot spot for presentation, although the sequence was, with exception of Mel27, included in peptide ligands with a length  greater than 14 aa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of P280, the peptide sequence could be detected only in Mel27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest other PMEL-derived peptides to be potentially more promising for defined targeting in a larger patient cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "Even without further enrichment, peptide ligands harbouring posttranslational modifications as phosphorylation were detected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies for the high recovery and sensitivity of our method and importantly it avoids the requirement of reservation of dedicated samples for enrichments of phospho-peptides and additional laborious sample processing38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, such peptides may contain cancer-specific phosphorylation patterns and therefore potentially represent attractive targets for cancer immunotherapy31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One third of identified phosphorylation sites have not been reported in the PhosphoSitePlus database30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We envision that direct immunopeptidomic analyses have the potential to identify novel sites on protein sequences that may not be compatible with trypsin digestion and therefore may be undetected by shotgun phospho-proteomics39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24% of the phospho-HLA peptides have been identified in tumour samples derived from multiple patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A clear signature of proline-directed phosphorylation of the detected HLA peptides could be observed and this is likely to be assigned to a defined kinase motif associated to cell proliferation and tumorigenicity32,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our data point to a common oncogenic phospho-peptide signature potentially attractive for multimodal targeting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, our data revealed a very conserved motif within detected phospho-HLA peptides with preferred Arginine and Lysine in P1 and the phosphorylation site in P4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This canonical motif has been previously described for defined HLA allotypes and structural data suggest that the conserved amino acid usage in P1 may increase peptide binding of low affinity peptides whereas phosphorylation in P4 may improve immunogenicity by direct presentation of the phosphorylation site to the TCR or conformational peptide changes31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data indicate that such peptides are presented over a broad HLA repertoire making these peptides attractive to be tested as more general target antigens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reactivity of patients' derived autologous T cells with specificity for these peptides might be limited due to negative thymic depletion of reactive T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, TCR derived from the mismatched or xenogeneic repertoire may still represent attractive therapeutic tools to target self-antigens with cancer-specific expression in adults41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ", "In contrast to shared TAA, mutated peptide ligands can be regarded as foreign antigens which have been previously described to be well detectable by autologous T cells in diverse disease settings16,17,19,20,42,43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Especially clonogenic ones have been shown to be associated to a durable clinical benefit by immune checkpoint inhibitors24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hereby describe for the first time the identification of mutated peptide ligands derived from patients' non-modified and non-cultivated native tumour tissue samples using our discovery MS approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within this proof of concept, with testing of five patients, we detected 11 mutated peptide ligands, 8 of them in one patient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This patient experienced prolonged clinical benefit following the application of Ipilimumab, a checkpoint inhibitor involved in the enhancement of primary and memory T-cell responses45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, response to treatment in melanoma has been associated to the mutational load, suggesting that mutated peptide ligands are the major source of target antigens13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Few mutated peptide ligands have been previously identified by MS using murine or human cell lines as raw material21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the direct identification of neoantigens from non-modified native human tumour tissue represents an important breakthrough for several reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissue, unlike cell lines, is heterogeneous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although more challenging, mutated peptide ligands identified from this material are likely among the most well presented peptides and hence the best targets for immune interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, most mutated peptide ligands identified from Mel15 were independently identified in several MS measurements of different tissue probes, and their measured MS intensity indicates adequate presentation similar to non-mutated self-antigens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MS-based detection is by nature biased to detect the more abundant peptides and hence will favour identification of clonogenic mutated peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, mutations present only in malignant subclones are likely to be under-represented in the total peptidome and therefore below the detection limit of the current MS-based discovery approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ", 'Most of the neoantigens we detected are predicted to bind with high affinity to their respective HLA molecules, although they are mostly not within the top 10 predicted ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In case that amino acid alterations are located in anchor positions, novel ligands may be generated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in case that the alterations are not in anchor positions there is a fair chance that also the wt peptides will be detected by MS, especially if the peptides are expected to bind with high affinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we detected the corresponding wt peptides of mutated SYTL4 and GABPA in the peptidomes of Mel15 and Mel5, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we also detected corresponding wt peptides, and also sequences that are shorter or longer versions of the core neoantigen sequences in HLA peptidome samples of other patients with alternative HLA allotypes as e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  for RPBMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple peptide sequences homing to a certain location on the protein suggest that this might be again a hot spot for presentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, mutations that are included in hot spots may have preferred presentation in vivo, although larger studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if this hypothesis is correct, future large-scale immunopeptidomics studies are expected to reveal such hot spots in the human proteome, and consequently in-silico algorithms should prioritize neoantigen candidates that are included within them in order to shorten the target list.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The potential and promise of MS detection of neoantigens is in fact highlighted by the hit rate of mutated peptide ligands with obvious clinical relevance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, two out of eight mutated peptide ligands were detected by blood and TIL-derived autologous T cells of patient Mel15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates a clear advantage compared with the usage of prediction software tools to identify neoantigens16,19,24,44,46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, mutation-specific T-cell responses could be detected as early as two days after peptide stimulation without prior enrichment as previously published44,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutation-specific T-cell lines recognized freshly isolated tumour material further emphasizing clinical relevance of these neoantigens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, neoantigen-specific responses were declining over time whereas a single remaining lung metastasis started to progress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are highly intriguing and suggest that mutation-specific T-cell responses might be investigated as personalized surrogate biomarkers in future studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two other mutated peptide ligands were recognized by matched allogeneic T cells and we suggest that such matched allogeneic T cells may be an attractive source to be used for adoptive T-cell or TCR transfer as recently published and suggested43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, in-depth characterization of one defined T-cell population demonstrated reactivity also against the wt peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distinct T-cell population was not detected by the wt multimer and wt-peptide-specific cytokine release was clearly inferior if compared with the mutated peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, lysis of minigene-transduced or peptide-pulsed target cells presenting respective wt epitope reached high levels comparable to lysis of targets presenting the mutated ligand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that differences in TCR avidity in response to mutated versus wt peptide may follow similar rules compared with observed differences in response to viral antigens48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, multi-functional characterization of neoantigen-specific T cells is important to estimate risks of autoimmunity and neoantigen-specific matched allogeneic T-cell populations or TCR need to be carefully selected for adoptive transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The time necessary for direct identification of mutated peptide ligands by MS using native tissue probes can be as short as three weeks, including whole exome sequencing analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, this approach is highly suitable for the development of personalized treatment approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the usage of cell lines as raw material for MS analysis requires prolonged time for generation of a sufficient number of cells and is not always successful.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the prediction approach currently predominantly used for identification of presumable neoantigens is highly time consuming and expensive as subsequent large-scale immunogenicity testings are necessary for neoantigen validation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the prediction approach harbours the risk for biased or limited results especially in case of binders to rare HLA allotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data indicate that the commonly used threshold for predicted affinity of 500 nM is by far too low for some HLA allotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, our data may be highly useful as to be a training dataset to further improve the performance of such predictors and consequently to enable more reliable in-silico identification of neoepitopes in the future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The issue of the sensitivity of this discovery MS-based approach is currently the major limitation as indicated by the limited number of identified neoantigens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More than that, we could not detect neoantigens among the class II peptidome in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter result was expected as class II molecules are typically expressed on professional antigen presenting cells in the tumour microenvironment, and often not directly on the melanoma cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, unlike T-cell based assays, the MS approach is not sensitive enough to detect the few copies of neoantigens presented only on professional antigen presenting cells that are in the tumour microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more intensive fractionation of the HLA peptides sample prior to the MS analysis may increase the depth but will also significantly increase the investment in MS measurement time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We envision that the new generations of MS instruments, new computational algorithms and more efficient procedures for sample preparations will further improve the sensitivity and therefore this direct antigen discovery approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The direct identification of clinically relevant antigens, both shared and private, will foster our understanding of essential characteristics of targets and their respective specific T cells relevant for effective tumour rejection and protection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Defined neoepitopes can be targeted by vaccination and respective T-cell responses can be tracked and used as biomarkers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neoepitopes and defined common TAA not recognized by the patients T cells may be attractive for alternative immunotherapeutic strategies such as transfer of effector cells with defined specificity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
