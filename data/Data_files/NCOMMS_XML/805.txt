mTORC1-independent TFEB activation via Akt inhibition promotes cellular clearance in neurodegenerative storage diseases  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Neurodegenerative diseases characterized by aberrant accumulation of undigested cellular components represent unmet medical conditions for which the identification of actionable targets is urgently needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we identify a pharmacologically actionable pathway that controls cellular clearance via Akt modulation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that Akt phosphorylates TFEB at Ser467 and represses TFEB nuclear translocation independently of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a known TFEB inhibitor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The autophagy enhancer trehalose activates TFEB by diminishing Akt activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Administration of trehalose to a mouse model of Batten disease, a prototypical neurodegenerative disease presenting with intralysosomal storage, enhances clearance of proteolipid aggregates, reduces neuropathology and prolongs survival of diseased mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pharmacological inhibition of Akt promotes cellular clearance in cells from patients with a variety of lysosomal diseases, thus suggesting broad applicability of this approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings open new perspectives for the clinical translation of TFEB-mediated enhancement of cellular clearance in neurodegenerative storage diseases.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Neurodegenerative diseases pose a major burden on public health that is expected to increase in the next decades due to the extension of life expectancy and global population aging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike other human health conditions, neurodegenerative diseases have proven to be extraordinarily refractory to attempts to halt or slow their progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, no approved treatments exist for any neurodegenerative disease that significantly extend life span or modify clinical progression1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, neurodegenerative diseases represent unmet medical conditions for which the identification of effective, pharmacologically actionable targets is urgently needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mounting genetic and experimental evidence converges on cellular clearance pathways as the main processes implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the vast majority of patients with a neurodegenerative condition have aberrant neuronal accumulation of undigested macromolecules, as a result of an overwhelmed or impaired cellular degradative system2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the identified causes is the abnormal generation of aggregation-prone proteins, which are less efficiently disposed of by the cell, and genetic defects that directly or indirectly affect the autophagiclysosomal degradative pathway4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, a general paradigm is emerging, which proposes that enhancement of cellular clearance in these disease conditions will help maintain cellular homoeostasis and prevent neuronal cell death5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our recent identification of a genetic program that oversees lysosomal biogenesis and function has provided a suitable target to manipulate lysosomal degradative pathways7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor EB (TFEB) indeed acts as a master regulator of cellular clearance through the enhancement of several processes that include lysosomal proliferation8, expression of degradative enzymes8,9, autophagy10, lysosomal exocytosis11 and lysosomal proteostasis12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo studies based on heterologous expression of TFEB have shown improved clearance and amelioration of disease phenotypes in rodent models of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimers disease13,14, tauopathy15, Parkinsons disease16 and Huntingtons disease8,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An opportunity for pharmacological activation of TFEB has stemmed from cell-based studies that indicate that TFEB is negatively regulated by the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)18,19,20, the main known factor restricting autophagy induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Catalytic inhibition of mTORC1 in cells leads to TFEB activation; however, rapamycinthe mTORC1 allosteric inhibitor that along with its analogues is leading research in mTOR-related translational applicationsis quite ineffective at activating TFEB18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, no pharmacological therapy of TFEB activation has been proposed yet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identification of alternative routes to activate TFEB is therefore needed to move the field forward in translational applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we identify the serine/threonine kinase Akt (protein kinase B) as a pharmacologically actionable target that controls TFEB activity independently of mTORC1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the non-reducing disaccharide of glucose, -D-glucopyranosyl -D-glucopyranoside or trehalose, an mTOR-independent autophagy inducer21, promotes nuclear translocation of TFEB by inhibiting Akt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that trehalose administration reduces disease burden in a mouse model of a prototypical neurodegenerative disease that presents with abnormal intralysosomal accumulation of undegraded proteinaceous material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that TFEB activity is modulated by Akt phosphorylation at Ser467, and that Akt pharmacological inhibition promotes cellular clearance in a variety of models of genetic diseases presenting with impairment of lysosomal pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modulation of Akt activity is the subject of intense clinical studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the finding that Akt controls TFEB-mediated clearance opens novel perspectives for future pharmacological therapies of neurodegenerative storage disorders.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Trehalose attenuates neuropathology in a model of JNCL', 'The most documented example of mTORC1-independent activation of cellular clearance is that exerted by trehalose22,23,24,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that trehalose activates TFEB through a hitherto uncharacterized pathway, and set out to test this hypothesis using a prototypical model of aberrant intralysosomal storage represented by juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL or Batten disease; OMIM #204200), the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder of childhood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  JNCL is caused by mutations in CLN3, a gene involved in the regulation of lysosomal homoeostasis27,28,29, and is characterized by autophagic impairment and intralysosomal accumulation of ceroid lipopigment, which is detectable by confocal and electron microscopy30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Oral trehalose administration to Cln3ex7-8 mice, an established model of JNCL32, significantly extended their life span.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The median survival of Cln3ex7-8 mice increased from 454 to 522 days (15% increase, log-rank P=0.00566) and the maximum life span increased from 544 to 699 days (28% increase; Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Post mortem examination and neuroimaging studies of JNCL patients have shown generalized brain atrophy, including significant thinning of the corpus callosum (CC) and brainstem33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in JNCL mice reported that CLN3 protein deficiency results in a similar generalized atrophy of the brain, thereby mirroring the human condition35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured the wet brain weight of 12-month-old Cln3ex7-8 mice (0.355±0.024 g) and found that it was indeed significantly lower than that of age-matched wild-type (WT) mice (0.516±0.021 g; P=0.0016); however, this difference was largely rescued by trehalose treatment (0.473±0.028 g; difference with untreated Cln3ex7-8 mice, P=0.032; Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, trehalose administration did not affect the body weight of Cln3ex7-8 or WT mice (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next evaluated the CC volume of fixed brains by MRI analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative measurement of 48 stacks per sample showed that Cln3ex7-8 mice had a marked reduction in the volume of the CC (12.96±0.43 mm3; Supplementary Movie 1) compared with their WT counterparts (16.81±0.89 mm3; P=0.0081; Fig 1c; Supplementary Movie 2), which was also rescued by the treatment (15.02±0.33 mm3; difference with untreated Cln3ex7-8 mice, P=0.027; Fig 1c; Supplementary Movie 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis of WT mice treated with trehalose did not show any significant changes in CC volume (18.27±0.66 mm3; Fig 1c; Supplementary Movie 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Amelioration of disease pathology in JNCL mice fed with trehalose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Trehalose significantly extended survival of Cln3ex78 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treated (Tre) Cln3ex7-8 mice: n=13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Untreated (UT) Cln3ex7-8 mice: n=12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Weight of brains from 12-month-old WT and Cln3ex7-8 mice with or without trehalose treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All groups of mice, n=4 or 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Fractional anisotropy of brains from 12-month-old WT and Cln3ex7-8 mice with or without trehalose treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Left panel: representative coronal images of the four groups of brains; corpus callosa are indicated by the yellow arrowhead.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Right panel: quantification of callosal volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All groups of mice, n=3 or 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 2 m.

effectiveness while preserving adaptability to ever-changing cell conditions42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we reasoned that upstream regulators of TFEB might lie in the same signalling cascade that includes mTORC1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The kinase activity of mTORC1 is tightly regulated by TSC2, which becomes inactive on phosphorylation by the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because inhibition of either PI3K or Akt resulted in TFEB nuclear translocation similar to mTORC1 inhibition by Torin 1 (Fig 7a,b), we investigated whether Akt directly regulates TFEB activity independent of mTORC1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used Tsc2/ cells to test TFEB responsiveness to Akt activity under conditions of constitutive activation of mTORC1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous studies44, Akt activity could be stimulated by serum repletion in Tsc2/ cells, where the mTORC1 pathway is insensitive to serum removal or stimulation (Supplementary Fig 8a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, serum re-stimulation of serum-starved Tsc2/ cells resulted in TFEB nucleus-to-cytosol translocation, which was prevented by preincubation with the Akt inhibitor MK2206 (Supplementary Fig 8b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, Akt activity is required for TFEB cytosolic localization on serum stimulation independent of mTORC1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also checked possible interdependence with GSK3, another factor modulating TFEB subcellular localization45,46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An immunoblot analysis showed no detectable effect of trehalose on GSK3 activity (Supplementary Fig 9a), and confocal microscopic analyses showed that both trehalose and MK2206 were able to induce nuclear translocation of TFEB in cells expressing constitutively active GSK3 (CA-GSK3/S9A-GSK3; Supplementary Fig 9b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'This study identifies Akt control of TFEB activity as an mTORC1-independent, pharmacologically actionable target with potential relevance for the treatment of neurodegenerative storage diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TFEB is indeed a central hub controlling lysosome-based cellular clearance8, whose potential therapeutic relevance has been demonstrated in models of the major neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease and Huntingtons disease through proof-of-principle studies based on heterologous expression of TFEB8,13,14,15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data using Batten disease mice as an in vivo model of neuronal intralysosomal storage demonstrate that lysosomal enhancement can be leveraged to counteract defects in clearance pathways due to primary impairment of lysosomal homoeostasis and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are relevant for lysosomal storage disorders that, like the juvenile form of Batten disease, are caused by the deficiency of a membrane-bound protein for which approaches based on bone marrow transplantation or gene therapy are inherently difficult to apply52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More broadly, our findings are of potential interest for neurodegenerative storage diseases for which validated targets of treatment have still not been established, yet experimental evidence has identified enhancement of cellular clearance pathways as a candidate therapeutic target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pioneering genetic and mechanistic studies have indeed unveiled strong links between pathogenic mechanisms and lysosomal function in these diseases2,3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Understanding how to pharmacologically control TFEB activity is urgently needed to move the field forward and help set-up clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy of TFEB-mediated lysosomal enhancement in neurodegenerative disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent cell-based studies have shown that TFEB activity may be regulated by mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation at specific serine residues in response to changes in the nutritional status18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This represented a significant discovery because mTORC1 itself is known to be involved in the regulation of autophagy and has therefore been the subject of pre-clinical investigation in models of neurodegenerative diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results from multiple studies indicated that autophagy upregulation via mTORC1 inhibition attenuates neurodegenerative pathology in mouse models of Huntingtons disease53, Alzheimers disease54,55, tauopathy56, frontotemporal lobar dementia57, spinocerebellar ataxia type III (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  58) and familial prion disease59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mTORC1, however, acts as a central regulatory hub controlling anabolic pathways such as cell growth by modulating the synthesis of proteins, lipids and nucleotides60, and long-term mTORC1 inhibition results in induction of immunosuppression and impaired wound healing3,61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinically, mTORC1 inhibition is obtained by using rapamycin, the first identified mTORC1 allosteric inhibitor62, or rapamycin analogues that present improved pharmacological profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, allosteric inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin has small or no effects on TFEB activation18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our identification of an mTORC1-independent route to pharmacologically activate TFEB offers a new avenue to test TFEB-mediated enhancement of cellular clearance in neurodegenerative diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, TFEB pharmacological activation and mTORC1 allosteric inhibition could be used as orthogonal, synergic activators of autophagiclysosomal clearance pathways, ideally identifying drug dosages that would minimize potential side effects of either drug.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increased availability of Akt inhibitors and, importantly, of dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors may therefore prove beneficial for future pre-clinical and clinical studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Akt, a member of the AGC serine/threonine kinase family, plays key roles in the cell survival and apoptosis inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Abnormal activation of Akt may occur through mechanisms such as Akt mutation or dysregulation of upstream signalling pathways, and is an important driver of malignant progression and chemoresistance63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This makes Akt a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intense pre-clinical and clinical effort is indeed being placed on characterizing downstream pathways regulated by Akt and in testing chemical inhibition of Akt in cancer patients49,50,64,65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, pioneering studies have shown that Akt regulates macroautophagy66 and chaperone-mediated autophagy67.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While it remains to be determined how a disaccharide like trehalose modulates Akt activation, the finding that Akt regulates lysosomal function via TFEB adds a crucial layer in the characterization of Akts role in autophagiclysosomal clearance pathways and offers a novel angle in understanding the cellular processes that are impacted by the clinical use of Akt inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since PI3K-Akt pathway plays a key role in the integration of signals from secreted growth factors to stimulate mTORC1 activity, it is also interesting that Akt inhibition by trehalose does not inhibit mTORC1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In response to growth factors, Akt phosphorylates and inhibits the TSC2, which acts as a negative regulator of mTORC1 by maintaining the mTORC1 direct activator, Rheb, in its inactive GDP-bound state68.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another upstream regulator of mTORC1 that acts in parallel to Akt via the same TSC2/Rheb cascade is ERK, which integrates signals from growth factors through the Ras-ERK pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to Akt, ERK also inhibits TSC2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that trehalose inhibits Akt but not ERK activity; therefore, it is possible that active ERK is sufficient to keep TSC2 inactive, thus resulting in an unmodified mTORC1 signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TSC proteins also integrate signals from other pathways, thus additional layers of regulation might be responsible for mTORC1 insensitivity to trehalose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, the identification of Akt as an mTORC1-independent regulator of TFEB opens new perspectives for the pharmacological control of TFEB-mediated cellular clearance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Akt modulation of TFEB might be exploited therapeutically to enhance cellular clearance in neurodegenerative storage disorders, and the availability of drugs that target the Akt-TFEB signalling pathway warrants future studies aimed at the clinical translation of TFEB-mediated lysosomal enhancement in neurodegenerative diseases.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
