A live RSV vaccine with engineered thermostability is immunogenic in cotton rats despite high attenuation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of infant hospitalization and there remains no pediatric vaccine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RSV live-attenuated vaccines (LAVs) have a history of safe testing in infants; however, achieving an effective balance of attenuation and immunogenicity has proven challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we seek to engineer an RSV LAV with enhanced immunogenicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic mapping identifies strain line 19 fusion (F) protein residues that correlate with pre-fusion antigen maintenance by ELISA and thermal stability of infectivity in live RSV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We generate a LAV candidate named OE4 which expresses line 19F and is attenuated by codon-deoptimization of non-structural (NS1 and NS2) genes, deletion of the small hydrophobic (SH) gene, codon-deoptimization of the attachment (G) gene and ablation of the secreted form of G. OE4 (RSV-A2-dNS1-dNS2-SH-dGm-Gsnull-line19F) exhibits elevated pre-fusion antigen levels, thermal stability, immunogenicity, and efficacy despite heavy attenuation in the upper and lower airways of cotton rats.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In the 1960s, a formalin-inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) vaccine primed for enhanced illness in infants on natural infection1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenomenon was replicable in animal models and considered dependent on RSV naive status2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent studies using subunit-based vaccines also primed for immunopathology in animals3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These early RSV vaccines encouraged development of LAVs, which do not prime for enhanced disease in animals or seronegative infants2,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, development of pediatric RSV LAV strains with sufficient attenuation and immunogenicity has been difficult6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address these dual challenges, newer RSV LAVs have incorporated genetic modifications rationally designed to retain or enhance immunogenicity compared with wild-type virus7,8,9 because natural infection may be suboptimally immunogenic for LAVs derived by classic attenuation methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recent elucidation of the structure of the pre-fusion conformation of RSV F protein (pre-F10) and discovery of its importance as a natural immunogen11 has had implications for RSV vaccine development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high capacity of pre-F to elicit neutralizing antibody titres has been demonstrated in multiple vaccine platforms, including purified proteins12,13,14, virus-like particles15, and recombinant parainfluenza viruses16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Use of pre-F in passive immunization, either by anti-pre-F monoclonal antibody (mAb) prophylaxis or by boosting RSV neutralizing antibody (nAb) titres in pregnant mothers with pre-F protein-based vaccines, holds promise for reducing RSV disease in the youngest infants14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, active immunization of infants with a replicating RSV vaccine could potentially have a large child health benefit if protection spanned beyond the persistence of passively acquired maternal Ab.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since natural RSV infection induces anti-pre-F nAb11, we hypothesized that RSV with enhanced pre-F expression would have increased LAV immunogenicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we first identified a chimeric RSV strain A2-line19F with enhanced pre-fusion antigen levels, thermostability and immunogenicity compared with parental strain A2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then incorporated line19F into an RSV LAV candidate OE4 with the genotype RSV-A2-dNS1- dNS2-SH-dGm-Gsnull-line19F.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that OE4 exhibited elevated pre-fusion antigen levels, thermal stability, immunogenicity, and efficacy despite heavy attenuation in the upper and lower airways of cotton rats.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

We found that strain A2-line19F, which expresses the F protein of strain line 19 in the background of the prototypical A2 strain20,21, exhibited significantly higher relative binding to MPE8 than did strain A2 (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed this finding using the human monoclonal antibody D25, which binds to a distinct antigenic site on pre-F (antigenic site Ø)10 with even greater specificity than MPE8 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that A2-line19F exhibited higher relative binding to D25 than A2, which was similar in magnitude and correlated with MPE8 binding (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: MPE8 and D25 ELISAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Ratio of direct ELISA using MPE8, a pre-F-specific mAb, to direct ELISA using motavizumab, a total F mAb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values are normalized to strain A2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For A2-line19F mutants, the asterisks show significant differences compared with A2-line19F.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Ratio of direct ELISA using D25, another pre-F-specific mAb, to direct ELISA using motavizumab.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All graphs represent the means+s.d.s of at least two experimental replicates, and data were analysed by one-way ANOVA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When significant, P values are shown as a bracket between groups (P less_than 0.0005) or by asterisk when compared with A2-line19F (*P less_than 0.05;

consistent with its expression of the line 19F protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further explored this relationship by quantifying pre-F stability as measured by MPE8 binding of OE4 and A2 from virus stocks incubated at 4 °C over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative pre-F antigen levels declined in both viruses over a period of 8 days (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the kinetics of thermal stability of A2 and OE4 infectivity did not correlate with the decay of pre-F antigen levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, OE4 maintained greater than twice the levels of pre-F antigen levels at each time point compared with A2 (Supplementary Fig 2b), and a minimal threshold of pre-F may be sufficient to maintain infectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In order to assess the overall structure of the virions

'We identified a chimeric RSV strain A2-line19F that had increased relative MPE8 binding, increased thermal stability in viral stocks and increased immunogenicity in vivo compared with parental strain A2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A2-line19F differs from A2 by only five unique residues within the F protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incorporation of two of these residues (357/371) into a heterologous vaccine strain DB1 conferred increased relative MPE8 binding and increased thermal stability at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To exploit these properties in an RSV LAV, we incorporated the line 19F protein into a rationally designed vaccine candidate OE4 with the genotype RSV-A2-dNS1-dNS2-SH-dGm-GSnull-line19F.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like A2-line19F, OE4 had increased relative MPE8 and D25 binding and increased thermal stability compared with RSV A2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OE4 was also immunogenic and highly efficacious in BALB/c mice and cotton rats, despite significant levels of attenuation in vitro and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutations incorporated into OE4 were genetically stable in virus recovered from BALB/c mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, lung histopathologic staining demonstrated that OE4 was not mucogenic in mice, nor did it cause enhanced histopathology following RSV challenge in cotton rats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One inherent limitation of our study is that neither mice nor cotton rats fully recapitulate RSV disease in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, for example, we observed a difference in the attenuation levels of OE4 in our two animal models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas OE4 was highly attenuated in cotton rats and in human primary airway epithelial cells, it was less attenuated in BALB/c mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that OE4 was more immunogenic in BALB/c mice than in cotton rats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suspect these discrepancies were attributable to strain-specific differences in the attachment and infectivity of the line 19F protein and the differential effects of codon-deoptimized G protein in cotton rats compared with mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Teng et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  demonstrated that deletion of G from an RSV clinical stain was completely attenuating in cotton rats32, whereas Widjojoatmodjo et al.42 found that RSV-G was only moderately attenuated in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, OE4 was significantly attenuated in both animal models and was capable of inducing protective neutralizing antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A second limitation of our study relates to the utilization of MPE8 and D25 ELISAs to quantify pre-F antigen levels in viral stocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both MPE8 and D25 are monoclonal antibodies that preferentially bind to the pre-fusion conformation of F; however, the conformational specificities of these two antibodies have not been fully validated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MPE8, in particular, competes with palivizumab19 and binds only 1020 times better to pre- than post-fusion F22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D25, in contrast, binds at the apex of the pre-fusion trimer at the antigenic site Ø which undergoes marked structural rearrangement upon transition to post-F (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, D25 binds with even greater specificity to pre- than post-F (100-fold); ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, limited cross-reactivity with post-F has been observed, and a monomeric form of F has also been identified which retains pre-fusion-specific epitopes13,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these limitations, both MPE8 and D25 demonstrate relatively high pre-F specificity, and generated consistent results among the viruses analysed in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Native immunogold labelling combined with thin-section TEM also demonstrated increased pre-F and total F on the surface of OE4 compared with A2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suspect the increased incorporation of total F into OE4 was attributable to the deletion of the SH gene, which shifted the F gene towards the viral promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vast majority of F in both OE4 and A2 was in the pre-fusion conformation, likely because the virions were maintained in their native states and not subjected to viral harvesting and stock preparation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subvolume averaging of the F structures confirmed that the majority of F was in the pre-fusion conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, application of heat to A2 triggered the conformational change to post-F, clearly demonstrating a relationship between temperature and pre-F stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these results demonstrate that heat triggers the transition from pre- to post-fusion F, the relationship between temperature and pre-F stability remains incompletely defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the favourable immunogenicity to attenuation profile of OE4 is likely multifactorial and cannot be attributed specifically to the expression of pre-fusion F or to thermostability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we identified key molecular determinant positions of RSV line 19F which were associated with both thermal stability and the availability of the pre-F antigen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetically modifying these residues to thermally stabilize and boost immunogenicity of RSV LAVs represents a promising new approach to next-generation RSV vaccine design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using reverse genetics, we rationally designed a novel RSV LAV OE4 that incorporated line 19F into the genotype RSV-A2-dNS1-dNS2-SH-dGm-GSnull-line19F.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to being thermally and genetically stable, OE4 was also highly immunogenic and efficacious despite significant attenuation in vitro and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data demonstrate that we fundamentally altered RSV immunogenicity and generated a promising LAV candidate that merits further investigation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

#@NEW_LINE#@#  A version of OE4 without the mKate2 gene was also generated from pSynkRSV-dNS1-dNS2-SH-line19F by excising the coding region containing the mKate2 gene with KpnI and AvrII.
