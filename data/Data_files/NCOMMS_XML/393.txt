Enhancing digestibility and ethanol yield of Populus wood via expression of an engineered monolignol 4-O-methyltransferase  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Producing cellulosic biofuels and bio-based chemicals from woody biomass is impeded by the presence of lignin polymer in the plant cell wall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Manipulating the monolignol biosynthetic pathway offers a promising approach to improved processability, but often impairs plant growth and development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that expressing an engineered 4-O-methyltransferase that chemically modifies the phenolic moiety of lignin monomeric precursors, thus preventing their incorporation into the lignin polymer, substantially alters hybrid aspens lignin content and structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Woody biomass derived from the transgenic aspens shows a 62% increase in the release of simple sugars and up to a 49% increase in the yield of ethanol when the woody biomass is subjected to enzymatic digestion and yeast-mediated fermentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the cell wall structural changes do not affect growth and biomass production of the trees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study provides a useful strategy for tailoring woody biomass for bio-based applications.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Wood is one of the worlds most abundant natural materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is widely used in pulp and paper manufacturing and recently has been considered a promising source of simple sugars for industrial bio-based products and advanced biofuels1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wood is the secondary xylem of vascular plants, consisting of a compound middle lamella and secondary wall layers composed of a cellulose/hemicellulose network, and impregnated with lignin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the wood of Populus spp., these polymers occur in the approximate proportions of 45% cellulose, 25% hemicelluloses and 20% lignin2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lignin in the wood forms a hydrophobic barrier hindering the access of digestive enzymes to polysaccharides and decreasing their activity; therefore, it is a significant limiting factor in converting woody biomass to fermentable sugars in processes towards biofuels1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lignins are complex and heterogeneous polymers of 4-hydroxy-phenylpropanoid units3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are derived from the oxidative radical coupling of three typical building blocks (that is, the monolignols), p-coumaryl, coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After their incorporation into the growing lignin polymer, these hydroxycinnamyl alcohols correspondingly produce p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) subunits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount and composition of lignin varies among taxa, cell types and the individual layers of the cell walls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, the S/G ratio dictates the degree of lignin condensation and reactivity by supporting different types of subunit linkages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A higher G-unit content creates more condensed lignin that is composed of a greater portion of biphenyl, phenylcoumaran and other carboncarbon linked units as their 5-position on the aromatic ring is available for radical coupling reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S-units, in contrast, are more commonly linked through ether bonds at the available 4-hydroxy position of the growing lignin polymer yielding more linear and chemically relatively labile polymers3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For several decades, considerable effort has been expended in tailoring monolignol biosynthesis to control lignin content and/or composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several studies have successfully demonstrated that reducing lignin content or modifying its structure in plants could translate into improved saccharification efficiency, and thus, lead to reduced biomass conversion costs4,5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A few studies also reported that manipulating monolignol biosynthetic genes such as caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT), and 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL) in, for example, swtichgrass (Panicum virgatum) or ryegrass (Lolium pernne), appeared to have no negative effect on crops agronomic performance and/or biomass yield8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, on the other hand, many investigations of different plant species show that the growth and development of the engineered plants is often compromised by the simple disruption of the monolignol biosynthetic pathway, and/or by a dramatic reduction of the content of lignin in the cell wall11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is particularly evident in the manipulation of hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA: shikimate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HCT) gene in alfalfa12, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), coumaroyl 3-hydroxylase (C3H), and cinnamoyl-coa reductase (CCR) genes in Arabidopsis, alfalfa, and hybrid poplars6,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though down-regulation of 4CL did not affect biomass production of swtichgrass, the silencing of this gene in pine16 and poplar caused obviously stunted plant growth17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, COMT-deficient brown midrib mutants of maize (bm3) and sorghum (bmr12), and COMT-downregulated sugarcane exhibited a biomass yield reduction19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is desirable to further explore a more effective strategy to modulate lignin synthesis and structure, thus improving the efficiency of the bioconversion of wood, while sustaining the plant growth and development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Illustration of

processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) The reaction catalysed by the engineered monolignol 4-O-methyltransferase, which deprives the propensity of the modified lignin precursors for further polymerization.Full size image', 'Lignin polymerization commences with one-electron oxidation of the phenols of monolignols by oxidative enzymes, laccases and/or peroxidases, to yield activated radical intermediates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coupling of monolignol radicals with each other (for the initiation of lignin polymer) and, more importantly, with the growing polymer forms lignins3,22 (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this process, a free phenol (the unsubstituted 4-hydroxy group of a monolignol, and/or the free-phenolic end of the growing polymer), is essential for generating phenolic radicals to allow radical coupling that forms the different types of lignin inter-unit linkages3,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously, we demonstrated that chemical modification, that is, the methylation of the 4-hydroxy group of a monolignol, prevents the participation of the monolignol derivative in the subsequent coupling process, thus disrupting lignin formation24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on this observation, we engineered a set of novel O-methyltransferase (OMT) variants using structure-guided iterative saturation mutagenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These OMT variants effectively catalyse the 4-O-methylation of monolignols, and are therefore termed monolignol 4-O-methyltransferases (MOMTs)24 (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of these variants, MOMT4, shows a slight catalytic preference for methylating sinapyl alcohol, the S-lignin precursor, in vitro25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate its potential effects on lignin synthesis in woody species, and its application in tailoring wood digestibility for biofuel production, in this study we express MOMT4 in hybrid aspen (Populus tremula × Populus alba), a fast growing Populus species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that the expression of MOMT4 in aspen markedly alters lignin structure, with more than a 50% reduction of the labile S-units and about a fourfold increase in condensed lignin subunit cross-linkages by G-units.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in contrast to our common perception, along with the increase of condensed lignin structures, the efficiency of the release of simple sugars from transgenic woods increases up to 62%, and the ethanol yield from pretreated and non-treated transgenic woods rise by  greater than 40% and 49%, respectively, compared with those from their corresponding controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the content and composition changes in lignin do not affect growth and fitness of the transgenic aspens in the greenhouse; the wood densities and the biomass yields are comparable to those of the controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that (1) lignin condensation itself is not a critical factor affecting the digestibility of the cell wall; (2) the developed strategy of etherifying lignin precursors by the engineered OMT represents a useful biotechnological solution for effectively tailoring the digestibility of Populus woody biomass and, (3) the created transgenic aspens are a promising advanced biomass feedstock for biofuel production.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Alteration of lignin content and structure', 'MOMT4, one of engineered enzyme variants from the parent enzyme isoeugenol 4-O-methyltransferase26, possesses four amino acid substitutions in its active site, that is, T133L, E165I, F175I and H169F (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those substitutions confer a substantial catalytic efficiency of the enzyme to both coniferyl alcohol and sinapyl alcohol for p-hydroxyl methylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kinetically, MOMT4 slightly prefers sinapyl alcohol with a catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of 3,999.3 (M1 s1), and a binding affinity (Km) of 68.1±11.1 (± indicates s.d., n=3) M versus 2,738.7 (M1 s1) and 192.6±24.5 (± indicates s.d., n=3) M for coniferyl alcohol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We transferred the expression cassette of the MOMT4 gene, driven by the promoter of the bean phenylalanine ammonium lyase-2 (PAL2) gene that encodes the enzyme catalysing the first step of phenylpropanoid/lignin biosynthesis27, into hybrid aspen via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bean PAL2 promoter has been demonstrated to be highly active in the early stage of vascular development at the inception of xylem differentiation, when it drives the glucuronidase reporter gene, and is heterologously expressed in tobacco28; its promoter property was well conserved, even expressing in gymnosperm species29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, this promoter has been successfully adopted in driving the target genes to effectively disturb lignin biosynthesis in different plants14,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After obtaining the independent primary transformants, 2-month-old transgenic trees grown in a greenhouse were initially screened.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Profiling the methanolic extracts from the plants revealed that two novel metabolites had accumulated in the leaves of the established transgenic lines (Supplementary Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After digestion of the leaf extract with -glucosidase, we found that one metabolite we resolved was identical to the 4-O-methylated coniferyl alcohol, and the other one was identical to the 4-O-methylated sinapyl alcohol, based on their retention times and ultraviolet spectra, compared with the enzymatically synthesized authentic standards, as was their molecular mass assignment (detected by gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GCMS)) (Supplementary Fig 1af).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that the engineered MOMT4 functions properly in the transgenic aspens, and can modify monolignols into the corresponding 4-O-methylated compounds; those methylated products most likely were further transformed to their glucoconjugates for detoxification and/or for the storage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The levels of the accumulated metabolites in the leaves of 2-month-old trees were 23 mol g1 of the fresh weight of the leaves for the 4-O-methylated coniferyl alcohol, and 57 mol g1 fresh weigh for the 4-O-methylated sinapyl alcohol (Supplementary Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, in the stems of 2-month-old trees, only 4-O-methylated sinapyl alcohol was detected, and its accumulation level was much lower than that in the leaves at 0.120.2 mol g1fresh weight, which probably reflects the limited storage capacity of xylem cells for the soluble phenolics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the phenolic profiling and the preliminary quantification of the total lignin content of these generated transgenic lines, we selected four independent lines, covering the lowest- to the highest-level of metabolic changes, for our further detailed histochemical and chemical analyses on the composition of their cell walls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conventional phloroglucinol-HCl stain that yields a violet-red colour indicative of total lignin revealed that the xylem tissues of MOMT4 transgenic aspens exhibited a slightly weaker (or nearly indiscernible change in) colour intensity than those of the control plants (Fig 2b,c), suggesting a limited reduction of total lignin content in the wood; however, when we applied the Mäule stain (which stains syringyl units in lignin red), the colour intensity apparent on the cross-section of MOMT4 transgenic stem was undoubtedly fainter than that displayed in the control stem (Fig 2d,e), indicating a substantial reduction of S-type lignin subunits in the cell walls of MOMT4 transgenic lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the histochemical observation, quantification of aceteyl bromide lignin in the stem cell walls of 6-month-old plants revealed that the average lignin content of control lines was 23% of tissue dry weight, whereas of the MOMT4 transgenic lines ranged from 19 to 20%, indicating a moderate level of lignin reduction (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the monomeric composition of lignin was determined using the diagnostic thioacidolysis method that primarily cleaves O4-ether linkages interconnecting the lignin subunits30, we found that the amount of released S monomers from MOMT4 overexpression lines exhibited 6374% reduction compared with the control lines; in contrast, the amount of released G-units was very similar, with an approximate level of 400 mol g1 dried cell wall residues (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correspondingly, the S/G ratio of lignin had fallen from a value of 2:1 in the controls to 1:2 in the MOMT4 overexpression lines (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that expression of MOMT4 in hybrid aspen substantially alters lignin composition, and that the incorporation of the S-lignin monomer (sinapyl alcohol) was principally impaired in the cell walls of MOMT4 transgenics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: The effect of expression of MOMT4 on content and composition of lignin in transgenic aspens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Three-month-old hybrid aspens of control (left) and three MOMT4 independent transgenic lines (right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b,c) Phloroglucinol-HCl staining of the stem cross-sections of control (b) and MOMT4-0 transgenic line (c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d,e) Mäule staining of the stem cross-sections of control (d) and MOMT4-0 transgenics (e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars, 1 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) Acetyl bromide total lignin content in the cell walls of control and MOMT4 transgenic aspen stems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (g) The monomers released by thioacidolysis from the stem cell walls of MOMT4 transgenic aspens;

the calculated S/G ratio changed from 1.7 in the control lines to 0.4 in the MOMT4 overexpression aspens (Fig 3a,b; Supplementary Fig 2), consistent with the thioacidolysis results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both the thioacidolytic and NMR analyses, the detected amount of the p-hydroxyphenyl (H) units was extremely low, and was not significantly different between the MOMT4 overexpression and control lines (Figs 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: 2D HSQC NMR spectral analysis of lignin structure in MOMT4 transgenic aspens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) Partial short-range 2D HSQC NMR spectra (aromatic region) of equal amounts of solubilized total cell walls of control and MOMT4 transgenic plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main structural units are coloured to coincide with their structures on the right.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c,d) Partial short-range 2D HSQC NMR spectra of lignin aliphatic and polysaccharide region of the same samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main units, characterized by their inter-unit linkages, are coloured to coincide with their structures to the right.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Supplementary Figs 2 and 3 online for the complete set of spectra of the transgenic and control samples.Full size image', 'The aliphatic region of 2D HSQC NMR spectra reflects the changes in the types and distribution of inter-unit linkages present in the lignin fraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lignin from the control lines was rich in -aryl ether units with modest amounts of resinols and low amounts of phenylcoumarans, as well as modest levels of the cinnamyl alcohol end groups (Fig 3c; Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resinols (-coupled units) mostly arise from the dimerization of sinapyl alcohol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectra of lignin derived from MOMT4 transgenic aspens revealed that the resinol and -aryl ether units were decreased by 25% compared with the controls, consistent with the lower amount of syringyl monomers released by thioacidolysis and documented in 2D HSQC NMR spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the phenylcoumaran (5-coupled) structures that require at least one guaiacyl unit for their formation increased on average by more than fourfold over the controls (Fig 3d;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The production of biofuels and bio-based chemicals from woody biomass is limited by its recalcitrance to hydrolysis for releasing simple sugars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most lignin elimination processes are inefficient and expensive for many applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reducing and/or structurally changing lignin by manipulating certain genes in the monolignol biosynthetic pathway can enhance the cell wall degradability1; however, this approach is often accompanied by impairment of plant growth and development that results in a severe penalty to biomass yield6,12,13,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plants seem, however, to be tolerant of a wide range of lignin compositional/structural changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One measure of lignin structure is its G- and S-lignin unit composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, a high S/G ratio is associated with increased pulping yields38,39, or improved enzymatic release of sugars40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present study demonstrated that expression of the MOMT4 enzyme that etherifies the phenolic moieties of monolignols preferentially disrupts S-lignin deposition in hybrid aspen, which leads to the production of a G-lignin-rich biopolymer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An increase in G-units would be expected to exacerbate lignins condensation, complexity and thus recalcitrance of the cell walls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, the MOMT4 transgenics woods displayed substantially improved efficiency in sugar release and had an enhanced bioconversion rate to ethanol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Up to 60% more woody biomass could be digested from transgenic cell walls than from the control wood under the same treatment, and up to 49% more ethanol resulted from the conversion of the non-pretreated transgenic woods, in comparison with the controls (Fig 7; Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that expression of MOMT4 in hybrid aspen leads to a significant alleviation of the recalcitrance to wood processing in an unexpected way, facilitating the conversion of woody biomass to liquid fuels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The improved wood digestibility of MOMT4 transgenic aspen may be attributed to several concurrent factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, (1) the modest reduction of total lignin content in the cell wall that mitigates its physical barrier properties; (2) drastic structural alteration in lignin that may affect the association of lignin with polysaccharides and the interaction between cell wall biopolymers, thus changing the accessibility of the wall to digestive enzymes; (3) the relative increase of the content of cellulose fibres due to the cell walls mass balance, which, in turn, enhances the source of fermentable six carbon sugars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, altering lignin content and structure not only promoted cellulose deposition but also altered its ultrastructure; more crystalline cellulose microfibrils were formed in the MOMT4 transgenics cell walls (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The underlying mechanisms for such concomitant alteration in polysaccharide deposition and structure remain unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One hypothesis is that S-lignin subunits and/or their linked hydroxybenzoate esters may play structural roles in the ligninpolysaccharide association.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disturbing S-lignin synthesis may trigger a potential feedback remodelling of cell wall carbohydrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, S-lignin deposition is regarded as one of the integral steps of plant secondary cell wall formation41; disrupting S-lignin synthesis may disturb or delay the cell walls development processes, sustaining wood at a younger stage, and thus rendering it less recalcitrant to breakdown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our study suggests that lignin condensation does not necessarily correlate to the digestibility of Populus, and it is not the sole or critical factor dominating cell wall recalcitrance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Expression of MOMT4 in the herbaceous dicot Arabidopsis, and the woody species, aspen, yields quite different metabolic and biological consequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When MOMT4 expressed in Arabidopsis, the plants produced both the 4-O-methylated feruloyl and sinapoyl malates in their soluble phenolic fraction25, suggesting that the 4-O-methylated products of MOMT4 entered the endogenous pathway of phenolic-ester biosynthesis that is specific for Brassicaceae species42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total lignin content in the stem of transgenic Arabidopsis exhibited a significant reduction, while its composition and structure essentially remained unchanged25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, when MOMT4 was expressed in aspen, the transgenic plant accumulated glucoconjugates of the 4-O-methyalted monolignols (Supplementary Fig 1); furthermore, the lignin from transgenic tree was composed of a significantly lower level of S-subunits, and more condensed (CC bonded) structures containing G-subunits (Figs 2 and 3) than occurred in the control aspen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This biological discrepancy may reflect the diversity and speciation of the phenylpropanoid metabolism, and the detoxification mechanism that the particular plants adopt, and also the species variability of plant lignifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, in terms of the distinct effects of MOMT4 on lignin synthesis in these two species, Populus hardwood is rich in syringyl lignin with an S/G ratio ranging from 1.8 to 2.344; whereas the lignin of Arabidopsis is guaiacyl rich (with S/G ratio 0.25)45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since MOMT4 displays a discernible, yet less dominant, substrate preference to sinapyl alcohol, when it is expressed in the guaiacyl-rich Arabidopsis, its kinetic effect may be masked or compromised.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas when MOMT4 acts in an environment in which the S-monomeric substrate is more prominently available, its kinetic propensities may result in its dominantly modifying sinapyl alcohol, and thus triggering a metabolic consequence entailing a more severe disruption of S-lignin formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such metabolic preference in fact was also evidenced with the higher level of accumulation of the 4-O-methylated sinapyl alcohol than the 4-O-methyalted coniferyl alcohol in the soluble phenolic fraction of transgenic aspen leaves and stems (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another possibility for preferentially reducing S-lignin in the transgenic aspens is that the MOMT4-produced 4-O-methylated compounds may exert inhibitory effects on the activities of Populus intrinsic S-lignin-specific enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our in vitro study revealed that the 4-O-methylated monolignols have no detectable inhibitory effects on the activities of Cald5H/F5H or COMT from aspen; they only displayed a 314% inhibition on the activities of cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenases (Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With such an inhibition, both the activities of CAD/SAD to the G- and S- lignin precursors should be affected, which do not explain the observed preferential impairment of S-lignin synthesis (Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exact reasons for expressing MOMT4 in aspen preferentially to disrupt S-lignin formation may be complicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains to be determined whether this phenomenon is Populus specific or occurs in the other woody species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite the drastic change in lignin and cell wall structure, those greenhouse-grown, 6-month-old MOMT4 transgenic aspens showed no penalty in biomass yield, nor loss in wood density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structural integrity at the whole plant- and cellular-level was maintained essentially similar to that of the control (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sustained growth and fitness features of MOMT4 transgenic aspens are most likely attributed to their attaining condensed G-lignin, the increased cellulose content, and the elevated crystallinity of cellulose fibres in their cell walls along with a concomitant decrease in S-lignin formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the current study, examining the plant growth property, was conducted in a relatively short period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An extended physiological investigation, or a field trial with the generated transgenic trees, will substantiate their viability as biofuel feedstocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, expressing an engineered monolignol 4-O-methyltransferase in hybrid aspen substantially alters lignin structure while also producing more cellulose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such alteration facilitates wood digestibility and its bioconversion to ethanol, proving a useful strategy to tailor woody biomass for bio-based applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The created transgenic aspen represents a valuable feedstock for further industrial exploitation in biofuel production.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
