Blood-brain-barrier spheroids as an in vitro screening platform for brain-penetrating agents  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Culture-based bloodbrain barrier (BBB) models are crucial tools to enable rapid screening of brain-penetrating drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, reproducibility of in vitro barrier properties and permeability remain as major challenges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report that self-assembling multicellular BBB spheroids display reproducible BBB features and functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spheroid core is comprised mainly of astrocytes, while brain endothelial cells and pericytes encase the surface, acting as a barrier that regulates transport of molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spheroid surface exhibits high expression of tight junction proteins, VEGF-dependent permeability, efflux pump activity and receptor-mediated transcytosis of angiopep-2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the transwell co-culture system displays comparatively low levels of BBB regulatory proteins, and is unable to discriminate between the transport of angiopep-2 and a control peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we have utilized the BBB spheroids to screen and identify BBB-penetrant cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This robust in vitro BBB model could serve as a valuable next-generation platform for expediting the development of CNS therapeutics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The inability of most therapeutics to cross the bloodbrain barrier (BBB) is a major limitation to effective treatment of diseases in the central nervous system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BBB is a highly evolved microvasculature system comprised of brain endothelial cells (ECs) lining the vascular lumen, pericytes in the basal lamina, and associating astrocytic end-feet, microglia and neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cellular architecture forms functional neurovascular units that regulate molecular trafficking between blood and brain1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific features of the brain endothelium distinguish it from the peripheral endothelium, including the presence of complex tight junctions that restrict paracellular permeability2, efflux pumps (for example, P-glycoprotein (P-gp)) that move foreign substances out of the brain3, and specific transporters and receptors (such as glucose carriers and amino acid carriers) to supply the brain with essential nutrients and other molecules4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Systems to model the BBB in vitro are crucial tools to help predict brain uptake of drug candidates before costly and laborious in vivo studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One major challenge in developing representative models of the BBB is the fact that brain ECs rapidly dedifferentiate and lose their BBB characteristics when they are removed from their native microenvironment and grown in culture, giving rise to a more generic EC phenotype6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenomenon, known as phenotypic drift, is especially likely to occur in ECs at higher passages, resulting in lack of expression of key BBB modulators and leaky paracellular barrier function7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been reported that direct cellcell interaction of brain ECs with other components of the neurovascular unit such as pericytes and/or astrocytes is important for induction and maintenance of the specialized BBB properties in culture1,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has led to the development of several in vitro BBB co-culture models with this modular organization to facilitate discovery and advancement of neuropharmaceuticals9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To date, the transwell system is the simplest and most widely used in vitro BBB model, in which ECs are plated on the upper (apical blood side) on a semipermeable membrane, separated from the lower (basal brain side) compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this mid- to high-throughput model offers ease of culture and versatility11, it has been criticized owing to several well-known limitations12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Efforts to simulate a more realistic representation of the BBB morphology in a living system by reproducing the microcirculatory environment in the brain to account for blood flow and shear stress have led to the development of the hollow fibre (dynamic in vitro BBB) model13 and other microfluidic BBB systems14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these devices are also limited in terms of throughput, and their construction is rather complex, making them relatively inaccessible to many laboratories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Human brain ECs, pericytes and astrocytes spontaneously form into a multicellular spheroid in co-culture under low-adherence conditions, and self-assemble into a modular organization that resembles the BBB (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important feature of this platform is that each cell type is able to interact with one another within the spheroid, which has been reported to play an essential role in the maintenance of the BBB integrity and function9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present here a modified approach in culturing multicellular BBB spheroids to recapitulate key barrier functions that represent the BBB, and for the first time, demonstrate the utility of this model as a reliable and predictive in vitro screening tool for BBB-penetrating compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the surface of the BBB spheroids is regulated by the activity of key BBB modulators, such as tight/adherens junctions and the P-gp efflux pump.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the expression level of these modulators is significantly higher on the surface of the BBB spheroids compared to ECs grown using the transwell approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a proof-of-principle, we also demonstrate the versatility of this model in analysing the LRP-1 receptor-mediated transport of angiopep-2 (refs 18, 19), as well as the permeability of a BBB-penetrant small molecule that inhibits the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, known as BKM120 (buparlisib)20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we have utilized the BBB spheroid platform to screen and identify cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) with the ability to cross the BBB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the facile construction and the ability of the BBB spheroids to reproduce key barrier activity and characteristics, this model is particularly attractive for cost-effective and high-throughput drug permeability testing.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cellular organization of BBB spheroids', 'To investigate the spontaneous assembly and formation of the BBB spheroids, we co-cultured primary human astrocytes and human brain vascular pericytes (HBVP) with two different human brain EC types: (1) primary human brain microvascular ECs (HBMECs) and (2) immortalized hCMEC/D3 (human cerebral microvascular EC line D3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we confirmed the identity of each cell type by immunofluorescence staining using cell-specific biomarkers; astrocytes were tested for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression (Supplementary Fig 1a), pericytes for NG2 expression (Supplementary Fig 1b), primary HBMECs for CD31 (Supplementary Fig 1c) and immortalized hCMEC/D3 ECs for CD31, VE-cadherin and von Willebrand factor expression (Supplementary Fig 1d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To produce a single spheroid, 1 × 103 cells of each cell type were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Astrocytes and pericytes were co-cultured with either EC type in a 1:1:1 ratio (as per Urich et.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  al.17) in endothelial basal media containing human serum on low-attachment culture plates coated with soft agarose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, unlike the methodology described by Urich et al., we cultured the spheroids in media with no additional VEGF-A, as VEGF-A has been shown to induce vascular permeability through the disruption of tight junctions21 and break down of the BBB22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'When the three cell types were co-cultured, we found that all cells interacted tightly with one another and eventually self-assembled into a compact spheroid by 12 h (data not shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Out of a total of 886 spheroids, 797 of the spheroids formed after 48 h of co-culture were considered acceptable on the basis of their physical characteristics (Supplementary Fig 2a; nexperiment=5; 184/230, 117/136, 85/90, 205/215 and 206/215), yielding an average success rate of 90%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long-term analysis of spheroid size showed that the spheroids remained stable and viable for over 17 days in culture (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To distinguish each cell type and track structural organization in co-culture, we pre-labelled each of them with a distinct fluorescent long-term cell-labeling dye as follows: astrocytes (VivoTrack 680 Near-Infrared), pericytes (CellTracker Violet), primary HBMECs (CellTracker Orange) and immortalized hCMEC/D3 (CellTracker Green).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 48 h of co-culturing, we observed distinct cellcell stratification within the spheroid by confocal microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with observations by Urich and colleagues17, astrocytes were seen to mostly occupy the spheroid core, while HBMECs or hCMEC/D3 ECs together with pericytes appeared to form a surface monolayer encasing the spheroid (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This modular organization was observed in both the primary and the immortalized ECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we also utilized transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to gain deeper insight into the ultrastructure of each spheroid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our prior observations using confocal microscopy, we saw that hCMEC/D3 ECs (characterized by the nature of their irregularly shaped nuclei and elongated cellular structure24) lined the outer surface of the spheroid (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pericytes (marked by the presence of elongated rough endoplasmic reticulum and well-developed Golgi body25) formed direct contact with ECs close to the spheroid surface (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, astrocytes (characterized by an abundance of filamentous bundles within the cell26) were found mostly in the spheroids interior (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed analysis at the point of cellcell contact between ECs on the surface of each spheroid revealed the formation of dense strands of tight junctions (Fig 1d), indicating that the outer surface could act as a barrier in governing transport into the spheroid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we confirmed a high level of tight junction proteins, including occludin, claudin 5 and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) at the surface of each spheroid (Fig 2ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Cellular organization of the multicellular BBB spheroids.Representative confocal images showing the organization of human astrocytes (white), HBVP (blue) and (a) primary HBMEC (red) or (b) immortalized human cerebral microvascular ECs (hCMEC/D3; green) when co-cultured to form a spheroid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Astrocytes were pre-labelled with VivoTrack 680 Fluorescent Imaging Agent, HBVP with CellTracker Violet, HBMEC with CellTracker Orange, and hCMEC/D3 with CellTracker Green for 1 h before co-culturing on 1% agarose for 48 h.

expression/activity in the transwell model compared to when ECs were cultured alone, or in co-culture with either pericytes or astrocytes only8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our studies, we co-cultured 5 × 107

of angiopep-2 with the scrambled control peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that compared to inserts with no ECs (which represent passive diffusion of compounds across the insert with no barrier), both angiopep-2 and the scrambled peptide displayed significantly lower permeability in the co-culture system (Fig 6a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the transwell co-culture system was unable to differentiate between the permeability of angiopep-2 and the scrambled control (Fig 6c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we found the level of P-gp, ZO-1 and -catenin (adherens junction protein) on the surface of BBB spheroids to be substantially higher than ECs cultured in the triple co-culture transwell model (Fig 6d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results may be attributed to the fact that although the transwell co-culture models have been shown to improve barrier tightness8,9,12, this system, unlike the BBB spheroid model, fails to account for 3D cellular organization and direct cellcell contact, which are imperative for proper cell differentiation and barrier formation17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, it has also been reported that ECs tend to distribute unevenly on the transwell filter, resulting in barrier imperfections caused by the formation of multiple layers of cells or holes within the monolayer34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in terms of cost-effectiveness and versatility, a standard transwell system (utilizing a 24-well plate) typically requires a relatively large number of ECs (ranging between 104107 cells) to form a tight cellular monolayer on the membrane surface over 37 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, the spheroid model which only requires 1 × 103 of each cell type (ECs, pericytes and astrocytes) consistently produced an intact and functional barrier displaying key BBB characteristics within 48 h.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Altogether, the BBB spheroid model is able to reproduce BBB properties and functions through the exhibition of high levels of tight/adherens junctions, efflux pumps and transporters that are required to restrict or regulate the influx of foreign molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model can also offer a highly convenient approach to study mechanisms of BBB transport (that is, paracellular delivery, receptor-mediated transcytosis and so on).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have demonstrated the value and versatility of this model as a screening tool using two different detection approaches: confocal fluorescence microscopy and MALDI mass spectrometry imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, our screening experiments demonstrate that the permeability results obtained in vitro are recapitulated in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BBB spheroid model is easily scalable to high-throughput capacity due to the simplicity of the approach and low amount of reagents required to establish the spheroids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the screening throughput of this model can be increased even further through the possibility of integration with automated microscopy and robotics-assisted mass spectrometry technologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ease of culture, cost-effectiveness and reproducibility of this model offer a very practical and attractive approach for researchers interested in studying BBB drug transport and developing brain-penetrant drugs for the treatment of CNS diseases.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
