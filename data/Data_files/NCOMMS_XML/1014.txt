Onset of meso-scale turbulence in active nematics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Meso-scale turbulence is an innate phenomenon, distinct from inertial turbulence, that spontaneously occurs at low Reynolds number in fluidized biological systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This spatiotemporal disordered flow radically changes nutrient and molecular transport in living fluids and can strongly affect the collective behaviour in prominent biological processes, including biofilm formation, morphogenesis and cancer invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite its crucial role in such physiological processes, understanding meso-scale turbulence and any relation to classical inertial turbulence remains obscure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show how the motion of active matter along a micro-channel transitions to meso-scale turbulence through the evolution of locally disordered patches (active puffs) from an ordered vortex-lattice flow state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that the stationary critical exponents of this transition to meso-scale turbulence in a channel coincide with the directed percolation universality class.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding bridges our understanding of the onset of low-Reynolds-number meso-scale turbulence and traditional scale-invariant turbulence in confinement.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Low-Reynolds-number turbulence is established through continuous energy injection from the constituent elements of an active fluid in many biological systems, including bacterial suspensions1,2,3,4,5,6, cellular monolayers7,8,9 or sub-cellular filament/motor protein mixtures10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the inertia is negligible (Reynolds number 1) in such systems, active turbulence is characterized by a highly disordered distribution of vortices12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, meso-scale turbulence in living fluids possesses a characteristic vortex length scale, which distinguishes it from scale-invariant inertial turbulence14, and it is considered a new class of turbulent flow2,12,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite extensive implications for diverse fluid dynamical systems and more than a century of research, the transition from pressure-driven laminar flow to inertial turbulence in even the simplest geometries remains one of the major unresolved problems in fluid mechanics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elaborate experiments have recently shed new light on the nature of this transition by measuring the decay and splitting of local turbulent domains/clusters (puffs) in pipe flows and have determined the critical Reynolds numberratio of inertial to viscous forcesat which the transition occurs16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Short-range interactions between the locally turbulent puffs, which feed on surrounding laminar flow as an absorbing state, drive a continuous transition to a fully turbulent flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent experimental evidence from channel and circular Couette flows18,19, together with direct numerical simulation studies and predatorprey models20, have provided evidence that the transition at the critical Reynolds number is characterized by the directed percolation universality class.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Strikingly, here we show that for a profoundly distinct class of turbulence at low Reynolds number, the transition in a channel can also be characterized by the emergence of puffs created by microscopic activity of biological fluids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even for this low Reynolds number class of turbulent-like flows that apparently lacks a perfectly unique absorbing state, we find that the critical exponents correspond to the directed percolation universality class subject to a small non-ordering, conjugated and intrinsic field.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Vortex lattice as an intermediate state', 'To study the transition to low-Reynolds-number meso-scale turbulence, we computationally solve the continuum equations of active nematics in micro-channels, which have successfully reproduced the patterns of bacterial ordering in bulk5 and in confinement21, the flow structure and correlation lengths of microtuble bundles10,11,22 and the flow patterns of dividing cells8,23 (see Methods for the details of the model).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through this continuum description, the transition to turbulence occurs by increasing the amount of local energy injection (activity) in the living fluids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a confined environment, the activity leads to spontaneous symmetry breaking and the generation of unidirectional flow24, which is followed by an oscillatory regime characterized by distorted streamlines25,26, upon increasing the activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further increase in the activity leads to the emergence of a stable lattice of vortices throughout the channel27 (Fig 1a), and this transitions to meso-scale turbulence at higher activities (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emergence of the intermediate vortex lattice in active matter has been observed experimentally in motility assays of microtubles28, in bacterial suspension in a channel confinement6, and also numerically by short-range attraction of self-propelled particles29 and hydrodynamic screening of activity-induced flows due to frictional damping30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To focus on the effect of the confining channel on the transition to meso-scale turbulence, we consider the ideal wet limit and neglect additional frictional damping11,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because in the experimental systems studied so far, there is no obvious qualitative effect on the active turbulence, friction appears to be a small effect, and the meso-scale turbulent state we consider here is unaffected2,6,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the intermediate vortex lattice is stable to impulsive perturbations, which do not produce growing modes (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In stark contrast to inertial turbulence, the Reynolds number is irrelevant here and the transition between flow regimes is governed by the dimensionless activity number  (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This parameter characterizes the ratio of the channel height h, which here is equivalent to the hydrodynamic screening length, to the characteristic activity-induced length scale , which represents the relative importance of the intrinsic activity  and the orientational elasticity K of the nematic fluid33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Emergence of puffs from a vortex-lattice controls the transition to active turbulence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) A highly ordered flow vortex lattice is formed at lower activities and (b) active turbulence is fully established at higher activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lower panels in a,b show the height-averaged enstrophy

length scales control the transition to active turbulence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Phase-space of control parameters corresponding to the vortex-lattice state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slope of 0.5 at the boundaries of the vortex-lattice state shows that the emergence of vortex lattice is controlled by two competing length scales: the channel height h and the activity length scale .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Transition from the vortex-lattice state to active turbulence is characterized by the channel-averaged enstrophy  distribution for increasing values of activity number .Full size image', 'The marked difference between the various flow states is clearly seen in the structure of the vorticity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, to characterize the transition between the regimes, we measure the distribution of the local enstrophy , averaged across the channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This quantity represents the strength of vortices in the flow, and has also been used for determining the nature of inertial turbulence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vortex-lattice state possesses a well-defined peak in the enstrophy (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the active flow transitions at higher activities, the enstrophy distribution broadens, demonstrating that vorticity cascades down into meso-scale turbulence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gradual disappearance of the peak in the enstrophy distribution (Fig 2b) suggests a continuous transition from the vortex lattice to meso-scale turbulence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But how does the active turbulence develop from the vortex lattice?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Critical behaviour', 'Figure 1c shows a snapshot of the vorticity field in a long channel close to the transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vortex lattice predominantly occupies the entire channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Locally, however, we can identify regions of the channel where vortex pairs split into smaller non-ordered vortices (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This coexistence of the global vortex lattice and clusters of local active turbulence controls the transition to turbulence in the channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We term these localized domains of non-ordered vorticity active puffs, in analogy to the inertial puffs observed in the experiments on scale-invariant turbulence in long tubes16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike the inertial puffs that are externally initiated by perturbations to the flow field (such as induced pressure jumps), active puffs are intrinsic to our simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The behaviour of these active puffs is clearly characterized in the space-time kymograph of enstrophy (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An active puff can split, giving birth to new puffs, or decay into the ordered vortex-lattice state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below some critical activity number, puffs tend to decay back to the inactive vortex-lattice state (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, active puffs span the entire system when splitting occurs at a high enough rate to produce a statistical steady state at the critical activity number (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At higher activities yet, the competition between splitting and decaying of puffs results in a well-defined turbulence fraction within the channel (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The active flow approaches the fully turbulent state with active puffs ultimately occupying the entire channel when the decay time far exceeds the splitting time16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

turbulence and right panels show simulations from the DomanyKinzel cellular automaton model of directed percolation model with rare spontaneous activations.Full size image', 'We thus measure the turbulence fraction, the area fraction occupied by active puffs in the channel, as a function of the activity number (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Well below the critical point, active puffs have a short lifetime and rarely split (Fig 3a), leading to a negligible turbulence fraction in the steady state (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as the critical value of the activity is approached, puff decay becomes less likely and splitting time decreases substantially (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Above the critical point, the puff population does not die out, producing a steady-state, non-zero turbulence fraction (Fig 3c), and we find the turbulence fraction continuously increases with a power-law dependence (AAcr) (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measure the stationary exponent to be =0.275±0.043, which closely matches the universal critical exponent of the (1+1) directed percolation process (=0.276)35 and is in agreement with the value that has recently been measured for inertial turbulence in Couette flow (=0.28±0.03)19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Transition to active turbulence coincides with directed percolation universality class.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Turbulence fraction as a function

vorticity length scale, and high-Reynolds-number inertial turbulence, which is scale-invariant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the exponent is particularly surprising as active puffs are generated at a small activity-independent rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, the inactive vortex lattice is not a perfectly absorbing state, and yet there is remarkable agreement between the measured stationary exponent  and the critical exponent of the directed percolation universality class.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The agreement with the universal critical exponent from directed percolation can be understood by recognizing that the creation of puffs corresponds to a weak, non-ordering field conjugated to the turbulence fraction, which is known to have no detectable effect on the stationary exponents sufficiently close to the critical point36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To further scrutinize the critical behaviour at the transition point, we measure the spatial and temporal distributions of vortex-lattice gaps (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These distributions of the inactive state characterize correlations of the active puffs38 and obey power laws with exponents , || for space and time, respectively (Fig 4b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temporal exponent is measured to be ||=1.84±0.04 and the spatial exponent is =1.8±0.1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values also correspond to the critical exponents for (1+1) directed percolation (||=1.84,=1.748)35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values of the exponents obtained from our measurements for meso-scale turbulence in a channel and for (1+1) directed percolation with spontaneous site activation are summarized in Table 1 and are compared with the experimentally measured exponents for the inertial turbulence in simple shear experiments in one-dimensional geometries19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It would be of interest to see if the critical exponents of the directed percolation universality class will continue to be found in geometries with higher effective dimensionality, as in experiments on inertial turbulence in quasi-two-dimensional passive liquid crystals39,40, in channel flows18 and in three-dimensional quantum turbulence41.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our findings present a first concrete connection between turbulence in living fluids and classical scale-invariant turbulence, beyond a superficial visual similarity, by showing that the transitions to these two profoundly distinct types of spatiotemporal disorder in channel flows are characterized by the same scaling behaviour, corresponding to a critical directed percolation process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the transition to scale-invariant turbulence corresponds to a critical absorbing phase transition, our results suggest that meso-scale turbulence is driven away from criticality by rare active puff creation that corresponds to directed percolation in the presence of a conjugated field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This opens new possibilities for further investigation of the nature of meso-scale turbulence and using tools from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to explain transitionary behaviours in biological systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future research should investigate the transitions between ordered flow states, the nature of the weak conjugated field and the possibility of non-universal dynamical scaling behaviour or super-exponential dependence of puff lifetime on activity number.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
