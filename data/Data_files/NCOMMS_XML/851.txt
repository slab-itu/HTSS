An integrative approach unveils FOSL1 as an oncogene vulnerability in KRAS-driven lung and pancreatic cancer  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'KRAS mutated tumours represent a large fraction of human cancers, but the vast majority remains refractory to current clinical therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms triggered by KRAS oncogene may yield alternative therapeutic strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the identification of a common transcriptional signature across mutant KRAS cancers of distinct tissue origin that includes the transcription factor FOSL1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High FOSL1 expression identifies mutant KRAS lung and pancreatic cancer patients with the worst survival outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, FOSL1 genetic inhibition is detrimental to both KRAS-driven tumour types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistically, FOSL1 links the KRAS oncogene to components of the mitotic machinery, a pathway previously postulated to function orthogonally to oncogenic KRAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FOSL1 targets include AURKA, whose inhibition impairs viability of mutant KRAS cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, combination of AURKA and MEK inhibitors induces a deleterious effect on mutant KRAS cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings unveil KRAS downstream effectors that provide opportunities to treat KRAS-driven cancers.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'KRAS is frequently mutated in human cancers1 and is a driver of neoplasias in the lung, pancreas, colon and biliary tract2,3,4,5, where tumour maintenance is highly dependent on continued oncogenic KRAS expression6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, recent approaches to inhibit KRAS directly still lack long-term inhibition capacity and show toxicity in vivo8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus alternative strategies to neutralize KRAS-mediated effects are urgently needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Design of such strategies would be facilitated by a deeper understanding of the molecular alterations downstream of oncogenic KRAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Gene-expression profiling provides a tractable strategy to expose novel components of the oncogenic KRAS network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KRAS signatures from single experimental systems or tumour types that classify patients according to KRAS genotype9,10 and KRAS dependency11 have been described, but show little overlap10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the transcriptional response is highly dependent on the tissue of origin and raises the question whether a core of genes relevant for mutant KRAS biology is preserved across different tumour types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Integration of multiple laboratory and clinical gene-expression data from different tissues spanning mouse and human species would address this question but has yet not been described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A plethora of transcription factors have been linked to transformation by KRAS oncogene in vitro, including the AP1 transcription complex12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, little evidence exists for a critical activity of AP1 or other transcription factors in KRAS-driven tumorigenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, loss of WT1, FOXM1 or MYC has been reported to impair initiation of mutant Kras lung or pancreatic tumours in mice15,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, given the complexity of the transcriptional regulatory network elicited by KRAS oncogene, it is likely that other transcription factors could play a role in KRAS-driven tumorigenesis and represent novel vulnerabilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Human tumours expressing KRAS oncogene undergo mitotic stress19 and, thus, are highly dependent on the mitotic machinery to preserve cellular homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this cellular context, various components of the mitotic machinery have been unveiled as KRAS vulnerabilities in human cancer20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, whether KRAS oncogene intersects with the mitosis network influencing the cellular adaptation to mitotic stress is largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the mitotic machinery has been postulated to operate orthogonally to mutant KRAS signalling20,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we devised an integrative strategy to expose common core elements of KRAS signalling critical for homeostasis of KRAS mutated tumours by combining (1) a cross-tumours gene-expression screen to identify KRAS-dependent candidate genes, and (2) patient outcome to inform selection of candidate genes for functional follow-up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strategy unveiled FOSL1 as a prominent component of oncogenic KRAS-driven lung and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which partially functions by transcriptionally regulating a subset of genes involved in mitotic fitness that unveils opportunities for pharmacological intervention.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Identification of candidate genes by a cross-tumours screen', 'To uncover a core of genes consistently regulated by KRAS across mouse and human tumours, we followed a two-tiered approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we screened gene-expression data from in vitro and in vivo experimental systems of epithelial and mesenchymal origin with either wild-type or mutant KRAS allele (human immortalized bronchoepithelial cells, KrasLSLG12D/+ mouse embryo fibroblasts and a mouse model of Kras-driven lung cancer).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only 19 genes were consistently overexpressed in mutant KRAS phenotype in at least two of the three studies (Fig 1a, Supplementary Fig 1a and Supplementary Table 1), indicating that the transcriptional response to oncogenic KRAS is markedly influenced by the background of each experimental system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, only three genes (DUSP6, GLRX and PHLDA1) overlapped with a previous cross-species KRAS signature23, underscoring the validity of our approach to uncover novel KRAS-regulated genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Identification of cross-tumours KRAS-dependent genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Workflow of the gene-expression strategy for the

Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of publicly available data from mouse and human tumours was performed to investigate the relevance of the 19 candidate genes in cancer (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A negative () enrichment was observed in mouse lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) and PDAC where mutant KRAS expression was depleted2,7 (Supplementary Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In human cancer, a positive (+) enrichment was observed in mutant KRAS patients compared to wild-type in LAC (n=3), PDAC, colorectal cancer (CRC), cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and multiple myeloma (MM) (Supplementary Fig 1dj).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations were recapitulated in human LAC and CRC cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia24 (Supplementary Fig 1k,l, and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results suggest that the 19 genes are regulated through a cell-autonomous mechanism and are representative of KRAS-driven cancers independently of the tissue origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A cross-tumours signature predicts KRAS status and survival', 'To refine the value of the identified KRAS-regulated genes to human cancer, those genes recurrently present in  greater than 50% of the leading edges of the mouse and human cancer GSEA were identified (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis across different KRAS-driven tumours unveiled a core of eight genes including AREG, DUSP4, DUSP6, FOSL1, LAMB3, LAMC2, PHLDA1 and SPRY4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, LAMB3 has been reported as a synthetic lethal interaction with oncogenic KRAS in colon cancer21, suggesting that other co-identified genes could also display a functional role in mutant KRAS cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Next, we interrogated independent data sets of KRAS-driven cancers to determine whether the eight-gene signature would be a predictor for KRAS status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A higher geometric mean was representative of LAC (n=3), PDAC and CCA tumours harbouring KRAS mutations (Fig 1bd and Supplementary Fig 1m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results correlated with a statistically significant area under receiver operating characteristic (AUC) (Supplementary Fig 1n).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since KRAS mutations are mutually exclusive with other dominant oncogenic drivers in LAC, we reasoned that the cross-tumours eight-gene signature would be exclusive of the KRAS phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The geometric mean of the eight genes did not discriminate mutant EGFR from wild-type patients in four data sets (Supplementary Fig 1o).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were observed for AML4-ALK, BRAF and DDR2 mutant or MYC amplified tumours in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data set (Supplementary Fig 1p).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We then sought to investigate the role of the eight-gene signature in patient survival using the TCGA LAC data set that is large enough to stratify patients based on KRAS status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutant KRAS patients expressing high levels of the eight-gene signature had the worst outcome (Fig 1e) with a significant decreased survival compared to wild-type patients (P=0.04, log-rank test, Mantel Cox).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, multivariate analysis of mutant KRAS patients expressing high levels of the eight-gene signature showed that the effect of gene expression on patient survival is irrespective of stage, age and gender (P=0.003, HR=1.599 (1.1772.172), Cox proportional hazards model), conversely to what was found in wild-type KRAS patients (P=0.883, HR=1.024 (0.7481.402), Cox proportional hazards model).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The eight-gene signature was also associated with poor survival in PDAC patients25 (Fig 1f), whereas no association with patient survival was observed in other tumours where KRAS mutations are rarely found or absent such as squamous cell lung carcinoma or breast cancer (Supplementary Fig 1q,r).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results argue that high expression of the eight-gene signature is representative of mutant KRAS cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'FOSL1 upregulation in KRAS-driven human LAC', 'To further delineate the contribution of the eight candidate genes, we carried out single gene survival analysis to discriminate those genes involved in the clinical outcome of mutant KRAS LAC patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focused on LAC where patients can be stratified based on KRAS genotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only high FOSL1 expression identified a group of patients bearing KRAS mutations with the worst survival outcome and the differences between wild-type and mutant KRAS patients expressing high FOSL1 levels were statistically significant (P=0.016, log-rank test, Mantel Cox) (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multivariate analysis including stage, age and sex showed that FOSL1 expression was an independent survival marker in LAC patients with KRAS mutations (P=0.006; HR=5.072 (1.6115.98), Cox proportional hazards model).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No association was observed between FOSL1 expression and survival of squamous lung carcinoma or breast cancer patients (Supplementary Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that FOSL1 expression is preferentially associated with KRAS mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

(also known as FOS-related antigen 1, FRA-1) is a transcription factor that heterodimerizes with members of the JUN family to form the AP1 transcription complex26, which is upregulated during KRAS-induced transformation of murine fibroblasts in vitro27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, its role in human KRAS-driven cancer remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate FOSL1 in human LAC, a panel of cell lines with known RAS status was utilized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FOSL1 mRNA and protein were upregulated in mutant RAS cell lines compared to wild type (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, phosphorylation of FOSL1, previously suggested to be a mechanism of FOSL1 activation19, was preferentially observed in mutant cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, analysis of other AP1 members of the JUN and FOS families revealed no obvious genotype-specific expression (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further analysis of patient-derived xenografts revealed upregulation of FOSL1 expression in tumours with KRAS mutations compared to wild type (Supplementary Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To explore whether FOSL1 was downstream of mutant KRAS, KRAS inhibition was carried out in different cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KRAS knockdown lowered FOSL1 protein levels (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, FOSL1 was upregulated upon mutant KRAS overexpression in wild-type KRAS cells (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

to ERK1/2, ERK5 and JNK consistently regulate FOSL1 expression in mutant KRAS cell lines (Fig 2f and Supplementary Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, FOSL1 is regulated by, and integrates signals from, different kinases downstream of KRAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'FOSL1 overexpression in a model of LAC', 'To study FOSL1 expression in a more physiologically relevant system, a genetically engineered mouse model of Kras-driven LAC, KrasLSL-G12D; Trp53f/f (KP), that is representative of human disease was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed in normal and tumour tissue after antibody validation (Supplementary Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No FOSL1 expression was detected in normal alveolar and bronchiolar epithelia of KP mice (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, around 60% of lung tumours expressed FOSL1 to some extent (Fig 2h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, FOSL1 expression was also found in advanced tumour lesions such as lymph node metastases (n=4) (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, only a small fraction of cells expressing FOSL1 was positive for Ki67 (7.25%) (Supplementary Fig 2f), suggesting that FOSL1 does not specifically label a population of proliferative cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To rule out the possibility that FOSL1 upregulation was mediated by a non-cell autonomous mechanism, its expression was assessed in lung cancer cell lines derived from different mouse models2,30,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fosl1 expression was detected in mutant Kras LAC cell lines but not in normal lung tissue or wild-type Kras squamous cell carcinoma cells (Fig 2i and

sensitivity of mutant KRAS cells to FOSL1 loss', 'To test the functional relevance of FOSL1 in KRAS-driven LAC, FOSL1 was depleted by interference RNA in mutant and wild-type RAS cell lines

#@NEW_LINE#@#  This result was consistent among mutant and wild-type cell lines with similar population doubling (Fig 3a, open circles, and Supplementary Fig 3b) suggesting that the sensitivity to FOSL1 loss is specific to KRAS genotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the effect of FOSL1 inhibition was extended to mutant RAS cells from large cell carcinoma (Supplementary Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, FOSL1 depletion in two mouse LAC cell lines derived from a Kras-driven mouse model led to significant decrease in cell viability (Supplementary Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, the cellular mechanisms underlying the effects of FOSL1 loss were analysed using an inducible shRNA that compromised proliferation of mutant KRAS cells in vitro as seen for the same constitutive shRNA

FOSL1 upregulation in ADM of sections from KPC mice (Fig 5e) and in a mouse ex-vivo ADM assay of KrasLSLG12D acini34 (Fig 5f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the later, Fosl1 upregulation was accompanied by upregulation of the ductal marker Ck19 (Supplementary Fig 5g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent Fosl1 knockdown studies revealed FOSL1 requirement for efficient duct formation of acinar cells upon Kras activation (Fig 5g and Supplementary Fig 5g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, Fosl1 overexpression was sufficient to promote ADM, albeit at lower levels than Kras activation (Fig 5h,i and Supplementary Fig

significant enrichment in FOSL1 genes were microtubule-based process, mitotic cell cycle, regulation of response to stress, negative regulation of biological process and cell cycle phase (Supplementary Fig 6d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a decrease in mRNA of genes involved in mitosis-related processes such as AURKA, CCNB1, FOXM1, and the AURKA targets HURP and TACC3 (refs 37, 38, 39, 40) (Supplementary Fig 6e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, protein expression of AURKA, CCNB1, HURP and TACC3 was decreased upon FOSL1 inhibition in an independent mutant KRAS LAC cell line but not in wild-type cells with similar proliferation rate in vitro and in vivo (Fig 6e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the AURKA target PLK1, previously identified as a synthetic lethal interaction with KRAS38, was also diminished upon FOSL1 inhibition in a genotype-specific manner (Fig 6e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Downregulation of mitotic proteins was also observed in PDAC cells at the mRNA and protein level (Supplementary Fig 6f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results strongly suggest that KRAS oncogene intersects with the mitosis machinery through FOSL1 in human cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The above results suggested that the phenotype originated by FOSL1 loss involves components of the mitotic machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A central event in mitosis is the phosphorylation of histone H3 (HH3) by AURKA40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using taxol, which interferes with mitotic spindle function and blocks cells in mitosis, we found that FOSL1 inhibition led to decreased phospho-HH3 levels in mutant KRAS LAC cells compared to control cells, in concordance with decreased expression of mitotic genes (Supplementary Fig 6h,i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings argue that the phenotype observed in FOSL1-silenced cells may involve the regulation of components of the mitotic machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'AURKA depletion recapitulates FOSL1 loss phenotype', 'Mutant KRAS tumours undergo a high degree of mitotic stress and, thus, genes contributing to this phenotype may represent cancer vulnerabilities20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focused on AURKA, for which pharmacological inhibitors are currently being investigated in clinical trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AURKA knockdown led to a profound protein decrease of the mitotic genes CCNB1, HURP and PLK1, while only a partial reduction of TACC3 and FOXM1 was observed (Fig 6f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the functional level, AURKA inhibition induced a decrease in the relative number of mutant KRAS cells compared to wild type (Fig 6g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, AURKA overexpression did not rescue the FOSL1-knockdown proliferative phenotype of mutant KRAS cells (Supplementary Fig 6j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, we observed that AURKA overexpression was unable to recover the expression of TACC3 in the rescue experiment (Supplementary Fig 6k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In light of these results and given that TACC3 is a potent AURKA coactivator41 that is only partially regulated by this mitotic kinase, we reasoned that if TACC3 is required for AURKA activity in KRAS-driven tumours its depletion would recapitulate the AURKA-inhibition phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, TACC3 inhibition was also preferentially detrimental to proliferation of mutant KRAS LAC cells (Fig 6h and Supplementary Fig 6l).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Next, survival analyses were carried out in two independent LAC and PDAC patient cohorts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that high levels of AURKA were a marker of poor prognosis in both tumour types (Supplementary Fig 6m), highlighting a clinical role for this kinase in KRAS-driven tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Based on the AURKA knockdown results and the fact that its upstream regulator FOSL1 can be regulated by different KRAS effectors, including the MEK-ERK pathway, we posited that combined inactivation of AURKA and MEK would be more deleterious to mutant KRAS cells than single protein inactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pharmacological inhibition of AURKA (alisertib) and MEK1/2 (trametinib) was carried out in mutant and wild-type LAC cell lines using drug concentrations equal or lower than the GI25 by MTS analysis (500 nM and 1,000 nM), which achieved complete protein inactivation after a 3-day treatment (Supplementary Fig 6n,o).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the dual inhibition revealed a synergistic effect in three out of four mutant KRAS cell lines for all possible drug combinations, while no synergy was observed in wild-type KRAS cell lines (Fig 6i and Supplementary Fig 6p).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The synergistic effect correlated with a significantly higher induction of active caspase 3/7 positive cells in the inhibitor combination compared to single treatments (Fig 6j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The in vitro results prompted us to test the effect of alisertib and trametinib combination in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutant KRAS tumours were treated for 14 days (H2009) or until control tumours reached the largest volume allowed under the ethical protocol (11 days, H1792).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alisertib or trametinib induced significant reduction of tumour volume in the two xenograft models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, concomitant treatment induced a more significant reduction than each single drug (Fig 6k,l).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, the drug combination led to regression of 15 out of 16 tumours in the two models while alisertib and trametinib alone to one and five tumours, respectively (Fig 6m,n).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the different treatments had no impact on mice weight (Supplementary Fig 6q).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results support a functional role of the FOSL1 target AURKA in KRAS-driven tumours and unveil the dual inhibition of AURKA and MEK activation as a potential strategy to treat tumours with KRAS mutations.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We described an integrative gene expression-based screen to unveil KRAS dependencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach followed a two-tiered zoom-in strategy to first identify KRAS-regulated candidate genes by a cross-species meta-analysis of laboratory data and, second, to select genes frequently upregulated across human KRAS-driven cancers by querying the 19 KRAS candidate genes against a panel of five different tumour types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selection within the KRAS eight-gene cross-tumours signature of the candidate gene FOSL1 for follow-up studies relied on the incorporation of patient outcome information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that loss-of-function experiments demonstrated that FOSL1 is important in mutant KRAS LAC argues that the overall approach integrating gene-expression and survival data is successful to identify genes with a relevant role in KRAS-driven cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the survival and genetic data were recapitulated in PDAC, what supports the analysis across different tumour types to unveil common KRAS targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Inhibition of early events in the phylogeny of a tumour could attenuate tumour growth and relapse42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, intratumour heterogeneity arises as a hurdle for the identification of such events, thus favouring tumour progression and relapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One potential strategy to unveil those early events relies on the study of initial stages of tumorigenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, our strategy using experimental systems that represented initial stages of KRAS-induced cell transformation and tumour progression yielded genes with a role in advanced disease such as FOSL1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are in tune with recent findings that took advantage of a gene expression signature derived from mouse lung hyperplasias driven by oncogenic Kras to uncover DDR1 as a therapeutic target in KRAS-driven LAC43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the process of RAS transformation, FOSL1 was originally considered a gene involved in controlling G1/S phase transition by upregulating CCND1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, FOSL1 inhibition experiments later unveiled a role in the control of a motility and invasion programme in human colon cancer cells expressing oncogenic KRASG13D (refs 29, 44) in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study provides evidence that, under endogenous KRAS oncogene expression, FOSL1 can as well regulate a set of genes involved in mitosis progression, a cellular function previously proposed to work orthogonally to KRAS oncogene in human cancer20,22 but for which a direct link to the KRAS oncogene network was missing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the identified genes, the AURKA targets and coactivators TACC3 and HURP had not been previously linked to the KRAS signalling network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, AURKA was found upregulated in PDAC45,46 and malignant peripheral nerve sheath sarcomas with abnormal RAS signalling47, and reported to phosphorylate the KRAS effectors RalGDS and RalA when ectopically expressed in mouse and human cells48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the molecular mechanisms whereby oncogenic KRAS regulated AURKA expression and its clinical and functional role in KRAS-driven tumours were largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data also revealed that the mitosis kinase PLK1 is regulated by FOSL1, shedding light into the molecular mechanisms regulating this kinase in the context of KRAS oncogene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All in all, these observations indicate that FOSL1 links KRAS oncogene to genes involved in mitotic fitness, and suggest that AURKA and TACC3 may partially mediate the synthetic sensitivity of mutant KRAS tumours to FOSL1 loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although FOSL1 inhibition involved the regulation of mitotic genes, sensitivity of mutant KRAS cells to FOSL1 loss seems to occur irrespectively of the proliferative rate of tumour cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is supported by the fact that both in vitro and in vivo mutant KRAS cells showed a higher sensitivity to FOSL1 knockdown than wild-type cell lines with similar population doubling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A possible explanation of the synthetic sensitivity to FOSL1 loss maybe the heightened mitotic stress reported in mutant KRAS cells20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, despite the central role of the mitotic machinery to mutant KRAS phenotype, the contribution of other members of the FOSL1 signature to the effect induced by FOSL1 loss remains unexplored and may also help to explain the impact of FOSL1 inhibition in homeostasis of mutant KRAS tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our findings also argue that a better understanding of the molecular events controlled by prominent transcriptional nodes of the KRAS oncogene network, such as FOSL1, may expose alternative strategies to direct inhibition of transcription factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that, at least for LAC, concomitant inhibition of the FOSL1 target AURKA and the KRAS canonical effector MEK is more effective than single treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result provides the rationale for novel therapeutic approaches against tumours with KRAS mutations and adds to recently reported combinatorial strategies for the treatment of KRAS-driven tumours involving MEK inhibitors (MEKi)50 or inhibitors targeting central kinases of mitotic progression, such as PLK1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinical trials combining alisertib and targeted therapies such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor (EGFRi) erlotinib, (NCT01471964), the pan-RAFi MLN0128 (NCT02327169), the mTORi MLN1117 (NCT02551055) and sapanisertib (NCT02719691) are being conducted in solid tumours, thus paving the path for combination studies with MEKi in KRAS-driven tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we developed an integrative analysis for the identification of KRAS oncogene vulnerabilities that unveiled opportunities for therapeutic intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This general approach integrating mutation, gene-expression and survival data may be applicable to other cancers driven by not actionable oncogenes and/or tumour suppressors for which similar information is available.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
