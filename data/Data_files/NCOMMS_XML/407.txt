Loss-tolerant state engineering for quantum-enhanced metrology via the reverse HongOuMandel effect  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Highly entangled quantum states, shared by remote parties, are vital for quantum communications and metrology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particularly promising are the N00N statesentangled N-photon wavepackets delocalized between two different locationswhich outperform coherent states in measurement sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these states are notoriously vulnerable to losses, making them difficult to both share them between remote locations and recombine in order to exploit interference effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we address this challenge by utilizing the reverse HongOuMandel effect to prepare a high-fidelity two-photon N00N state shared between two parties connected by a lossy optical medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measure the prepared state by two-mode homodyne tomography, thereby demonstrating that the enhanced phase sensitivity can be exploited without recombining the two parts of the N00N state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we demonstrate the application of our method to remotely prepare superpositions of coherent states, known as Schrödingers cat states.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In the current race towards the practical implementation of quantum techniques for information processing and communications, a strong trend is to design loss-tolerant quantum protocols, such as the preparation of non-local superpositions of quasi-classical light states1, discord-assisted remote state preparation2, quantum illumination3, undoing the effect of losses on continuous-variable entanglement4 and the preparation of single-qubit entangled states over a long distance5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this article we are interested in N00N states , which are useful in linear-optical quantum computation9,10, quantum-optical state engineering11,12 and the preparation of photon-number path entanglement13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But the most important potential application of these states is as a resource for quantum enhanced metrology14,15,16,17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interference measurements with N00N states exhibit super-resolving properties: the number of fringes per wavelength equals N, in contrast to a single fringe in the case of coherent states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This property can be exploited for precise measurement of diverse physical quantities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Widespread application of N00N states for metrology is however precluded by their extreme sensitivity to losses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When exposed to even moderate losses, the degree of entanglement and hence the super-resolution potential of the N00N states dramatically degrade to an extent that eliminates any advantage20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the present work, we address this challenge by developing a technique to losslessly produce N00N states between parties that are separated by a lossy quantum channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, using N00N states usually requires bringing back together the two entangled parts, introducing more propagation losses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But we will show that this second step is not required, and that super-resolution for the optical phase can be obtained remotely, by using homodyne detection11.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Concept', 'For N00N state production, we exploit some peculiar properties of the HongOuMandel (HOM) effect22, a well-known quantum interference phenomenon in which two indistinguishable photons that are overlapped on a symmetric beam splitter (BS) always emerge in the same output mode, preparing the N00N state', '', 'in the beam splitter output.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experiment relies upon the reverse version of the HOM effect23, in which the measurements in the two output modes of the BS project them onto single-photon states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the time-reversible nature of quantum mechanics, such projection is equivalent to projecting the state of the input onto the two-photon N00N state (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If each of the beam splitter inputs is, in turn, entangled with other modes, these modes become entangled with each other, thanks to entanglement swapping24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the original HOM setting creates a two-photon N00N state, extension to any even N is straightforward (see Supplementary Section Preparation of high-order N00N states).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Specifically, consider a set-up in which two pairs of modes (A,C) and (B,D) are prepared in two-mode squeezed states:', '', 'by means of non-degenerate parametric down-conversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modes C and D are then mixed on a symmetric BS, the outputs of which are subjected to measurement in the photon-number basis via single-photon counting modules (SPCMs), as shown in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Conceptual scheme of the experiment.A coincidence click of the SPCMs projects modes C and D onto the two-photon N00N state due to the reverse HOM effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This, in turn, prepares modes A and B in the same state, thanks to entanglement swapping.Full size image', 'In the weak-squeezing limit ||2 less_than  less_than 1, every SPCM click is likely to be caused by no more than one photon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, a coincidence click in both SPCMs correspond to projection on state |1, 1CD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the unitary nature of the BS operation, this event assures that modes C and D were initially in the N00N state (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This corresponds to two pairs of photons having been produced in either of two crystals; therefore, now the remaining modes A and B also share a two-photon N00N state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The application of the reverse HOM effect to N00N state preparation has been proposed by Kok et al.13, albeit not in a remote fashion as we do here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A remarkable feature of this scheme is its robustness to losses in channels C and D. Such losses only reduce the probability of the two SPCMs to click, but, if the clicks do occur and the down-conversion amplitude  is sufficiently small, the leading term in the state of channels A and B is still the two-photon N00N state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show in Supplementary equation (8) and Supplementary Fig 4 that the fidelity of this state is bounded from below by F142 for all loss values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, by pumping the down-conversion crystals sufficiently weakly, one can prepare a N00N state of arbitrarily high purity, no matter how high the losses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our method is equally robust with respect to low quantum efficiencies of the SPCMs, because these are effectively equivalent to additional losses in modes C and D25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note, however, that our technique does not help eliminate losses in modes A and B, as well as the effect of detector imperfection in these modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'N00N state tomography', 'Conditioned on coincidence clicks of the two SPCMs, we characterize the state of modes A and B by means of homodyne tomography (Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured states in both cases are very close to the ideal state (1) that has suffered a 1=45% loss due to imperfect detection efficiency26,27 (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Density matrix of the conditionally prepared state of modes A and B.The data are displayed with a 10-dB total loss in modes C and D before the BS, reconstructed in the Fock basis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No correction is made for losses in any of the channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The numbers along the horizontal axes are the indices of the bra and ket elements of that matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The components shown in red correspond to the ideal N00N state, others appear due to losses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) When modes C and D are matched to each other, a two-photon N00N state is prepared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The |1, 11, 1| component amounts to 0.01.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) In the case of a 5-ps mismatch between modes C and D, the HOM interference and any coherence between modes A and B are eliminated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emerged |1, 11, 1| component is shown in grey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Green hats show the statistical error of the reconstruction.Full size image', 'To illustrate the reverse HOM effect and the critical significance of the matching between modes C and D for proper N00N state preparation, we measured the behaviour of the state in modes A and B as a function of increasing temporal mismatch between modes C and D.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The protocol developed here addresses the primary challenge in the way of employing nonclassical states of light, particularly the N00N state, for quantum metrology: optical losses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With conventional optical fibres, it allows establishing nearly ideal N00N entanglement over large distances, with a considerably increased tolerance to the loss in the channel connecting the parties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to its extreme sensitivity to the overall phase between Alice and Bob (see Supplementary Section Phase behavior for details), our scheme could be used for ultra-precise measurements of the distance between Alices and Bobs homodyne detectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its further advantage is that there is no need to recombine the two parts of the N00N states, thanks to the homodyne detections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In many cases, however, it is likely that a simple laser interferometric measurement would do better than our scheme due to the much larger number of available photons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our scheme becomes advantageous in settings where the amount of light transmitted between the two parties is limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Suppose, for instance, that a lossy biological medium, very sensitive to the light intensity, is inserted in channels C and/or D. Then it will be possible to get high-precision interferometric measurements through this medium, with almost negligible light intensity, as long as channels A, B and the associated homodyne detections have a high quality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'At this stage our experiment is a proof-of-principle only, and its application in practical settings would involve a number of challengesin particular, the synchronization of the photons in channels C and D within the inverse down-conversion bandwidth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the production of higher-order N00N states would be required to achieve a significant practical gain over interferometry with coherent states, which are not limited in photon number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our scheme can be generalized to enable producing N00N states with an arbitrary even N. To this end, we can use a sequence of N/2 reverse HOM measurements to subject modes C and D to operator  using the recipe of Kok et al.13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An event in which the application of this operator has been successful (all N SPCMs have clicked) implies that either C or D initially contained at least N photons, but is unable to distinguish which one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means, in turn, that modes A and B are in the |N :: 0 state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly to the two-photon case, the down-conversion amplitude  must be sufficiently low in order to reduce the contribution of higher-order terms in the output state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present a detailed theoretical and numerical analysis of this scheme in the Supplementary Section Preparation of high-order N00N states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we find that the fidelity of the prepared state for a given  does not strongly depend on the losses in modes C and D. This enables preparation of high N00N states at reasonable rates, even with quite lossy channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to interferometry, the generalization of our scheme to higher-order N00N states may have other applications, based on ultraremote preparation of quantum states of light, as illustrated by the cat state generation presented above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In that case, fibre transmission over long distances may be used, with possible quantum cryptography applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present scheme is therefore a valuable addition to the quantum-state engineering toolbox, for both discrete- and continuous-variable degrees of freedom of optical modes11,30,31.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
