Time-resolved scattering of a single photon by a single atom  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Scattering of light by matter has been studied extensively in the past.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, the most fundamental process, the scattering of a single photon by a single atom, is largely unexplored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One prominent prediction of quantum optics is the deterministic absorption of a travelling photon by a single atom, provided the photon waveform matches spatially and temporally the time-reversed version of a spontaneously emitted photon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we experimentally address this prediction and investigate the influence of the photons temporal profile on the scattering dynamics using a single trapped atom and heralded single photons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a time-resolved measurement of atomic excitation we find a 56(11)% increase of the peak excitation by photons with an exponentially rising profile compared with a decaying one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the overall scattering probability remains unchanged within the experimental uncertainties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate that envelope tailoring of single photons enables precise control of the photonatom interaction.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The efficient excitation of atoms by light is a prerequisite for many proposed quantum information protocols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strong light-matter interaction by using either large ensembles of atoms1,2 or single atoms inside cavities3,4,5 has received much attention in the past.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, significant light-matter interaction has also been observed between single quantum systems and weak coherent fields in free space6,7,8,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time-reversal symmetry of Schroedingers and Maxwells equations suggests that the conditions for perfect absorption of an incident single photon by a single atom in free space can be found from the reversed process, the spontaneous emission of a photon from an atom prepared in an excited state12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There, the excited state population decays exponentially with a time constant given by the radiative lifetime 0 of the excited state, and an outward-moving photon with the same temporal decay profile emerges in a spatial field mode corresponding to the atomic dipole transition21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, for efficient atomic excitation the incident photon should have an exponentially rising temporal envelope with a matching time constant 0 and propagate in the atomic dipole mode towards the position of the atom22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For a more quantitative description of the scattering process we follow ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15, which assumes a stationary two-level atom interacting with a propagating single photon in the Weisskopf-Wigner approximation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The photon-atom interaction strength depends on the spatial overlap   0,1 of the atomic dipole mode with the propagating mode of the photon, where =1 corresponds to complete spatial mode overlap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consider scattering of exponentially decaying and rising photons described by the probability amplitude (t)', '', 'and', '', 'where (t) is the Heaviside step function and p is the coherence time of the photon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Integrating the equations of motion in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15 leads to analytic expressions for the time-dependent population Pe(t) in the excited state of the atom for both photon shapes:', '', 'and', '', 'In this work, we measure the atomic excited state population dynamics by scattering single photons with identical power spectrum, but different temporal envelopes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the overall scattering probability only depends on the power spectrum, the dynamics depends on the temporal envelope of the incident photon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, an exponentially rising envelope leads to a higher instantaneous excited state population than an exponentially decaying envelope.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In summary, we have accurately measured the atomic excited state population during photon scattering and have demonstrated that the power spectrum of the incident photon is not enough to fully characterize the interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exponentially rising and decaying photons have an identical Lorentzian power spectrum with a full-width-half-maximum , but the transient atomic excitation differs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have shown that the scattering dynamics depends on the envelope of the photon, in particular that an atom is indeed more efficiently excited by a photon with an exponentially rising temporal envelope compared with an exponentially decaying one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when integrated over a long time interval t0, p both photon shapes are equally likely to be scattered as shown by our measurement of the extinction  The advantage of exciting single atoms with exponentially rising photons is a larger peak excitation probability within a narrower time interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a synchronization can be beneficial to quantum networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our experimental results also contribute to a longstanding discussion about differences between heralded and true single photons32,33,34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The atomic excitation dynamics caused by heralded single photons matches well the one expected from true single photon states in our theoretical model, and therefore support a realistic interpretation of photons prepared in a heralding process.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
