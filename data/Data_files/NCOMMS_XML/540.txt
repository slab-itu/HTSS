Mice produced by mitotic reprogramming of sperm injected into haploid parthenogenotes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Sperm are highly differentiated and the activities that reprogram them for embryonic development during fertilization have historically been considered unique to the oocyte.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We here challenge this view and demonstrate that mouse embryos in the mitotic cell cycle can also directly reprogram sperm for full-term development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Developmentally incompetent haploid embryos (parthenogenotes) injected with sperm developed to produce healthy offspring at up to 24% of control rates, depending when in the embryonic cell cycle injection took place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that most of the first embryonic cell cycle can be bypassed in sperm genome reprogramming for full development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remodelling of histones and genomic 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine following embryo injection were distinct from remodelling in fertilization and the resulting 2-cell embryos consistently possessed abnormal transcriptomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies demonstrate plasticity in the reprogramming of terminally differentiated sperm nuclei and suggest that different epigenetic pathways or kinetics can establish totipotency.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Fertilization integrates multiple cell-autonomous processes to transform a sperm and an oocyte (egg) into a totipotent embryo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mammals, the fertilizing sperm triggers embryogenesis by inducing a calcium-dependent phospho-relay to remove the unique cytostatic factor, Emi2, resulting in metaphase II (mII) exit and completion of meiosis1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sperm membranes, mitochondria and perinuclear matrix components are dismantled and the unique non-histone major sperm nucleoprotein, protamine, is replaced by maternal histones3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both parental chromatin sets undergo signature patterns of global modification2,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paternal and, to some extent, maternal genomes undergo active 5-methylcytosine (5mC) depletion4,6,7,8 accompanied by Tet3-catalysed production of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the mouse, meiotic completion is followed by the formation of visible pronuclei (membranated compartments that uniquely separate each parental genome) 4.5 h after sperm entry; DNA synthesis and transcription respectively initiate after 8 and 10 h (Supplementary Fig 1a,b)2,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Reprogramming during fertilization represents an extreme cellular potency change, from the assured death of sperm and oocyte to the emergence of the embryonic totipotent state able to engender an entire organism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sperm are terminally differentiated, post-meiotic germ cells that are exhaustively remodelled during fertilization4,5 and nothing suggests that sperm are capable of being reprogrammed to totipotency by any other cell than oocytes, which are specialized for the role9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sperm injected well after mII exit have so far failed to support development10,11,12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although embryonic stem (ES) cell nuclei participate in development when injected into pro-metaphase 1-cell15 or interphase 2-cell16 embryos, they are pluripotent, contain diploid nucleosomal chromatin and are efficient nuclear transfer donors relative to somatic cells17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since ES cells transit through a quasi-2-cell embryonic state during culture18, early embryonic reprogramming of their nuclei may be minimal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, sperm possess structurally unique toroidal chromatin whose principal nucleoprotein is protamine3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore investigated whether embryos also possess the ability to reprogram differentiated cell nuclei exemplified by the inert, protaminic chromatin of sperm, to instate totipotency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We now report that haploid parthenogenetic embryos injected with sperm undergo distinctive chromatin remodelling, including altered protamine-histone exchange kinetics, different 5hmC and histone modification dynamics, parental chromatin remodelling asynchrony and abnormal gene expression compared to normal fertilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, this distinctive remodelling can result in full-term development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work suggests that sperm reprogramming sufficient to support full and healthy development can occur not only when mII oocytes are fertilized, but in mitotic embryos well after meiotic exit, via anomalous epigenetic pathways or kinetics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Development in vitro of parthenogenotes injected with sperm', 'We assessed the ability of parthenogenotes to reprogram sperm at different stages of the first cell cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We selected haploid parthenogenotes as our starting point so that the introduction of a sperm would potentially restore diploidy and rescue development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parthenogenotes also allow us to eliminate potential contributions of paternal contributions earlier in fertilization and have previously been used to probe mitotic reprogramming of sperm10,11,12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parthenogenetic haploid (ph) embryos generated by exposing mII oocytes to strontium chloride (SrCl2) were examined 7, 10 or 13 h after treatment started (ph-7, -10 and -13) (Fig 1a; Supplementary Fig 1ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SrCl2 induced rapid Geminin degradation typical of that seen in somatic cell G1 (Supplementary Fig 1d) but differing from pluripotent cells in which Geminin escapes degradation19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Geminin and Cdt1 accumulated in the pronuclei of ph embryos, dispersing cytoplasmically after pronucleus (pn) membrane breakdown (pnMBD; Supplementary Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following sperm injection (ICSI) of ph-7 embryos (phICSI-7), paternal chromatin remained compact with little morphological change for 5 h until the onset of maternal pnMBD (1213 h after the start of SrCl2 treatment; Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, following ICSI of ph-13 parthenogenotes (phICSI-13) soon after pnMBD, sperm began decondensing within 1 h (Fig 1b; Supplementary Fig 2e), although spindle assembly on paternal chromatin was incomplete prior to the first mitotic cell division (Supplementary Fig 2g, asterisk).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The timing of cell division in phICSI-13 was similar to that of ph-13 controls (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Development in vitro following phICSI-13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic (upper) and merged Hoffman and Hoechst 33342 (DNA) fluorescence images showing phICSI-13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Red arrowheads indicate sperm heads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Merged Hoffman and Hoechst 33342 (DNA) images (upper) at the times indicated after sperm injection in phICSI-13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Schematic (centre: paternal genome, black; second polar body, pink) and fluorescence images (BrdU, maternal genome; PI, both genomes) show different classes of nuclear configuration 14 h after the first mitotic division (1C2C) in phICSI-13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  White arrowheads, paternal chromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars, 20 m.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'These studies demonstrate that mitotic embryos are able to remodel sperm chromatin completely, leading to the direct production of healthy animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full sperm reprogramming is therefore not unique to oocytes, showing that sperm chromatin reprogramming machinery is present at different development stages and in other cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  phICSI has the potential to reveal not only stage-dependent features such as high zygotic 5hmC production, but key features of reprogramming during the gamete-to-embryo transition in natural fertilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All randomly-sampled phICSI embryos exhibited anomalous reprogramming, but since full-term development in phICSI-13-1bla occurred at 24% of ICSI control rates (10.4% versus 43.4%, Supplementary Table 1), development was not the result of a subgroup that evaded epigenetic analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We challenged this assertion by generating binomial distributions of probabilities that phICSI embryos with two normal modifications gave rise to different numbers of offspring (Supplementary Fig 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The production of 9 or more phICSI embryos with modifications characteristic of ICSI out of a total of 24 that developed to term can be excluded on the 5%-significance level, since P(9|20,)0.0465 (worst case) for all  (Supplementary Fig 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probability that not a single embryo is phICSI modification derived is only P(24|20, )9.84e17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this analysis assumed only two epigenetic differences, we detected five modifications that consistently differed between stage-matched ICSI and phICSI-13 embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data strongly suggest that different chromatin remodelling dynamics support the emergence of totipotency following phICSI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given that sperm reprogramming naturally accompanies exit from the second meiotic metaphase, it is reasonable to suppose that our success in phICSI-13 was partly because recipient parthenogenotes were at, or soon entered, metaphase of the first mitotic M-phase after sperm injection22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the lower rates of term development we observed in phICSI-7 and -10, where sperm were injected during the meiotic-to-mitotic transition well before M-phase (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This constitutes evidence that a cell cycle window for sperm reprogramming closes after fertilization and reopens during entry into the first mitotic M-phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An additional possibility is that sperm reprogramming factors accumulate in pronuclei during interphase37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pronuclear sequestration of remodelling factors is also thought to occur in somatic cell nuclear transfer, but the mitotic cytoplasm later regains remodelling activity15,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Injected sperm heads in phICSI-7 and -10 exhibited limited nucleoprotein exchange until pn membrane breakdown (Supplementary Fig 2) and poor subsequent development may have been due to paternal chromatin damage before M-phase (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'When we employed pn transfer experiments to ask whether embryonic stage skipping exerted an effect on development, pups were produced only in pre-S-phase transfer experiments (the pnT-G1 group) but they did not survive fostering (Fig 4ac; Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We cannot exclude technical effects such as genomic DNA damage and cell cycle discordance between donor pn and recipient blastomeres, but it is also possible that key reprogramming events of the first mitotic cell cycle were omitted in both pnT-G1 and pnT-G2 and that these events are part of the physiological mechanism of the gamete-to-embryo transition following natural fertilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'From the unique properties of sperm chromatin3 it might be inferred that remodelling activity in oocytes is unique, but in phICSI, remodelling is performed by mitotic embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that nucleoplasmin-like activity responsible for removing protamines is also mitotic5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse putative nucleoplasmins Npm1, Npm2 and Npm3 are expressed in oocytes; after fertilization, Npm2 is present in both parental pronuclei and remains in the nuclei of early cleavage embryos39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pronuclear sequestration, embryonic persistence and evidence that Npm2 possesses somatic cell reprogramming activity40 collectively suggest that one or more nucleoplasmins mediate chromatin remodelling in phICSI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In fertilization, sperm decondensation is followed by maternal histone deposition3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deposition of the oocyte core histone variant, H3.3 requires the chaperone, Hira41 and since Hira is present in mitosis27 it may operate in mitotic sperm chromatin remodelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chromatin remodelling in fertilization and mitotic cells may share other features including rapid and dynamic regulation of nuclear proteins, H3 family dynamics and the contribution of factors enriched in mII oocytes41,42,43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The success of phROSI shows that mitotic parthenogenotes can directly reprogram non-protaminic chromatin from differentiated cells; the method might also be combined with products of paternal meiosis generated in vitro45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'High developmental rates in phICSI are remarkable given that the injected sperm bypasses all events as they occur during the first 13 h of natural fertilization (Supplementary Fig 1a), including calcium mobilization, cytokinesis, disassembly of membrane, mitochondria and perinuclear structures, chromatin decondensation, reassembly and modification leading to pn formation, S-phase and preparation for the first embryonic transcription2,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, an essential reprogramming role for calcium mobilization is unlikely; it is dispensable for full development and is probably more important for sustained Emi2 degradation1,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fertilizing sperm desconstruction inside the oocyte is mediated by the proteasome, which is ubiquitously expressed and present in early mammalian embryos47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with evident dismantling of sperm in phICSI-13, although we did not examine sperm dismantling in detail in phICSI-7 and -10; the prediction is that although sperm chromatin remained condensed in phICSI-7 and -10 (Fig 5a), some components disperse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oocyte microvillar projections thought to remove the sperm perinuclear matrix following fertilization are rich in microfilaments49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since microfilaments persist well into the late 1-cell stage50, analogous interactions could remove the perinuclear matrix in successful phICSI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Chromatin remodelling following fertilization involves pronounced changes in 5hmC levels8 which were markedly different in phICSI (Fig 7a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydroxymethylation of paternal chromatin or of 5mC DNA-beads (5mC-beads) injected around the first M-phase was low compared to ICSI controls (Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under the conditions of the DNA-beads assay, the appearance of 5hmC required pre-existing 5mC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that rates of phICSI-13 term development (Supplementary Table 1) were similar to those of functionally Tet3 null embryos7, it is possible that 5hmC dysregulation accounts for some developmental failure in phICSI but it is unlikely to account for all of it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, if 5hmC anomalies alone accounted for impaired phICSI development, other aspects of reprogramming in phICSI would either be the same as those of ICSI, which they are not, or the 5hmC differences in phICSI would have to have been indirectly responsible for all of the epigenetic differences we observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondly, lack of functional maternal Tet3 does not affect rates of preimplantation development7, but preimplantation development in phICSI-13 was poor (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thirdly, during manuscript preparation, it was reported that haploinsufficiency is the major reason for the perinatal abnormality in Tet3 mutant mice, with no fundamental developmental function of Tet3-mediated 5hmC production in male pronuclei51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourthly, 5mC-dependent DNA hydroxymethylation is evident in ph-7 parthenogenotes (Fig 7e;
