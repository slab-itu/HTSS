Direct oriented growth of armchair graphene nanoribbons on germanium  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Graphene can be transformed from a semimetal into a semiconductor if it is confined into nanoribbons narrower than 10 nm with controlled crystallographic orientation and well-defined armchair edges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the scalable synthesis of nanoribbons with this precision directly on insulating or semiconducting substrates has not been possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate the synthesis of graphene nanoribbons on Ge(001) via chemical vapour deposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nanoribbons are self-aligning 3° from the Ge110 directions, are self-defining with predominantly smooth armchair edges, and have tunable width to  less_than 10 nm and aspect ratio to  greater than 70.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to realize highly anisotropic ribbons, it is critical to operate in a regime in which the growth rate in the width direction is especially slow,  less_than 5 nm h1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This directional and anisotropic growth enables nanoribbon fabrication directly on conventional semiconductor wafer platforms and, therefore, promises to allow the integration of nanoribbons into future hybrid integrated circuits.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Graphene nanoribbons are excellent charge1 and thermal2 conductors that can exhibit high current-carrying capacity3 and novel magnetic and spin-polarized edge states4,5,6 depending on their crystallographic orientation, edge structure and width.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike continuous two-dimensional graphene, which is semimetallic, one-dimensional (1D) graphene nanoribbons can be semiconducting, allowing for substantial modulation of their conductance and enabling their application in semiconductor logic, high-frequency communication devices, optoelectronics, photonics and sensors in which a bandgap is needed to achieve high performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their bandgap roughly varies inversely with ribbon width and the largest bandgaps are expected for ribbons with armchair edge orientation7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While achieving a ribbon width of  less_than 10 nm is necessary to induce a technologically relevant bandgap that is substantially greater than kBT of 25 meV at room temperature5,7, sub-10 nm resolution is beyond the limits of conventional optical and electron-beam lithography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, top-down lithographic techniques in which ribbons are etched from continuous graphene sheets result in nanostructures with relatively rough, defective edges, which lead to Coulomb blockade8 and localized electronic9,10 and phonon states11 and, consequently, degrade the high charge carrier mobility12,13,14 and thermal conductivity2 of graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These deficiencies, in part, can be overcome, via bottom-up organic synthesis on metal surfaces15,16,17 and in solution18,19 as well as by unzipping graphite20 and carbon nanotubes21 in solution, to yield ribbons with sub-10 nm width and smooth edges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, surface-assisted organic synthesis yields short ribbons (20 nm) and unzipping graphite and carbon nanotubes does not offer control over the ribbon crystallographic orientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the controlled placement and alignment of ribbons onto substrates from solution has proven to be difficult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Scalable nanoribbon fabrication has also been reported via epitaxial growth on templated SiC nanofacets22 and by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) on surface features, such as steps23, twins24 and trenches25, as well as on patterned catalysts in which growth is confined to predetermined areas that define the ribbon dimensions26,27,28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, with these approaches, ribbons with sub-10 nm width have not been demonstrated and the catalyst template determines the ribbon edge structure rather than a more precise self-defining growth mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we show that the CVD of graphene on Ge(001) can be controlled to yield oriented nanoribbons with sub-10 nm width and smooth armchair edges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work on integrating graphene with Ge has primarily focused on large-area graphene monolayers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, continuous graphene films have been transferred onto Ge from other substrates30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, continuous graphene monolayers have been grown via CVD directly on Ge(001) by Wang et al.32 and Ge(110) and Ge(111) by Lee et al.33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in these previous studies, nanoribbons were not observed in partial growth experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, we report that high aspect ratio nanoribbons can be directly grown on the Ge(001) facet by tailoring the CVD conditions to maximize the anisotropy of crystal growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is critical to operate in a regime in which the growth rate is especially slow,  less_than 5 nm h1 in the width direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nanoribbons are grown at atmospheric pressure using various growth temperatures (860 less_than T less_than 935 °C), CH4 mole fractions (3.7 × 103 less_than  less_than 1.6 × 102), and H2 mole fractions (0.17 less_than  less_than 0.33), as summarized in Supplementary Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By tuning T, ,  and the growth time (t), the growth anisotropy is tailored to yield ribbons from the bottom-up with controlled width (w), length (l) and aspect ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using conditions in which the anisotropy is maximized, isolated ribbons are prevalent on the Ge(001) surface even after t greater than 18 h. In contrast, Wang et al.32 used a relatively fast growth rate in which continuous graphene films were synthesized on Ge(001) in t less_than 100 min.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Growth behaviour', 'Several general observations are made regarding graphene growth on Ge(001) by analysing representative scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) images in Fig 1ac.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following nucleation, graphene crystals evolve anisotropically, resulting in nanoribbons with high aspect ratio and smooth, straight edges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Raman spectroscopy indicates that the 2D:G ratio and the 2D peak full-width-at-half-maximum are 6.0 and 28 cm1, respectively, confirming that the nanoribbons are monolayer graphene34 (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ribbons preferentially orient closely along the 110 directions of the Ge(001) template, resulting in two ribbon orientations that are approximately perpendicularly aligned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two orientations exist with equal probability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For ribbons with w less_than 10 nm, the short ribbon edges form 60, 90 or 120° angles with the long ribbon edges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for wider ribbons, only angles of 60 and 120° are observed, indicating that all edges are oriented along equivalent crystallographic directions of graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While as high as 90% of the graphene crystals that nucleate evolve as ribbons, more compact graphene crystals with lower aspect ratio and edges that are not aligned along Ge110 directions are also observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the Ge underneath the ribbons is nanofaceted, which is studied further below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Growth evolution of graphene nanoribbons on Ge(001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ac) SEM (a), AFM phase (b) and STM (applied bias 2 V, current 200 pA) (c) images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars are 400 nm in (a,b) and 10 nm in c.

Figure 1c shows an example of a nanoribbon with w of 7 nm and l of 160 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The effects of ,  and T on the nanoribbon growth rate and the resulting anisotropy are also quantified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The growth rates increase as  increases (Fig 2a),  decreases (Fig 2b), and T increases (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of these parameters can be independently tuned to vary Rl over an order of magnitude from 30 to 300 nm h1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The anisotropy varies inversely with Rl, independent of whether  or  is changed (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a critical parameter for realizing high aspect ratio nanoribbons is to operate in a regime in which growth is slow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, at low  of 0.0066 and high  of 0.33, not only is a slow Rl of 40 nm h1 achieved, but also a much slower Rw of 1.4 nm h1, yielding ribbons with an aspect ratio of 30, on average, and as high as 70 (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Minimizing Rw also makes it possible to tailor w with high precision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Empirical rate laws are identified (insets of Fig 2a,b), indicating that Rl scales as  and .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, an Arrhenius temperature

as the graphene nucleus becomes larger, the energy barrier associated with its rotation significantly increases, which, consequently, fixes the orientation of the nanoribbon lattice during the subsequent growth52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ge(001) surface consists of two types of terraces that have the same structure but are rotated 90° with respect to each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is plausible that on one set of terraces, the armchair direction of the graphene nuclei is rotated 3° from Ge110 and on the other set of terraces, the armchair direction is rotated 3° from Ge, giving rise to the two families of orientations observed in the LEED and STM data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nucleation does not seem to be strongly correlated with the density or directionality of steps that exist before nucleation (Supplementary Figs 1214 and Supplementary Discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'After nucleation, several factors could drive anisotropic ribbon evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While step edges may play a role in setting the crystallographic orientation of the nuclei on each terrace, subsequent preferential growth along step edges cannot solely account for the formation of ribbons with smooth edges over long segments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we do not observe residual nanoparticles at the ribbon ends or tapered ribbon growth that might indicate that the ribbon evolution is driven by a catalyst particle like in conventional nanowire growth53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anisotropic diffusion of intermediate hydrocarbons on the Ge surface cannot alone account for the ribbon evolution because low aspect ratio crystals are also observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We hypothesize that the anisotropic growth is due to preferential attachment of intermediate hydrocarbons from the Ge surface to the short (faster growing) ribbon edges over the long (slower growing) ribbon edges, which is consistent with the observation that the low aspect ratio crystals have different lattice orientation than that of the nanoribbons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During attachment, the transition state and the corresponding energy barrier will depend on the relative orientation between the nanoribbon edge and the Ge surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar growth phenomena, such as the formation of polygonal graphene crystals with relatively straight edges and sharp vertices54 and the synthesis of other 1D structures on the (001) face of zinc-blende semiconductors55,56,57, have also been attributed to attachment-limited kinetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in Rw with time (Fig 1d) may indicate that the barrier for hydrocarbon attachment to the long (slower growing) ribbon edges decreases as w increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rw begins to noticeably increase after w exceeds about 30 nm, potentially corresponding to when ribbons begin to outgrow the Ge terrace on which they nucleate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ge hill-and-valley structures increase in height and width as w increases; this evolution may also perturb the interactions of the nanoribbon edges with the underlying Ge and, thus, may also modify the attachment barrier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Several challenges in synthesis and fabrication have inhibited progress in nanoribbon research and development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, (1) the synthesis of nanoribbons with armchair edges, (2) the definition of nanoribbons with width  less_than 10 nm and (3) the direct integration of nanoribbons onto insulating or semiconducting platforms have been difficult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work overcomes these challenges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that by controlling graphene synthesis on Ge(001) via CVD, it is possible to realize oriented nanoribbons with sub-10 nm width, controlled crystallographic orientation and smooth armchair edges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This direct, self-defining growth offers precise control over the ribbon structure beyond the fidelity of top-down lithography and yields a relatively pristine nanoribbon/substrate interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ribbons are self-aligning, and ribbons with w less_than 10 nm can still be hundreds of nanometres in length, opening the door for exploration of dense nanoribbon arrays as logic, photonic and sensing components in integrated circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Improved control over the ribbon placement will enhance the viability of these applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are also technologically important because they enable a scalable, high throughput pathway for integrating nanoribbons directly on conventional large-area semiconductor wafer platforms that are compatible with planar processing, like Ge wafers and potentially epitaxial Ge films on Si (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33) or GaAs (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  58) wafers.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
