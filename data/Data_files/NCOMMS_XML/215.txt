Neuronal differentiation is associated with a redox-regulated increase of copper flow to the secretory pathway  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Brain development requires a fine-tuned copper homoeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Copper deficiency or excess results in severe neuro-pathologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that upon neuronal differentiation, cellular demand for copper increases, especially within the secretory pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Copper flow to this compartment is facilitated through transcriptional and metabolic regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative real-time imaging revealed a gradual change in the oxidation state of cytosolic glutathione upon neuronal differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transition from a broad range of redox states to a uniformly reducing cytosol facilitates reduction of the copper chaperone Atox1, liberating its metal-binding site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concomitantly, expression of Atox1 and its partner, a copper transporter ATP7A, is upregulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These events produce a higher flux of copper through the secretory pathway that balances copper in the cytosol and increases supply of the cofactor to copper-dependent enzymes, expression of which is elevated in differentiated neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct link between glutathione oxidation and copper compartmentalization allows for rapid metabolic adjustments essential for normal neuronal function.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Neuronal cells require copper for their neurochemical activities as well as general metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of copper to cycle between the two oxidation states (Cu+ and Cu2+) is utilized by various enzymes that carry out biochemical reactions essential for brain development and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The housekeeping copper-dependent enzymes include cytochrome c oxidase, which is involved in electron transfer and ATP production in mitochondria, and superoxide dismutases (SOD1 and SOD3), which are responsible for detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cytosol and at the cell surface, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Copper-dependent enzymes that contribute to functional identity of specific neurons include dopamine--hydroxylase (DBH), which performs the key step in the biosynthesis of norepinephrine, and peptidyl-glycine--monooxygenase (PAM), which is responsible for the production of all amidated neuropeptides1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The copper-requiring proteins are located in different cellular compartments; this property necessitates a timely delivery of copper to these compartments for functional maturation of resident enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been established that after entering cells copper is escorted to specific destinations by small proteins called copper chaperones2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chaperone for SOD, CCS, delivers copper to SOD1 in the cytosol, whereas a complex set of chaperones including Cox11, Cox17, SCO1 and SCO2 mediates copper transfer into mitochondria and incorporation of copper into cytochrome c oxidase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cytosolic chaperone Atox1 shuttles copper to the copper transporters ATP7A and ATP7B located in the secretory pathway2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the energy of ATP hydrolysis, ATP7A and ATP7B transport cytosolic copper into the lumen of trans-Golgi network (TGN) and various vesicles to activate PAM, DBH, SOD3 and other copper-dependent enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although identities of metallochaperones have been established, it remains unclear how cells regulate copper flow to different cellular compartments to meet the metabolic demands for copper in these locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biochemical studies led to the suggestion that copper distribution between proteins is driven by relative abundance of copper-binding molecules and differences in their affinity for copper5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This basic principle is likely to govern copper distribution in the cytosol under steady-state conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanisms through which cells make changes in copper delivery to any given compartment remain unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, timely adjustment of intracellular copper fluxes is potentially crucial for the development of unique neurochemical characteristics of neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon transition from a proliferative phase to a differentiated state, neuronal cells undergo significant metabolic restructuring defined by changes in metabolome6 and protein-expression profiles7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differentiated neurons actively synthesize neurotransmitters and neuropeptides within the secretory pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These processes require copper8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that neuronal differentiation is likely to involve adjustment of cellular copper homoeostasis, and, in the current study, we directly tested this hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Transcriptional control is compatible with a long-term maintenance of cellular copper homoeostasis9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, changes in protein expression are too slow to provide rapid adjustment of copper delivery to distinct subcellular locations, which may require post-translational and/or metabolic controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously found that the copper chaperone Atox1 can be reversibly oxidized within a physiologically relevant range of redox potentials10,11, and hypothesized that such reversible oxidation might modulate intracellular copper fluxes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, using in vivo and cell culture models, we investigated how differentiating neurons regulate intracellular copper distribution and whether this regulation involves redox modulation of copper-handling proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experiments revealed two distinct mechanisms through which cells adjust intracellular copper fluxes and uncovered a tight link between the cellular metal compartmentalization and redox homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that changes in the redox status of cytosolic glutathione may have significant effect on the metabolic activity of secretory pathway by altering maturation and function of the resident copper-dependent enzymes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Differentiated motor neurons have higher levels of PAM', 'To test whether copper utilization changes upon neuronal differentiation we used two different experimental models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the in vivo model, we have chosen the developing chick embryonic spinal cord.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At Hamburger Hamilton stage (HH stage) 2021, motor neuron progenitors differentiate into postmitotic motor neurons12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The progression of differentiation correlates with the position of cell bodies along the mediallateral axis of the spinal cord12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Actively cycling neuronal progenitors reside medially within the ventricular zone, whereas the cell bodies of postmitotic motor neuronsvisualized by the postmitotic motor neuron marker Isl1/2are located laterally13 (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spinal cord is rich in neuropeptides including substance P14,15, which is involved in chemoattraction of migrating cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional maturation of substance P and other neuropeptides requires a copper-dependent enzyme peptidylglycine--amidating monooxygenase (PAM)8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunohistochemistry of chick spinal cords revealed that PAM is more abundant in the lateral region compared to the medial zone (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this observation, differentiated motor neurons (indicated by the marker Isl1/2) have higher levels of PAM than neuroprogenitors, as evidenced by colocalization of PAM and Isl1/2 (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher abundance of PAM in differentiated motor neurons indicates an increased demand for copper in the secretory pathway to accommodate PAM biosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Requirement for copper is increased in the secretory pathway upon neuronal differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Immunostaining of PAM (green) in a chicken spinal cord (HH stage 20 embryo).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Traverse sections of chick embryos were analysed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differentiated cells in marginal zones were identified by postmitotic marker isl1/2 (red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 50 m.

PAM and copper in differentiating neurons, we utilized a cultured cell model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were differentiated by sequential treatment with retinoic acid (RA) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)16 as shown in Fig 1c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RA induces cell differentiation, as detected by the appearance of neuritic processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent BDNF treatment in the absence of serum yields a homogeneous population of cells with a neuron-like phenotype16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell differentiation was further verified by expression of the neuronal marker microtubule-associated protein 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell lysates were then used to determine copper content and the mRNA levels for PAM and proteins involved in copper transport and utilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Copper delivery to the secretory pathway is mediated by Atox1 and the downstream transporters ATP7A and ATP7B (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found Atox1 and ATP7A to be upregulated upon cell differentiation, whereas ATP7B was not (Fig 1d and Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The change in protein abundance was verified by western blotting and compared with other cell types (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ATP7A levels in the non-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells were significantly higher than in other cells including HEK293, HeLa and HepG2 (Fig 1e and Supplementary Fig 1a) suggesting its functional importance in neuronal cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ATP7A abundance was further increased by RA (a trigger of neuronal differentiation) and remained steady during BDNF treatment (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of non-differentiating HEK293 cells with RA did not affect ATP7A levels (Supplementary Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggested that ATP7A plays an important role in neuronal cells, especially post-differentiation (see Supplementary Fig 1e,f for supporting evidence).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'When measuring levels of copper-utilizing proteins, we observed significant differences between cell compartments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detected a 19-fold increase in PAM mRNA which receives copper cofactor in the secretory pathway, the predicted location for ATP7A (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another important copper-dependent enzyme, DBH, was also upregulated in response to RA and was significantly higher in differentiated cells (Supplementary Fig 1f,g) The mitochondria copper chaperone COX17 and subunit 1 of cytochrome C oxidase (COX1) were upregulated by 3.8-fold and 6.5-fold, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation complemented a recent report showing that differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells increases cellular respiration17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the cytosolic SOD1 and its copper chaperone CCS did not show significant changes at the mRNA levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Increased production of copper-dependent enzymes in the secretory pathway and mitochondria implied that differentiated cells require more copper in these compartments, whereas the demand for copper in the cytosol appeared unchanged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements of copper in cell lysates confirmed that copper level in differentiated cells was higher than in non-differentiated cells (18.1±0.3 and 12.3±3.2 pmol per mg of protein, respectively, Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Copper levels in the microsomal fractions (containing TGN and secretory vesicles) were also higher in differentiated cells (21.4±0.8 pmol per mg compared with 14.7±2.8 pmol per mg in non-differentiated cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mRNA levels of copper uptake transporters CTR1 and CTR2 were increased (1.6-fold and 2.3-fold) upon differentiation (Fig 1d), pointing to a potential source of elevated copper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, our results suggest that neuronal differentiation is associated with increased utilization of copper in the secretory pathway (and possibly mitochondria) and upregulated expression of proteins involved in copper uptake and transport to these compartments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Localization of ATP7A and Atox1 in SH-SY5Y cells', 'Previous studies demonstrated that increase in the cytosolic copper triggers trafficking of ATP7A from the TGN to vesicles18,19,20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since total copper was higher in differentiated cells we tested whether localization of ATP7A may change with neuronal differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunostaining of the non-differentiated and differentiated cells revealed that in both conditions, ATP7A had similar distribution patterns (Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was detected at the periphery of nucleus (where it colocalized with the TGN marker TGN46; Pearsons product-moment coefficient P=0.71; Fig 1h), and in vesicles distributed throughout the cell body (Supplementary Fig 2a,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specificity of immunostaining was confirmed using transfection with ATP7A-targeted siRNA (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar intracellular distribution of ATP7A in differentiated and non-differentiated cells (despite difference in total copper) suggested that in differentiated cells extra copper was sequestered/compartmentalized and not available to stimulate ATP7A trafficking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The general ability of ATP7A to traffic was verified by treating cells with exogenous copper, which decreased the perinuclear signal and increased vesicular staining, which is indicative of trafficking (Supplementary Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Atox1 is thought to be present mostly in the cytosol where it transiently binds copper and mediates subsequent metal transfer to ATP7A and ATP7B (refs 2, 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atox1 was also shown to translocate into the nucleus of mouse embryonic fibroblast where it may function as a transcription factor23 or copper importer24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined distribution of endogenous Atox1 by subcellular fractionation followed by western blotting (Supplementary Fig 3a) and observed several bands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 7.4-kDa band in a soluble fraction (cytosol) corresponded to the expected molecular weight of Atox1 (7.4 kDa) and 1215 kDa bands in pellet fraction (nucleus) could have represented an Atox1 dimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with siRNAAtox1 diminished the intensity of 7.4 kDa band but did not affect the 1215-kDa bands, indicating that the latter bands are results of non-specific staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, at steady state, the majority of endogenous Atox1 is in the cytosol where it serves as a copper donor to ATP7A; this distribution does not change upon differentiation (Supplementary Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Glutathione oxidation decreases upon motor neuron maturation', 'Differentiation of motor neurons involves a redox-dependent activation of glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase 2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25), illustrating the impact of redox physiology on neuronal development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously found that the oxidation state of Atox1 can be influenced by the redox status of a glutathione pair (GSH:GSSG (oxidized glutathione))10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, we hypothesized that the oxidation state of Atox1 may change during neuronal differentiation if the redox equilibrium of cytosolic glutathione is altered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantitatively measure the redox status of cytosolic glutathione upon differentiation we used the GSH:GSSG sensor based on a redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused with glutaredoxin 1 (Grx1-roGFP2) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sensor has two Cys residues that form a reversible disulfide bond depending on the oxidation state of cytosolic glutathione; formation of the disulfide bond alters the excitation spectrum of the sensor (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio of emission intensities following excitation at 405 and 488 nm (R value) reports the degree of sensor oxidation; a higher R value corresponds to a more oxidized state of glutathione (Fig 2b and Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: In vivo measurements of the redox status of cytosolic glutathione

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Normal function of central nervous system requires proper copper homoeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In neuronal cells, copper is utilized for neurochemical activities as well as general metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that neuronal cells modulate their copper metabolism upon differentiation in conjunction with changes in redox homoeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that the demand for copper in the secretory pathway increases with neuronal differentiation and that metal compartmentalization is facilitated by changes in the transcriptome and cellular redox state (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our measurements of glutathione balance in developing motor neurons in vivo demonstrate that redox state of cytosolic glutathione correlates with the stage of neuronal differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the normal physiological processes, such as differentiation, glutathione redox balance can also be altered in disease or as a result of aging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that changes in glutathione oxidation can be translated and amplified (through the activities of copper-dependent enzymes) into specific metabolic responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Redox-regulated remodelling of cellular copper fluxes during neural differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells.The intracellular routes of copper (yellow circle) are indicated by arrows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bold arrows represent the pathways upregulated upon differentiation.Full size image', 'Copper-dependent enzymes function in different intracellular compartments (cytosol, mitochondria and the lumen of secretory vesicles) and their functional maturation requires targeted delivery of copper to the corresponding compartments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the secretory pathway, lysyl oxidases (LOX1-5), ferroxidases (ceruloplasmin29), SOD3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30) and various monooxygenases (such as DBH31 and PAM32) depend on timely delivery of copper by ATP7A or ATP7B with the help of the chaperone Atox1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data indicate that some of these enzymes, such as PAM and DBH, are expressed at higher levels in differentiated neurons and the increased protein production coincides with upregulation of ATP7A and Atox1 expression (at the mRNA and protein levels) to meet higher demand for copper in the secretory pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar co-regulation between PAM and ATP7A was reported for amygdala interneurons34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that ATP7A levels in differentiating cells are increased in response to RA but not BDNF, consistent with the previous finding that ATP7A is a target gene for RA receptor -2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to upregulation of ATP7A, we observed increased expression of other genes involved in copper metabolism: in mitochondria (COX17 and COX1) and copper uptake transporters (CTR1 and CTR2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation suggests that cell differentiation involves significant remodelling of the intracellular copper-trafficking system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Differentiated cells showed higher copper efflux (Fig 5d) and yet higher copper content (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation suggests that the rate of copper uptake mediated by CTR1 (which is upregulated in differentiated cells) exceeds the rate of copper secretion mediated through vesicle fusion, producing on a balance, higher steady-state levels of cellular copper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, some upregulated copper-binding proteins such as PAM remain in a cell, thus contributing to a higher copper content in differentiated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether these data suggest a model where neuronal differentiation is associated with simultaneous activation of copper absorption and secretion, generating higher copper flow through the secretory pathway to supply copper for maturation of copper-dependent enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although copper transport to the secretory pathway may not be obligatory for neuronal differentiation, the enhanced copper delivery to secretory pathway is required for normal neurochemical activities of neurons, as demonstrated by the reduced DBH secretion in the BCNU-treated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human patients with Menkes disease provide a real-life example of the essentiality of copper delivery to the secretory pathway for normal neuronal function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These patients have insufficient function of ATP7A resulting in abnormal neuronal arborization and myelination, pathologic electrical activity and epilepsy as early as months after birth36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cellular redox environment is controlled by multiple components including glutathione, cysteine, NADPH, thioredoxin and other redox-active molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These redox nodes are chemically and spatially independent from one another37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous data have suggested that the production of ROS increases with differentiation in hematopoietic cells38 and colonic epithelial cells39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations may appear inconsistent with our findings showing increased reduction of glutathione.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, higher levels of ROS may not necessarily increase oxidation of glutathione, because the redox status of cytosolic glutathione pair depends on many factors (the rate of production and subcellular location of ROS, SOD1 activity, glutathione peroxidase activity, glutathione synthesis, glutathione transport and other factors).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Physiologic oxidants such as H2O2 act as potent stimulators of cellular energy production40, and it is possible that increased ROS levels may be balanced by enhanced reduction of NADPH/NADP+ pair and/or glutathione pair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such relationship is seen in cancer cells, which have high ROS production along with high-antioxidant capacity41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, neurons transiently produce nitric oxide42 and maintenance of its antioxidant capacity depends on pentose-phosphate pathway, where glucose is metabolized to generate NADPH for converting oxidized glutathione to the reduced state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supporting this possibility, NADPH level as well as NADPH/NADP+ ratio are indeed significantly elevated upon differentiation in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig 4h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Quantitative analysis of individual redox nodes in animal models has been technically challenging, especially because the redox status of subcellular compartments such as ER, mitochondoria and cytosol differs significantly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the milestone work by Gutsher et al.26, Grx1-roGFP2 was designed to specifically report status of glutathione pair within specific compartments and probe real-time redox changes during starvation, mitochondrial depolarization and immune response in cultured mammalian cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate utility of cytosolic Grx1-roGFP2 for studies in neuronal cells in the developing spinal cord.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experiments identified variations in the redox status of cytosolic glutathione that appear to correlate with neuronal differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, motor neurons at the later HH stage 23 showed more reduced cytosolic environment compared with cells at the HH stage 20 embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cultured cells, we observed analogous variation in the redox status of proliferating cells and a uniform glutathione reduction following BDNF treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies in other cell types demonstrated correlation between the glutathione level and cell cycle progression43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In CHO cells, progression from the G1 to G2/M phase is associated with an increase in the cellular GSH level, potentially providing optimal redox environment for oxidation-sensitive proteins activated in the G2/M phase44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar conclusion was made for A549 lung carcinoma cell line43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that the observed redox variability in proliferating cells (neuroprogenitors) reflects the cell cycle phase-dependent oscillations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neuroblastoma and neuroprogenitors are actively cycling cells, while differentiated neurons are quiescent (arrested in G0) perhaps explaining why non-differentiated cells showed higher degree of cell-to-cell redox variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference in cellular GSH:GSSG ratio may underlie a preferential cytotoxic effect of the redox modulator BCNU towards rapidly growing glioblastomas45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Better understanding of cellular redox nodes in normal growth and differentiation may yield novel approaches to control cell cycle progression.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
