Quantitative interaction mapping reveals an extended UBX domain in ASPL that disrupts functional p97 hexamers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Interaction mapping is a powerful strategy to elucidate the biological function of protein assemblies and their regulators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report the generation of a quantitative interaction network, directly linking 14 human proteins to the AAA+ ATPase p97, an essential hexameric protein with multiple cellular functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the high-affinity interacting protein ASPL efficiently promotes p97 hexamer disassembly, resulting in the formation of stable p97:ASPL heterotetramers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-resolution structural and biochemical studies indicate that an extended UBX domain (eUBX) in ASPL is critical for p97 hexamer disassembly and facilitates the assembly of p97:ASPL heterotetramers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This spontaneous process is accompanied by a reorientation of the D2 ATPase domain in p97 and a loss of its activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we demonstrate that overproduction of ASPL disrupts p97 hexamer function in ERAD and that engineered eUBX polypeptides can induce cell death, providing a rationale for developing anti-cancer polypeptide inhibitors that may target p97 activity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Most biological processes are controlled by dynamic proteinprotein interactions (PPIs), which form molecular networks of enormous complexity1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several methods for the identification and characterization of PPIs have been developed, and some have been applied in large-scale studies3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these, the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system has been particularly attractive for PPI screening because binary interactions can be systematically and rapidly tested in an automated process at relatively low cost7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Y2H PPI data, however, are qualitative and do not provide information on interactions strength9, which is important for a better understanding of the cellular organization of proteins and the regulation of complex biological systems like signal transduction or gene expression10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recently, luminescence-based PPI mapping technologies such as LUMIER with BACON11,12 or DULIP13 have been established, which provide quantitative information about the association of proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distinction between weak and strong interactions allows now the generation of quantitative interaction networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is very useful for the prioritization of PPIs for focused functional validation and for the identification of proteins that might be able to disrupt protein complexes14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through the generation of a comprehensive quantitative chaperone interaction network, for example, the architecture of cellular protein homoeostasis pathways was elucidated15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The AAA+ ATPase p97, also known as VCP (valosin-containing protein) in mammals or Cdc48 in yeast, is a homohexameric ring-shaped molecular machine that together with partner proteins controls a plethora of essential cellular processes such as ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation16, maintenance of quality control17 or homotypic membrane fusion18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It comprises four domains: a flexible N-terminal domain (N), two AAA+ ATPase domains (D1 and D2) and an unstructured C-terminal tail19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  p97 is an essential protein, with orthologues in archaea and all eukaryotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also highly relevant to disease, as it is mutated in familial cases of inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget disease of the bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) and in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is increasing evidence that p97 is critical for proliferation of cancer cells23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  p97 hexamers, therefore, are a target for cancer therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small molecules inhibiting p97 ATPase activity have recently been identified24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A large number of p97 interaction partners have been identified with proteomics methods and biochemical assays25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This includes 13 ubiquitin regulatory X (UBX) domain-containing proteins that commonly interact with the conserved N domain27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This domain is positioned at the periphery of p97 hexamers and acts as an allosteric regulator of ATPase activity28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Partners binding to it with high affinity might control p97 function by influencing its ATPase activity29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Information about the binding strengths of most known p97 interacting proteins is, however, not available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To identify high-affinity binders, we decided to generate a quantitative p97 interaction map, involving automated Y2H screening followed by systematic validation of identified interactions in a dual luminescence-based co-immunoprecipitation (DULIP) assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discovered 12 high-confidence p97 interaction partners, four of which had been reported previously, including the UBX domain-containing protein ASPL (alveolar soft part sarcoma locus), which showed the highest binding strength in DULIP assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biochemical and structural studies revealed that a C-terminal fragment of ASPL is necessary and sufficient for p97 binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fragment causes efficient p97 hexamer disassembly and spontaneous formation of a heterotetrameric p97:ASPL protein complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, overproduction of ASPL caused disruption of functional p97 hexamers in cell models and blockage of ERAD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we showed that engineered ASPL-derived polypeptides can potently inhibit cell growth, suggesting that such molecules may be suitable as anti-cancer treatments.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Identification of p97 interacting proteins', 'We applied an automated yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system4 to identify p97 interaction partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eight MATa yeast strains producing non-autoactivating p97 fragments (Supplementary Fig 1a) were pooled and mated on YPD agar plates with 16,000 MAT yeast strains expressing human prey proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interacting bait and prey proteins were finally identified through growth assays on selective agar plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To increase our sampling the prey library was screened four times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, potential PPIs were tested pair wise in 46 independent mating experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only pairs tested positive at least three times were considered as positive interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interaction mating approach revealed 14 unique p97 partner proteins, 6 (43%) of which have been reported previously (Fig 1a,b, and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: A quantitative p97

uncharacterized proteins such as UBXD4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of identified proteins interact with the N-terminus of p97 (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This region contains the N domain, which has been shown to be critical for recruiting many adaptor proteins30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, four UBX domain-containing proteins were identified that interact with N-terminal p97 fragments, confirming previously reported observations16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, several p97 interactors with a functional role in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation pathways were revealed (Supplementary Fig 1b), supporting previous observations that p97 and its partners play a critical role in these processes30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'DULIP-based ranking of p97 interacting proteins', 'To validate Y2H PPIs, a DULIP assay was applied, providing quantitative interaction information13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We systematically examined the interactions between protein-A-Renilla luciferase (PA-RL)-tagged fusion proteins and firefly luciferase (FL)-tagged fusion proteins in HEK293 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through quantification of luciferase activities of precipitated protein complexes, background-corrected normalized interaction ratios (cNIRs) were calculated for all tested interactions (Fig 1c and Supplementary Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These ratios are an indication of interaction strength, allowing the distinction of potentially high from low affinity interactions13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a stringent cNIR cutoff of 3 to define DULIP-positive PPIs13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions 12 out of 14 (86%) tested Y2H interactions could be reproduced in DULIP assays with full-length p97 as a bait.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cNIRs varied over a range of 750-fold, suggesting that proteins interact with p97 with very different binding strengths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cNIRs ranked the UBX domain-containing ASPL (Supplementary Fig 1d) as the strongest p97 binder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To substantiate this result, we finally employed biolayer interferometry (BLI)31 measurements to determine the binding affinity between purified His-tagged full-length ASPL and p97 (Supplementary Fig 1e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interaction between the full-length proteins was confirmed to be very strong with a dissociation constant (KD) of2 nM (Supplementary Fig 1f), supporting our results with the DULIP assays (Fig 1c and Supplementary Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we selected the interaction between ASPL and p97 for more detailed characterization with biochemical and structural methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'ASPL binding to p97 involves an extended UBX domain', 'First, we assessed whether ASPL and p97 form a protein complex under physiological conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that p97 was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated by anti-ASPL antibodies from human post-mortem brain protein extract, but not by control antibodies or beads alone (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result was also confirmed when an anti-p97 antibody was utilized for co-immunoprecipitation (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we defined the binding regions that are critical for the interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first generated deletion fragments for ASPL and systematically investigated whether they associate with full-length p97 in DULIP assays (Supplementary Fig 2bc).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As UBX domains in adaptor proteins have been shown to be critical for their interaction with p97 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32), we assumed this to be the case also for ASPL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, cell-based PPI mapping revealed that the conserved UBX domain of ASPL (residues 377462) alone does not interact with p97.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, an extended UBX (eUBX) domain-containing fragment (residues 313553)termed ASPL-Cshowed strong binding to p97 (Fig 2b and Supplementary Fig 2c), indicating that amino acid residues located up- and downstream of the UBX domain are critical for the interaction with p97.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation was independently verified by co-immunoprecipitations of V5-tagged

in p97 with DULIP assays (Supplementary Fig 2d), revealing a relatively weak interaction between full-length ASPL and the N domain of p97 (aa 1208).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a stronger PPI was observed with the N-terminal p97-ND1 fragment (residues 1480), which includes the N domain and the conserved D1 ATPase domain, indicating that both domains are critical for strong ASPL binding.

hexamers33, suggesting that they might also influence the interaction between ASPL and p97.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GST pull-down assays showed that ATP, ADP or AMP-PNP do not significantly influence the binding of GST-ASPL-C to full-length p97 (Supplementary Fig 3c), supporting the view that both proteins form a very stable complex in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'ASPL-C converts p97 hexamers into

presence of increasing concentrations of ASPL-C while two lower molecular weight protein bands migrating at 230 and 480 kDa were detectable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that ASPL-C binding promotes the conversion of p97 hexamers into smaller p97:ASPL-C heterooligomers (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis by mass spectrometry revealed that these protein bands contain both p97 and ASPL-C polypeptides, supporting this hypothesis (Supplementary Fig 4a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In strong contrast, heterooligomeric p97:ASPL-C protein complexes were not detectable when samples were analysed by

(350 kDa) (Fig 5a and Supplementary Fig 8a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further strengthened these findings by providing additional experimental evidence with size-exclusion chromatography studies.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this study, we applied a two-step interaction mapping approach including automated Y2H screening and systematic validation of binary PPIs with a DULIP assay to identify high-affinity interaction partners for the AAA+ ATPase p97.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  p97 is a hexameric molecular machine that carries out diverse cellular functions in association with partner proteins30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among others, p97 was shown to play a critical role in the degradation of misfolded proteins and to be involved in cellular processes such as Golgi membrane assembly47 or autophagosome formation16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple partner and adaptor proteins of p97 have been identified with a variety of techniques25,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, detailed information on binding affinities or mechanisms is mostly missing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This information is of particular importance as previous investigations with p97 interactors indicate that they bind sequentially to specific domains in p97 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  49), suggesting that high-affinity binders could displace other proteins from p97 hexamers and thereby influence their specific cellular functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Through our quantitative PPI mapping approach, we were able to rank the initially identified p97 interaction partners based on normalized interaction ratios (NIRs), an indicator of interaction strength13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis revealed that among 14 proteins identified in Y2H assays, the UBX domain-containing protein ASPL binds most strongly to p97 (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interaction between ASPL and p97 has been reported previously25,50, information on interaction strength and whether the association with ASPL is stronger or weaker than other p97 interactions is unavailable, however.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evaluating our quantitative interaction data (Fig 1c), we could group the identified p97 interaction partners according to their NIRs and define potential hierarchies among them that might be of relevance for a better understanding of p97 function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous studies indicate that binding of ASPL or its orthologues to p97 promotes hexamer disassembly51,52,53, suggesting that the protein functions as a regulator of p97 ATPase activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our investigations of the interaction using biochemical and high-resolution structural methods support this view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond previous findings, we could demonstrate that a C-terminal ASPL fragment harbouring an eUBX domain and an -helical lariat are necessary and sufficient for the dissociation of p97 hexamers as well as the inhibition of ATPase activity (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, we also found that ASPL-C-mediated hexamer disassembly causes the formation of stable p97:ASPL-C heterotetramers with a compact globular structure in cell-free assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This leads to the question of how the C-terminal fragments ASPL-C or ASPL-C (Fig 2b) promote p97 hexamer disassembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our biochemical and structural studies suggest that the eUBX domain, which contacts the N domain in p97 through a conserved cis-Pro touch-turn motif, is important for the initial association with p97 hexamers, while the -helical lariat structure is critical for hexamer dissociation (Fig 3b,c and Supplementary Figs 5 and 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, both subdomains of ASPL-C or ASPL-C cooperate to target and disassemble p97 hexamers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the importance of UBX domains in adaptor proteins for binding p97 hexamers is well documented26,32, an -helical lariat structure that promotes hexamer disassembly has not been described previously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our structural investigations suggest that the -helical lariat in ASPL is a flexible structure that directly targets the D1:D1 interprotomer interface in p97 hexamers (Supplementary Fig 5c), a region crucial for oligomer stability35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interaction subsequently promotes the dissociation of p97 hexamers into ASPL-C-bound protomers, which spontaneously assemble into stable p97:ASPL-C heterotetramers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, our structural studies revealed that the formation of p97:ASPL-C heterotetramers is accompanied by a reorientation of the D2 ATPase domain (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that this relocation of the D2 domain is critical for the assembly of stable p97:ASPL-C heterotetramers and the inhibition of ATPase activity (Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A mechanistic model outlining the potential steps of the ASPL-C-mediated p97 hexamer disassembly and the heterotetramer re-assembly process is shown in Fig 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Structure-based model for the disassembly of p97 hexamers through the interaction with ASPL-C.ASPL-C-mediated disassembly of p97 hexamers is a multistep process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first step, ASPL-C docks onto the p97 surface via its cis-Pro touch-turn motif that is conserved in the eUBX domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, the ASPL-C helical lariat disrupts the association of p97 protomers by targeting the D1 ring and binding to the p97 Na subdomain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This results in the generation of six metastable p97:ASPL-C heterodimer units, which rapidly re-assemble into stable heterotetramers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concomitantly, the D2 domain in p97 undergoes a 140° rotation from a closed to an open conformation, preventing the re-association of protomers into p97 hexamers.Full size image', 'Based on these results, we primarily addressed the question of whether ASPL-derived fragments can be utilized as specific inhibitors to perturb p97 hexamer function in cell model systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  p97 is an essential protein and conserved across all eukaryotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it was shown that p97 is involved in the development of various cancers23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A specific inhibitor of the protein would be a highly relevant tool to investigate its diverse functional roles and to evaluate its potential as a therapeutic target in human disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that both overexpression of ASPL and the addition of a cell-permeable truncated ASPL fragment efficiently induces death of mammalian cells (Fig 5fi and Supplementary Fig 10a,b), indicating that ASPL-derived polypeptides are potent inhibitors of p97 function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overproduction of ASPL in cells was associated with inhibition of ERAD and mobilization of executioner caspases 3 and 7 (Fig 5ce), suggesting that high levels of ASPL induce cellular toxicity through inhibition of p97-dependent protein degradation pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our investigations are in good agreement with studies of the small-molecule inhibitors of p97 such as DBeQ and CB-5083, which were shown to potently inhibit cancer cell growth, block ERAD and activate executioner caspases43,44,54,55,56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings provide a rationale for targeting the N and D1 domains in p97, thereby disrupting the hexamer structure and inhibiting the ATPase activity of p97.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the high-resolution structures we describe, we envision that highly specific therapeutic molecules should be designed that directly target p97 hexamers and inhibit their function in cancer cells.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
