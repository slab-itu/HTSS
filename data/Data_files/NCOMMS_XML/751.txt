Structural basis of ligand interaction with atypical chemokine receptor 3  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Chemokines drive cell migration through their interactions with seven-transmembrane (7TM) chemokine receptors on cell surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3) binds chemokines CXCL11 and CXCL12 and signals exclusively through -arrestin-mediated pathways, without activating canonical G-protein signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This receptor is upregulated in numerous cancers making it a potential drug target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we collected over 100 distinct structural probes from radiolytic footprinting, disulfide trapping, and mutagenesis to map the structures of ACKR3:CXCL12 and ACKR3:small-molecule complexes, including dynamic regions that proved unresolvable by X-ray crystallography in homologous receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data are integrated with molecular modelling to produce complete and cohesive experimentally driven models that confirm and expand on the existing knowledge of the architecture of receptor:chemokine and receptor:small-molecule complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we detected and characterized ligand-induced conformational changes in the transmembrane and intracellular regions of ACKR3 that elucidate fundamental structural elements of agonism in this atypical receptor.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Positional control of cell movement plays a crucial role in development, the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system and regulation of a number of other physiological functions such as angiogenesis and wound repair1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Guidance cues are provided by small globular chemoattractant proteins called chemokines that accumulate in gradients on cell surfaces and the extracellular matrix and are interpreted as directional signals by chemokine receptors on migrating cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most chemokine receptors are seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that activate Gi-dependent intracellular pathways in response to chemokine binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a few chemokine receptors signal via other mechanisms and are therefore referred to as atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs)2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'ACKR3 (also known as CXCR7) is an atypical receptor that binds chemokines CXCL11 (a.k.a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ITAC, shared with CXCR3) and CXCL12 (a.k.a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SDF-1, shared with CXCR4)3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It does not couple to G proteins but signals through alternate pathways including -arrestins4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ACKR3 expression is upregulated in several cancers and the associated tumor vasculature5 where it cooperates with CXCR4, a receptor heavily implicated in cancer growth and metastasis6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there have been contradictory reports where ACKR3 enhances CXCR4-mediated metastasis and others where it inhibits CXCR4 (refs 5, 7), emerging evidence suggests that it can signal through -arrestin to ERK1/2, AKT and other pathways to promote tumor migration and survival as well as the survival and self-renewal of cancer stem cells8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to its unusual signalling properties, ACKR3 also acts as a scavenger of extracellular CXCL12 to establish chemokine levels that maintain cellular responsiveness by preventing excessive desensitization and downregulation of CXCR4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, ACKR3-expressing cells in a primary breast tumor enhanced the metastasis of CXCR4-expressing breast cancer cells9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, scavenging of CXCL12 by ACKR3 has been shown to maintain CXCR4 responsiveness in migrating cortical interneurons10 and the lateral line primordium of zebrafish11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, pharmacological inhibition of ACKR3 has been shown to cause pronounced increases in plasma CXCL12 levels9 with associated impairment of leukocyte migration towards CXCL12, likely because of CXCR4 downregulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These and other studies suggest that ACKR3 may be a good therapeutic target for cancer12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this concept, short interfering RNA, small molecules and nanobodies against ACKR3 have been shown to slow cancer progression through effects on proliferation, survival signalling, metastasis and angiogenesis12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Crystal structures have been determined for chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 in complex with small molecules and, more recently, for CXCR4 in complex with the viral chemokine vMIP-II and for US28 in complex with human CX3CL1 (refs 14, 15, 16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, despite its promise as a therapeutic target, there is currently minimal structural data for ACKR3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is not surprising as the structural biology of seven transmembrane (7TM) receptors remains challenging due to their inherent flexibility and low stability, their limited surface area for forming crystal contacts, the need for slow off-rate ligands for crystallization and many other technical hurdles18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we produce stable complexes between ACKR3 and CXCL12 as well as the small-molecule partial agonist CCX777.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radiolytic footprinting, disulfide trapping and mutagenesis approaches are combined to map the ligand interaction interfaces and the effects of ligand binding on the structure of ACKR3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a total of 100 probes located throughout the ACKR3 and CXCL12 sequences, we identify interaction sites between ACKR3 and these ligands as well as conformational changes in the transmembrane helical domain of ACKR3 that are linked to activation of the receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we utilize experimentally guided homology modelling to produce models of ACKR3:CXCL12 and ACKR3:CCX777 complexes that reveal insights into receptor:ligand recognition and may guide drug discovery efforts.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Characterization of ACKR3 ligand pharmacology', 'To probe the structure and ligand interactions of ACKR3, we characterized ACKR3 in complex with two different ligands, the chemokine CXCL12 and the small-molecule CCX777.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CXCL12 is a known agonist of -arrestin signalling4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the pharmacological response of ACKR3 to CCX777 has not been characterized, although similar synthetic ligands are known to induce -arrestin recruitment19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare the functional responses of ACKR3 to CCX777 and CXCL12, we utilized a -arrestin recruitment assay based on bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ACKR3 fused to Renilla luciferase 3 (ACKR3-Rluc3) was transiently transfected into HEK293 cells stably expressing -arrestin-2 fused to green fluorescent protein 10 (GFP10) and recruitment of -arrestin-2 was measured as an increase in BRET after stimulation with ligand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Doseresponse curves show that CCX777 acts as a partial agonist of -arrestin-2 recruitment to ACKR3 with an efficacy of 52±7% and a fourfold lower potency (33±6 versus 8.5±1.3 nM) than CXCL12 (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a functional perspective ACKR3:CXCL12 therefore represents a complex that is biased towards a more active receptor conformation than the partially active ACKR3:CCX777 complex, allowing comparison of the differences between the two conformations by radiolytic footprinting (described below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Functional characterization of CXCL12 and CCX777.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Doseresponse curves of -arrestin-2-GFP10 recruitment to ACKR3-Rluc3 in HEK293 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Curves are representative of 10 independent experiments and error bars represent standard errors of the mean of three replicates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b, c) pEC50 and Emax values determined as the average and standard error of the mean of 10 independent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emax values were determined as the difference between the start and end values of doseresponse curves and were normalized to CXCL12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CCX777 has lower Emax and pEC50 than CXCL12 as determined from two-sided, unpaired t-test with P=0.002 and P less_than 0.0001, respectively.Full size image', 'Production of stable ACKR3 complexes with ligands', 'To produce an ACKR3:CXCL12 complex, receptor and chemokine were coexpressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells and the complex was purified in n-dodecyl -D-maltoside/cholesteryl hemisuccinate (DDM/CHS) using affinity chromatography (Fig 2a and Supplementary Fig 7)20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To form a complex between ACKR3 and the small-molecule ligand CCX777, Sf9 membranes expressing ACKR3 were incubated with a large excess of CCX777 before purification (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to other 7TM receptors, ACKR3 is unstable in the absence of ligand, which makes experiments with apo receptor impossible (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, ACKR3:CXCL12 and ACKR3:CCX777 complexes are monodisperse and stable with unfolding midpoints of 60 °C as determined by analytical size-exclusion chromatography (SEC; Fig 2b) and thermal unfolding experiments21 (Fig 2c), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These complexes are suitable for mapping binding interfaces and conformational changes by radiolytic oxidation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Characterization of ACKR3 complexes in DDM/CHS micelles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) A strong band corresponding to monomeric ACKR3 and a minor band corresponding to dimeric receptor can be seen on a 10% SDSPAGE gel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A lower molecular weight band corresponding to CXCL12 is seen only for the ACKR3:CXCL12 complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A full, uncropped version of the gel is shown in Supplementary Fig 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) SEC trace of ACKR3 in complex with CXCL12 and CCX777.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sharp peak eluting at 2.8 ml shows that both samples are monodisperse in DDM/CHS micelles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Thermal unfolding of ACKR3 complexes using CPM fluorescence21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tm values were 59 and 61 °C for ACKR3:CCX777 and ACKR3:CXCL12 complexes, respectively.Full size image', 'Binding interfaces mapped by radiolytic footprinting', 'Radiolytic protein footprinting is a structural mass spectrometry (MS) technique where synchrotron radiation is used to generate hydroxyl radicals that covalently modify side chains proximal to either bulk solvent or structural water molecules22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting mass shifts related to specific peptide side-chain oxidations can be detected using protease digestion in combination with tandem MS. As the rate of radiolytic oxidation of a side chain is proportional to its solvent exposure, the technique can be used to map interaction interfaces as sets of residues that are buried upon complex formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method can also report on conformational transitions that change the exposure of individual residues to bulk solvent or their interaction with structural waters23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this work, we measured residue oxidation rates of three samples: CXCL12 alone, ACKR3:CXCL12 and ACKR3:CCX777.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteolytic digestion of oxidized CXCL12 samples yielded 11 peptides that covered 87% of the sequence (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For ACKR3:CCX777 and ACKR3:CXCL12 complexes, digestion with pepsin yielded 337 unique peptides covering 100% of ACKR3 (Supplementary Fig 2b), while digestion with a combination of trypsin and AspN gave 28 peptides and 51% sequence coverage (Supplementary Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these peptides, oxidation rates were determined, providing discrete readouts for 62 and 25 unique sites on ACKR3 and CXCL12, respectively (see Supplementary Fig 3 for representative doseresponse plots and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 for oxidation rates of specific residues); these data represent a total sequence coverage and structural mapping by MS that by far exceeds what has been previously achieved for any 7TM receptor complex23,24,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Nearly all of the measured oxidation rates for CXCL12 are decreased on binding to ACKR3 (Fig 3a and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To interpret this observation in a structural context, we converted the oxidation rates for side chains exhibiting +16 Da oxidations in free CXCL12 into protection factors (PFs) using residue-specific coefficients of oxidation propensity27 (see Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The natural logarithms of the measured PFs inversely correlate (R=0.74) with the solvent-accessible surface areas (SASAs) calculated from the CXCL12 X-ray structure28 (Fig 3b), confirming that the oxidation rates reliably report on residue bulk solvent exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this linear correlation and ln PF values for ACKR3-bound CXCL12, we then predicted the SASA values (and fractional SASA (fSASA) values) for CXCL12 in the context of the ACKR3:CXCL12 complex27,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis shows that when in complex with the receptor, most chemokine residue SASA values (of those calculated) are significantly lower than for CXCL12 alone (Fig 3c,d), with the largest changes concentrated in the chemokine N terminus (where most probe residues become entirely buried).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other significant changes involve residues F13/F14, H17, V18, R20 (the so-called N-loop), residues P32 and C34 in the 30s loop, E60, Y61 and L62 in the C-helix, Q37/Q38 and V39 in the 2 strand and residues I28 and L29 in the 1 strand (that facilitates dimerization of CXCL12 when it is alone in solution30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data reveal an extensive receptor:chemokine interaction interface, with multiple receptor elements essentially wrapping around the chemokine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

cannot be carried out for a receptor for which no definitive structural information is available and for which many of the oxidation sites are buried in the transmembrane region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we performed a relative comparison by calculating the ratios of rates for all detected species between the chemokine and the small-molecule bound states of ACKR3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As demonstrated by Fig 4 (see also Supplementary Fig 4 and Supplementary Table 2), a number of N-terminal residues of the receptor (including L3, L5, I27 and V28), as well as residues in ECL2 (Y195, V186 and H203) are protected by CXCL12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are consistent with previous mutagenesis studies showing that mutations in ECL2 of ACKR3 lead to reduced potency of CXCL12-induced -arrestin-2 recruitment31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison with the protection of CXCL12, the reductions of oxidation rates in the receptor N terminus upon binding the chemokine are modest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can likely be explained by the N terminus being partially folded and therefore protected from solvent even in the ACKR3:CCX777 sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Corroborating this hypothesis, the oxidation rates of the ACKR3 N terminus are lower than what would be expected for an unfolded peptide27 (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the greater protection of residues in the extracellular domains by CXCL12 than CCX777, multiple residues in the transmembrane region are more protected in the CCX777 complex than in the CXCL12 complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Radiolytic footprinting

to involve two main interaction sites referred to as chemokine recognition sites (CRS) 1 and 2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CRS1 includes interactions between the N terminus of the receptor and the globular core of the chemokine, while CRS2 interactions involve the N-terminal signalling domain of the chemokine and the transmembrane (orthosteric) binding pocket of the receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a small-molecule ligand, CCX777 is expected to occupy the orthosteric ligand-binding pocket of ACKR3, and overlap the chemokine N terminus in the CRS2 region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in the absence of an apo receptor sample, ACKR3:CCX777 mimics a chemokine-free receptor in the CRS1 region (which enables characterization of CRS1 interactions between CXCL12 and ACKR3), while simultaneously allowing for comparison of small molecule and chemokine binding in CRS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed oxidation rate changes are in perfect agreement with this model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the changes in oxidation rates of numerous TM domain and intracellular residues upon full agonist (chemokine) binding as compared to partial agonist (small-molecule) binding is expected to report on the conformational differences that the receptor undergoes on activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Pairwise residue proximities probed by cysteine trapping', 'Radiolytic footprinting identifies individual residues that are part of interaction interfaces, but it does not report on pairwise interaction geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain such pairwise information, we probed interactions between ACKR3 and CXCL12 using disulfide trapping, as previously described for other receptor:chemokine complexes14,32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this technique, strategically designed Cys mutations are individually introduced into the receptor and chemokine of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the Cys residues are proximal and adopt a favourable geometry in the complex, they spontaneously form a disulfide bond, and the resulting irreversible complex can be identified using SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) and western blots of purified samples; moreover, the ratio of complexed to uncomplexed receptor provides an indication of the efficiency of the crosslink.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Assuming that the general concept of CRS1/2 receptor:chemokine interactions applies to the ACKR3:CXCL12 complex, we hypothesized that protection of ECL2 of ACKR3 was partly due to CRS2 interactions with the N terminus of CXCL12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 5ac shows that a specific cysteine mutation (R197C) in ECL2 of ACKR3 crosslinks to residues in the N terminus of CXCL12, and that the most efficient crosslink is formed with Y7C of CXCL12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While some crosslinking may be nonspecific and not representative of the final bound states, this mutant produced almost 100% disulfide-trapped complex when coexpressed with R197C-ACKR3, suggesting high compatibility with the preferred interaction geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thermal unfolding experiments show that of all crosslinked complexes, R197C-ACKR3:Y7C-CXCL12 is the most stable complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its stability exceeds that of non-covalent R197-ACKR3:CXCL12 by 20 °C, which indicates that it is the best mimic of the native ACKR3:CXCL12 geometry (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although in radiolytic footprinting experiments, no oxidation rates could be measured directly for R197 (Arg does not oxidize efficiently27), the observed strong protection of the neighbouring Y195 and partial protection of F199 are consistent with this pairwise interaction; similarly, earlier mutagenesis experiments also support the role of R197 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, contacts between Y7 of CXCL12 and ECL2 of ACKR3 would orient the preceding residues of the CXCL12 N terminus into the orthosteric pocket of ACKR3 to trigger signalling, consistent with expectations from the CRS1/2

radiolytic footprinting and disulfide-trap mapping of ACKR3:ligand interaction determinants, we introduced single Ala mutations and analysed their effects on the potency and efficacy of ACKR3

W2085.34 are protected by CCX777 as compared to CXCL12 in the radiolytic footprinting experiments (Fig 4) and they are the only two residues that are protected among the 12 mutated sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, mutation of M2125.38 on TM5 has no effect on -arrestin-2 recruitment, which is also consistent with this residue being oxidized but not protected by compound or chemokine

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this study, we investigate the structural basis of the interaction between ACKR3 and its endogenous chemokine agonist, CXCL12, as well as with the small-molecule partial agonist, CCX777, using a synergistic combination of radiolytic footprinting, disulfide trapping, mutagenesis, functional experiments and molecular modelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The models and experimental data reveal both similarities and unique features of ACKR3 compared to G-protein-coupled chemokine receptors14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The proposed ACKR3:CXCL12 model is consistent with common interaction architecture proposed for all/most receptor:chemokine complexes and involves two main interaction epitopes: (i) CRS1 where the N terminus of the receptor binds to the N-loop and 40s-loop of the chemokine and (ii) CRS2 where the N terminus of the chemokine interacts with ECL2 and the TM domain pocket of receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to confirming this architecture, the recent crystal structures of CXCR4:vMIP-II and US28:CX3CL1 highlighted an unexpected intermediate region that we termed CRS1.514; it involves the formation of an antiparallel -sheet between the proximal N termini and the conserved cysteines of the receptor and the chemokine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although chemokines bind their receptors as monomers, they oligomerize48, and interestingly, the CRS1.5 interface mimics the oligomerization interfaces of CC and CX3C chemokines49,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CXC chemokines, on the other hand, dimerize through interactions involving the 1 strand, forming a six-stranded antiparallel -sheet (Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, radiolytic footprinting confirms that residues L3 and L5 of the ACKR3 N terminus and residues I28 and L29 in the 1 strand of CXCL12 are protected, and modelling suggests that they form an antiparallel -sheet interaction that mimics the CXCL12 dimer interface (Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These interactions, referred herein as CRS0.5, are likely present in other CXC receptor:chemokine complexes but the dynamic nature of the receptor N terminus may make their detection in crystal structures rather challenging14,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For different CXC receptor:chemokine pairs, interactions in this region can explain a number of experimental observations that could not be explained by previous structures and models: (i) cross-saturation NMR experiments suggested that the 1 strand of CXCL12 is in close proximity to the CXCR4 N terminus51, (ii) truncation of residues 29 of CXCR4 affects both CXCL12 binding and activation of CXCR4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  52, iii) D10 is critical for CXCL12-induced activation of CXCR4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  53, iv) sulfation of residues Y7 and Y12 of CXCR4 affects CXCL12-induced signalling54, (v) nuclear Overhauser effects have been measured in this region between CXCL12 and a peptide corresponding to residues 138 of the CXCR4 N terminus55, (vi) mutation of CXCR2 residues 7 and/or 9 affects chemokine binding and signalling56 and (vii) mutations in the 1 strand of CXCL8 reduce its affinity for CXCR1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our detection of the CRS0.5 interactions emphasizes the need to combine diverse approaches to understand the structure and dynamics of 7TM receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radiolytic footprinting and other solution techniques such as NMR and H/D exchange can capture dynamic processes related to ligand-binding and receptor activation, making them highly complementary to the more static pictures obtained from receptor:chemokine crystal structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While possessing the conserved fold and chemokine complex architecture, ACKR3 has a number of unique features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of them is an intramolecular disulfide bridge connecting C21 and C26 in the ACKR3 N terminus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further experiments are needed to fully understand the functional importance of this disulfide but it appears highly conserved across species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two other human chemokine receptors, CXCR3 and CCR7, have pairs of Cys residues in their extracellular domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To the best of our knowledge, disulfide formation has not yet been proposed or confirmed for either of these receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in analogy with ACKR3, the Cys residues likely form a disulfide in the oxidizing extracellular environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, ACKR3 and CXCR3 both interact with the chemokine CXCL11, suggesting that the disulfide motif could be a recognition determinant for this chemokine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As an atypical receptor, ACKR3 exclusively couples to -arrestin and does not signal through G proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is despite the fact that it possesses the hallmark G-protein signalling motifs such as the DRY sequence at the end of TM3 and the NPxxY motif in TM7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, ACKR3 represents a unique system for studying the structural basis of 7TM receptor bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This study identified numerous similarities between ACKR3 and canonical GPCRs; for example, the residues in the orthosteric pocket that affect ACKR3 activation (-arrestin recruitment) are homologous to those that affect G-protein signalling in other receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we demonstrate that the conformational changes that ACKR3 undergoes on agonist binding are strikingly similar to those on activation of canonical GPCRs such as rhodopsin and -opioid receptor, which suggests that the conformational control of bias is subtle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, 19F-nuclear magnetic resonance58 studies of 2 adrenergic receptor located unique conformational changes associated with -arrestin biased signalling to the C-terminal end of TM7; this could be correlated to the increased radiolytic oxidation rates of ACKR3 TM7 residues C3087.46 and C3097.47 in the presence of CXCL12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the bias towards -arrestin signalling could be governed by other (non-conformational) mechanisms such as ligand kinetics, receptor distribution in the membrane, or post-translational modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In recent years, biased 7TM receptor ligands that preferentially activate either G proteins or -arrestin pathways gained interest as novel therapeutics59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the structural basis of biased agonism remains poorly understood, partly because the available crystal structures of G-protein- and -arrestin complexed GPCRs41,46,47 do not show any pronounced conformational differences in the receptors when compared with each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present study adds to the growing body of evidence supporting the similarity of receptor conformational changes that lead to activation of G-protein- versus -arrestin-mediated pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, as the first structural mapping of an atypical chemokine receptor and the most thorough radiolytic footprinting mapping of a 7TM receptor to date, this study dramatically expands current knowledge of the structural determinants of ligand-binding and ligand-induced signalling in chemokine and other 7TM receptors.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

and apolar surface interactions66.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chemokine N terminus (up to the second N-terminal cysteine residue) was built ab initio, its CXC motif tethered to the positions of the corresponding atoms in the template, and the N terminus thoroughly sampled in the receptor potential grids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The obtained stack of N terminus conformations was merged with the full-atom model of the receptor, and another 1020 × 106 steps of Monte Carlo optimization were performed, this time using full-atom receptor representation with flexible binding pocket side chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For receptor N-terminus refinement, the chemokine was represented as a set of 3D grid interaction potentials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The receptor N terminus (residues 134) was built ab initio, an intramolecular disulfide bond imposed (C21C26), the conserved cysteine (C34) tethered to the positions of the corresponding residue in the template and the distal N terminus (residues 26) tethered to the 1 strand of the chemokine dimer partner from the PDB 3gv3 (residues H25:L29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The N terminus was then thoroughly sampled in the chemokine potential grids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The obtained stack of conformations was merged with the full-atom model of the chemokine, and another 108 steps of Monte Carlo optimization were performed, this time using full-atom chemokine representation with flexible interface side chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For final model assembly, top-scoring conformations of receptor N terminus and the chemokine N terminus were merged with the remaining parts of both molecules into an intact complex, after which another short round of side-chain refinement was performed to remove residue clashes resulting from the merge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Compound docking was performed using full-atom-biased Monte Carlo sampling of the ligand and the receptor binding pocket side chains in internal coordinates, as implemented in ICM64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Guided by the extensive SAR of CCX777 compound series37, the acceptor centres on the quinoline and the thiazole moieties and the donor on the azepane ring were tethered to the side chains of Q301 and Y268 in two alternative orientations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rest of the compound and the surrounding binding pocket side chains were allowed to freely change their positions/conformations throughout the sampling procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four candidate stereoisomers of the compound were generated before docking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conformers of the saturated rings were sampled explicitly during docking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sampling was performed to convergence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the sampling phase, top-ranking predicted poses of the ligands were re-evaluated using full-atom representation of the receptor pocket and the ICM ligand-binding score67 and the top-scoring pose was chosen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'The sequences of
