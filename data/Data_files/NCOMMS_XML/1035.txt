Hierarchical on-surface synthesis and electronic structure of carbonyl-functionalized one- and two-dimensional covalent nanoarchitectures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The fabrication of nanostructures in a bottom-up approach from specific molecular precursors offers the opportunity to create tailored materials for applications in nanoelectronics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the formation of defect-free two-dimensional (2D) covalent networks remains a challenge, which makes it difficult to unveil their electronic structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report on the hierarchical on-surface synthesis of nearly defect-free 2D covalent architectures with carbonyl-functionalized pores on Au(111), which is investigated by low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy in combination with density functional theory calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The carbonyl-bridged triphenylamine precursors form six-membered macrocycles and one-dimensional (1D) chains as intermediates in an Ullmann-type coupling reaction that are subsequently interlinked to 2D networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electronic band gap is narrowed when going from the monomer to 1D and 2D surface-confined -conjugated organic polymers comprising the same building block.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significant drop of the electronic gap from the monomer to the polymer confirms an efficient conjugation along the triphenylamine units within the nanostructures.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'On-surface synthesis is a powerful tool to fabricate atomically defined carbon-based nanostructures in a bottom-up approach with prospective applications in molecular electronics, optoelectronics and sensor devices1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereby, the structural control is essential, because the electronic properties of these nanostructures sensitively depend on their geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The use of specifically designed organic precursors provides for on-surface synthesis of atomically precise graphene nanoribbons5,6 with tunable band gap through heteroatom-doping or by modifying their lateral size and edge termination7,8,9,10,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the growth of long-range ordered two-dimensional (2D) porous graphene in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) is still a major challenge, despite the use of various design concepts and surface reactions14,15,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bond flexibility in the molecular building blocks and the irreversibility of the newly formed CC bond prohibit an error correction during the network formation, which leads readily to equilibrium-disordered structures of limited size19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, electronic properties of bottom-up fabricated 2D networks remain experimentally widely unexplored20, despite the exciting physical properties such as a half-metallic character21 or band structures with Dirac-cone-like crossings and linear band dispersion predicted by density functional theory (DFT)22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with graphene nanoribbons, porous graphene exhibits a band gap that can be controlled by the pore size, density, functionalization and geometry25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, porous graphene promises to combine the outstanding electronic properties of graphene with a tunable band gap, which makes it more suitable than pristine graphene for many electronic and optoelectronic applications requiring gapped semiconductor materials6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mostly carbon- and nitrogen-containing26,27 2D porous polymers have been studied so far, to avoid competing interactions among the functional groups during the reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With suitable precursors, there is no inherent limitation, however, to extend the surface-assisted synthesis to more complex 2D polymers that feature functionalized pores28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The functional groups facing the pores lay the foundation to further tune the electronic properties of porous graphene networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, functionalized pores can be used to selectively bind molecules, or to track chemical reactions in a confined space for catalytic applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we present the on-surface synthesis and electronic structure of covalent macrocycles, one-dimensional (1D) chains and 2D porous networks based on Ullmann-type coupling reactions of carbonyl-bridged triphenylamines (CTPAs) with a tuned substitutional pattern on Au(111).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the hierarchical on-surface synthesis, intermediate macrocycles and 1D chains are initially fabricated that are interlinked thereafter to 2D networks of high structural quality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS) experiments reveal a narrowing of the band gap when going from the monomer to 1D and 2D surface-confined -conjugated organic polymers comprising the same building block.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First-principles DFT calculations qualitatively reproduce the electronic structure and confirm the weak coupling of the planar polymer to the surface that leads to a quasi-free-standing electronic structure.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

#@NEW_LINE#@#  The suppression of defects within the porous networks is a major advantage of this hierarchical approach and is attributed to the preceding self-assembly of the macrocycles and chains, which allows undesired structural elements to segregate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The covalent linkage of the well-ordered six-membered macrocycles leads by design to the formation of honeycomb networks: the only possible defect would be a combination of four to eight-membered ring pairs, which is, however, not observed (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of these defects is most likely a consequence of their instability due to the large strain resulting from the inherent rigidity of the CTPA moieties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pentagonal and heptagonal defects at the periphery of the porous graphene islands may be created by interlinking short chains that are present at lower reaction temperatures before the second reaction occurs in the hierarchical approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In Fig

the structure is commensurable to an optimized (6 × 6) Au(111) surface cell (the computed lattice constant a0(Au) is 2.90 Å, in good agreement with the experimental value34 of 2.88 Å).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CTPA polymer adsorbs almost planar on top of the gold surface (Fig 3e) proofing the 2D character of the polymer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest distance in z-direction to the surface is found at the central N atom (3.33 Å), whereas the O atoms are closest to the surface (3.21 Å).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean adsorption height of 3.30 Å indicates that the CTPA polymer is physisorbed on the Au(111).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The adsorption energy is 3.55 eV per monomeric unit, 70% of which are attributed to dispersive (or van der Waals) forces, supporting the physisorptive character of the interaction.

comparison between the electronic structure of bottom-up fabricated 2D polymers and their analogous 1D counterparts has so far been explored theoretically for extended -systems22,35, but has, to our knowledge, not been experimentally verified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In our STS measurements, we excluded networks with trapped halogens in the pores to avoid doping effects36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, networks with a size less than seven rings and chains shorter than eight units were neglected to exclude an interfering size dependence35 in the measured electronic properties and to ensure maximum reproducibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured peak energies in STS were found to be independent of the tip-molecule distance, indicating that there was no observable effect of the electric

The pronounced peaks at 1.96±0.03 eV and at 1.95±0.03 eV, respectively, are attributed to the HOMO and LUMO of the CTPA 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, the measured gap between the VBE and the first CB resonance scales with the dimensionality of the covalent structures: 3.14±0.04 eV (2D networks), 3.18±0.06 eV (self-assembled chains) and 3.31±0.03 eV (isolated chains).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured peak energies of the CB resonances instead of the CBEs provide indirect evidence for the band gap scaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the main features of the CB are comparable in the calculated density of states (DoS) for 1D and 2D structures, and therefore we expect the energy gaps VBECB and VBECBE to scale similar among the dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the 2D network and isolated chains, the approximate CBE onset appears at 0.82±0.05 eV and 0.86±0.06 eV, respectively, in the STS spectra (blue arrow), which results in an approximate band gap of 2.45±0.09 eV and 2.50±0.09 eV, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the HOMOLUMO gap of 3.91±0.03 eV measured for the CTPA 1 monomer is significantly larger.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can conclude from the STS measurements that the band gap decreases around 170 meV from 1D to 2D structures built from CTPA compounds and is mainly caused by a shift of the CB, whereas from the monomer to 1D chain the gap decreases by around 1.34 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decrease of the band gap from the monomer to the 2D polymer is a result of the increased effective -conjugation length, which indicates an efficient conjugation among the triphenylamine building blocks within the nanostructure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The small difference between the band gaps of 1D and 2D compared with 0D and 1D shows that the -electron delocalization length is only little increased between 1D and 2D CTPA polymers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The electronic Shockley surface state of the Au(111) substrate is observed by the steep rise in the STS spectra near 0.5 eV below the Fermi level (Fig 4b and Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The surface state persists in the dI/dV spectra above the porous 2D polymer, which indicates a weak confinement of the surface state by the covalent pores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It shifts around 130250 meV towards the Fermi level due to the modification of the work function caused by the molecular adlayer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The surface state measured in STS maps in the centre of the pore is weakly confined by the molecular network (Supplementary Fig 7), which is in accordance with the physisorbed nature of the network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Constant height dI/dV maps at energies of the observed VBE and CB states provide further insights into the localization of the states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DoS is localized at equivalent positions in both the covalently linked 2D network and 1D chains (see Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the VBE (Fig 5b,f), the homogeneously distributed DoS at the CTPA centres suggest a homogeneous electron density across the monomer backbone, whereas extended delocalization of the -electrons along the sp2-carbon framework between CTPA units is questionable due to a decreased relative intensity at the new CC bonds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DoS of the first and second resolved unoccupied band is localized beside (Fig 5c,g) and on top (Fig 5d,h) of the newly formed intermolecular CC bond, respectively, with weakened intensity at the CTPA centres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of unoccupied states at the positions of the newly formed CC bond has also been observed in previous STS experiments on covalent networks40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DoS of the CTPA 1 monomer (Fig 5j,k) matches well with the 1D and 2D structures: the HOMO is resolved in the centre of the molecule and the LUMO of the monomer is located next to the carbonyl bridges at the periphery of the carbon scaffold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the LUMOs of two neighbouring CTPA monomers hybridize upon the covalent connection, which form the unoccupied state located beside the CC bonds in the polymer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Qualitatively, no difference in the DoS has been observed in constant current and constant height dI/dV maps in accordance with the planar adsorption geometry of the polymer structures on the surface (see Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bias dependence of the STM contrast reflects as well the observed features in the STS maps (Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the location of the first unoccupied band beside the newly

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The hierarchical approach presented herein provides for structural control in the on-surface synthesis of functionalized porous 2D polymers that is less dependent on the growth kinetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using brominated macrocycles and chains as reaction intermediates constrains the defects to the rim of the formed 2D networks, leaving the properties of the covalent polymer largely preserved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The self-assembly of intermediate macrocycles and chains is essential to achieve structurally well-ordered covalent 2D networks: first, undesired structural elements segregate to the periphery of the network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the weak, non-covalent interactions among the intermediates make them structurally controllable and lead to equilibrated structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Covalent linking of macrocycles form defect-free 2D networks after the second reaction step, while chains are still susceptible to form pentagonal and heptagonal defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inevitably, 2D structures synthesized by Ullmann-type reactions are size limited due to the presence of halogens46 on the surface and the reaction conditions that reduce the diffusion of the building blocks16,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The hierarchical approach produces structurally related planar 1D chains and 2D networks that permits direct insight into the interplay between dimensionality and effective conjugation on the band gap of conjugated polymers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed decrease of the band gap with increased dimensionality is well known for inorganic nanostructures48,49; however, to our knowledge, it is shown here experimentally for the first time for organic molecular structures fabricated in a bottom-up approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decrease of the band gap and the relative shift of the frontier orbitals (stronger shift in the unoccupied states) is qualitatively in good agreement with DFT as shown here and for related dimethylmethylene-bridged triphenylamines35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The smaller reduction in the band gap energy from covalent 1D to 2D structures in comparison with the change between monomer and 1D polymer suggests that the delocalization length is increased to a smaller extent between 1D and 2D CTPA polymers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study clearly outlines the possibility of band gap engineering in 2D covalent organic structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The functionalized pores provide further tunability of the band gap in future experiments and are interesting for potential applications in electronics, sensor devices and catalysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The synthesis of triphenylamine derivatives is in this respective versatile, providing a variety of substitution possibilities to explore the tunability of band gap and hostguest interactions50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we disclosed the on-surface synthesis of macrocycles, 1D chains and 2D polymers with functionalized pores on Au(111) using Ullmann-type coupling reactions between halogen-substituted CTPAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high-resolution capability of STM to resolve the geometric and local electronic structure, in combination with DFT calculations, provides valuable details on the growth mechanism and band structure of functionalized 1D and 2D polymers on metal surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the synthesis of the twofold symmetric precursors yields well-ordered self-assemblies of six-membered macrocycles and chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The preferred hexagonal shape of the macrocycles results from the weak interaction forces between the macrocycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the hierarchical two-step synthesis using a CTPA precursor with a tuned substitutional pattern facilitates the fabrication of structurally well-defined 2D polymers consisting of prevalent six-membered pores with five- and seven-membered defects located solely at the periphery of the islands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, the covalent character of the 1D and 2D polymers is clearly identified in the dI/dV and DoS maps: the valence band reveals an extended conjugation of the -electrons along the molecule backbone and localized unfilled states of the CBs are found at the newly formed CC bond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electronic band gap was decreased by the increased dimensionality changing from the monomers to structurally related chains and network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The change in the gap is comparably larger from the monomer to the 1D polymer than from the 1D to the 2D system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Last, the functionalized pores show a remarkable combination of structural, chemical and electronic properties, which makes them particularly attractive for hostguest chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The respective studies are currently being pursued in our laboratories and will be published elsewhere.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
