Magnetic routing of light-induced waveguides  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Among photofunctional materials that can be employed to control the propagation of light by modifying their properties, soft dielectrics such as nematic liquid crystals (NLCs) stand out for their large all-optical response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through reorientation, the molecular distribution of NLCs can be modified by the electric field of light, permitting functional operations and supporting self-localized light beams or spatial optical solitons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, the generation and routing of such solitons have been limited by the boundary conditions employed to tailor the properties of NLCs in planar cells or capillaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report on spatial solitons in bulk NLCs with no lateral anchoring, where the application of an external magnetic field effectively controls the direction of propagation and the angular steering of the self-trapped wavepackets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results entail a completely new approach to the routing of self-localized beams and light-induced waveguides in three dimensions, without the usual limitations imposed by transverse boundary conditions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The main interest in practical applications of optical spatial solitons is caused by their ability to serve as light-induced channels for optical information and, therefore, as basic elements for all-optical signal processing1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter requires soliton waveguides to be reconfigurable in space by modifying the soliton trajectories through external stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Developing efficient strategies to achieve such control is one of the challenges in nonlinear optics4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, the control of soliton trajectories has been achieved only over small steering angles in bulk solid-state media, such as photorefractive crystals5,6, or in specific planar geometries in soft matter, such as liquid crystals7,8,9,10,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photorefractive crystals allow for varying soliton path, but are rather expensive, require usage of high voltages and have relatively long relaxation times5,6,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, liquid crystals are affordable and efficient because of their unique sensitivity to lightmatter interactions15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The key to such sensitivity is the organization of nematic liquid crystal (NLC) anisotropic molecules, providing a reorientational response to the electric field of incident light16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ensuing nonlinearity and the formation of spatial solitons normally require appropriate molecular alignment at the boundaries, with a well-defined orientation of the optical axis8,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the steering of spatial solitons in NLCs, so-called nematicons7, has been limited by cell geometries, such as hollow channels18 or planar cells with an NLC layer, typically 0.1 mm or less in thickness8,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most notable experimental results in nematicon steering have been reported in planar configurations9,20,21,22, whereby molecular orientation is defined by anchoring on the cell glass/NLC interfaces19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In planar cells the NLC alignment can be modified by applying a low-frequency voltage across the layer by means of thin film or solid electrodes8,9,23, by changing the beam power13,24, by using additional beams25,26 or by photoalignment layers10,27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, fully three-dimensional (3D) soliton dynamics is hampered by the dimensional restrictions of these planar structures29, as beam trajectories can only vary within the NLC region about the mid-plane of the cell, with angular steering not exceeding fractions of degree orthogonally to the propagation plane parallel to the interfaces8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this paper we demonstrate three-dimensional steering of self-trapped beam paths by employing bulk NLC samples without lateral boundary conditions and a magnetic field to modify their molecular orientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In achieving this goal, we manage to exploit magnetic molecular reorientation16 while preserving the nonlinear optical response of the material, introducing magneto-optic control of spatial solitons, realizing 3D soliton routing without limitations of voltage-controlled planar schemes, and hence paving the way to a whole new family of signal routers and processors.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Hence, the light beam splits into two independent linearly polarized components, namely an ordinary (o) wave beam with electric field Eo orthogonal to the plane kn and an extraordinary (e) wave with the electric field Ee coplanar with k and n.', 'While NLCs are insensitive to the ordinary o-polarized beam below the so-called Freedericks transition16, the electric field E of the extraordinary e-polarized beam exerts an optical torque on the highly polarizable NLC molecules, which tends to align the director along the electric field vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The torque tilts the director by a small (in the weak nonlinear regime) angle  in the region around the beam axis (at peak intensity), and the local director orientation becomes =m+, with m the uniform distribution of the director in the absence of optical stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extraordinary index  increases in the region surrounding and containing the beam, inducing a graded-index waveguide and allowing for self-confinement7,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the trapped beam propagates with wavevector , the Poynting vector tilts at the walk-off angle  with respect to ke due to birefringence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Soliton routing', 'The propagation direction of the e-polarized soliton-forming beam in our geometry is determined by the spatial orientation of the stationary magnetic field B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An arbitrary fixed direction of the magnetic vector defines both the director n and the walk-off orientation, with respect to chosen coordinates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the z axis is always orthogonal to the entrance interface of the NLC and , the axes x and y with corresponding unit vectors  and  can be chosen arbitrarily in the plane z=const.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Let us assume that the B vector has fixed polar orientation with an angle m and is initially coplanar with the xz plane, so , as shown in Fig 1c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After rotating by an azimuthal angle  around the z axis the magnetic field becomes coplanar with the new plane x1z:  in a new coordinate basis .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the molecular director n together with the electric field of extraordinary beam Ee follow the plane zB, the trajectory of spatial soliton lies in the planes yz and y1z before and after the rotation, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our experimental conditions the effect of optical torque on the polar director orientation  is significantly small ( less_than  less_than m) in comparison with the magneto-induced torque as we are in the weak nonlinear regime30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the resulting walk-off angle  is practically determined by m:', '', 'In this equation models well our experimental observations of magnetic-field control of spatial solitons in bulk liquid crystals with no lateral boundary conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model neglects the interplay between all-optical and magnetic reorientations, while describing the walk-off of a bell-shaped beam on axis, that is, in the framework of the highly nonlocal approximation7,30,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, we take a linearized superposition of all-optical and magnetic-driven orientations, analogous to the nonlinear optical response in the presence of an external voltage bias7,19.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We used circularly polarized beams (=800 nm) yielding o- and e-components of equal powers in the NLC mixture 6CHBT (n=1.5144 and n=1.6714 at 20 °C), independently of .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While the electric field Ee of the e-polarized beam tends to align NLC molecules along its own direction, the magnetic field determines the background alignment; the stronger the B, the higher the beam intensity/power required to produce an index change  for self-trapping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, equation (1) is valid as long as the external magnetic field effects are comparable with those due to the electric field of light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this perturbative regime, we observed diffractionless propagation of 6 m diameter solitons over millimetre distances, at powers from a few to tens of mW depending on the magnetic field direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2 shows the experimental results on soliton generation and routing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beam trajectories (Fig 2ad) and output intensity profiles (Fig 2f) are reported for a circularly polarized fundamental Gaussian input.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the magnetic field B is applied parallel to the input beam wavevector (m=0) or is absent, the low-power beam (P=7 mW) rapidly diffracts (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the magnetic field is tilted with respect to the z axis (m0), the optical wavepacket splits into ordinary and extraordinary-wave components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The former still propagates along the original direction (z axis) experiencing diffraction, while the latter propagates at the walk-off angle  and forms a spatial soliton via reorientation-induced self-focusing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evolution of the self-localized beam in our geometry depends on the direction of the magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the magnetic field rotates by an angle  around the z axis, the beam trajectory follows this rotation and remains coplanar with them in the plane zB (see Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2bd,f shows soliton trajectories for m=45° with =90°, 0°, 180°, 270° in the planes yz (side view) and xy (output), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here the circularly polarized input beam had a total power of 7 mW, the e-wave soliton 3.5 mW with its polarization in the plane zB, as only extraordinary waves could contribute to all-optical reorientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we verified that the orientation of the magnetic field determined the principal plane for the e-wave component of the beam undergoing reorientational self-confinement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Soliton steering in NLC by means of an external magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Acquired images of an ordinary wave beam undergoing diffraction while propagating along the z axis, (bd) projections of trajectories of extraordinary-wave self-confined solitons (visible because of weak out-of-plane light scattering) on the zy plane, from a circularly polarized beam of power P=7 mW when B is oriented at a fixed polar angle m=45° with respect to z and various azimuthal angles : 90° (b), 0°, 180° (c) and 270° (d) with respect to x, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Time evolution of the beam walk-off in the plane yz when the orientation of the magnetic field (B=0.2T) was abruptly ( less_than 1 s) switched from the angular position m=45°, =90° to m=45°, =270° (red squares) and from m=45°, =270° to m=45°, =90° (blue squares), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vertical green line indicates when B was switched.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) Intensity profiles of the output beam for various values of .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The broad spot in the centre corresponds to the diffracting ordinary-wave beam; the four narrow spots are the outputs of extraordinary-wave solitons, angularly displaced by the orientation of the magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Counterclockwise from right: =0°, 90°, 180°and 270°, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The white scale bars in ad,f, 50 m.Full size image', 'Soliton formation strongly depends on both the angular direction m of the magnetic field and the power of the incident light beam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3 illustrates the role of m on the wavepacket walk-off and the soliton threshold power.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured the walk-off by varying m from 90° to +90° in the plane yz and obtained results (Fig 3b) in perfect agreement with equation (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Effect of magnetic field orientation on soliton trajectory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Photographs of soliton trajectories in the fixed yz plane with walk-off determined by the magnetic field orientation m.
