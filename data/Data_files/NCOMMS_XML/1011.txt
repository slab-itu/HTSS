Post-supereruption recovery at Toba Caldera  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Large calderas, or supervolcanoes, are sites of the most catastrophic and hazardous events on Earth, yet the temporal details of post-supereruption activity, or resurgence, remain largely unknown, limiting our ability to understand how supervolcanoes work and address their hazards.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Toba Caldera, Indonesia, caused the greatest volcanic catastrophe of the last 100 kyr, climactically erupting 74 ka.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the supereruption, Toba has been in a state of resurgence but its magmatic and uplift history has remained unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we reveal that new 14C, zircon UTh crystallization and (UTh)/He ages show resurgence commenced at 69.7±4.5 ka and continued until at least 2.7 ka, progressing westward across the caldera, as reflected by post-caldera effusive lava eruptions and uplifted lake sediment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The major stratovolcano north of Toba, Sinabung, shows strong geochemical kinship with Toba, and zircons from recent eruption products suggest Tobas climactic magma reservoir extends beneath Sinabung and is being tapped during eruptions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Many of Earths largest calderas, or supervolcanoes, like Yellowstone (Wyoming, USA) and the Valles Caldera (New Mexico, USA), record multi-million year histories punctuated by geologically instantaneous and catastrophic supereruptions1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the intervening periods of relative quiescence, the caldera re-establishes magmastatic, isostatic and lithostatic equilibrium after the catastrophic disruption of the caldera-forming (climactic) eruption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Referred to as resurgence, this period of post-climactic recovery is recognized as one of the most dynamic phases of a caldera cycle during which uplift of the caldera floor is accompanied by further eruptions, establishment of hydrothermal and geothermal systems, and ore formation4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, despite the recognition that all currently active large calderas are in resurgence with the potential for significant further hazard7, precise timing of events during resurgence at large calderas are unknown, impeding our ability to fully assess any accompanying hazard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the main challenges is to unravel how activity varies in space and time, but to date, efforts have been hindered by the limitations of the available techniques8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show how the application of combined 238U230Th disequilibrium and (UTh)/He dating of zircon crystals11,12,13,14 from eruptions at Toba Caldera and 14C ages of lake sediment deposits found on lava extrusions reveal for the first time details of the post-caldera eruption and uplift history that informs the potential hazards of the largest young supervolcano on Earth, which remain heavily debated15,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirm that Toba Caldera formed during the climactic eruption 74 ka but find that the resurgence started within a few 1,000 years after caldera formation, and continued until at least 2.7 ka.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Sinabung, a currently active volcano north of Toba, shows similar 87Sr/86Sr isotopic values to Tobas rocks, unlike any other arc volcano on Sumatra, and also has an overlapping zircon crystallization history based on 238U230Th disequilibrium age constraints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This raises the possibility that Sinabung and Toba share a common magmatic source requiring reconsideration of the potential hazard to this region.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A significant record of structural and magmatic resurgence of Toba Caldera since the climactic eruption of the YTT, 74 ka, is being revealed through new geochronological data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new eruption and outermost zircon rim crystallization ages from the post-caldera lava domes and current eruptions at Sinabung reveal that extrusions of lava domes began immediately after the climactic eruption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined with the 14C ages of sediments on post-caldera lava domes, these data indicate that resurgence at Toba started immediately after the YTT eruption, and eruptions continued episodically for another 624 kyr (Fig 2k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spatiotemporal pattern of the post-caldera lava domes records spatially discrete pulses of volcanism moving from along the Samosir fault to the southern and western parts of the caldera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spatial and temporal link between the Samosir lava domes and uplift of Samosir strongly indicates that magmatism associated with the volcanic episodes motivated uplift of the resurgent dome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Toba-like magma has been erupted 30 km north of Toba from Sinabung volcano where geochemical affinities with Toba are accompanied by overlapping zircon crystallization histories that continue to more recent times under Sinabung (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The possibility that the Toba magma system is currently being sampled by Sinabungs active and erupting volcano suggests that Tobas magma system extends further north than previous geophysical surveys have indicated31,32,33, and should be considered in assessments of hazard associated with activity in this region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The high-resolution temporal and spatial record of resurgence at Toba provides hitherto unknown details of post-supereruption recovery at supervolcanoes34,35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tobas 1 million year lifetime is similar to that of other active large resurgent calderas worldwide such as Long Valley, Yellowstone and the Valles Caldera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These systems, like Toba, all have geophysical and petrological evidence of active magmatic systems beneath them37,38,39,40, but are older in that the last supereruptions were at least 630 ka (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has proved challenging for current geochronological techniques to provide insights into the immediate post-supereruption history.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings at Toba indicate that magmatism beneath large calderas continues vigorously between supereruptions, motivating structural uplift and feeding hazardous eruptions within and around the caldera almost immediately after the climactic eruption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At older calderas, much of this evidence is probably destroyed or buried by subsequent activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our new geochemical and geochronological data also suggest significant extension of the caldera-related magmatic system well beyond the Toba caldera boundary to beneath Sinabung volcano.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the exact nature of the connection is unknown, a shared magmatic history and magmatic consanguinity is clear and the data are most consistent with a common magmatic reservoir with a shared thermal and chemical evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Magmatic complexes that extend well beyond caldera boundaries have been recognized by geophysical surveys at other large calderas42 and may be more common than previously thought.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like at Yellowstone, at Toba the northern extension may be facilitated by structures that in this case parallel the nearby Sumatra fault, along which the Toba depression is thought to have developed as a step-over pull-apart basin22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The possibility of Tobas magmatic system extending north to Sinabung raises the need to reassess the potential hazards in this region.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
