The missing Northern European winter cooling response to Arctic sea ice loss  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Reductions in Arctic sea ice may promote the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been argued that NAO-related variability can be used an as analogue to predict the effects of Arctic sea ice loss on mid-latitude weather.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As NAO events are associated with colder winters over Northern Europe, a negatively shifted NAO has been proposed as a dynamical pathway for Arctic sea ice loss to cause Northern European cooling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study uses large-ensemble atmospheric simulations with prescribed ocean surface conditions to examine how seasonal-scale NAO events are affected by Arctic sea ice loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite an intensification of NAO events, reflected by more prevalent easterly flow, sea ice loss does not lead to Northern European winter cooling and daily cold extremes actually decrease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dynamical cooling from the changed NAO is missing, because it is offset (or exceeded) by a thermodynamical effect owing to advection of warmer air masses.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment report1 found that warming of the climate system is unequivocal and human influence on the climate system is clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rapid retreat of Arctic sea ice cover is one of the most visible manifestations of man-made climate change2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The annual minimum sea ice cover (in September) has declined by 40% from 1979 to 2015 and is now lower than that at any other time in the past 1,450 years5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Climate model simulations run with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations unanimously project continued loss of sea ice, with ice-free summers the norm later this century if greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This profound environmental change has motivated extensive research aimed at understanding the climatic implications of sea ice loss, both within the Arctic and beyond10,11,12,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The response of the large-scale Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation to Arctic sea ice loss has proven hard to elucidate, owing to its inherent nonlinearity15,16,17with respect to the magnitude and spatial pattern of sea ice loss18,19,20,21 and to the background climatic state22,23apparent model dependence24, and often low detectability amidst the large chaotic variability of the system25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this large uncertainty, a common conclusion is that reductions in Arctic sea ice tend to favour a shift towards the negative phase of the NAO26, or its hemispheric equivalent, the Arctic Oscillation (AO).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A causal link between Arctic sea ice and the NAO (or AO) has been inferred from observations/reanalyses27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36, seasonal predictions37 and climate model simulations19,20,24,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although such a negative shift of the NAO has been found in many studies, there are exceptions17,21,25,47,48, for reasons that are not well understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The negative phase of the NAO is associated with cooler winter temperatures over Europe26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it has been assumed (often implicitly or via association) that sea ice loss will favour colder winters over Europe (and mid-latitudes more generally) if, as evidence suggests, sea ice loss promotes the negative NAO phase49,50,51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is plausible that the European winter temperature response to Arctic sea ice loss is influenced by factors other than the negative NAO shift.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, although several studies have suggested a physical link between Arctic sea ice loss and winter cooling over Asia18,53,54,55,56,57,58, connections to European winter climate are less clear14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extreme caution is required when extrapolating conclusions from one mid-latitude region to another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This study presents evidence from model simulations that strongly support the notion of a negative NAO response to Arctic sea ice loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This atmospheric circulation change would be expected to lead to cooling over Europe, if the NAO is a good analogue for the expected temperature response to Arctic sea ice loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, such a cooling response is missing in these model simulations, because it is offset (or exceeded) by a thermodynamical effect owing to advection of warmer air masses.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Sea ice loss', 'This study makes use of large-ensemble atmospheric model simulations with perturbed sea ice conditions to isolate the influence of Arctic sea ice loss on the negative phase of the NAO (NAO).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It focuses on the NAO for two key reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the climatological winter mid-tropospheric circulation response to sea ice loss in these simulations projects onto the NAO (Supplementary Fig 1), prompting a closer look at NAO events specifically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, considering the wider literature, the one dynamical change that appears commonplace (if not ubiquitous) in response to sea ice loss is a tendency towards NAO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main analyses are based upon two 502-member ensembles, one with below-average sea ice cover and the other with above-average sea ice cover (see Methods for further details), hereafter referred to as the low ice (LI) and high ice (HI) ensembles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1a,b show the differences in sea ice concentration between LI and HI during early winter (NovemberDecember) and midwinter (January-February), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are reduced sea ice concentrations, in LI compared with HI, along the sea ice edge and in the sub-polar seas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference patterns are largely similar between early and midwinter, except for larger sea ice reductions in Hudson Bay and the Chukchi Sea in the former, and larger reductions in the Sea of Okhotsk and Labrador in the latter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BarentsKara Sea is a region where sea ice reductions are understood to be especially effective at influencing the NAO18,33,36,46,56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decreased ice cover in this region is evident in both early and midwinter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Arctic sea ice loss prescribed in the model simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Early winter (NovemberDecember) sea ice concentration differenced between the low ice (LI) and high ice (HI) simulations (LI minus HI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) As a but for midwinter (JanuaryFebruary).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c,d) As a,b but for the difference between twenty-first century (C21) and twentieth century (C20) simulations (C21 minus C20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The red and green lines mark the sea ice edge (15% contour) in LI and HI, respectively, in both a,b and in C21 and C20, respectively, in both c,d.Full size image', 'Figure 1c,d show differences in sea ice concentration between two additional experiments, referred to as the twenty-first century (C21) and twentieth century (C20) ensembles (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differences in sea ice cover between C21 and C20 are more spatially extensive than between LI and HI, and the difference in sea ice area is roughly twice as large (8.9 versus 4.8 million km2 in early winter; 10.2 versus 5.2 million km2 in midwinter).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in some regions, the differences in sea ice concentration are larger between LI and HI than between C21 and C20 (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is especially the case near to the observed climatological sea ice edge (stemming from the fact that C20 has less sea ice than HI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C21 and C20 ensembles will be utilized later, but first the focus is on the differences in the NAO between LI and HI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'NAO response', 'Unlike previous studies that have examined seasonal mean changes of the NAO in response to Arctic sea ice loss, the large ensembles used here allow in-depth analysis of strongly negative NAO events specifically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This distinction is important as changes in extreme events (in this case, low surface NAO index values) may not simply follow changes in mean climate and society is arguably more sensitive to the former.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study focuses on seasonal-scale (JanuaryFebruary mean) NAO events, which are associated with prolonged periods of anomalous weather and significant impacts on society.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simulated NAO events (defined here as when the midwinter surface NAO index is  greater than 1 s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  below its mean; see Methods) are characterized by raised mid-tropospheric (500 hPa) geopotential heights centred over Greenland and lowered heights over the North Atlantic (Fig 2a, contours).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These anomalies are vertically coherent and extend from the surface into the stratosphere, as illustrated by a vertical cross-section along the 40° W meridian (Fig 2b, contours).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Changes to NAO events induced by Arctic sea ice loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Midwinter (JanuaryFebruary) 500 hPa geopotential height during NAO events, differenced between the low ice (LI) and high ice (HI) simulations (shading;

however, other studies have found NAO responses to be maximal in late winter19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The timing of the NAO response may be dependent of the atmospheric model used and/or the sea ice conditions prescribed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Tropospherestratosphere interaction', 'The temporal evolution of polar cap ( greater than 65° N) height (PCH) is a commonly used metric to infer the evolution of the NAO (or AO) through time19,20,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2c shows the evolution of PCH in the months preceding, during and following midwinter NAO events, and how this differs between LI and HI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically, midwinter NAO events are preceded by increases in stratospheric PCH in late autumn and early winter months (Fig 2c, contours).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These positive PCH anomalies descend through time and become apparent in the troposphere by midwinter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the stratospheric PCH anomalies persist into early spring following the midwinter NAO event, the tropospheric anomalies dissipate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing LI and HI, PCH is enhanced in the stratosphere from October to March in LI with positive tropospheric anomalies emerging a few months later in December and persisting until April.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This familiar response pattern to Arctic sea ice loss19,20,46 strongly suggests a warming and weakening of the stratospheric vortex, followed by a downward propagation of circulation anomalies into the troposphere with a lag of around 12 months.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Negative PCH differences in the stratosphere during spring may be linked to delayed final breakdown of the polar vortex, which often follows the recovery from a weakened winter vortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As large differences in stratospheric PCH emerge in November preceding midwinter NAO events (Fig 2c), attention now turns to this month and potential causes of the weakened polar stratospheric vortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work has suggested that sea ice loss increases vertical wave propagation into the stratosphere in early winter and leads to a weakened polar vortex46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such increases in vertical wave activity are understood to relate to amplification of the climatological planetary waves, in particular the zonal wavenumber 1 component46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concept of linear interferencehow the forced response interacts with the climatological wavesappears a powerful paradigm to explain the effect of extratropical surface forcing, such as sea ice loss, on vertical wave activity59,60,61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3 shows the zonal wavenumber 1 component of the difference in geopotential height between LI and HI for Novembers preceding midwinter NAO events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differences display a westward tilt with altitude, indicative of vertical wave propagation62, and are tightly in phase with the climatological wavenumber 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, these simulations support the notion that the planetary wave response to Arctic sea ice loss interferes constructively with the climatological wave pattern in November and enhances vertical wave propagation into the stratosphere, consistent with ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other months, the wave response does not project so well onto the climatological wave pattern (Fig 3b), which suggests enhanced vertical wave propagation in November (and to a lesser extent October) triggered by sea ice loss is especially relevant for winter weather, as proposed by others33,37,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth noting that despite using a low-top model (that is, with a model lid at 10 hPa and relatively poor vertical resolution of the stratosphere) in this study, the results are strongly consistent with those from high-top models19,20,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, these simulations display a robust intensification of NAO events in response to Arctic sea ice loss, through a mechanism whereby enhanced tropospheric wave activity leads to a weaker stratospheric polar vortex and precedes more intense NAO events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Planetary wave interference induced by Arctic sea ice loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Zonal wavenumber 1 component of November geopotential height averaged between 40 and 60° N during NAO events, differenced between the low ice (LI) and high ice (HI) simulations (shading;

hence, they act to lower the midwinter temperature in LI relative to HI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that although days of zonal wind less than 4 m s1 are also increased, these are few in number so contribute less to the midwinter mean change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a smaller dynamical cooling contribution from days of zonal wind in the range 48 m s1, owing to fewer of these typically warmer days in LI compared with HI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dynamical contribution is small for days of zonal wind in the range 03 m s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the thermodynamical contribution (Fig 5d, red line) is largest in this range, but positive for all categories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As all wind categories are warmer in LI compared with HI (Fig 3c), the magnitude of the thermodynamical contribution is largely dictated by the mean frequency of each category, with more frequent categories making a larger contribution to the midwinter mean temperature difference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The net contribution (Fig 5d, black line) shows cooling (dynamically driven) on days of strong easterly flow ( less_than 5 m s1) and on days of strong ( greater than 5 m s1) westerly flow, and warming (thermodynamically driven) on days of moderate (5 to 5 m s1) easterly and westerly flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Summed over all days in midwinter NAO events (that is, over all wind categories), the cooling effect of intensified NAO is missing, owing to a larger and opposite warming effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cold extremes', 'Figure 5b shows a reduction in the frequency of daily cold extremes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reduction in cold extremes is caused in part by mean warming, but also by decreased daily temperature variability, consistent with previous work20,57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduced variability is a physical consequence of weakened horizontal temperature gradients63,64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Northern European cold extremes tend to be associated with advection of cold subpolar air from northern Eurasia, a region that is warmed by Arctic sea ice loss (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth noting that cold extremes decrease in frequency (Fig 5b), despite a net cooling on days of strongest easterlies ( less_than 5 m s1; Fig 5d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be understood by the fact that the zonal wind is only one factor of many that influences temperature, meaning that not all the coldest days are coincident with strong easterlies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of the coldest days fall into wind categories that are warmed by sea ice loss (for example, 5 to 5 m s1;

there are too few NAO events in each of the smaller ensembles to allow reliable comparison of solely NAO midwinters) and the absence of Northern European cooling are robustly simulated in all four cases (Supplementary Figs 5 and 6), suggesting little sensitivity to the background state (this is in contrast to other aspects of the response to sea ice loss23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further explore potential sensitivities, it is useful to attempt to reproduce the results using another set of ensemble simulations with the same model, but very different prescribed sea ice concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These additional ensembles were briefly introduced earlier (C21 and C20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recall that the difference in sea ice area between C21 and C20 is approximately twice as large as between LI and HI, and the spatial patterns of sea ice loss are very different (Fig 1 and Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these differences in sea ice forcing (and in the background state), there is very high consistency in the simulated atmospheric response to sea ice loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mid-tropospheric heights differenced between C21 and C20, show a very similar amplification of NAO events (Fig 6a) to that discussed previously (Fig 2a), suggesting this is a robust feature of the atmospheric response to sea ice loss (at least in this model).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another consistent feature is the absence of European cooling associated with these more intense NAO events (c.f.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figs 4c and 6b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Replication of main results in simulations with different Arctic sea ice loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Midwinter (JanuaryFebruary) 500 hPa geopotential height during NAO events, differenced between the twenty-first century (C21) and twentieth century (C20) simulations (shading;

Fig 6e) to that between LI and HI (0.58 m s1 (0.88to 0.27); Fig 5c), despite much larger sea ice differences between C21 and C20 (Fig 1 and Supplementary Fig 2), emphasizing that the dynamical response does not scale linearly with the magnitude of sea ice loss15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enhanced easterlies exert a dynamical cooling contribution but, as found before, this is offset by thermodynamical warming (Fig 6f), leading to a small and insignificant (P=0.81) mean temperature response (0.10 °C (0.66 to 0.87)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite an increase in frequency (as well as intensity) of NAO midwinters in C21 relative to C20 (see Methods), there is no evidence of Northern European cooling in the climatological temperature response to sea ice loss (that is, across all midwinters not just NAO ones; Supplementary Fig 7), even though the climatological circulation response is similar to the NAO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One noteworthy difference between the two sets of simulations is that the slope of the windtemperature relationship is reduced in C21 compared with C20 (Fig 6e), whereas it stays roughly constant in HI and LI (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference in slope is attributable to larger (sub-) polar warming in the future sea ice loss scenario and further weakened horizontal temperature gradients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, the intensification of NAO events and the missing Northern European cooling are common features of the response to Arctic sea ice loss in both sets of simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of NAO-like surface temperature change, despite a circulation response to sea ice loss reminiscent of the NAO, was also evident in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24 (although it was not explored in any detail).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, both sets of simulations analysed in this study and the simulations analysed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24 were conducted with the same model, so model dependence cannot be ruled out.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The NAO is a key driver of winter weather and climate variability over Northern Europe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the similarities between the mean atmospheric state during NAO events and that often simulated in response to Arctic sea ice loss (for example, Figs 2a and 6a), the NAO has been suggested as a prototype to understand how mid-latitude weather might change with Arctic sea ice loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As NAO winters are typically colder than average, the above line of reasoning would predict that Arctic sea ice loss causes winter cooling over Northern Europe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study strongly suggests, however, that Northern European winter temperature is only weakly affected by Arctic sea ice loss, despite a marked intensification of NAO events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temperature of seasonal-scale NAO events remains fairly constant (or warms), because thermodynamical warming offsets (or exceeds) NAO-related dynamical cooling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, using the NAO as an analogue would predict more frequent cold extremes over Northern Europe, although the simulated response suggests fewer such events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the NAO cannot be used as an analogue to predict how surface temperature responds to Arctic sea ice loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further work is required to ascertain whether this holds true for modes of atmospheric variability other than the NAO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, it is noteworthy that a similar conclusion was recently drawn in relation to the AO as an analogue for the effect of Arctic warming on atmospheric blocking65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This study has shown that a Northern European cooling response is missing in these simulations and explained its absence, but why then are Arctic sea ice reductions correlated with cold winters in the real world49,50,51,52?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulations strongly suggest that although Arctic sea ice loss may augment the negative NAO, the European cooling correlated with sea ice loss in observations is not caused by sea ice loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, it is likely to be related to co-varying atmospheric variability52,66,67.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, the observed correlation between Arctic sea ice and European winter temperature does not appear to be indicative of a physical relationship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study has only considered the effects of sea ice loss and it remains to be seen how co-varying factors, such as Eurasian snow cover, may influence connections between sea ice, the NAO and Northern European weather.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Research into linkages between the Arctic and mid-latitudes is in part motivated by the potential to improve prediction of mid-latitude weather33,68.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results here suggest that Arctic sea ice cover could be a potential source of predictability for the NAO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, November sea ice cover in the Kara Sea has been identified as one possible contributor to skilful NAO predictions in a state-of-the-art seasonal prediction system37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the results also suggest that improved predictions of the NAO may not translate in better forecasts of surface temperature unless the temperature of advected air is also well predicted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, the study provides support for a causal link between Arctic sea ice loss and more intense midwinter NAO events but, importantly, emphasizes that cooling over Northern Europe stemming from this dynamical change is fully compensated by thermodynamical warming.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Model', 'Model simulations were performed with the UK Met Office Unified Model version 6.6.3, which is the atmospheric component of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) model HadGEM2-ES69.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model was utilized in an atmosphere-only configuration with prescribed surface boundary conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The atmosphere-only framework has the distinct advantage that sea ice can be perturbed in a controlled way, to isolate its influence on the atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The major weakness of this approach, however, is that it fails to capture coupled atmosphereoceanice interactions and feedbacks, which may modify the atmospheric response44,45,67.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  External forcings (for example, greenhouse gas concentrations, aerosols and so on) were held constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model version used here has a horizontal resolution of 1.875° longitude and 1.25° latitude (known as N96) and 38 vertical levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Low ice and high ice ensembles', 'Two ensemble experiments were performed with either positive or negative sea ice anomalies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both experiments consist of 502 ensemble members, with each member being 1 year in duration and having the same surface boundary conditions, but starting from a different atmospheric initial condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For sea ice boundary conditions, the monthly mean climatological mean and s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  () of observed sea ice concentration and sea surface temperature (SST), 19792013, was calculated at each grid point from the UK Met Office Hadley Centre Ice and SST data set (http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadisst).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the HI experiments, a sea ice concentration anomaly of +2 was applied to the climatological mean and for the LI experiments an ice concentration anomaly of 2 was applied to the climatological mean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At grid points where a sea ice anomaly was imposed, an SST anomaly was also imposed to account for SST changes linked to sea ice changes, adapting the approach of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the HI experiment, an SST anomaly of 2 was applied to the climatological mean and in LI an SST anomaly of +2 was applied to the climatological mean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At grid points where sea ice is never present or always has the same concentration, the climatological sea ice concentration and SST was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific ice-related anomalies are applied in each calendar month, but only in the northern hemisphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sea ice concentrations were restricted to being between 0 and 100%, to avoid unphysical values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sea ice thickness was calculated empirically within the model code from the prescribed sea ice concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work has shown that the atmospheric response to sea ice loss can be sensitive to the background SST22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, four different background states are used, intended to capture SST variability associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These were chosen, as they are the dominant modes of SST variability on decadal to multi-decadal timescales in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, respectively, and this study is focused on the response to Arctic sea ice loss on these timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To represent the different PDO phases, the detrended and normalized annual-mean PDO index (http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/climateindices/list/), 19482013, was regressed against detrended annual mean global SST, to yield an SST anomaly per 1 change in the PDO index ().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For one background state, an SST anomaly of +2 was applied and the other an SST anomaly of 2 was applied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SST anomalies were applied globally at all ice-free grid points, with the same SST anomalies applied in each calendar month.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SSTs were restricted to no lower than 1.8 °C (freezing temperature of saltwater) to avoid unphysical values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An analogous procedure was applied for the AMO to yield two additional background states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both LI and HI (to ensure no net difference in SST between these), the two PDO background states were each applied in 150 members and the two AMO background states were each applied in 101 members.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Twenty-first and twentieth century ensembles', 'Two 260-member ensembles were performed with either sea ice conditions representative of the late twentieth century (C21) or those projected for the late twenty-first century (C20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the C20 experiment, sea ice concentrations and SSTs were taken from the CMIP5 historical simulations of HadGEM2-ES, averaged for the period 198099 and across all available ensemble members (N=4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the C21 experiment, sea ice concentrations were taken from the CMIP5 RCP8.5 simulations of HadGEM2-ES, averaged for the period 208099 and across all available ensemble members (N=4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SSTs in C21 were the same as C20, except at grid boxes where sea ice was lost, where the climatological SST of the late twenty-first century was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure accounts for the local SST warming associated with reduced sea ice cover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RCP8.5 simulations are forced by a continuous increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and are often viewed as a business-as-usual scenario, with limited mitigation strategies applied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This scenario was chosen to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further details on these simulations can be found in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'NAO events and
