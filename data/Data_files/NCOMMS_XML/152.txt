Epigenetic regulation of puberty via Zinc finger protein-mediated transcriptional repression  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In primates, puberty is unleashed by increased GnRH release from the hypothalamus following an interval of juvenile quiescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GWAS implicates Zinc finger (ZNF) genes in timing human puberty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that hypothalamic expression of several ZNFs decreased in agonadal male monkeys in association with the pubertal reactivation of gonadotropin secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of two of these ZNFs, GATAD1 and ZNF573, also decreases in peripubertal female monkeys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, only GATAD1 abundance increases when gonadotropin secretion is suppressed during late infancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeted delivery of GATAD1 or ZNF573 to the rat hypothalamus delays puberty by impairing the transition of a transcriptional network from an immature repressive epigenetic configuration to one of activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GATAD1 represses transcription of two key puberty-related genes, KISS1 and TAC3, directly, and reduces the activating histone mark H3K4me2 at each promoter via recruitment of histone demethylase KDM1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that GATAD1 epitomizes a subset of ZNFs involved in epigenetic repression of primate puberty.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Puberty in highly evolved primates is unleashed after a prolonged phase of juvenile development by the re-emergence of a robust pattern of pulsatile GnRH release, a mode of hypothalamic neuroendocrine activity that was placed in check during infancy1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One immediate cause of this juvenile hiatus in GnRH release appears to be a reduced production of the peptide kisspeptin from a subset of KISS1 neurons that are located in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because many of these KISS1 neurons also express neurokinin B and dynorphin, they have been termed KNDy neurons2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the reduced activity of the GnRH pulse generator during juvenile development and the resurgence of GnRH secretion at puberty occur in the absence of the gonads, indicating that these changes do not require feedback actions of either ovarian or testicular steroids in primates1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One of our laboratories recently provided evidence that a mechanism of transcriptional repression prevents the premature initiation of puberty in the female rat by silencing the Kiss1 gene in KNDy neurons4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcriptional repression is a major component of the molecular machinery regulating mammalian gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 2,000 transcription factors estimated to be present in the human genome5, almost 800 are transcriptional repressors containing zinc finger (ZNF) motifs6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These motifs recognize specific DNA sequences in regulatory regions of the genome7, and therefore are critical for ZNF proteins to interact with DNA targets and regulate gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most common of these motifs is the C2H2 or Krüppel type of ZNF (KZNF)6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About one third of KZNFs also contain a motif called a Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) that recruits histone deacetylase complexes to the DNA region to which the ZNF is attached8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The potential contribution of ZNF genes to the pubertal process was recently suggested by several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) showing that single-nucleotide polymorphisms located near ZNF131, ZNF462 and ZNF483 were associated with an earlier age of menarche9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations raise the possibility that members of the ZNF gene superfamily, operating within the neuroendocrine brain, may represent a component of the neurobiological brake that underlies the arrest of the GnRH pulse generator during juvenile development in primates and thus contribute to preventing the premature initiation of puberty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To systematically pursue this idea, we used DNA arrays to interrogate the hypothalamic transcriptome of agonadal male rhesus monkeys at two critical phases of postnatal development, the infantilejuvenile (INFJUV) transition when the GnRH pulse generator is brought into check and the juvenilepubertal (JUVPUB) transition when robust GnRH pulse generator activity is re-initiated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We employed agonadal male monkeys to eliminate the confounding effect of gonadal steroids on gene expression in the brain, and because the juvenile hiatus in GnRH release is more conspicuous than that in females1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also determined if any of the changes observed in males also occurred in females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To gain mechanistic insights into the actions of ZNFs, we used female rats as an in vivo model of puberty timing, and a combination of targeted DNA arrays, systems biology and in vitro molecular approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that ZNFs restrain puberty by epigenetically repressing a gene network thatoperating in the ARCcontrols puberty by governing pulsatile GnRH release.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The present study provides evidence that members of the ZNF superfamily of transcriptional repressors represent an important component of the neurobiological brake that holds the GnRH pulse generator in check during juvenile development in highly evolved primates, and that, therefore, prevents the premature awakening of the pubertal process in these species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that expression of GATAD1 and ZNF573, along with that of five other ZNFs, decreases in the MBH of agonadal male rhesus monkeys during the JUVPUB transition when GnRH pulse generator activity increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar peripubertal changes in GATAD1 and ZNF573 expression were also observed in ovary-intact female monkeys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, when GATAD1 or ZNF573 were overexpressed in the ARC of immature female rats, puberty was delayed and subsequent oestrous cyclicity was disrupted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results show that four of the eight ZNFs displaying decreased expression in the male monkey hypothalamus at puberty (ZNF573, ZNF582, ZNF587 and ZNF791) belong to the large family of KRABKZNF genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These four puberty-related KRABKZNFs are members of the large cluster of KZNFs located in the q13 region of chromosome 19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is unlikely, however, that all KRABKZNFs contribute to silencing genes that at the termination of juvenile development reactivate GnRH pulse generation, as evidenced by the finding that expression of ZNF483, a KRABKZNF located on chromosome 9, did not decrease during the JUVPUB transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, ZNFs lacking a KRAB domain and located in chromosomes other than chromosome 19 may work in concert with chromosome 19 KRABKZNFs to maintain puberty in check.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In keeping with this idea, hypothalamic expression of GATAD1 and ZNF462, two ZNFs encoding proteins lacking a KRAB domain, decreased at puberty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results also show that primate-specific ZNFs do not contribute to regulating the timing of puberty in primates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, puberty appears to be regulated by ZNFs, such as GATAD1 and ZNF573, less affected by lineage-specific diversification and expressed across mammalian species, including primates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The term primate-specific refers to a group of KRABZNF and ZNF genes that, resulting from lineage-specific evolutionary expansion and diversification, is unique to primates23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two largest clusters of primate-specific genes reside in the centromeric regions of chromosome 19 (p1213.1) and chromosome 7 (7p11.2q11.21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we did not detect changes in GATAD1 expression in the rat hypothalamus at puberty, GATAD1 was effective in delaying puberty in this species suggesting that ZNFs may be able to substitute for other ZNFs in the regulation of major biological processes such as puberty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This idea is supported by the finding of several ZNFs displaying reduced abundance in the monkey hypothalamus at puberty, and is consistent with the concept that the large number of ZNFs present in the mammalian genome is important for the fine tuning of transcriptional regulation within regulatory networks25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'GATAD1 is a particularly intriguing ZNF not only because it has been implicated in determining adult height14,15, but also because of its contribution to the epigenetic regulation of gene expression16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GATAD1 is considered to be a chromatin reader because it associates to promoter regions containing H3K4me3 to form a repressive complex16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H3K4me3 is a bona fide histone modification associated with active gene transcription26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the foregoing reasons, we conducted a more detailed analysis of the potential mechanisms by which GATAD1 might induce transcriptional repression in the ARC using a reverse translation approach with the intact female rat serving as our in vivo model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach revealed that GATAD1 overexpression disrupts the normal changes in gene network connectivity that occur in the ARC as puberty approaches, preventing a juvenile-to-peripuberal organization geared for transcriptional activation and maintaining one less mature that favours transcriptional silencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GATAD1-imposed transcriptional silencing appears to be exerted at two levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first involves direct transcriptional repression of Kiss1 and Tac3, two genes expressed in the ARC and considered to be central to the pubertal increase in GnRH pulsatility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second level of transcriptional silencing leads to a switch in the chromatin landscape from a configuration-favouring gene activation to another that promotes gene silencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of GATAD1 transcripts in kisspeptin neurons of the rat ARC provides morphological support to the concept that GATAD1 is a physiological regulator of the pubertal process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Expression of both KISS1 and TAC3 increases in the monkey hypothalamus, as GATAD1 expression decreases during the JUVPUB transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That these events may be causally related is suggested by the results of our promoter assays showing that GATAD1 inhibits KISS1 and TAC3 promoter activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This repression occurs in the absence of exogenously added co-repressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, GATAD1 did not affect the promoter activity of other genes tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is perhaps due to the need of co-repressors or to a potential effect of GATAD1 on the body of these genes to recruit SETDB1, a methyltransferase that catalyses the synthesis of the repressive histone mark H3K9me3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our gene network analysis predicted the contribution of several epigenetic domains to the regulation of puberty and the repression of this process by GATAD1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We pursued studies on one of these domains, because of its direct relevance to the epigenetic regulation of gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to our computational analysis, Kdm1a loses connectivity in the ARC during normal prepubertal development of the female rat and GATAD1 overexpression prevents this change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KDM1A (also known as LSD1), the lysine demethylase encoded by Kdm1a, specifically demethylates H3K4me2 at gene promoters19, and, therefore, is linked to gene repression19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our in vitro finding that KDM1A recruitment is increased by GATAD1 overexpression while association of H3K4me2 to the KISS1 and TAC3 promoters is dramatically reduced, is consistent with the interpretation that GATAD1 reduces KISS1 and TAC3 gene activity in part by facilitating loss of H3K4me2 from these promoters via gain of KDM1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decrease in GATAD1 and KDM1A association to the KISS1 and TAC3 promoters and the concomitant increase in H2K4me2 abundance observed in the monkey MBH at the time of puberty, strongly support the in vitro results and suggest that these epigenetic changes are events normally associated with the time of primate puberty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, GATAD1 and KDM1A appear to be interconnected in a broader context as sequence variation in genomic loci harbouring these genes has been shown to affect human height14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Altogether, these results are consistent with the emerging concept that transcriptional repression of genes involved in the initiation of puberty resides at the heart of the molecular mechanism by which the hypothalamus holds the GnRH pulse generator in check and therefore prevents the premature activation of the pubertal process4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The polycomb (PcG) complex, known to play a major role in imposing gene silencing at various developmental stages28, was shown by one of our laboratories to prevent the premature initiation of puberty in the rat by repressing the transcriptional activity of Kiss1 in KNDy neurons4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of GATAD1 to promote H3K4me2 demethylation at the KISS1 and TAC3 promoters suggests that ZNFs, instead of directly interacting with PcG proteins, may function to counteract the antagonistic effect of the Trithorax complex on PcG-mediated gene silencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mono, di and trimethylation of H3 at lysine 4 at target promoters are histone modifications associated with active transcription and catalysed by specific members of the Trithorax complex29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Of the ZNFs we studied, only expression of GATAD1 exhibited an inverse developmental relationship with the centrally driven on-off-on pattern of pulsatile GnRH release observed in highly evolved primates during the infantjuvenile and JUVPUB transitions1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding implies that the ZNF components of the molecular switch that we posit, controls the pubertal reactivation of GnRH pulsatility, may not be identical to those comprising the switch that represses the GnRH pulse generator during the infantjuvenile transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, the decline in GnRH pulsatility during the INFJUV transition was not accompanied by a decrease in either KISS1 or TAC3 mRNA levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is surprising in the view of an earlier study showing a greater number of ARC kisspeptin neurons in agonadal infantile male monkeys than in juveniles31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, hypogonadotropism was reported in an infant boy with a loss-of-function mutation of KISS1R/GPR54 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly additional studies are required to unravel the regulation of GnRH secretion during primate infancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By identifying a cohort of ZNFs with decreasing hypothalamic expression during the JUVPUB transition in rhesus monkeys, and mechanistically characterizing the mode of action of one of them in a rodent model, our results enable us to advance the notion that ZNFs are transcriptional regulators involved in the process by which epigenetic repression contributes to regulating the timing of primate puberty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further propose that ZNFs may provide a layer of control linked to that provided by EAP1 and MKRN3, two ZNF and RING finger-containing proteins earlier shown to share puberty-regulatory functions in rodents and primates33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether a similar ZNF-mediated mechanism contributes to restraining puberty in rodents is not known, but the fact that rat puberty is delayed by human ZNFs suggests this to be the case.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
