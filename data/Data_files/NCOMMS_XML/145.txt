High-efficiency polymer solar cells with small photon energy loss  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A crucial issue facing polymer-based solar cells is how to manage the energetics of the polymer/fullerene blends to maximize short-circuit current density and open-circuit voltage at the same time and thus the power conversion efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate that the use of a naphthobisoxadiazole-based polymer with a narrow bandgap of 1.52 eV leads to high open-circuit voltages of approximately 1 V and high-power conversion efficiencies of 9% in solar cells, resulting in photon energy loss as small as 0.5 eV, which is much smaller than that of typical polymer systems (0.71.0 eV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is ascribed to the high external quantum efficiency for the systems with a very small energy offset for charge separation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These unconventional features of the present polymer system will inspire the field of polymer-based solar cells towards further improvement of power conversion efficiencies with both high short-circuit current density and open-circuit voltage.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Polymer-based bulk-heterojunction solar cells (PSCs) that use semiconducting polymers and fullerene derivatives as p-type (hole-transport or electron donor) and n-type (electron-transport or electron acceptor) materials, respectively, are an emerging renewable energy technology that enables low-cost and low-environmental impact production and yields light-weight and flexible devices1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Drastic improvements of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) made in the last decade4,5,6,7,8,9 have resulted in PCEs surpassing 10% even in single-junction cells10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has been achieved mainly by the development of new semiconducting polymers having donoracceptor (DA) backbones where electron-rich (donor; D) and electron-deficient (acceptor; A) units are combined, owing to their narrow optical bandgap12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such polymers also offer great potentials in p-type polymer/n-type polymer (all-polymer) solar cells, which are recently resulted in PCEs more than 5% (refs 14, 15, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To improve PCEs further, it is necessary to realize a high short-circuit current (JSC) and a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) at the same time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is a well-known fact that there is a trade-off between those two parameters and thus, minimizing the trade-off is one of the most crucial issues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A key to resolving the issue in PSCs is to reduce the relatively large photon energy loss (Eloss), which is defined by EgeVOC, where Eg is the optical bandgap of the semiconducting polymer evaluated from the absorption edge17,18,19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Eloss in recently reported high-efficiency PSCs is typically 0.71.0 eV (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18), which is larger than those in inorganic solar cells and perovskite solar cells, which are around 0.40.5 eV (refs 19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Very recently, some particular polymers were reported to have small Eloss in PSCs when used in combination with 6,6-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) or 6,6-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bazan and co-workers demonstrated that the use of a pyridylthiadiazole-based polymer reduced Eloss in the PSC to ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  0.6 eV, which leads to a relatively high VOC of 0.86 V even though the polymer has a narrow Eg of 1.47 eV (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shortly thereafter Janssen and co-workers showed that the use of thiazole-linked diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP-2Tz) polymers, having a Eg of around 1.441.53 eV, reduced the Eloss below 0.55 eV, resulting in a high VOC greater than 0.92 V (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although PSCs based on those polymers could potentially afford both high JSC and VOC, the JSC was in fact relatively low and PCEs were limited to 56% because of the trade-off.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The trade-off between JSC and VOC is also strongly related to the match of the molecular orbital energy levels between the polymer and fullerene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the fundamental working mechanism of PSCs, the realization of both high JSC and VOC requires that the polymer must have both a narrower Eg and a deeper highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this inevitably results in a deeper lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level, diminishing the energy offset of the LUMOs between the polymer and fullerene (EL), which is considered as a driving force for the photoinduced charge separation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This eventually causes a loss of the driving force, in turn being detrimental to the PCE improvement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, synthetic chemists face a formidable challenge: to create new semiconducting polymers to manage the energetics between polymers and fullerenes and thus to minimize the trade-off.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recently, we have reported23,24 that a DA narrow bandgap polymer (PNTz4T, Eg=1.56 eV) based on quaterthiophene and naphtho1,2-c:5,6-cbis1,2,5thiadiazole (NTz) as the D and A units, respectively, showed as high as 10.1% PCE with a high JSC of 19.4 mA cm2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, VOC was limited to 0.710.74 V because of the moderately deep HOMO energy level of 5.14 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, Eloss in this system was 0.820.85 eV, which is typical of the semiconducting polymers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Naphtho1,2-c:5,6-cbis1,2,5oxadiazole (NOz, ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24), which is a new fused heterocycle as an oxygen analogue of NTz and was also independently developed by Zhang et al.26, can deepen both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels compared with NTz while maintaining the Eg, most likely as a result of the stronger electron negativity of oxygen than sulfur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we highlight that the use of a DA copolymer of quaterthiophene and NOz (PNOz4T, Fig 1a)24, with a narrow Eg (1.52 eV) similar to that of PNTz4T and deeper HOMO and LUMO energy levels, affords high PCEs of up to 8.9% along with a remarkably high VOC of 1 V in inverted PSCs combined with PCBM (PC61BM or PC71BM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, the Eloss in this system is 0.520.56 eV, which is among the smallest values for PSCs and approaches the value for inorganic solar cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also note that, interestingly, the PNOz4T/PCBM system achieves such high PCEs despite the fact that EL is 0.1 eV, which is smaller than the empirical threshold of 0.3 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we find that through the spectroscopic studies, the small EL will not be a limiting factor in the charge separation process, and there may be still room for improving the PCE in this system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results open doors for the solution of the trade-off issue and for the realization of PCEs exceeding 15%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Structures and properties of the polymers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Chemical

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Properties and energetics of the materials and the blend', 'PNOz4T was synthesized by polymerizing dibrominated dithienyl-NOz with long branched alkyl groups (2-decyltetradecyl) and distannylated bithiophene via the Stille coupling reaction (Supplementary Fig 1 and Note 1)24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PNOz4T was soluble in hot chlorinated benzenes, such as chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number-average (Mn) and weight-average (Mw) molecular weights evaluated by gel permeation chromatography at 140 °C were 57.2 and 417 kDa, respectively, and the polydispersity index (PDI) was 7.3 (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large PDI is likely due to the strong aggregation nature of the polymer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absorption spectra of PNTz4T and PNOz4T in the thin film are shown in Fig 1b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PNOz4T provided a slightly red-shifted spectrum compared with PNTz4T.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absorption maximum (max) was observed at 749 nm, and the absorption edge (edge) was determined to be 815 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both were 2030 nm longer than those of PNTz4T (max=721 nm, edge=793 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eg of PNOz4T was calculated to be 1.52 eV from edge, and was slightly smaller than that of PNTz4T (1.56 eV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1c depicts the cyclic voltammograms of PNTz4T, PNOz4T, PC61BM and PC71BM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HOMO and LUMO energy levels (EH and EL) were determined using the redox onset potential (vs Fc/Fc+) of cyclic voltammograms, which were measured for five times for each material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EH and EL of PNOz4T were estimated to be 5.48 (±0.007) eV and 3.65 (±0.014) eV, which were 0.34 eV and 0.19 eV deeper than those of PNTz4T (EH=5.14 (±0.022) eV, EL=3.46 (±0.022) eV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results indicate the strong electron deficiency of PNOz4T, which is consistent with the computation (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EHs of PC61BM and PC71BM were 5.85 (±0.019) eV and 5.77 (±0.016) eV, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EL of 3.77 eV was obtained for both PC61BM and PC71BM (s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  were ±0.015 and ±0.024, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values for PCBMs agree well with the reported values27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1d displays the energy diagrams of PNTz4T, PNOz4T and PCBM blend system using EHs and ELs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noted that whereas EL for PNTz4T (between PCBMs) is 0.31 eV, that for PNOz4T is 0.12 eV, which is much smaller than the widely referenced empirical threshold value of 0.3 eV (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the driving force of the photoinduced charge separation is reduced in the PNOz4T system compared with the PNTz4T system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that, however, the estimation of the energetics based on EH and EL evaluated by the measurements on the isolated polymer and PCBMs is considered to neglect the influence of exciton binding energy and other interfacial effects29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, the energy offset can be estimated by the difference of the excited state energy of the polymer and the charge transfer (CT) state energy (ECT) of the polymer/PCBM blend17,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we attempted to determine ECT of the blend films by means of the electroluminescence measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for the PNOz4T/PC71BM system, the emission band of the pure PNOz4T and the CT emission band of the PNOz4T/PC71BM blend system measured by the electroluminescence cannot be distinguished (Supplementary Fig 4), and thus ECT cannot be evaluated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the excited state of the polymer and the CT state of the blend are energetically very close, and thereby the energy offset is very small32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the small EL for the PNOz4T/PC71BM blend system measured by cyclic voltammetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This will be further examined later in this paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Solar cell properties', 'The solar cells were fabricated using an inverted architecture, indiumtin-oxide (ITO)/ZnO/PNOz4T:PCBM/MoOx/Ag, where the active layer was spin-coated from the blend solution in chlorobenzene, and the optimal active layer thickness was around 200 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2a,b depict the current density (J)voltage (V) curves and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the cells, respectively, and Table 1 summarizes the photovoltaic parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the driving force of photoinduced charge separation, EL, is smaller than the empirical threshold, the PNOz4T cells exhibited fairly high PCEs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the cells with the PNOz4T to PC61BM weight (p/n) ratio of 1:1, a significantly high VOC of 1.0 V was obtained (JSC=9.6 mA cm2, FF=0.59, PCE=5.6%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be mentioned that the VOC of 1.0 V is difficult to be achieved even with middle-to-wide bandgap polymers (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the increase of the PC61BM ratio to 1:1.51:3, although VOC was slightly decreased, a marked increase in JSC was observed and PCE was as high as 8.8% (JSC=14.6 mA cm2, VOC=0.97 V, FF=0.62) at the p/n ratio of 1:3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in PCE between the p/n ratios of 1:2 and 1:3 was marginal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum PCE in the PNOz4T cell was 8.9% (JSC=14.5 mA cm2, VOC=0.96 V, FF=0.64), which was obtained when PC71BM was used at the p/n ratio of 1:2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  JV curves of the PNOz4T/PC71BM cells and the corresponding photovolataic parameters are summarized in Supplementary Fig 5 and Table 1, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed VOCs of 0.961.0 V are higher by more than 0.2 V than those observed for the PNTz4T cells (VOC=0.710.74 V) (ref.

For the energy of the polymer-excited state, we use Eg following the previous studies by several groups17,32,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the energy offset defined as EgECT (Egeff) is 0.14 eV for the PNOz4T system and 0.49 eV for the PNTz4T system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that since Egeff is determined at 0 K, ECT at room temperature is typically larger by 0.10.2 eV than Egeff (refs 36, 37) and thus the actual EgECT is presumed to be negligibly small (0 eV) for the PNOz4T system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with our observation that the electroluminescence of the PNOz4T/PC71BM blend system is almost the same as that of the PNOz4T neat film as mentioned before.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By considering the small EL=0.12 eV estimated by electrochemistry and the negligibly small EgECT 0 eV, we can safely say that the driving force for the charge separation is quite small in the PNOz4T/PCBM system32,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Temperature dependent eVOC for a PNOz4T/PC71BM cell and a PNTz4T/PC71BM cell.The p/n ratio is 1:2 for both cells.Full size image', 'The PNOz4T cells showed EQEs surpassing 60% at the polymer max region, except for the cells that used PC61BM with the p/n ratio of 1:1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highest EQE of 66% was obtained when PC61BM was used with a p/n ratio of 1:3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These EQE values for the PNOz4T cells were lower than those for the PNTz4T cells (EQE 75% at max), which reflects the lower JSC despite the fact that PNOz4T has an absorption range, that is, Eg, similar to that for PNTz4T.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This issue will be further discussed later in this paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note here that, however, these EQE values are quite high for the polymer/PCBM systems with such a small energy offset, that is, EL or EgECT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, although the system of DPP-2Tz polymers/PC71BM was reported to have a small EL of 0.090.21 eV and provide a high VOC of more than 0.9 V, it only showed low EQEs of 540%, which resulted in a low JSC of 2.08.8 mA cm2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly high EQEs with the small energy offset were previously reported by Vandewal and co-workers, in which isoindigo-based polymers with EgECT of 0.0 and 0.1 eV showed internal quantum efficiencies of 45% (EQE 30%) and 87% (EQE 60%) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in this case, PCEs were limited to 4.5% (VOC=0.91 V) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  40) and 6.3% (VOC=0.70 V), respectively41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, in demonstrating high PCEs of 9% with a high VOC of 1 V, small Eloss and a small energy offset at the same time, PNOz4T is regarded as quite a unique narrow bandgap polymer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Charge transport properties', 'The charge carrier mobility of PNOz4T was evaluated for hole-only devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PNOz4T:PCBM/MoOx/Ag) by using the space-charge-limited current model, where the p/n ratios were 1:3 and 1:2 for PC61BM and PC71BM, respectively (Supplementary Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blend films with PC61BM and PC71BM exhibited hole mobilities of 2.4 × 103 cm2 V1 s1 and 1.7 × 103 cm2 V1 s1, respectively, which are high for semiconducting polymers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm the balance of the charge carrier transport between hole and electron, we also fabricated electron-only devices using the blend films (ITO/ZnO/PNOz4T:PCBM/LiF/Al) with the same p/n ratios as the hole-only devices (Supplementary Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electron mobility was also of order 103 cm2 V1 s1;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We discuss the origin of the relatively low EQE (60%) and JSC (below 15 mA cm2) of the PNOz4T/PCBM system in comparison with those of the PNTz4T/PCBM system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The photoluminescence spectrum of the PNOz4T/PC71BM blend film showed that the photoluminescence signal for PNOz4T was not completely quenched.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the exciton diffusion to and/or the charge transfer at the polymer/fullerene interface are the main limiting process for the low EQE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the delayed charge generation with a time constant of as long as 100 ps observed in the transient absorption measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the TEM images clearly showed that the PNOz4T/PC71BM blend film exhibited larger phase-separated domains than the PNTz4T/PC71BM blend film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that the low efficiency of the PNOz4T system originates mainly from the exciton diffusion loss because of the large domain size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is further supported by the observation of the polaron signals at 0 ps, which suggests that the energetical driving force for the charge separation is sufficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note here that in the PNOz4T/PC71BM films, transient absorption was measured at an excitation wavelength of 800 nm, which is around edge of PNOz4T, to generate relaxed singlet excitons with no excess energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, charge generation via hot excitons can be ruled out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We, therefore, believe that the small EL and EgECT in this system would not be a limiting factor but be rather sufficient for the photoinduced charge generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that further optimization of the phase separation structure can lead to the improvement of charge generation and thus overall PCE in this system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we have shown that the use of PNOz4T, an NOz-based polymer, demonstrates as high as 8.9% PCE in single-junction inverted cells, along with a remarkably high VOC of up to 1 V despite the fact that the polymer had a narrow bandgap of 1.52 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We primarily highlighted that the Eloss in this system, 0.520.56 eV, were found to be among the smallest values for PSCs, which were smaller than the empirical limit of 0.6 eV referenced to date, and were close to the values for inorganic solar cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another interesting feature is that, closely related to the small Eloss, the energy offset (EL and EgECT) that is a driving force for the photoinduced charge separation is very small.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, EL, a widely referenced important parameter in designing p-type semiconducting polymers, was 0.12 eV, which is much smaller than the empirical threshold value of 0.3 eV for efficient photoinduced charge separation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, to the best of our knowledge, PNOz4T is the highest performing narrow bandgap polymer in terms of having several unconventional aspects at the same time: VOC of 1 V and Eloss of 0.5 eV (and almost negligible energy offset), which are among the highest and smallest values for PSCs reported so far, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study of charge generation dynamics in comparison with the PNTz4T system revealed that the relatively low EQE (66%) of the PNOz4T system originates in the relatively large domain size of the blend films and not in the small EL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is expected that further modification of the polymer structure and/or optimization of the morphology of the blend film can still improve EQE and thus JSC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although further studies are necessary to understand why such a high performance is achievable even with a small energy offset, our results open the door to the realization of both high JSC and VOC at the same time, and thus the high PCE such as 15% in single-junction cells.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
