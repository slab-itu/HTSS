Hotspots of aberrant enhancer activity punctuate the colorectal cancer epigenome  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In addition to mutations in genes, aberrant enhancer element activity at non-coding regions of the genome is a key driver of tumorigenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we perform epigenomic enhancer profiling of a cohort of more than forty genetically diverse human colorectal cancer (CRC) specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using normal colonic crypt epithelium as a comparator, we identify enhancers with recurrently gained or lost activity across CRC specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the enhancers highly recurrently activated in CRC, most are constituents of super enhancers, are occupied by AP-1 and cohesin complex members, and originate from primed chromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many activate known oncogenes, and CRC growth can be mitigated through pharmacologic inhibition or genome editing of these loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nearly half of all GWAS CRC risk loci co-localize to recurrently activated enhancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicate that the CRC epigenome is defined by highly recurrent epigenetic alterations at enhancers which activate a common, aberrant transcriptional programme critical for CRC growth and survival.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The development of cancer is closely associated with the accumulation of not only oncogene and tumour suppressor mutations, but also epigenetic changes that alter chromatin structure and lead to dysregulated gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mammalian cells, active gene enhancer elements are contained within open chromatin marked with high levels of mono-methylated lysine 4 and acetylated lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K4me1 and H3K27ac)1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously demonstrated that malignant transformation of colon is accompanied by widespread locus-specific gains and losses of enhancer activity, which we termed variant enhancer loci (VELs)3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent studies have shown that colorectal cancer (CRC) and other forms of cancer contain clusters of aberrantly active gene enhancers called super enhancers that drive dysregulated expression of oncogenes4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, both super enhancers and typical enhancers are enriched for SNPs that confer genetic predisposition to cancer3,4,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these studies suggest that aberrant enhancer activity is a fundamental driver of tumour formation and maintenance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To date, a handful of different tumour types and cell lines have been molecularly profiled at the level of the enhancer epigenome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, thorough characterizations of the enhancer epigenomes of a single type of cancer, including CRC, have been limited9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, because the cell type of origin for most cancers is either unknown or difficult to obtain, few studies have interrogated tumour enhancer landscapes in relation to an appropriate normal comparator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the degree of aberrant enhancer activity in most forms of cancer remains unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, it is unclear whether regions of altered enhancer activity are heterogeneous across tumours of a given type or if tumours contain recurrently altered enhancers that are functionally analogous to well documented mutational hotspots10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of a normal comparator also precludes the ability to interrogate the chromatin status of such potential hotspots before malignant transformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, while there are strong correlations between cell type-specific enhancers and tumour risk SNPs identified through GWAS, the extent of these correlations for a given tumour type is difficult to determine without a complete reference map.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also essential to study the epigenomes of both the normal cells and the tumour to determine the cellular context(s) in which the cis-regulatory SNPs likely function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, whether aberrant enhancers in cancer represent drivers of tumorigenesis or are simply bystanders accrued during malignant transformation remains to be investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we identified differential enhancer usage between normal colonic crypts and more than 40 CRC specimens, representing the most extensive delineation of enhancer alterations in a single type of cancer to date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that thousands of enhancers were activated or silenced more frequently across the CRC cell lines than expected by chance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These recurrently altered enhancers were associated with dysregulated expression of predicted target genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental manipulation of aberrantly gained enhancers, either by targeted genome editing or by pharmacologic inhibition, counteracted the associated gene overexpression, indicating a direct link between enhancer alteration and oncogenic patterns of gene misexpression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recurrently gained enhancers frequently arise from sites of poised chromatin in normal colon tissue, overlap the majority of CRC risk loci identified by GWAS, and are commonly occupied by a set of factors including AP-1 and cohesin complexes, which may provide clues to the mechanisms underlying epigenetic dysregulation at enhancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately half of the recurrent gained VELs are present in early adenomas, suggesting that the full enhancer signature may be required for progression to full-blown CRC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that the formation of CRC is accompanied by a signature pattern of epigenetic changes at enhancer elements that contributes to tumour risk, progression, growth and survival.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Epigenomic profiling reveals enhancer changes in CRC', 'We combined 36 new and six previously published datasets3, all uniformly processed, to obtain a set of high-resolution H3K27ac ChIP-seq profiles on seven freshly isolated purified specimens of normal colonic epithelial crypts, 31 genetically diverse CRC cell lines representing all clinical stages, and four primary colorectal tumours directly resected from patients (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also performed H3K4me1 ChIP-seq and DNaseI Hypersensitivity (DHS) mapping on normal colonic crypts and a subset of the CRC cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose to use cell lines for our discovery phase analyses and tumour tissue for validation based on the knowledge that heterogeneity of tumour tissue samples and varying degrees of stromal contamination can skew genomic analyses, particularly those involving clustering, correlation and differential analyses11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each sample was input matched and sequenced to a mean depth of 38.5 million uniquely aligned reads (Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A representative browser view of the H3K27ac ChIP-seq data is shown in Fig 1a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detected a mean of 14,406 promoters across all colon samples, defined by H3K27ac peaks (MACS P less_than 1 × 109, see Methods) located within 2 kb of transcription start sites (TSS) (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean number of H3K27ac peaks located distal to promoters ( greater than 2 kb from TSS) was 32,136.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained when a more conservative distance of 1 kb from the nearest TSS was used for promoters, with only 15% of peaks per sample located between 1 and 2 kb of a TSS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through overlaps of H3K27ac peaks with H3K4me1 and DHS peaks from representative samples, we determined that the majority of the distal H3K27ac peaks bear signature features of active enhancer elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, on average 82% of H3K27ac peaks were co-enriched for H3K4me1, and 5564% were contained within open chromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Epigenetic alterations at enhancers distinguish CRC from normal colon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

relative to the normal colonic crypts, we used DESeq12 and a BenjaminiHochberg corrected P value threshold of  less_than 0.05 (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DESeq approach minimizes potential false positives due to discrepancies in sequence read depths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In keeping with previous terminology, we term these regions VELs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gained VELs were defined as sites in which the H3K27ac mark was more enriched in CRC than in the normal crypts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lost VELs were defined as sites more enriched for H3K27ac in crypts than in CRC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exemplar loci are shown in Fig 1d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cases, the percentage of gained and lost VELs within 2 kb of TSSs was far fewer than those more distal to TSSs (6784% at distal loci, MannWhitneyWilcoxon (MWW) P less_than 1 × 1010).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VELs were also enriched for distal, putative enhancer sites compared with the overall distribution of H3K27ac peaks (2, P less_than 1 × 1030), suggesting distal regulatory elements may be particularly prone to aberrant changes in cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gained VELs showed concordant increases in H3K4me1 levels and were often located in open chromatin sensitive to DNaseI digestion (Fig 1d, Supplementary Fig 1A,B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lost VELs showed concordant decreases in H3K4me1 and were located in closed chromatin (Fig 1d, Supplementary Fig 1A,C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assigned VELs to their putative target genes using PreSTIGE, an experimentally validated computational method that predicts enhancergene interactions based on integrated enhancer profiles and gene expression data13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative to normal colon, genes associated with gained VELs showed elevated expression in CRC, while lost VEL genes were broadly repressed, and the magnitude of the change in expression positively correlated with the number of VELs per gene (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined that our cohort of 31 CRC samples captured 89% of all possible lost VELs and 80% of all possible gained VELs in CRC, indicating that our VEL detection approached saturation (Supplementary Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We predicted that each additional cell line sequenced after 31 samples would add  less_than 1% to the total number of unique VELs identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentage of VELs in each CRC cell line relative to all enhancers (gained, lost, and unchanged) varied widely among CRC samples, from 39 to 88% (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unsupervised clustering showed that the enhancer epigenomes of the normal crypts were highly distinct from those of CRC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CRC cell lines formed two clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Members of one cluster were considerably more closely correlated to one another (median Spearmans correlation  0.73) and to the normal crypts (median  0.65) than members of the other cluster (median  0.61 and 0.54, respectively) (Fig 1g, compare green boxes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The more correlated, crypt-like cluster was more enriched for early stage CRCs than the less crypt-like cluster (Z test for two-proportions P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The less crypt-like cluster was also male biased (Z test P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The clusters failed to correlate with microsatellite instability status, tumour side, patient ethnicity, or age at diagnosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that colon cancer progression is accompanied by extensive remodelling of the enhancer epigenome, with early stage tumours generally preserving a considerable portion of the normal enhancer epigenome and appearing more crypt-like than late stage tumours that have undergone a more dramatic shift.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Highly recurrent VELs dysregulate key cancer genes', 'Upon visual inspection of ChIP-seq profiles, we noticed hotspots, that is, genomic intervals harbouring VELs shared by the vast majority or all of the CRC samples, suggesting they were positively selected during malignant transformation of the colon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An example is shown in Fig 2a, where multiple gained VELs at the FOXQ1 locus are evident in nearly all CRC samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To systematically assess VEL recurrence, we used permutation analyses to identify VELs common among a greater proportion of CRC samples than expected by random chance at various stringent false discovery rates (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enhancers gained in 10 or more CRC lines (G10+) or lost in 14 or more CRC lines (L14+) were significantly recurrent (permutation P less_than 0.001, FDR less_than 0.05; Supplementary Data 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detected 75 gained VELs and 67 lost VELs common to all 31 CRC cell lines (FDR less_than 0.0001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More than 90% of the most highly recurrent VELs (present in 30 or all 31 of the CRC lines) validated in primary tumours and are therefore unlikely to be cell culture artifacts (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of genes associated with recurrent gained VELs was elevated across primary CRCs relative to normal, while lost VEL gene expression was repressed (Fig 2d, MWW P less_than 1 × 1043).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, dysregulated genes associated with recurrent VELs were more likely to validate as dysregulated in patient tumours than misexpressed genes not associated with VELs (2, P less_than 1 × 1010).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, genes associated with the most recurrent VELs were more dysregulated than genes associated with less recurrent VELs (MWW P less_than 1 × 1031; Supplementary Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To directly characterize the regulatory effects of VELs, we performed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption of three recurrently gained enhancers predicted to upregulate PHLDA1 in HCT116 cells (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the unedited parental cell line, PHLDA1 levels were reduced by more than 60% in each of the three the cell lines containing the edited enhancers (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a negative control, we also used CRISPR/Cas9 to disrupt four sites at the MYC locus that had relatively weak signal in HCT116 cells, but were identified as robustly gained VELs in other CRC cell lines (Supplementary Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The disruption of these four sites did not significantly impact MYC levels (Supplementary Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together these results suggest that VELs have a significant regulatory effect on the predicted target genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: VELs are recurrent and associated with altered gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Normalized

hormone secretion, DNA replication, small molecule transport and drug metabolism (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene ontology terms enriched among lost VEL genes included small RNA regulation, ion homoeostasis, ion transport, drug metabolism and cell transporter activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes associated with the most common VELs included novel genes and several known oncogenes and tumour suppressors implicated in CRC as well as other forms of cancer, including MYC10,16, BMP4 (refs 17, 18), PHLDA1 (refs 19, 20, 21, 22), SOX9 (refs 23, 24, 25) and TRIB3 (refs 26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several of the recurrent VEL genes have been shown through functional studies to enhance tumorgenicity in CRC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, overexpression of FOXQ1 has been shown to increase CRC tumour growth in mice28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduced expression of recurrent lost VEL genes, E2F2 and SIRT6, is associated with increased tumour growth in CRC28,29,30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these findings are consistent with and extend our previous studies3 indicating that the CRC epigenome is defined by a signature set of highly recurrent epigenetic alterations at enhancer elements, or hotspots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highly significant recurrence of these enhancer aberrations suggest that these loci may be under positive selection for acquisition of enhancer function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is further evidenced by the association of these hotspots with a common aberrant transcriptional programme defined by a broad range of cellular processes that are frequent hallmarks of colorectal and other types of cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'AP-1 and cohesin factors enriched at recurrent gained VELs', 'Recurrent gained VELs often contained exceptionally high levels of H3K27ac and formed clusters of individual enhancers, reminiscent of super-enhancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations prompted us to systematically investigate the relationship between VELs and super-enhancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To define super-enhancers in each sample, we implemented the ROSE script on H3K27ac ChIP-seq signals (Supplementary Fig 3A), and then determined the fraction of gained and lost VELs that were constituents of super-enhancers as a function of VEL recurrence rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty-four to 44% of lost VELs were constituents of super-enhancers in normal colon crypt, and this percentage did not scale with the lost VEL recurrence rate (Supplementary Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In marked contrast, the proportion of gained VELs that were super-enhancer constituents progressively increased with VEL recurrence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the most highly recurrent gained VELs, 96% were constituents of super-enhancers, compared with  less_than 20% of gained VELs unique to a single CRC line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We next set out to identify transcription factors and other proteins that occupy the recurrent gained VELs and potentially activate expression of the associated genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We began by identifying transcription factor motifs enriched in recurrent gained VELs compared with unique gained VELs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, five of the top six most enriched factors were members of the AP-1 complex (HOMER P less_than 1 × 10300; Supplementary Data 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AP-1 factors mediate cell state transitions during development and in response to myriad environmental cues32 that are often exploited by cancer cells for growth and survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next integrated the CRC VEL profiles with publicly available ChIP-seq data of more than 400 proteins in CRC cells33, looking for factors that showed the greatest increase of enrichment with VEL recurrence (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the motif search, AP-1 factors ranked among the top, including JUND and JUN in the top 2%, and ATF2 in the top 6%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three core components of the cohesin complex, RAD21, SMC1A and SMC3, as well as the cohesin loading factor, NIPBL, were also among the top ranking factors (rank greater than 96th percentile).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cohesin complex facilitates physical interactions among individual constituents of super-enhancers and their target genes34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Factors ranking highly in this analysis also included several that were themselves targets of highly recurrent VELs, such as MYC, ETS2 and CDX2 (rank 99th, 97th and 94th percentile, respectively), indicative of autoregulatory loops driving expression of these factors, as has been previously demonstrated for super enhancer-associated genes9,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recurrent gained VELs are hotspots for CRC GWAS risk loci', 'We next sought genetic evidence that recurrent VELs are relevant to CRC by intersecting various categories of VELs and enhancers with 75 loci associated with genetic predisposition to CRC through GWAS (Supplementary Data 5)37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous results, the majority of risk loci (76.0%; risk SNP and SNPs in tight linkage disequilibrium, see Methods) reside in a putative H3K27ac enhancer in crypts or CRC3,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, two-thirds of these (48% of all CRC risk loci) mapped to recurrent gained VELs, most of which were highly recurrent, that is, common to 19 or more CRC samples (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through variant set enrichment (VSE) analyses3,38 we confirmed that CRC risk locus variants were most enriched in highly recurrent gained VELs, and that this enrichment was specific for recurrent gained VELs and not recurrent lost VELs or other genomic features such as 5UTRs, exons or introns (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Promoter enrichment was borderline significant, but not to the degree of recurrent or highly recurrent gained VELs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We highlight an exemplar locus containing two independent disease association signals that lie in recurrent gained VELs downstream of DUSP10 (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full list of risk loci that overlapped recurrent gained VELs and their putative target genes is shown in Fig 3d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also determined that the proportion of VELs containing CRC risk SNPs scaled with the recurrence of the VELs, such that highly recurrent VELs common to 19 or more CRC lines were 7.8-fold more likely to overlap a risk locus than VELs unique to a single CRC line (Fig 3e, Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genomic convergence between recurrent VELs and CRC risk loci provides genetic evidence that the recurrent gained VELs are relevant in colorectal tumorigenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the results imply that a considerable fraction of the CRC GWAS signals are cis-regulatory variants active only in the tumour, as has been previously proposed7,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with either of two possibilities: that the CRC risk SNPs promote aberrant gain of enhancer function, or that the SNPs alter the activity of the

active chromatin states also occurs in terminally differentiated cells in response to both intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the notion that malignant transformation fundamentally represents a major transition in cell state, and that tumour expression programs are often responsive to microenvironmental cues, we investigated the chromatin status of gained VELs before malignant transformation, through analysis of H3K4me1 and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq data from the normal colon crypts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of non-recurrent gained VELs (VELs unique to one CRC line), 20% contained significant levels of H3K4me1 in the normal crypts and were considered primed (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Less than 2% contained both H3K4me1 and H3K27me3 and were considered poised.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority gained both H3K4me1 and H3K27ac marks and appear to be newly commissioned in CRC, lacking both H3K4me1 and H3K27ac in the normal and gaining both of these marks in CRC.

the recurrent VELs were not newly commissioned, but rather that they existed within the normal crypts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests a reawakening of developmental or environmentally responsive

the preceding results we hypothesized that a subset have a direct role in establishing or maintaining the CRC phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of the recurrent gained VELs were super-enhancers acquired in CRC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A handful of super enhancer-associated genes, including MYC and OCA-B, have been shown to be dependency genes in multiple myeloma, and these genes are often selectively downregulated in response to BET inhibition5,6,44,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This led us to hypothesize that genes associated with highly recurrent gained VELs may indeed be CRC dependency genes that are similarly amenable to downregulation in response to pharmacologic BET inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore used the BRD4 inhibitor, JQ1 (refs 44, 46), as a tool to assess the functional role of the gene set demarcated by recurrent gained VELs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested 20 CRC cell lines in culture, which were all relatively sensitive to JQ1, showing a broad range of IC50s ranging from 100 to 3,800 nM (Fig 6a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These IC50s are below the range reported for JQ1-resistant cancers of various origins47,48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Doseresponse curves for one of the most and least responsive CRC cell lines are shown in Fig 6a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flow cytometry analyses indicated that CRC cells treated with JQ1 underwent both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Supplementary Fig 6), consistent with responses observed in other cancers45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next tested JQ1 efficacy in mouse xenograft models of three CRC cell lines that showed variable responses in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  JQ1 had similar effects in all three xenograft models, significantly slowing tumour growth (Fig 6c, Supplementary Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is unsurprising that the xenografts responded similarly to JQ1, given that the previously reported serum concentrations for the dosing regimen used far exceed the IC50s calculated in vitro44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate whether the growth-inhibiting effects of JQ1 were associated with a specific transcriptional response, we performed transcriptomic analysis before and after treatment with JQ1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested two highly sensitive, two moderately sensitive, and two less sensitive CRC cell lines at four time points after JQ1 treatment (0.5, 1, 6, 24 h) as well as untreated controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then analysed the transcriptional response of genes associated with gained VELs and recurrent gained VELs relative to all expressed genes as controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that genes associated with multiple gained VELs were particularly upregulated in CRC relative to normal (Fig 1e), we also quantified the expression of these clustered VEL genes following JQ1 treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the six-hour time point, gained VEL genes were significantly reduced in expression in all but the two least sensitive CRC cell lines (Fig 6d, Supplementary Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recurrent gained VELs showed an even greater degree of downregulation, with genes associated with multiple recurrent gained VELs showing the most dramatic response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, recurrent gained VELs mark a set of genes that are specifically downregulated following JQ1 treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The response of the recurrent VEL genes was markedly attenuated in two less sensitive CRC lines compared with the two most sensitive CRC lines (Fig 6d, Supplementary Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next analysed whether the difference in the response was related to the specific genes targeted by recurrent VELs in the most and least sensitive lines, or the degree of responsiveness of the same gene targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that 8994% of the highly recurrent gained VEL genes were shared between the two most and two least sensitive CRC lines, however the response of these shared genes was far greater in the two sensitive lines (P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that the phenotype of growth inhibition by JQ1 is associated with recurrent VEL gene response, and not necessarily differences in the targeted gene sets between sensitivity groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Recurrent VEL

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The classic genetic model of CRC tumorigenesis, or the Vogelgram, states that mutation of APC initiates the conversion of normal colon epithelium to the early adenoma stage51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The progression from adenoma to frank carcinoma is accompanied by additional mutations in other genes including KRAS, SMAD4, PIK3CA and TP53 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model is well supported by exome sequencing studies showing that these genes lie in mutational hotspots and myriad functional studies support their role in malignancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results presented here indicate that recurrent oncogenic events are not limited to the CRC genome, but that there are also hotspots of frequent epigenetic dysregulation at enhancer elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found thousands of VELs that were more recurrent than expected for passenger-like events, suggesting they were under strong positive selection during the process of tumorigenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, similar to recurrent DNA mutations, the recurrently altered enhancer elements deregulate potential tumour suppressors and oncogenes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the number of recurrent enhancer alterations dwarfs that of recurrent mutational events by as much as 10-fold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these findings indicate that epigenomic enhancer dysregulation occurs in parallel to the well described DNA mutations that occur at canonical proto-oncogenes and tumour suppressors during malignant transformation of colon crypt cells into CRC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We provide several lines of evidence that many of the recurrently acquired enhancer changes in CRC are functional and relevant to the CRC phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, through integration with transcriptome data from both CRC cell lines and primary tumours, we find that the recurrently acquired enhancers activate genes that are commonly elevated in CRC, suggesting VEL acquisition is a major mechanism by which tumour cells alter expression to gain a growth or survival advantage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several of these genes are known oncogenes previously implicated in CRC by TCGA and others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This includes MYC, the primary effector of Wnt- catenin pathway activity in CRC16 and a central node connecting dysregulation of Wnt- catenin and other signalling pathways to downstream patterns of misexpression10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Others genes associated with recurrent VELs are novel, and by association may also be important in CRC pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we demonstrate a strong convergence between the recurrently acquired enhancers and genetic loci associated with risk to CRC through GWAS, with recurrent gained VELs far more likely to harbour a GWAS risk SNP than non-recurrent VELs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, we demonstrate that the growth of CRC cells can be mitigated by targeted knockout of individual genes activated by the recurrent VELs, or with a BET inhibitor that selectively and potently suppresses genes associated with the recurrently acquired VELs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these findings indicate that the recurrently acquired enhancers drive a specific transcriptional programme that both specifies and maintains the CRC phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'What drives formation of the recurrent VELs and why these specific enhancers are recurrently activated remain outstanding questions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility is that VELs are formed through somatic mutations that introduce transcription factor binding sites, similar to somatic mutations that result in recruitment of MYB to the TAL1 enhancer previously described in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Copy number alterations are another possibility54, although it is worth noting that ChIP-seq peaks in our study were input-normalized, and therefore enhancer signals derived from copy number alterations are most likely excluded from our analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, given that the frequency of recurrent VELs exceeds that of all but the most common mutations in CRC, DNA variation alone cannot fully account for all recurrent VELs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Integration of somatic mutations derived from whole genome sequencing of matched tumour/normal pairs with the enhancer landscapes presented here could help reveal any potential interplay between the CRC genome and enhancer epigenome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, functional data annotating the non-coding genome, such as that presented in this study, will be critical for the interpretation of WGS data in CRC and other types of cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternative hypothesis is that recurrent VELs form downstream of primary mutational events which deregulate a common signalling mechanism, such as Wnt/-catenin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we found that only a subset of the recurrent VELs are present at the adenoma stage, suggesting that additional events beyond deregulated Wnt/-catenin signalling are required for establishment of the full VEL signature and transition to the carcinoma stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies designed to profile the enhancer epigenome in colon cells immediately following complete loss of the APC gene and after each of the subsequent mutational events that accompany the stepwise formation of CRC could help shed light on these possible mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Lastly, while there is a growing body of evidence implicating super-enhancer function in malignancy, the concept that super enhancers represent a distinct class of enhancers which constitute a new regulatory paradigm distinct from typical enhancers remains controversial55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gained and lost VELs presented here were identified by an unbiased survey of the CRC enhancer epigenome and evaluated using metrics that were, by design, analogous to accepted methods for identifying likely driver DNA mutations, such as recurrence, association with known cancer genes and oncogenic pathways, and impact on gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regions containing clusters of enhancers repeatedly emerged, throughout our analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recurrent gained VELs often occurred in clusters and in fact, the most recurrent gained VELs were almost universally constituents of super-enhancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enhancer landscape around known oncogenes was often densely populated with gained VELs, such as shown at the FOXQ1 locus (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, genes associated with multiple gained VELs were not only more upregulated in CRC than genes associated with a single VEL, they were also more responsive to inhibition by JQ1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, even though our method of identifying VELs made no prior assumptions about genomic distribution, our findings converge with several others4,54,56,57,58 to suggest that clusters of recurrent enhancer activation have disproportionately strong effects on oncogenesis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

recurrence at or above that number that overlapped each factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using linear modelling in R, best fit lines were calculated for this data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine which factors showed the greatest increase of binding site enrichment with recurrence, factors were ranked by the slope of their best fit lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Association with CRC GWAS risk loci', 'SNPs associated with CRC by GWAS were retrieved from the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalogue (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/) on June 15, 2015 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Linkage disequilibrium (LD) information was pulled from HapMap, and used to identify SNPs in tight LD (LOD greater than 2, D greater than 0.99) with each GWAS lead SNP in the population in which the SNP was found to be associated with CRC risk (CEU, JPT or YRI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GWAS SNPs that lacked any LD SNPs were removed, leaving 75 lead SNPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All analyses were performed with each lead SNP and its set of LD SNPs considered as a unit that is, if a genomic feature overlapped a lead SNP or any of its LD SNPs, then the feature and lead SNP were considered associated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VSE was performed as previously described3,13,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, 1,000 sets of 75 SNPs were randomly selected such that the number of LD SNPs matched the CRC risk SNP set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion of the random SNPs associated with each genomic feature of interest was calculated, and the distribution of the randoms was used to generate a P value for enrichment (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Predicted target genes of SNP-associated VELs were determined using PreSTIGE (as described above), or by nearest expressed gene for VELs without PreSTIGE predictions, as well as previous publications71,72,73,74,75.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'JQ1 experiments', '2,5005,000 cells per well were plated in a 96-well plate and the following day were treated in triplicate or quadruplicate
