Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Electron spins of diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres are important quantum resources for nanoscale sensing and quantum information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining NV spins with levitated optomechanical resonators will provide a hybrid quantum system for novel applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we optically levitate a nanodiamond and demonstrate electron spin control of its built-in NV centres in low vacuum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe that the strength of electron spin resonance (ESR) is enhanced when the air pressure is reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To better understand this system, we investigate the effects of trap power and measure the absolute internal temperature of levitated nanodiamonds with ESR after calibration of the strain effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observe that oxygen and helium gases have different effects on both the photoluminescence and the ESR contrast of nanodiamond NV centres, indicating potential applications of NV centres in oxygen gas sensing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results pave the way towards a levitated spinoptomechanical system for studying macroscopic quantum mechanics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'With electron spin states accessible by visible lasers and microwave radiation1,2,3, diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres have broad applications in quantum information4,5,6 and nanoscale sensing of magnetic field7,8,9, temperature10,11, and beyond12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining such NV spin systems with mechanical resonators14,15 will provide a hybrid system with versatile functions16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, several authors proposed to levitate a nanodiamond with a built-in NV centre in vacuum as a novel hybrid spinoptomechanical system for creating large quantum superposition states17,18, testing quantum wavefunction collapse models17,18,19 and quantum gravity20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A levitated nanodiamond will also be an ultrasensitive torque detector21 and mass spectrometer at room temperature22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These proposals are inspired by recent progresses in optomechanics of levitated pure dielectric (mainly silica) particles23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30, which show optical levitation in vacuum can isolate the mechanical motion of a dielectric particle from the environment to improve the mechanical quality factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Nanodiamonds have been optically trapped in liquid31,32, atmospheric air33 and low vacuum21,34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, the electron spin resonance (ESR) of optically levitated nanodiamonds has been demonstrated in atmospheric air34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The angular trapping and torsional vibration of an optically levitated nanodiamond have also been observed, which are important for controlling the orientations of NV spins21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The next key step towards realizing these ambitious proposals17,18,20,22 is to control the NV electron spin of a levitated nanodiamond in a vacuum environment, which has not been demonstrated before.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we demonstrate the electron spin control and direct temperature measurement of NV centres in an optically levitated nanodiamond in low vacuum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work is enabled by using a 1,550-nm trapping laser.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the 1,550-nm laser is more benign to the photoluminescence of NV centres than a 1,064-nm trapping laser34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One would usually expect that the ESR signal of an optically levitated nanodiamond in vacuum to be weaker than that in atmospheric air due to laser heating in vacuum36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our surprise, the ESR contrast of an optically levitated nanodiamond is enhanced in a vacuum environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We attribute this ESR enhancement to the reduction of low-quality negatively charged NV centres near the surface due to the reduction of oxygen surface termination37,38,39,40, and a moderate increase of the temperature that quenches low-quality surface NV centres41 without significantly affecting high-quality NV centres at the centre of the nanodiamond36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observe that oxygen (O2) and helium (He) gases have different effects on the photoluminescence and ESR contrast of nanodiamond NV centres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observed effects are reversible, indicating that nanodiamond NV centres can be used for oxygen gas sensing13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To better understand this system, we investigate the effects of trapping laser on ESR and measure the absolute temperature of levitated nanodiamonds in vacuum with ESR10,36 after calibration of the strain effect13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability to remotely measure the internal temperature of a levitated nanodiamond will have applications in investigating non-equilibrium thermodynamics25,42,43.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Optical levitation of nanodiamonds', 'In our experiment, a nanodiamond with a diameter about 100 nm is optically trapped inside a vacuum chamber (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first launch a mixture of commercial nanodiamonds and water to the trapping region with an ultrasonic nebulizer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The water microdroplets evaporate and a nanodiamond will be captured by a tightly focused 500 mW, 1,550 nm laser beam after waiting for a few minutes (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a nanodiamond is captured, we evacuate the air in the chamber by a turbomolecular pump.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A trapped nanodiamond will eventually be lost when the air pressure is below a critical value, which is a few torr for commercial nanodiamonds that we used (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1:

centres.Full size image', 'Effects of trapping laser on ESR', 'For an optically levitated nanodiamond, one needs to consider effects of the trapping laser while studying its NV centres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigate this effect by measuring the fluorescence spectra and ESR spectra at different trapping powers (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We excite the trapped nanodiamond with a 532-nm laser and collect its fluorescent signal by a spectrometer with an electron multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) camera with a single-photon sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To study the ESR, we excite the electron spin states by microwave radiation delivered by a coplanar waveguide antenna (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The normalized fluorescence signal IPL of the ESR spectrum is the ratio of total fluorescence count with and without the microwave excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resonance peaks of electron spin transition occur at the microwave frequencies of minimum IPL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ESR contrast is defined as 1IPL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2a,b, both the fluorescent signal and the ESR contrast decrease when the trapping power increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand these phenomena, we need to consider two primary effects associated with the trapping laser: heating44 and photo-induced ionization when a 532-nm laser is also present45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2:

with the nanodiamond marked as blue circles in c, which has a small temperature change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) At the initial trapping power of 500 mW, the internal temperature of the nanodiamond ranges between 300 and 400 K depending on individual nanodiamonds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the trapping power reduces, the internal temperature of the nanodiamond approaches the room temperature (296 K).

'Since the absorption of the trapping laser increases temperature, a higher trapping power leads to a higher temperature of the nanodiamond (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The visible fluorescent signal comes from the radiative decay transition 3E  3A2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is also a competing process that the excited state 3E may relax to the ground state 3A2 through nonradiative process with metastable states 1E and 1A1 (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because a high temperature enhances the nonradiative decay36, it weakens the visible fluorescence strength (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Besides heating, the 1,550-nm trapping laser can cause photo-induced ionization of NV to NV0 when the 532-nm laser is on45,46,47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1b, the 532-nm laser excites the NV centres from the ground state 3A2 to the excited state 3E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the separation between the excited state and the conduction band is 0.67 eV (corresponding to a vacuum wavelength of 1,880 nm)45, the 1,550-nm trapping beam can excite electrons from the excited state 3E to the conduction band and consequently ionize NV to NV0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because high trapping power increases the ionization rate from NV to NV0, the fluorescence signal from NV will be reduced as seen in Fig 2a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar effects have been observed for laser wavelength 1,064 nm and below33,44,45,46,47,48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the 1,550-nm laser is better than a 1,064-nm laser for the nanodiamond NV centres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More than 70% of bare nanodiamonds trapped by a 1,550-nm laser show a strong fluorescence signal, while only a few percent of bare nanodiamonds (even though each nanodiamond contains about 500 NV centres on average) and 1020% silica-coated nanodiamonds trapped by a 1,064-nm laser produce photoluminescence33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ionization not only reduces the fluorescence strength, but also lessens the ESR contrast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the recombination of NV0 to NV occurs45, the probability of NV0 ending up in |ms=0 state will be 1/3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus the ionization due to trapping laser will reduce the overall population of ms=0 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  50) and reduces the ESR contrast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'ESR in vacuum', 'Since nanodiamond temperature increases in vacuum, the ESR spectrum shifts to the left as shown in Fig 3a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From atmospheric pressure to 31 torr, the diamond temperature can rise from 300 K to above 450 K (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the mean free path of gas molecules is larger than the size of the nanodiamond, the cooling due to the surrounding gas is proportional to the pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So the increase of the temperature of the nanodiamond is inversely proportional to the pressure:  (see Methods), as shown by the solid curves in Fig 3b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the temperature rises in vacuum, one would expect the ESR contrast to decrease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Counter intuitively, the data show that the ESR contrasts of levitated nanodiamonds increase by more than a factor of 2 when the pressure is decreased from atmospheric pressure to 31 torr (Fig 3a,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This important phenomenon has not been observed before since the ESR of a levitated nanodiamond has not been studied in a vacuum environment before our work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latest relevant work reported the ESR of a levitated nanodiamond in atmospheric air34, but not in vacuum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a 1,550-nm trapping laser instead of a 1,064-nm laser as in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34, we observe more than 70% of nanodiamonds in the optical trap are fluorescent, which is crucial for our investigation of ESR in vacuum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3:

fitted parameters of the ESR spectra.Full size image', 'To verify that the increase in ESR contrast is a reversible process instead of a permanent change of the nanodiamond, we performed an experiment in which the chamber was first pumped from atmospheric pressure to 74 torr, and then brought back to atmospheric pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contrast at the later atmospheric pressure is slightly higher than the initial atmospheric pressure (red square markers in Fig 3c), but significantly smaller than the ESR contrast at low pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slight increase of the ESR contrast at the later atmospheric pressure can be explained by the purification of the nanodiamond after exposed to vacuum51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the main change of the ESR contrast is reversible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the nanodiamond is permanently changed, one would expect the nanodiamond to maintain a high ESR contrast when the pressure is brought back to atmospheric level from 74 torr, which is opposite to the measured data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So there is no significant change of the nanodiamond after exposed to low vacuum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the reduction of surrounding and absorbed air molecules is the primary source of the ESR enhancement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'ESR in different gases', 'To further understand the effects of the surrounding gas on levitated nanodiamond NV centres,

 Each measurement takes 5.3 s.Full size image', 'Our results demonstrate that oxygen and helium gases have different effects on both the ESR contrast and the fluorescence strength of levitated nanodiamond NV centres (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ESR contrast of nanodiamond NV centres in helium is about 25% higher than that in oxygen (Fig 4b), while the fluorescence strength in helium is about 30% lower than that in oxygen near atmospheric pressure (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the pressure decreases, the ESR contrast increases while the fluorescence signal decreases in both helium and oxygen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The different effects of oxygen and helium on the ESR contrast and fluorescence cannot be explained by their temperature difference, for example, the fluorescence strength in helium is lower than that in oxygen even through the temperature in helium is lower (the thermal conductivity of helium is higher).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, the fluorescence strength should increase when the temperature decreases (Fig 4a,c)36,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The observed phenomena in Fig 4 can be explained by the reduction of low-quality negatively charged NV centres near the surface due to the reduction of oxygen surface termination37,38,39,40, and a moderate increase of the temperature that quenches low-quality surface NV centres41 without significantly affecting high-quality NV centres at the centre of the nanodiamond36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing with NV centres far away from the surface36, NV centres near the surface have stronger non-radioactive decays, and thus a lower ESR contrast and stronger temperature dependence41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been observed that the fluorescence of NV centres in 2030-nm-diameter nanodiamonds decreased by 1040% when the temperature increased from 300 to 400 K (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  41), accompanying by a decrease of the lifetime of the excited state due to non-radioactive decay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the fluorescence of a NV centre inside a bulk diamond only decreases by a few percent when the temperature is increased from 300 to 450 K (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our experiment, the trapped nanodiamond has about 500 NV centres and a diameter of about 100 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the pressure decreases, the fluorescence of low-quality surface NV centres are suppressed at an increased temperature (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To roughly estimate the thickness of the surface shell where the fluorescence of NV centres is quenched, we assume that NV centres are uniformly distributed in the nanodiamond and the fluorescence signal Cinner of a levitated nanodiamond in low vacuum comes from NV centres within the inner core of radius rinner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rinner can be estimated by comparing Cinner to the fluorescence count Catm at atmospheric pressure: , where r is the radius of the nanodiamond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So rrinner is approximately the thickness of the surface shell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thickness of the surface shell is estimated to be about 1015 nm for the levitated nanodiamond at 100 torr (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the high-quality NV centres at the centre of the 100-nm nanodiamond are largely unaffected by the temperature increase while the low-quality NV centres near the surface are quenched, the overall ESR contrast increases due to the average effect of 500 NV centres (high-quality and low-quality) as shown in Fig 4b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Moreover, a large fraction of NV centres in a nanodiamond are in NV0 charge state39,53, which have low fluorescence signal and no ESR near 2.8 GHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oxygen termination allows more NV centres in NV charge state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus the fluorescence strength increases when the levitated nanodiamond is surrounded by oxygen (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the NV centres enabled by oxygen termination are near the surface and have low contrast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So the ESR contrast decreases in oxygen, as shown in Fig 4b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While oxygen has been used for permanent surface termination37,38,39,40, here we report that this can also happen in air near room temperature and is reversible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the effects are reversible, nanodiamond NV centres can be used for oxygen gas sensing repeatedly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the fluorescence signal in helium gases as the background correction for the thermal effect, the count difference in oxygen and helium gases exhibits roughly linear dependence on the pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the total fluorescence counts (Fig 4c) show a nonlinear scaling, the difference between the counts in oxygen and helium gases (Fig 4d) trends to be proportional to the pressure in the range of our data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a first-order approximation, we fit the data with a line (dashed line in Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found our current un-optimized imaging setup can detect about 100 photon torr1 s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the oxygen pressure is very large, we expect the signal to deviate from the linear fit because the maximum signal will be limited by the number of NV centres in the nanodiamond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For future applications in oxygen gas sensing, we can simply put nanodiamonds on a substrate instead of using optical levitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxygen gas sensors are extensively used to monitor the oxygen concentration in exhaust gases of internal combustion engines in automobiles, and in medical instruments such as anaesthesia monitors and respirators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most common oxygen gas sensor is the zirconia sensor54,55, which is an electrochemical fuel cell that consumes some oxygen to generate a voltage output depending on the concentration of the oxygen, and only works effectively after being heated up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing with zirconia oxygen sensors, the nanodiamond oxygen sensors do not consume oxygen and do not need to be heated up in order to work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nanodiamond sensors will also be much smaller.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple nanodiamonds can be used to improve the sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An area of 5 m × 5 m can have thousands of nanodiamonds.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'In this paper, we optically levitate a nanodiamond and demonstrate electron spin control of its built-in NV centres in low vacuum and different gases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that the ESR contrast of NV centres increases when the air pressure decreases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observe that oxygen and helium gases have different effects on both the photoluminescence and the ESR contrast of nanodiamond NV centres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While more detailed studies are required to fully understand this phenomenon, our observation suggests a potential application of nanodiamond NV centres for oxygen gas sensing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase of ESR contrast in low vacuum can improve the sensitivity of other NV centre devices such as nanodiamond magnetic/electric field sensors where the NV centres are near the diamond surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also study the effects of trapping laser and measure the absolute internal temperature of the levitated nanodiamond in vacuum to better understand this system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results show that the internal temperature of an optically levitated nanodiamond increases significantly in low vacuum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because the commercial nanodiamonds used in this work are not pure and have large optical absorption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Better nanodiamond samples with negligible absorption56 at the trapping wavelength are required to be optically trapped in high vacuum.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

At 450 K, the size reduction of a nanodiamond should be negligible, especially because the oxygen pressure is low in low vacuum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So the loss of a trapped nanodiamond is unlikely due to oxidization, instead it might relate to the Brownian motion due to the rising temperature of the nanodiamond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the temperature of the nanodiamond increases, the effective temperature of surrounding gases increases42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the mean squared displacement of the Brownian motion, x2, is proportional to effective temperature of surrounding gases, the particle will explore a larger volume and be more likely to escape from the trapping region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loss of levitated nanodiamond in an optical trap is similar to Kramers escape rate problem describing the escape rate of a particle from a potential barrier,  (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  59), where 0 is the viscous damping factor, Eb is the potential barrier, kB is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the nanodiamond temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The escape rate increases with increasing temperature of the particle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A larger vibration amplitude can lead to a decrease of the fluorescence signal when the nanodiamond randomly walks away the trapping region (overlapping with the focus of the visible imaging system).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though, more studies are required to further clarify the loss mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ", 'CMM motion calibration', 'When the nanodiamond is at the thermal equilibrium, the PSD of nanodiamond CMM is given by ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  60.

works best when the x is comparable to or larger than 0 (that is, when pressure is below 300 torr).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trapping frequency depends on the laser trapping power.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the refractive index of air is 1.0027, similar to vacuum, the trapping potential in air should be essentially the same as in vacuum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trapping frequency x does not change much from 300 to 10 torr according to the data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the trapping frequency is presumably constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Particle-size calculation', 'Since it is difficult (and not

Maxwell demonstrated that the viscosity of air remains constant from atmospheric pressure down to a few Torr62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At atmospheric pressure, the nanodiamond in Fig 5d (300 K) is presumably in thermal equilibrium with air molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temperature dependence of the viscosity can be calculated using Sutherlands formula63, which yields 18.52 × 106 (Pa s) and s67 nm at room

obtain the nanodiamond diameter of 94±7 nm while monitoring the particle size for over 30 min (Fig 5d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At low vacuum, the nanodiamond is not in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding gas due to its high internal temperature, so equation (2) is not suitable to calculate the particle size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'ESR technique', 'The ESR experiments were conducted using an optically detected magnetic resonance technique3,64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We employed a similar microwave antenna design and the microwave lock-in technique described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain the ESR signal, the electron spin states are excited  by microwave pulses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a given frequency, the antenna delivers a sequence of 500 ms alternative on/off microwave pulses to control the electron spin of NV centres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the microwave pulse is on, the NV ground spin state |ms=0 is excited to |ms=±1, and vice versa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, the visible fluorescence spectrum of the diamond is acquired using the spectrometer (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the visible fluorescence signal of |ms=±1 is weaker than the |ms=0 state, there is a dip in the plot of the normalized IPL when ESR happens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The normalized fluorescence signal IPL is the ratio of total fluorescence counts with and without microwave excitation, where the resonance peaks occur at the frequencies of minimum IPL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Nanodiamond temperature', 'The zero-field Hamiltonian of NV centre is written as ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
