Insights into the activation mechanism of class I HDAC complexes by inositol phosphates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Histone deacetylases (HDACs) 1, 2 and 3 form the catalytic subunit of several large transcriptional repression complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, the enzymatic activity of HDACs in these complexes has been shown to be regulated by inositol phosphates, which bind in a pocket sandwiched between the HDAC and co-repressor proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the actual mechanism of activation remains poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we have elucidated the stereochemical requirements for binding and activation by inositol phosphates, demonstrating that activation requires three adjacent phosphate groups and that other positions on the inositol ring can tolerate bulky substituents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also demonstrate that there is allosteric communication between the inositol-binding site and the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystal structure of the HDAC1:MTA1 complex bound to a novel peptide-based inhibitor and to inositol hexaphosphate suggests a molecular basis of substrate recognition, and an entropically driven allosteric mechanism of activation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) are enzymes involved in epigenetic gene regulation through controlling the acetylation state of lysine sidechains in histone tails1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They act as the catalytic subunit of several large protein complexes that repress gene expression when targeted to the genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent structural and functional studies of class I HDACs in complex with their cognate co-repressors have suggested that the activity of these complexes is regulated in the cell by inositol phosphates that are likely derived from membrane phospholipids2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding the regulation of these complexes is important since they are promising targets for epigenetic therapies for a range of diseases5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include numerous cancers as well as spinal muscular atrophy6, Friedrichs ataxia7, Alzheimers disease8 and HIV infection9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five HDAC inhibitors are now variously licensed for use in the clinic for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, peripheral T-cell lymphoma10,11 and multiple myeloma12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The class I HDAC family comprises of HDACs 13 and 8 (reviewed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HDACs 13 are assembled into at least five large multi-protein co-repressor complexes that are recruited to chromatin through interaction with repressive transcription factors or other silencing co-factors14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enzymatic activity of HDACs 13 show significant enhancement when incorporated into their cognate co-repressor complexes15,16,17,18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HDAC8, however, sits alone as the only class I HDAC that is not recruited into a larger complex and is fully active in isolation21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HDACs 1 and 2 are found within several distinct co-repressor complexes including NuRD23, Sin3A24, CoREST25 and MiDAC4,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HDAC3, however, is exclusively recruited to the SMRT/NCoR co-repressor complex20,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The regulation of these complexes by inositol phosphates was first suggested by the surprising discovery that inositol 1,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5,6)P4) was present in the HDAC3:SMRT crystal structure2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 is located at a binding pocket formed at the interface between HDAC3 and the co-repressor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finding that the Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 co-purified with the HDAC3 complex from mammalian cells suggests that it is likely to be a physiologically relevant activator of the complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is not possible to exclude the possibility that other inositol phosphates might also be able to activate the complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 is only one of several higher order inositol phosphates which are produced in cells from Ins(1,4,5)P3, the well-known second messenger that regulates Ca2+ release through binding to the inositol trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Importantly, the key residues which coordinate the binding of Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 to the HDAC3:SMRT complex were found to be conserved in several class I HDAC complexes, suggesting that these complexes may also be activated by inositol phosphates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is notable that the key residues are not conserved in the Sin3A co-repressor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the structure of the HDAC1:MTA1 complex confirmed that the inositol phosphate-binding pocket was present in other class I HDAC co-repressor complexes3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We initially proposed that Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 serves as an inter-molecular glue, mediating interaction between HDAC3 and SMRT2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It later emerged that longer constructs of SMRT form a constitutive complex with HDAC3 and that the role of the Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 is to activate the HDAC3 enzyme itself3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, we observed using mass-spectrometry, that the HDAC3:SMRT complex always co-purifies with Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 and that the Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 can only be removed using a high-salt wash (resulting in an inactive complex).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, mass-spectrometry showed that the HDAC1:MTA1 complex does not co-purify with Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 or any other inositol phosphates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the HDAC1:MTA1 complex is nevertheless robustly activated by exogenous Ins(1,4,5,6)P4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The novel MiDAC complex has also been shown to be activated by exogenous Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The physiological importance of inositol phosphate activation of HDAC complexes is supported by the finding that mutants in the inositol phosphate-binding pocket of HDAC1 are unable to fully restore HDAC activity in HDAC1/2 knock-out ES cells and rescue their viability29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, mice containing a mutation of one of the key inositol phosphate-binding residues in SMRT (Y470) exhibit increased local histone acetylation in vivo30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Whilst the structures of HDACs 1 and 3 in complex with their cognate co-repressors, along with functional studies, have established that these complexes are activated by inositol phosphates3, the exact mechanism through which inositol phosphates activate HDACs remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this important issue we have taken a chemical biology approach to understand what are the important stereochemical features of inositol phosphates that are required to activate class I HDAC complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have used inositol phosphate derivatives to directly investigate the binding of inositol phosphates to HDAC complexes in vitro and to demonstrate how further derivatives might be developed as tools to modulate HDAC activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These approaches do not purport to identify which inositol phosphates are relevant in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we have developed a novel peptide-based HDAC inhibitor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is essentially a substrate mimic based on the histone H4 tail, but incorporating a hydroxamic acid functionality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a structural biology approach we have explored the details of substrate recognition, as well as the relationship between the binding of substrate and activation by inositol phosphates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies, together with kinetic and mutational analyses of these enzyme complexes, give insight into the mechanism underlying the inositol phosphate-mediated allostery.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'HDAC3 activation by inositol phosphates', 'To understand the stereochemical basis underlying the activation of HDAC3 by inositol phosphates we investigated the ability of a range of inositol phosphates and derivatives to enhance the activity of HDAC3 in deacetylase assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To achieve this we used an assay based on the complex of HDAC3 with an extended SMRT construct which is stable in the absence of inositol phosphate3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this assay, any endogenous inositol phosphate that has been co-purified with the complex is removed by treatment with high-ionic strength buffer, which results in a complex that shows little catalytic activity but can be readily activated by the addition of Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The crystal structure of Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 bound to the HDAC3:SMRT complex suggests that each of the four phosphates on the inositol ring are recognized by distinct sites within the binding pocket.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These sites, referred to as A, B, C and D, accommodate phosphates at positions 4, 5, 6 and 1, respectively, on the inositol ring (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positions 2 and 3 of the inositol ring are relatively unobstructed and the free hydroxyls do not appear to be recognized by the protein suggesting that higher order inositol phosphates might also be able to bind and activate the HDAC3:SMRT complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, both Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 and InsP6 are able to activate the complex to the same degree as Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, they bind with higher apparent affinity than Ins(1,4,5,6)P4; Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 shows a twofold increase and InsP6 a 16-fold increase (Kd values of 5.0 and 0.6 M, respectively, compared with 10 M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This higher apparent affinity is mostly likely due to the increased negative charge contributing to a higher on-rate for binding to the positively charged pocket of the HDAC3:SMRT complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to being able to accommodate a phosphate group on the 2 position of the inositol ring, it also appears that the axial orientation is not important, since scyllo-InsP5 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31), which has an equatorial 2-hydroxyl, exhibits similar activity to Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: The stereospecific requirements for activation of HDAC activity by various inositol phosphates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 bound to the HDAC3:SMRT complex, with the HDAC3 shown as a grey surface and the SMRT as a cyan surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Schematic representation of the inositol phosphate-binding pocket, with the binding sites for the four phosphates of Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 designated A, B, C and D as indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2D indicates that the axial hydroxyl group on the second position of the inositol ring is pointing down in this view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b,d,e) Activation of HDAC3 by inositol phosphates using a BOC-Lys-AMC assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HDAC activity is expressed relative to the maximal Ins(1,4,5,6)P4-stimulated activity and is plotted against the inositol phosphate concentration (M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) The ability of scyllo-InsP5 and the planar benzene 1,2,3,4-tetrakisphosphate to activate HDAC3:SMRT is compared with Ins(1,4,5,6)P4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HDAC activity was measured in the presence of 200 M inositol phosphate/benzene tetrakisphosphate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HDAC activity is expressed relative to the maximal Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars indicate±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (n=3).Full size image', 'The stereochemistry of the Ins(1,4,5,6)P4-binding pocket suggests that the chair conformation of the inositol is important to position the phosphates correctly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interpretation is supported by the finding that benzene 1,2,3,4-tetrakisphosphate32 (four adjacent phosphates on a planar ring) fails to substantially activate the complex (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To fully rationalize the stereochemical requirements for activation of the HDAC3:SMRT complex, we explored the ability of eight tris- and tetrakis-inositol phosphates to enhance the deacetylase activity of the complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These molecules varied in their ability to activate the HDAC3:SMRT complex and bound with a range of apparent dissociation constants (Fig 1d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interpreting these data is complicated by there being potentially multiple modes of binding for the various inositol phosphates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, some of these modes might support binding to, but not activation of, the complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Careful analysis allows us to conclude that a minimum of three adjacent phosphates is required for the substantial activation of HDAC3 in the complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These phosphates must occupy sites A, B and C in the binding pocket (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full analyses of these data and conclusions are presented in the Supplementary Materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The requirement for three phosphates in positions A, B and C, fits well with the HDAC3:SMRT structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phosphates at sites B and C are essentially completely buried at the interface of HDAC3 and the SMRT co-repressor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The requirement for site A to be occupied can also be rationalized, since the phosphate at this site forms a salt bridge with R265 in HDAC3 which has been shown to be essential for activation of the enzyme2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that the well-established physiologically relevant inositol phosphate signalling molecule, Ins(1,4,5)P3, which activates the InsP3R to open calcium channels, is completely unable to activate HDAC3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be explained as it cannot simultaneously fulfil sites A, B and C.', 'To complement our analysis based on the ability of different inositol phosphates to activate the HDAC3:SMRT complex, we also performed computational docking studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used Autodock to first examine the contribution to the overall binding energy of the phosphates at the 1 or 4 position of Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 (Supplementary Fig 4ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Removal of phosphate P1 (occupying site D) reduced the binding energy by just 1.2 kcal mol1; whereas removal of phosphate P4 (occupying site A) reduced the binding energy by 5.4 kcal mol1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fits well with the activation data, which suggest that site A is more important than site D. We also freely docked Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 into the complex, since this molecule activates to greater than 75% yet can only fulfil three adjacent phosphate sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three lowest energy-docked molecules adopt an orientation that positions phosphates P3, P4 and P5 in sites A, B and C with an average binding energy of 18.72 kcal mol1 (Supplementary Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This energy is very similar to the calculated binding energy of Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 (18.86 kcal mol1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of the other docking solutions also fulfil positions A, B and C, but with lower binding energies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the docking solutions positioned the phosphates in sites B, C and D, leaving the A site unoccupied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these computational docking studies fit well with our conclusion that sites A, B and C are essential for both inositol phosphate binding and activation of the complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Activation of the HDAC3:SMRT complex by synthetic analogues', 'To explore further the distinction between molecules that activate the InsP3 receptor and those that activate HDACs, we tested the ability of synthetic adenophostin A, a potent InsP3 receptor agonist33,34, to activate the HDAC3:SMRT complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed no activity for adenophostin A even at the high concentration of 200 M (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This lack of activity likely results from the fact that the phosphate groups on the pyranose ring of adenophostin A mimic the 4 and 5 position phosphates of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and hence cannot satisfy the sites required for activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Activation of the HDAC3:SMRT complex by inositol phosphate analogues and derivatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The ability of adenophostin A and

question as to whether larger groups might be added on the 2 and 3 positions of the inositol ring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we synthesized and evaluated inositol phosphates with bulky substituents (benzyl groups) at the 2 and 3 positions (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, bulky groups at these positions can be tolerated with a minimal loss of HDAC activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It has recently been reported that inositol pyrophosphates may be important in S. cerevisiae for the regulation of the class 1 HDAC homologue Rpd3L (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the inositol-binding residues identified in HDAC3:SMRT are also present in Rpd3 and the Snt1 co-repressor, we speculated that this regulation might be mediated through the same inositol phosphate-binding pocket.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore tested whether pyrophosphate analogues and pyrophosphate, 5-PP-InsP4, might be able to activate the HDAC3 complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pyrophosphate mimic 1-PA-InsP5 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36) (pyrophosphate mimic on position 1 of the inositol ring) has similar activity to that of Ins(1,4,5,6)P4, whereas 5-PP-InsP4 (pyrophosphate on position 5) has reduced activity (60%) compared with Ins(1,4,5,6)P4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the pyrophosphate mimic at position 5 in 2-OH-5-PA-InsP4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  37) is completely inert (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference in activity may be due to differences in the possible binding modes of the pyrophosphates and their mimics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1-PA-InsP5 can bind in a way that sites A, B, C and D are all satisfied, whereas 5-PP-InsP4 can only satisfy the sites A, B and C. 2-OH-5-PA-InsP4, which contains a carbonyl in place of the pyrophosphate of 5-PP-InsP4, cannot form the crucial salt bridge with R265 in HDAC3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Inositol hexakisphosphate activation of HDAC1', 'We have previously shown that the HDAC1:MTA1 complex can also be activated by Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 (ref.

phosphate binding is likely to be similar (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate this, we soaked crystals of the HDAC1:MTA1 complex (which had been co-crystallized with a peptide-based inhibitor) with 225 mM InsP6 before freezing for data collection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure was solved to 3.3 Å by molecular replacement, by using the structure of unliganded HDAC1:MTA1 (pdb code 4BKX)

corresponding R265 in HDAC3 (Fig 3c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecule is supported in this new position through a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl of Y336 and the C3 phosphate group of the InsP6.

in the pocket, and compensates for small structural differences between the two complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this difference in orientation, the sites A, B and C (see above) are occupied by phosphates in exactly the same position as in the HDAC3 complex with Ins(1,4,5,6)P4; thus, supporting the importance of satisfying these positions so as to activate the enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

R270, in the HDAC1:MTA1:InsP6 complex has a different orientation, such that it interacts with the phosphate group in site C. Accordingly, the R270A mutation in the HDAC1:MTA1 complex does not have as pronounced an effect as that seen when R265 is mutated in the HDAC3:SMRT complex, but it still results in a twofold reduction in kcat (Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously observed that the R270Q mutation only modestly impairs the ability of HDAC1 to rescue cells in which both HDAC1 and 2 have been deleted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mutation does, however, strongly synergise with other mutations in the inositol phosphate-binding pocket29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, a survey of the available HDAC2 structures (pdb codes: 3MAX, 4LXZ, 4LY1) in the absence of an inositol phosphate ligand, suggests that this arginine is rather mobile and can adopt either the position seen for R265 in the HDAC3:SMRT:Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 structure or the position seen in the HDAC1:MTA1:InsP6 complex (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In either position the backbone trajectory remains unchanged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It seems likely, therefore, that the important feature is that this sidechain becomes immobilized on inositol phosphate binding and that this stabilization is important for activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Notably we have also observed a measurable cross-talk between the active site of HDAC3 and the inositol phosphate-binding site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is illustrated by the finding that binding of hydroxamic acid inhibitors, such as TSA, SAHA and MS-275 (a structurally distinct benzamide inhibitor) at the active site results in a threefold enhancement of the binding of 2-FAM-Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 to the allosteric site (Fig 6d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the inhibitor H4K16Hx has a more modest effect on the Kd for 2-FAM-Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those inhibitors that particularly influence 2-FAM-Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 binding position an aromatic group at the mouth of the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To further investigate the effects of both inhibitors and inositol phosphates, we used a circular dichroism-based thermal-stability assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unliganded HDAC3:SMRT complex showed co-operative unfolding at 45 °C, which increased to 51 and 53 °C by SAHA and InsP6, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the thermal denaturation was measured in the presence of both SAHA and InsP6 the melting temperature further increased to 62 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that binding to the active site or inositol phosphate results in significant stabilization of the complex (Fig 6e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar effects have also been observed on the stabilization of the HDAC1:MTA1 complex (Supplementary Fig 11).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Class I HDAC complexes have been implicated in the regulation of a wide range of biological processes from early development and X-chromosome inactivation to metabolism and circadian rhythms41,42,43,44,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finding that these complexes are regulated by inositol phosphates was unexpected and raises the question what is the physiological role of inositol phosphates; under what circumstances do their levels change and which biological processes are consequently regulated?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have not sought to answer these questions in this manuscript.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather we seek to understand the molecular mechanisms through which inositol phosphates regulate the activity of HDAC complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we wished to understand what are the important features of inositol phosphates that allow them to activate HDAC co-repressor complexes; what is the relationship between substrate and inositol phosphate binding and what is the mechanism underlying the allosteric activation?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have systematically tested the ability of a range of naturally occurring and synthetic inositol phosphates and their analogues to activate class I HDAC complexes and this has allowed us to elucidate the important stereochemical features of inositol phosphates that are required to allosterically activate class I HDAC complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of a fluorescently labelled inositol phosphate derivate has allowed the investigation of the direct binding of inositol phosphates to HDACs for the first time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This and other derivatives have effectively demonstrated that inositol phosphate derivatives may have potential use for modulating HDAC co-repressor complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure of HDAC1 in complex with the novel histone H4 1218 tail inhibitor peptide has given insight into understanding both substrate recognition and its relationship with inositol phosphate binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together with kinetic and mutational studies these results allow us to begin to understand the mechanism underlying the allosteric activation by inositol phosphates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our investigations into HDAC3:SMRT activation have led us to propose a biological rationale for higher order inositol phosphate signalling to HDAC complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ins(1,4,5)P3 is a major precursor for higher inositol phosphates, yet is completely unable to activate HDAC3 since it cannot simultaneously occupy sites A, B and C (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of a phosphate to Ins(1,4,5)P3 at either the 3 or 6 position creates a molecule that can robustly activate HDAC3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such phosphorylation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 is carried out by an inositol phosphate multikinase enzyme (called IPMK or IPK2) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  46, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect, therefore, that the activity of IPMK is critical for class I HDAC activity in vivo, since it is essential for the production of all of the inositol phosphates that are able to activate HDAC complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The predominant nuclear localization of IPMK fits well with this biological rationale48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the fact that Ins(1,4,5)P3, as well as the potent InsP3R agonist adenophostin A, are both completely inert in activating HDAC complexes indicates that the signalling role played by higher order inositol phosphates in modulating the activity of class I HDACs is physiologically isolated from the role played by Ins(1,4,5)P3 in Ca2+ signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Support for the concept that IPMK plays a key role comes from previous findings that both IPMK and its yeast homologue, Arg82p, have been reported to play a role in gene activation46,49,50,51,52,53,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However the role of the kinase activity of Arg82p/IPMK in gene activation is controversial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The kinase activity has been shown to be required for Pho5 transcription and chromatin remodelling49, whereas other studies suggest that the kinase activity is not required for the regulation of arginine metabolism in yeast53,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IPMK plays a role as a transcriptional co-activator in immediate early gene induction in mice through its interaction with the histone acetyltransferase CBP, though this interaction is not dependent on the kinase activity of IPMK52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Xu et al.52 speculate that the products of the kinase activity of IPMK might be important for repression of gene transcription, whereas the non-catalytic activity stimulates histone acetylation and therefore gene activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite the uncertainty in the role of the kinase activity of IPMK, it is well-established that all the products of IPMK (higher order inositol phosphates) vary throughout the cell-cycle55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is particularly interesting, since it is established that histone acetylation levels also vary during the cell-cycle56, yet the levels of HDAC3 remain constant57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, deletion of HDAC3 results in loss of the cell-cycle-dependent variation in histone acetylation57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If HDAC3 is responsible for cell-cycle regulation of histone acetylation yet its levels do not change, then some other factor (perhaps inositol phosphate levels?)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  must change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite these suggestive observations it still remains unclear what is the physiologically relevant species that activates HDAC complexes in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 co-purified with the complex from HEK293 cells, it has become clear that a range of higher order phosphates are able to activate in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly inositol phosphate kinases that lie downstream of IPMK and give rise to inositol pyrophosphates have been shown to be important for the activation of the yeast class I HDAC RPD3L and for implementing a stress response in yeast35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, Worley et al.35 have shown that mutation of residues in the inositol-binding site on the yeast HDAC homologue Rpd3 results in similar effects on gene expression in the environmental stress response as deleting enzymes in the pyrophosphate synthesis pathway (including Arg82).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings fit well with our observation that certain inositol pyrophosphates and pyrophosphate analogues are able to activate the HDAC3:SMRT complex in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is striking that there were only very minor structural changes when HDAC1 binds InsP6 and the synthetic substrate mimic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most significant is the rearrangement of the sidechain of D99 that mediates essential interactions with the peptide backbone of the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The importance of this residue in HDAC8 has been noted before58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This rearrangement appears to be the result of substrate binding, rather than an allosteric consequence of inositol phosphate binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, although the kinetic analysis indicates that substrate binding is strongly influenced by inositol phosphate binding and that catalytic turnover is increased, there is little evidence for a substantive structural change mediating these allosteric effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This contrasts with the classic dogma of allostery that requires concerted structural changes to mediate thermodynamic or kinetic alterations to an enzyme mechanism59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The allosteric mechanism in the HDAC complexes would seem to fit much better with concepts of allostery being the result of changes in entropy (dynamics) following binding at the allosteric site influencing the activity at the active site60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interpretation is supported by recent computational studies which suggest that Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 binding induces a change in the dynamic behaviour of the complex in the vicinity of the inositol phosphate and active sites61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the thermal denaturation studies reported here show that the binding of inositol phosphate results in a significant stabilization of both the HDAC3:SMRT and HDAC1:MTA1 complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Whilst it is recognized that dynamically driven allostery can occur over a large distance, the fact that the allosteric and active sites are in relatively close proximity provides a likely explanation of how inositol phosphate binding can influence the dynamics of the active site59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is particularly notable that the inositol phosphate and the substratepeptide interact on either side of a loop involving residues Q26-P29 in HDAC1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, both the substrate and inositol phosphate form hydrogen bonds with the same peptide bondQ26-G27 (Fig 6f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'HDACs have recently shown promise as therapeutic targets to treat a number of different diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, one of the major challenges is that inhibitors of class I HDACs exhibit relatively modest subclass specificity and, furthermore, several different complexes, with diverse biological functions, contain a common catalytic HDAC subunit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finding that class I HDACs behave quite differently when they are in complex with their cognate co-repressors, provides a new opportunity to develop inhibitors that are specific for individual complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding the molecular details of substrate binding, and the allosteric mechanism of activation by inositol phosphates, is likely to be essential for rational drug design.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
