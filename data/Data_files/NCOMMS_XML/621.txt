Selective removal of deletion-bearing mitochondrial DNA in heteroplasmic Drosophila  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) often exists in a state of heteroplasmy, in which mutant mtDNA co-exists in cells with wild-type mtDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High frequencies of pathogenic mtDNA result in maternally inherited diseases; maternally and somatically acquired mutations also accumulate over time and contribute to diseases of ageing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reducing heteroplasmy is therefore a therapeutic goal and in vivo models in post-mitotic tissues are needed to facilitate these studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe a transgene-based model of a heteroplasmic lethal mtDNA deletion (mtDNA) in adult Drosophila muscle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stimulation of autophagy, activation of the PINK1/parkin pathway or decreased levels of mitofusin result in a selective decrease in mtDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decreased levels of mitofusin and increased levels of ATPIF1, an inhibitor of ATP synthase reversal-dependent mitochondrial repolarization, result in a further decrease in mtDNA levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show that an adult post-mitotic tissue can be cleansed of a deleterious genome, suggesting that therapeutic removal of mutant mtDNA can be achieved.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mitochondria are membrane-bound organelles present in many copies in most eukaryotic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The circular mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) encodes multiple tRNAs, rRNAs and polypeptides necessary for oxidative phosphorylation, which generates the bulk of ATP in most cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual mitochondria contain multiple copies of mtDNA, each of which is packaged into a structure known as a nucleoid, with primarily a single mtDNA per nucleoid1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This multiplicity of genomes per cell, in conjunction with mtDNAs high mutation rate and limited repair capacity, often results in cells carrying mtDNA of different genotypes, a condition known as heteroplasmy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies suggest that 90% of individuals have some level of heteroplasmy, with 20% harbouring heteroplasmies that are implicated in disease2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the frequency of such a mutation reaches a threshold, pathology results4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High frequencies of deleterious mutant mtDNA result in severe maternally inherited syndromes4,5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heteroplasmy for deleterious mtDNA can also arise in somatic tissues during development and in adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It accumulates throughout life, and is thought to contribute to diseases of aging that include neurodegeneration, metabolic disorders, cancer, heart disease and sarcopenia8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations emphasize the importance of devising ways to reduce heteroplasmy in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mitochondria-targeted site-specific nucleases, such as restriction enzymes10,11, engineered zinc-finger nucleases12,13 and transcription activator-like effector nucleases14,15, provide one way to decrease the levels of heteroplasmy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this approach, a site-specific nuclease is engineered so as to bind and cleave a specific mutant version of the mtDNA genome, promoting its selective degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach has recently been used to decrease the levels of heteroplasmy in patient-derived cell lines14, in oocytes and in single cell embryos15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these methods are likely to be challenging to implement in the adult11, as the nuclease being expressed is a non-self protein; many cells must be targeted without off target cleavage effects; and individuals may be heteroplasmic for multiple deleterious mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we seek to promote cell biological processes that normally regulate mtDNA quality as an alternative approach to decreasing heteroplasmy in adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mitophagy serves as a form of quality control that promotes the selective removal of damaged mitochondria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In one important pathway, dysfunctional mitochondria are eliminated through a process dependent on PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) and Parkin, loss of which lead to familial forms of Parkinsons disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this pathway, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, which occurs in response to mitochondrial dysfunction of various sorts, results in stabilization of the kinase PINK1 on the outer mitochondrial membrane16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PINK1 recruits multiple autophagy adaptors17 and the cytoplasmic E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin18,19, which ubiquitinates and promotes the degradation of Mitofusins19,20,21, mitochondrial outer membrane proteins essential for outer mitochondrial membrane fusion22, thereby inhibiting re-fusion of dysfunctional mitochondria with the network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parkin also ubiquitinates a number of other proteins23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These events lead to the recruitment of autophagosomal membranes, which sequester the defective mitochondria and deliver it to the lysosome for degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An important question is whether mitophagy, which acts at the level of individual mitochondria, contributes to quality control at the level of mtDNAthe selective removal of mutant mtDNA within the cell as a whole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several observations suggest that PINK1/parkin-dependent mitophagy may participate in such a process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the frequency of a deleterious allele in a heteroplasmic mammalian cell line can be reduced if cells are cultured for long periods of time in the presence of Parkin25, decreased membrane potential25,26 and/or stimulation of autophagy26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are intriguing, but because the experiments occur over many cell cycles, stochastic segregation of mitochondrial genomes during division, coupled with increased survival and/or proliferation of cells with an increased fraction of wild-type mtDNA, may contribute to the decreased mutant mtDNA load.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, in lines of Caenorhabditis elegans heteroplasmic for an mtDNA deletion mutant, loss of Parkin (but not PINK1) results in increased levels of heteroplasmy28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results also support a role for Parkin in mtDNA quality control, but they leave the nature of the selection event unclear, and whether it occurs during germline transmission and/or in somatic cells, during development and/or in the adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, dopaminergic neurons from mice expressing a proofreading-deficient mtDNA polymerase and wild type for parkin, have a spectrum of mtDNA mutations that includes fewer predicted pathogenic variants than are observed in neurons from proofreading-defective mice that lack Parkin29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This also is consistent with models in which Parkin promotes the elimination of some mtDNA genotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, whether these events occur during development or during adulthood, and the nature of the selection event is unknown and difficult to study in a system in which mtDNA mutations are induced through random DNA polymerase errors throughout life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Regardless, the fact that mutant mtDNA accumulates in individuals wild type for PINK1 and parkin during aging, and in affected tissues in inherited maternal mitochondrial disease, indicates that if PINK1- and Parkin-dependent mitophagy and/or other pathways promote mtDNA quality control, they are often not active or effective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify ways of reducing the mutant mtDNA load in somatic tissues, systems are needed in which a specific deleterious heteroplasmy can be induced in vivo and followed over time, ideally in post-mitotic cells so as to eliminate potential confounding effects associated with stochastic segregation during cell division, and differential cell proliferation and/or cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current in vivo models are cumbersome and limited, as they require the use of Caenorhabditis elegans heteroplasmic for a deletion28,30, or introduction of the cytoplasm from animals homoplasmic31,32,33,34, or cells heteroplasmic35 for pre-existing mutant mtDNA genotypes, into early embryos of a different genotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe the generation and use of a transgene-based system of heteroplasmy in post-mitotic muscle to identify conditions that result in the selective removal of mutant mtDNA.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Creation of heteroplasmy for a lethal mtDNA deletion', 'To create a transgene-based model of a heteroplasmy that removes essential genes (lethal when homoplasmic), we first generated a mitochondria-targeted version of the restriction enzyme AflIII (mitoAflIII), which is predicted to cut Drosophila mtDNA twice, creating a 2,584 bp deletion (mtDNA) that removes or disrupts multiple genes (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 cells transiently transfected with mitoAflIII are heteroplasmic for mtDNA (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequency of heteroplasmy was further increased following co-expression with mitochondria-targeted T4 DNA ligase (mitoT4lig) (Fig 1b), presumably because T4 DNA ligase expression limits the degradation of AflIII cut linear products by promoting their re-ligation and re-cutting until base insertions or deletions result in products that lack AflIII sites (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Engineered heteroplasmy for an mtDNA deletion (mtDNA) in Drosophila.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Map of Drosophila melanogaster mtDNA showing the genes affected following cleavage and re-ligation at two AflIII restriction enzyme cleavage sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Co-expression of mitoAflIII and mitoT4lig in Drosophila S2 cells cause an increase in mtDNA levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Transgenesis construct for co-expression of mitoAflIII, mitoT4lig and Gal4 under the control of the Flightin indirect flight muscle (IFM)-specific promoter in Drosophila.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Left panel: mtDNA is detected by PCR in the thorax, but not the head and abdomen of P{pIFM-mitoAflIII, pIFM-mitoT4lig, pIFM-Gal4}attP1 (mitoAflIII) flies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mtDNA is undetectable in P{CaryP}attP1 flies, which were used for a site-specific transgenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Right panel: mtDNAWT (the presence of which results in a similarly size band in PCR) is present in all samples other than the no-template control (NTC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) The abundance of mitoAflIII mRNA falls precipitously after day one post eclosion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bars depict mean±1 s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical significance was calculated using Students t-test with unequal variance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NSP greater than 0.05, **P less_than 0.01 and ***P less_than 0.001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NS, not significant.Full size image', 'To explore the fate of mtDNA in vivo, we sought to generate transgenic flies that specifically create mtDNA deletions in a post-mitotic tissue, so as to be able to isolate effects on mtDNA quality control from those due to differential segregation during proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Drosophila indirect flight muscle (IFM) is a non-essential, adult-specific, post-mitotic and energy-intense tissue containing a high density of mitochondria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also shows strong and consistent phenotypes in response to the loss of genes involved in mitochondrial quality control, such as PINK1 and parkin mutants36,37,38,39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expressed mitoAflIII and mitoT4 DNA ligase under the control of an adult IFM-specific promoter (pIFM)41 derived from the flightin gene, and using the UASGAL4 system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the expression of mitoAflIII and T4 DNA ligase under the control of ubiquitous or neuron-specific GAL4 drivers resulted in 100% lethality, indicating the highly deleterious nature of the deletion, as would be expected for organism-wide defects in mitochondrial function (Supplementary Table 2), expression of mitoAflIII and mitoT4lig under pIFM control resulted in viable flies with high levels of tissue-specific heteroplasmy (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flies that carry these transgenes and pIFM-Gal4 (P{pIFM-mitoAflIII, pIFM-mitoT4lig, pIFM-Gal4}attP1) were used in subsequent experiments, and are hereafter referred to as mitoAflIII flies (Fig 1ce).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pIFM-driven mitoAflIII messenger RNA (mRNA) expression is high at day 1 post adult eclosion, and then decreases markedly ( greater than 100 ×) by day 3, and onwards (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MitoAflIII protein levels presumably follow a related time course, though a lack of antibodies to this protein prevented us from testing this directly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, pIFM-driven expression provides a pulse of mitoAflIII expression during early adulthood, the consequences of which can then be followed over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Quantification of mtDNA species', 'We used two complementary approaches to quantify wild type and deletion-bearing mtDNA in the IFMs, quantitative PCR (qPCR) and direct visualization in situ, using target-primed rolling-circle amplification (tpRCA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For qPCR, four loci were amplified from IFM DNA (Fig 2a): mtDNA common to wild type and deletion genomes, mt:NADH5 (mtDNAtotal); mtDNA that spans one of the AflIII sites, and which is therefore specific to wild-type mtDNA (mtDNAWT); mtDNA that spans the deletion, and is therefore specific to the deletion (mtDNA); and a nuclear locus, 3R:tub.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amplification efficiencies of these primers were similar over three orders of magnitude of DNA concentration (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of mtDNA was done relative to both total mtDNA (mtDNAtotal) and nuclear DNA (nucDNA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both approaches gave similar results, with the fraction of mtDNA increasing through the first 10 days of adulthood to 76% of mtDNAtotal, and then remaining stable thereafter (Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in fraction of mtDNA over time may simply reflect the kinetics of cleavage and re-ligation of the mtDNA genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Competitive replication advantage of the smaller deletion-bearing genome may also participate, a possibility that remains to be explored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: qPCR quantification of mtDNA species and effects of heteroplasmy on muscle structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Positions and orientations of qPCR primers are indicated by arrows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Four standard curves connecting three average Ct values (±1 s.d.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  for each primer set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) The amount of mtDNA in the IFMs of mitoAflIII flies increases through the first 10 days after eclosion and stabilizes afterwards.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative amounts of mtDNA were estimated using qPCR normalized to the levels observed in 10-day-old flies, which were assigned the value of 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Minimum four biological replicates were quantified for each time point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical significance is calculated relative to the values in 10-day-old flies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Quantification of mtDNA forms in flight muscle from 10-day-old P{pIFM-Gal4}attP1 (wild type, left bar of each pair) and mtDNA -bearing P{pIFM-mitoAflIII, pIFM-mitoT4lig, pIFM-Gal4}attP1 (mitoAflIII, right bar of each pair) flies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mtDNAWT depletion among all mtDNA molecules (mtDNAtotal) corresponds to emergence of mtDNA molecules: that is, mtDNAtotalmtDNAWT=mtDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bars depict mean±1 s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e,h) Toluidine blue staining, and (f,g,i,j) transmission electron micrographs of indirect flight muscles of 10-day-old flies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wild-type (eg) and mitoAflIII (hj) flies have similar muscular ultrastructure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars, 1.0 m.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have generated a transgene-based model of mtDNA heteroplasmy in an adult post-mitotic tissue, the adult flight muscle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high levels of heteroplasmy (76%) did not interfere with flight muscle function, making this a useful system for exploring mtDNA quality control in a quantitative manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may also prove useful as a system in which to identify compensatory mechanisms that buffer muscle function from effects caused by high levels of heteroplasmy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we demonstrate that the load of deleterious mtDNA can be decreased through several different interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic and chemical screens using such a model should prove useful in identifying molecules that can cleanse tissues of a deleterious genome, via known and unknown mitochondrial quality control pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The many tools for regulated spatial and temporal control of gene expression in Drosophila will allow such screens to be carried out in a variety of tissues and environmental contexts, including aging63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results show that adult muscle has a significant but limited ability to remove mutant mtDNA utilizing genes required for autophagy, and that mtDNA removal can be greatly stimulated in several ways: by limiting the ability of mitochondrial fragments to re-fuse with the network (decreasing Mfn levels), by limiting their ability to undergo repolarization through ATP synthase reversal (ATPIF1 expression), by increasing the tagging of mtDNA-bearing fragments (increasing PINK1 or Parkin levels), and by increasing the frequency with which these tagged fragments are degraded (activation of autophagy).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations have important implications for new therapies for mitochondrial disease and diseases of aging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our observation that wild-type levels of key proteins are not set to maximize mtDNA quality control provides a possible explanation for why mutant mtDNA accumulates in multiple tissues during normal aging: the components are required at different levels in other more immediate contexts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, mitochondrial dynamics are often driven to promote rapid cycles of fusion and fission so as to increase network connectivity, ATP production and/or calcium handling22,64,65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These conditions are predicted to facilitate mutant mtDNA maintenance or accumulation55,56,57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, levels of ATPIF1 may primarily reflect the need to buffer mitochondrial membrane potential from transient changes associated with muscle contraction and/or mediate metabolic reprogramming and responses to stress66.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PINK1 and Parkin also play a number of non-mitophagic roles in Drosophila and mammalian systems, which may be costly if activated continuously67,68,69.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Continuous activation of autophagy leads to cell death, tissue catabolism and changes in metabolism, and is normally tightly regulated at multiple levels50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the face of these competing cellular demands, expression tuned to maximize the removal of mutant mtDNA throughout life probably would result in significant life-history costs, particularly since defects in mtDNA quality control in somatic tissues manifest themselves primarily in later life8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A key question is whether occasional manipulations of cell physiology that promote mtDNA quality control, in otherwise healthy individuals, can bring about a more general housecleaning that keeps the frequency of mutant DNA below the threshold for causing cellular dysfunction in diverse tissues without incurring other organismal costs.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

several things must happen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the 53 exonuclease must degrade one strand of mtDNA, beginning at the cleaved EcoRI site, to provide a probe hybridization site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, following hybridization of the padlock probe, 29 DNA polymerase must shorten the unprimed 3-end so that it becomes located sufficiently near the probe hybridization site to function as a primer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both of these exonucleolytic events are likely to be inhibited in a distance-dependent manner in an in situ preparation of formaldehyde fixed tissue, since in vivo mtDNA is bound to varying degrees, depending on context, by mtDNA-packaging proteins such as TFAM1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Larsson et al.42 observed such distance-dependent behaviour, with padlock probes located close to the restriction enzyme-created end being detected twice as frequently as those located 134 bp away.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our experiments, the mtDNA padlock probe is located 1.7 kb away from the exposed 3-end in wild-type mtDNA, but only 66 bp away in mtDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, failure of one or both of the above exonucleases to process the intervening mtDNA provides a mechanistic basis for our ability to specifically detect mtDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With respect to our ability to quantify the fraction of mtDNAtotal represented by mtDNA using tpRCA, we note that target sites for mtDNA and mtDNAtotal padlock probes are located at different distances from their closest EcoRI cut sites: 66 and 44 bases, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming that the ability of a 3-end to prime tpRCA is a linear function of distance (based on the above proposed mechanisms, and the observations of Larsson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  )42, we applied a correction factor for different efficiencies of RCA of the circularized padlock probes by adjusting the percentage of mtDNA (red) to mtDNAtotal (green) loci on tpRCA images by 3/2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'mitoAflIII fly feeding experiments', 'The
