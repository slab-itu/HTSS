Neuronal uptake and propagation of a rare phosphorylated high-molecular-weight tau derived from Alzheimers disease brain  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Tau pathology is known to spread in a hierarchical pattern in Alzheimers disease (AD) brain during disease progression, likely by trans-synaptic tau transfer between neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the tau species involved in inter-neuron propagation remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify tau species responsible for propagation, we examined uptake and propagation properties of different tau species derived from postmortem cortical extracts and brain interstitial fluid of tau-transgenic mice, as well as human AD cortices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that PBS-soluble phosphorylated high-molecular-weight (HMW) tau, though very low in abundance, is taken up, axonally transported, and passed on to synaptically connected neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that a rare species of soluble phosphorylated HMW tau is the endogenous form of tau involved in propagation and could be a target for therapeutic intervention and biomarker development.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Accumulation and aggregation of microtubule-associated protein tau1, as intracellular inclusions known as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), is a pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimers disease (AD)2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cognitive deficits in AD are most closely linked with progression of NFTs in a hierarchical pattern, starting in the entorhinal cortex (EC) and marching throughout the brain during disease progression4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the precise mechanisms for this characteristic tau pathology spread remain unknown, accumulating evidence suggests a trans-synaptic transfer of tau proteins between neurons6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By developing the rTgTauEC mouse model of early AD that overexpresses human mutant P301L tau selectively in the EC, we and other groups have demonstrated that aggregated tau accumulates in synaptically connected downstream areas such as dentate gyrus, suggesting that NFT propagation occurs by cross-synaptic spread of pathologically misfolded tau proteins9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other studies demonstrated that pathological forms of tau replicate conformation and spread among cells, thus suggesting that prion-like mechanisms underlie the stereotyped propagation of tau13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown that tau can be secreted from intact neurons into the extracellular space in an activity-dependent manner17,18, supporting the idea that extracellular misfolded tau that is taken up by neurons may provide a platform for tau pathology spreading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Better understanding of the molecular basis of tau propagation is key to preventing progression from early mild memory impairment to full cognitive deterioration and dementia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recent studies showed that cellular tau uptake and trans-cellular propagation occur in various systems in vitro and in vivo; however, whether the tau species involved in neuron-to-neuron transfer is fibrillar or not, and what its specific properties are, remains uncertain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, to identify the specific tau species responsible for propagation, we compared the uptake and propagation properties of different tau species derived from brain extracts of tau-transgenic mouse lines rTg4510 (expressing aggregating P301L tau (0N4R))19 and rTg21221 (expressing non-aggregating wild-type (WT) human tau (0N4R))20, human sporadic AD brain extracts, and recombinant WT full-length human tau (2N4R, 441 amino acid (aa)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We isolated the propagating tau species via differential centrifugation and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), characterized it biochemically, and then studied its neuronal uptake in mouse primary cortical neurons and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all different sources of tau, efficient uptake was only observed for high-molecular-weight (HMW) tau species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We then examined the transfer of tau between neurons using a newly developed microfluidic neuron culture platform, which comprises three distinct chambers that are connected through arrays of thin channels such that the axon growth and formation of synaptic connections are precisely controlled between neurons in different chambers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a unique large-pore (1,000 kDa cutoff) probe in vivo microdialysis21,22 allowed us to investigate the presence of HMW tau species in brain interstitial fluid (ISF) of awake, freely moving mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that PBS-soluble phosphorylated HMW tau species, present in the brain extracellular space, are involved in neuronal uptake and propagation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Identifying the tau species that can be transferred between neurons is essential for understanding mechanisms by which misfolded tau propagates in AD and other tauopathies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we characterized the uptake and propagation properties of tau from various sources: brain extracts and ISF from tau-transgenic mice, brain extracts from postmortem AD patients and recombinant human tau protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that a rare HMW tau species, which accounts for only a small fraction (estimated at  less_than 1%) of all soluble tau species in the AD samples, was robustly taken up by neurons, whereas uptake of LMW tau was very inefficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Findings from the microfluidic neuron culture platform confirmed that this rare species is uniquely capable of propagating between neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we demonstrated that tau with similar biochemical characteristics can be identified in the brain ISF of rTg4510 animals obtained while they were awake and behaving, raising the possibility that it is a normal product in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ISF can also donate tau that can be taken up by neurons in culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data imply that (i) a relatively rare, HMW, phosphorylated tau species is released from neurons and found in brain ISF; and (ii) this species can be taken up, axonally transported, secreted and taken up by synaptically connected neurons and thus propagated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Uptake of tau from mice expressing aggregating P301L tau (rTg4510) depended on tau molecular weight, correlated with the level of phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that oligomerization and pathological phosphorylation increased the uptake efficiency of tau.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HMW tau species had a pathologically misfolded conformation (positive for Alz50 antibody staining) and appeared as non-fibrillar structures in AFM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies reported that synthetic tau fibrils26,27,28,29 or fibrillar tau species extracted from tau-transgenic mouse brain14,15 could be taken up by neurons and induce filamentous tau pathology in vitro and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observations indicate instead that soluble, misfolded HMW tau present in the extracellular space likely plays a role in propagation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preliminary data using extracts from a human G389R tau mutation case with frontotemporal dementia that did not have filamentous tau inclusions nonetheless showed tau uptake into neurons from a PBS-soluble extract, thus supporting the conclusion that soluble tau rather than filamentous aggregates support the propagation phenomenon described here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our findings do not entirely exclude the involvement of LMW tau species in uptake and propagation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may well be possible that the concentration of tau used in this study (500 ng ml1 human tau) was too low for uptake of LMW tau species, or that immunostaining was not sensitive enough to detect LMW tau internalized by neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Michel et al.30 demonstrated that extracellular monomeric tau enters SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells at concentration as high as 1 M (55 g ml1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, consistent with our findings, the same study showed that tau aggregates can be released and then internalized by other cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The intracellular accumulation of insoluble tau aggregates has long been considered to be toxic to neurons31; however, a recent study reported that insoluble tau aggregates are not sufficient to impair neuronal function32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings from the cell viability assay (Supplementary Figs 10 and 11) imply that tau uptake and subsequent intracellular aggregation do not cause acute cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further work will be needed to explore the long-term effect of extracellular and taken-up HMW tau on neuronal function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Spread of tau pathological lesions from medial temporal lobe towards temporal and other neocortical regions correlates well with the extent of cognitive impairment5, and the number of tangles appears to increase in each brain area with increasing duration of disease3,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If one mechanism for this spread is trans-synaptic propagation of misfolded tau species, as has been postulated, then understanding the parameters that govern this process is of importance in designing effective strategies to slow progression of cognitive changes in AD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extracellular tau propagation can be divided into uptake, axonal transport, release and re-uptake phases, with pathobiological processes leading to enhanced or diminished rates at each step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that uptake of unmodified LMW tau at physiological concentrations is not detected during the time course of our experiments, whereas uptake of a relatively rare HMW phosphorylated species is very efficient, occurring within 24 h of exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even in vivo, injection of the HMW tau, as opposed to the much more abundant LMW tau species, leads to uptake into neurons both in WT (Supplementary Fig 6) and pre-tangle stage rTg4510 (Fig 1jl) mouse brains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three lines of data support the idea that phosphorylation is important: uptake efficiency correlates with extent of phosphorylation (Figs 2 and 6); enzymatically dephosphorylating the tau blocks uptake (Fig 7df); and some phospho-tau specific antibodies are able to block uptake despite being relatively ineffective in IPing tau from the rTg4510 brain extract (Fig 7gj).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, recombinant non-phosphorylated tau, even when prepared as a HMW oligomer, is not taken up efficiently by neurons (Fig 7ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The HMW tau appears to be quite stable once it is taken up, as it is detectable days after it is washed off (Fig 5), which might be due to the hyperphosphorylation state of this species34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It undergoes axonal transport, is released, and can be taken up by the next neuron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus after initial uptake, at least in these model systems, axonal transport, release into a synapse and trans-synaptic propagation seem to occur relatively rapidly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If these data are applicable to human AD, the implication is that formation, release and uptake of the HMW phosphorylated forms of tau are key factors in determining propagation of tau across neural systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of HMW phospho-tau species accounted for  less_than 1% of the total PBS-soluble tau in AD brain extracts, and  less_than 10% even in mutant-tau overexpressing rTg4510 mouse brain extracts, in contrast to the much more abundant LMW tau species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that targeting HMW tau species may be an effective way of blocking or slowing the tau propagation cascade in AD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intervention to deplete these specific extracellular tau species might inhibit tau propagation and hence disease progression in tauopathies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
