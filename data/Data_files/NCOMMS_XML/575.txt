SIKs control osteocyte responses to parathyroid hormone  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Parathyroid hormone (PTH) activates receptors on osteocytes to orchestrate bone formation and resorption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that PTH inhibition of SOST (sclerostin), a WNT antagonist, requires HDAC4 and HDAC5, whereas PTH stimulation of RANKL, a stimulator of bone resorption, requires CRTC2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Salt inducible kinases (SIKs) control subcellular localization of HDAC4/5 and CRTC2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PTH regulates both HDAC4/5 and CRTC2 localization via phosphorylation and inhibition of SIK2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like PTH, new small molecule SIK inhibitors cause decreased phosphorylation and increased nuclear translocation of HDAC4/5 and CRTC2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SIK inhibition mimics many of the effects of PTH in osteocytes as assessed by RNA-seq in cultured osteocytes and following in vivo administration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once daily treatment with the small molecule SIK inhibitor YKL-05-099 increases bone formation and bone mass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, a major arm of PTH signalling in osteocytes involves SIK inhibition, and small molecule SIK inhibitors may be applied therapeutically to mimic skeletal effects of PTH.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Osteoporosis is a serious problem in our ageing population, with fragility fractures costing $25 billion annually1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Novel treatments are needed to boost bone mass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Osteocytes, cells buried within bone, orchestrate bone remodelling by secreting endocrine and paracrine factors2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Central amongst these are RANKL (encoded by the TNFSF11 gene), the major osteocyte-derived osteoclastogenic cytokine3,4 and an FDA-approved osteoporosis drug target, and sclerostin (encoded by the SOST gene), an osteocyte-derived WNT pathway inhibitor that blocks bone formation by osteoblasts5 and current osteoporosis drug target6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'When given once daily, parathyroid hormone (PTH), is the only approved osteoporosis treatment agent that stimulates new bone formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proximal signalling events downstream of Gs-coupled PTH receptor signalling in bone cells are well-characterized7, but how cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) generation in osteocytes is linked to gene expression changes remains unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SOST and RANKL are well-established target genes important for the physiological effects of PTH on osteocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the mechanisms through which PTH stimulates new bone formation, down-regulation of SOST expression in osteocytes plays an important role8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PTH also stimulates bone catabolism, in large part through stimulation of osteoclastogenesis via inducing RANKL11,12,13,14, which may limit its therapeutic efficacy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have previously described a role for the class IIa histone deacetylase HDAC5 as a negative regulator of MEF2C-driven SOST expression, both in vitro in Ocy454 osteocytic cells15 and in vivo16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Class IIa HDACs are uniquely endowed with N-terminal extensions that allow them to sense and transduce signalling information17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When phosphorylated, class IIa HDACs are sequestered in the cytoplasm via binding to 14-3-3 proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When de-phosphorylated, they are able to translocate to the nucleus to inhibit MEF2-driven gene expression18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like class IIa HDACs, cAMP-regulated transcriptional coactivators (CRTC) proteins shuttle from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where they function as CREB coactivators19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both HDAC4/5 and CRTC2 are known substrates of salt inducible kinases (SIKs)19,20,21,22, and SIK3 deficiency in growth plate chondrocytes increases nuclear HDAC4 and delays MEF2-driven chondrocyte hypertrophy21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we show that PTH signalling in osteocytes uses both HDAC5 and the closely related family member HDAC4 to block MEF2C-driven SOST expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, PTH-stimulated RANKL expression requires CRTC2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PTH signalling, via cAMP, inhibits SIK2 cellular activity in osteocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SIK inhibition, both in vitro and in vivo, achieved via the small molecule YKL-05-093, is sufficient to mimic many of the effects of PTH, including lower levels of HDAC4/5/CRTC2 phosphorylation, SOST inhibition and RANKL stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, a major arm of PTH signalling in osteocytes involves SIK inhibition, as revealed by RNA-seq analysis of PTH- versus YKL-05-093-treated osteocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we demonstrate that YKL-05-099 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23), an analogue of YKL-05-093 with properties making it suitable for targeting SIKs in vivo, is able to boost osteoblast numbers, bone formation, and bone mass in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, our results demonstrate that a PTH receptor/cAMP/SIK/class IIa HDAC/CRTC axis has a crucial role in osteocyte biology.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Class IIa HDACs control bone mass through SOST', 'Having previously demonstrated that HDAC5 blocks MEF2C-driven SOST expression in osteocytes16, we sought to determine whether HDAC5 and SOST interact in vivo to control bone mass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two complementary approaches demonstrated that this was the case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, compound heterozygosity of HDAC5 and SOST rescued the cortical and trabecular high bone mass phenotype of SOST+/ mice (Supplementary Fig 1AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, anti-sclerostin antibody treatment rescued the trabecular osteopenia present in HDAC5/ animals (Supplementary Fig 1D), which have high levels of SOST expression16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'With evidence that HDAC5 control of SOST is physiologically important, we asked if other class IIa HDACs function in osteocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We16 and others24 have previously reported that HDAC5/ mice display mild trabecular osteopenia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these studies, we extended our analyses to include the closely related family member HDAC4 for two reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, endogenous MEF2C immunoprecipitates from Ocy454 cells contained HDAC4 in addition to HDAC5 (Fig 1a and ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, while no obvious skeletal phenotype was observed when HDAC4 was deleted from osteocytes using DMP1-Cre25, compound deletion of both HDAC4 and HDAC5 led to a skeletal phenotype not observed in either single mutant strain, characterized by severe trabecular osteopenia (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig 1F for results of static and dynamic histomorphometry results), increased osteocyte density (Fig 1b,c), disorganized, woven cortical bone (Fig 1d), failure to respond to sclerostin antibody (Supplementary Fig 1D), and reduced endocortical bone formation (Supplementary Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we previously reported, mice lacking HDAC5 alone show mild cancellous osteopenia and reduced markers of bone formation by histomorphometry16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: HDAC4 and HDAC5 control osteocyte biology in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Endogenous MEF2C was immunoprecipitated from Ocy454 cells, followed by immunoblotting for the indicated proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data shown are representative of n=3 independent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Osteocyte density in cortical bone 3 mm below the growth plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  45, 8 week old male mice per genotype was analysed, *indicates P less_than 0.01 versus WT by students unpaired two tailed t-test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Representative H+E section demonstrating increased osteocyte density and disorganized cortical bone in DKO (HDAC4f/f; HDAC5/;DMP1-Cre) mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 40 m.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'PTH is currently the only approved osteoporosis therapy that promotes new bone formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While its effects on target cells in bone are broad, major target genes in osteocytes responsible for its ability to increase both bone formation and resorption include SOST and RANKL, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate that SIKs act as gatekeepers to regulate a major arm of PTH signalling in osteocytes, including (but not limited to) these two important target genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tonic SIK activity leads to constitutive phosphorylation and cytoplasmic localization of HDAC4/5 and CRTC2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of protein kinase A, as occurs with activation of the PTH receptor7, leads to multisite phosphorylation on SIK2, modifications that inhibit its cellular activity36,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This inhibition reduces tonic HDAC4/5 and CRTC2 phosphorylation, which in turn leads to their nuclear localization and action on respective target genes (Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether this pathway operates in other PTH/PTHrP target cells, such as chondrocytes45, renal epithelial cells46, T lymphocytes47 and adipocytes48 remains to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 9: Model showing PTH signaling via inhibition of SIK2 in osteocytes.In the absence of PTH signaling, SIK2 tonically phosphorylates its substrates HDAC4/5 and CRTC2, leading to their cytoplasmic retention via binding to 14-3-3 chaperones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PTH signaling leads to PKA-mediated phosphorylation of SIK2, which inhibits its cellular activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This in turn reduces phosphorylation of HDAC4/5 and CRTC2, leading to their dephosphorylation by an unknown phosphatase (ppase), and subsequent nuclear translocation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small molecule SIK inhibitors (YKL-05-093 and YKL-05-099) mimic the effects of PTH by directly blocking SIK2 kinase activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the nucleus, HDAC4/5 block MEF2C-driven SOST expression, while CRTC2 enhances CREB-mediated RANKL gene transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PTH-induced reductions in sclerostin contribute to increased bone formation, while PTH-induced increases in RANKL drive increased bone resorption.Full size image', 'HDAC4/5 are required for PTH-stimulated SOST repression in osteocytes, through effects on MEF2C binding to the +45 kB SOST enhancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous overexpression studies have suggested that PTH signalling impinges on the upstream SOST enhancer29,49,50: here we show that HDAC4/5 are required for this effect using loss of function approaches in vitro and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At later time points, PTH treatment reduces in MEF2C mRNA levels32,33,51, in addition to the post-translational effects on DNA binding observed here earlier (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, PTH induces both the rapid nuclear translocation of HDAC4 and, at later time points, increases in HDAC4 mRNA (Fig 6 and ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is interesting that PTH signalling has evolved two complementary mechanisms to inhibit MEF2C activity: HDAC4/5-mediated inhibition of binding of MEF2C to target genes and inhibition of transcription of the MEF2C gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since MEF2C autoregulation is known to occur53, future studies will focus on whether class IIa HDACs regulate MEF2C-driven expression of MEF2C itself, and other targets of MEF2C in osteocytes54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'HDAC4/5 DKO mice display several phenotypes not present in either single knockout strain or in mice over-expressing

animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, class IIa HDACs control expression of additional genes in osteocytes that potently regulate skeletal biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, as evident by the fact that HDAC4/5 DKO mice show a preserved bone anabolic effect of intermittent PTH treatment (Supplementary Fig 4A), class II HDAC/SOST-independent pathways that mediate the pharmacologic effects of parathyroid hormone must exist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interesting parallels and distinct differences are noted between PTH-mediated SOST suppression in osteocytes and PTHrP-mediated suppression of

nuclear translocation may differ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PTH signalling in osteocytes involves inhibition of SIK activity, while in chondrocytes, PTHrP signalling activates the cAMP-dependent phosphatase PP2A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That being said, a role for SIKs in PTHrP signalling in chondrocytes cannot be excluded given the fact that SIK3-deficiency21 appears to phenocopy the effects of PTHrP overexpression56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experiments with okadaic acid and PP2A shRNA (Supplementary Fig 4AD) argue against a major role for PP2A in mediating PTH signalling in osteocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

co-activator, CRTC2, for PTH-induced RANKL gene regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is of interest that PTH action requires two pathways, one involving a direct PKA target (CREB) and another that uses PKA-mediated SIK inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since SIK inhibition, through suppression of SOST expression, can also increase bone formation, one can speculate that this use of the SIK pathway forces PTH action to link bone resorption and bone formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A recent report has suggested that, in osteoblasts, PTH signalling promotes proteasomal degradation of HDAC4 that in turn

types used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We favour a model in which PTH induces RANKL expression in osteocytes via its 75 kB enhancer through SIK-dependent CRTC2 nuclear translocation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The use of SIK inhibitors uniquely allows us to examine the acute effects of changes in SIK enzyme activity in cells and mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments show that the effects of SIK inhibition are

their use complements the data derived from the genetic studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While YKL-05-093 and YKL-05-099 do inhibit kinases other than SIKs when tested in vitro, many of their effects in
