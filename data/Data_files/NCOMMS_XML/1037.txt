Charting organellar importomes by quantitative mass spectrometry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Protein import into organelles is essential for all eukaryotes and facilitated by multi-protein translocation machineries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysing whether a protein is transported into an organelle is largely restricted to single constituents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This renders knowledge about imported proteins incomplete, limiting our understanding of organellar biogenesis and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we introduce a method that enables charting an organelles importome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The approach relies on inducible RNAi-mediated knockdown of an essential subunit of a translocase to impair import and quantitative mass spectrometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To highlight its potential, we established the mitochondrial importome of Trypanosoma brucei, comprising 1,120 proteins including 331 new candidates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the method allows for the identification of proteins with dual or multiple locations and the substrates of distinct protein import pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate the specificity and versatility of this ImportOmics method by targeting import factors in mitochondria and glycosomes, which demonstrates its potential for globally studying protein import and inventories of organelles.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Most eukaryotic proteins are encoded in the nuclear genome and synthesized in the cytosol, but many need to be further sorted before they reach their final destination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These proteins follow distinct import pathways into various organelles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting protein inventories define the identity and functions of organelles in eukaryotic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knowing the subcellular localization of a protein, its import route, and the complete protein compendium of an organelle therefore lies at the heart of cell biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A proteins subcellular localization can be analysed microscopically using fluorescently labelled proteins or antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, it can be determined biochemically by cell fractionation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, while the first method allows the analysis of proteins in living or at least morphologically intact cells, it cannot easily be adopted to proteome-wide studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Traditional cell fractionation in combination with mass spectrometry (MS), referred to as organellar proteomics1,2, does not suffer from this drawback.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it remains essentially impossible to isolate organelles to homogeneity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This considerably limits the accuracy of this approach, which is especially true for the discrimination of low abundant organellar constituents and co-purifying contaminants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both approaches have also severe limitations when dealing with proteins that are simultaneously localized to more than one compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To alleviate some of these restrictions, elaborate proteomic profiling approaches employing quantitative MS have been implemented3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In previous work, we used a global quantitative profiling method to establish a most complete list of mitochondrial outer membrane (OM) proteins of Trypanosoma brucei7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we sought to establish a map of the entire mitochondrial proteome of T. brucei that is imported from the cytosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this aim, we designed and implemented a method, which combines the power of cell fractionation, stable isotope labelling (that is, SILAC12, peptide stable isotope dimethyl labelling13) and quantitative MS with an additional filter that specifically selects for proteins whose mitochondrial localization depends on the main protein translocation machinery located in the mitochondrial OM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This filter is based on inducible knockdown of the central, pore-forming subunit of the translocase to efficiently impair mitochondrial protein import in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that this method overcomes issues of limited specificity inherent to existing organellar proteomics approaches as it provides information about whether a protein is imported or not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It even allows for the unambiguous identification of mitochondrial proteins with dual or multiple localizations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the method holds the potential of globally identifying the substrates of different protein import pathways into mitochondria as demonstrated by targeting ATOM40, SAM50 and ERV1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a proof of concept study, we further show its applicability to the mapping of proteins imported into glycosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe that this versatile method will enable scientists to address many of the still open questions related to organellar proteomes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Loss of ATOM40 diminishes levels of substrate proteins', 'We recently elucidated function and molecular architecture of the archaic translocase of the mitochondrial outer membrane (ATOM), which is essential for the import of mitochondrial precursor proteins into the mitochondrion of the parasitic protozoan T. brucei14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we exploit the fundamental role of ATOM as main gatekeeper of mitochondria to develop a method that permits to globally identify the pool of mitochondria-imported proteins to which we refer to as the mitochondrial importome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To effectively impair import of mitochondrial precursor proteins, we targeted ATOM40, which is the central, pore-forming -barrel protein of ATOM16 (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following induction of RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of ATOM40, we observed two major effects when analysing total cell lysates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, unprocessed precursor forms of some presequence-containing proteins accumulated (Fig 1b, CoxIV, mtHSP70, REAP1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected when protein import is inhibited, these were localized in the cytosol (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the steady-state levels of all mitochondrial proteins tested decreased considerably (Fig 1b), irrespective of their submitochondrial localization and whether they contain a presequence or not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the levels of the cytosolic protein EF1a, which serves as control for a non-imported protein, did not change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Knockdown of ATOM40 reduces mitochondrial protein abundance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Trypanosomal precursor proteins enter the mitochondrion through the ATOM translocase located in the outer membrane (OM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tetracycline (Tet)-induced RNAi-mediated knockdown (+Tet) of the central protein import pore ATOM40 impairs import of precursor proteins into the organelle resulting in the depletion of mitochondrial proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Immunoblots showing the steady-state levels of mitochondrial proteins in whole-cell extracts on Tet-induced RNAi of ATOM40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins are: voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), cytochrome c (CYT C), cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4 (COXIV), cytochrome c1 (CYT C1), mitochondrial carrier protein 5 (MCP5), mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 (mtHSP70), and RNA-editing-associated protein 1 (REAP1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Precursors (p) and mature (m) protein forms are indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cytosolic elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1) serves as a control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Submitochondrial locations of proteins are indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IM, inner membrane; IMS, intermembrane space; OM, outer membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Immunoblot analysis of whole cell (T) and digitonin-extracted, mitochondria-enriched pellet (P) and soluble (S) fractions of uninduced (Tet) and induced (+Tet) ATOM40-RNAi cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Precursor (p)

isolated from uninduced (Tet) and induced (+Tet) ATOM40-RNAi cells, coding for known mitochondrial proteins, which were strongly downregulated on ablation of ATOM40 (see Supplementary Data 1).

ATOM40-RNAi cells cultured in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cytosolic EF1a serves as control.Full size image', 'We demonstrate that the observed reduction in the amounts of mitochondrial proteins is not due to a change in their respective messenger RNA levels (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simplest explanation for these results is that ablation of ATOM40 causes a decrease in the levels of imported proteins along with an accumulation of non-imported, nuclear-encoded precursors in the cytosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the cytosolic accumulation is not always evident since mistargeted proteins are rapidly degraded by the proteasome, as evidenced by their slower degradation in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar effect has recently been described for yeast17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the decrease of the mitochondrial levels of imported proteins is mainly due to reduced import.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, differences in the extent of reduction are observed as not all imported proteins have the same half-lives in mitochondria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The levels of imported proteins that are subunits of protein complexes, for example, may even be further reduced by intramitochondrial degradation if the levels of putative binding partners become limiting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, a reduction in the mitochondrial abundance of a protein in induced ATOM40-RNAi cells is indicative of its mitochondrial localization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Defining the mitochondrial importome', 'We envisioned that the quantitative proteomic comparison of gradient-purified mitochondria from induced (+Tet) versus uninduced (Tet) ATOM40-RNAi cells is an effective approach to delineate the mitochondrial importome (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the exception of OM proteins that do not rely on ATOM40 for membrane insertion and mitochondrially encoded proteins, this importome represents the entire mitochondrial proteome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method, which we termed ImportOmics, combines the advantages of cell fractionation (that is, reduction of sample complexity and enrichment of low abundant organellar proteins) with a functional filter for specifically selecting proteins imported into mitochondria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, this filter is essentially independent of the quality of the cell fractionation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Delineation of the ATOM40-dependent mitochondrial importome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) General workflow to study the mitochondrial importome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using stable isotope labelling by amino acid in cell culture (SILAC), procyclic ATOM40-RNAi cells were differentially labelled with heavy arginine (Arg10) and lysine (Lys8) or their light counterparts (Arg0/Lys0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tetracycline-induced (+Tet) and uninduced (Tet) ATOM40-RNAi cells were mixed at day 3 after induction and mitochondria were purified by differential and Nycodenz density gradient centrifugation (n=4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mitochondria were analysed using a gel-based LC-MS approach followed by computational data analysis to establish the mitochondrial importome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) SILAC-RNAi data obtained in a were visualized in a volcano plot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins with a P value  less_than 0.05 (n=4) and a mean log2 ratio of less than or equal to 0.62

SAM50 are annotated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mitochondrial reference proteins (934) are depicted in black, others (1,442) in grey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ce) Volcano plot shown in b with different classes of proteins highlighted in black as indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For details about mitochondrial inner membrane (IM) and outer membrane (OM) proteins as well as the definition of non-mitochondrial

gradient-purified mitochondrial fractions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each reference set, the portion of proteins that are part of the mitochondrial importome (mean log2 ratio less than or equal to 0.62, P value  less_than 0.05, n=4) is depicted in dark grey, while the fraction of proteins that do not belong to the importome is depicted in light grey.Full size image', 'To test our approach, we first established a small-scale purification protocol that allows for the isolation of mitochondria by differential and Nycodenz density-gradient centrifugation18 from 1010 cells of the procyclic form of T. brucei (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we performed SILAC of ATOM40-RNAi cells followed by RNAi induction (Fig 2a and Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To minimize indirect effects of ATOM40 knockdown in living cells, induced ATOM40-RNAi cells were harvested early, at the onset of the growth arrest (3 days after induction) (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Uninduced ATOM40-RNAi cells were cultured in parallel and harvested at the same point in time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a comparable growth defect, a significant reduction of the RNAi target ATOM40, and an accumulation of COXIV precursor in all four replicates (Supplementary Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gel-based liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) analyses of mitochondria purified from SILAC-ATOM40 knockdown and control cells (Fig 2a) resulted in the identification of 2,564 proteins exhibiting at least one SILAC ratio with an overlap of 2,133 proteins (83.2%) across all replicates (Supplementary Fig 2a, Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SILAC ratios were highly reproducible between experiments with Pearson correlation coefficients in the range between 0.85 and 0.93 (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For further evaluation, we considered 2,376 proteins (92%) to be reliably quantified (for details, see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these, 934 (39.3%) were part of the mitochondrial reference proteome defined in this work (Supplementary Fig 2c, Supplementary Data 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As depicted in the volcano plot (Fig 2b), most mitochondrial reference proteins were decreased in abundance, demonstrating that their import was distinctly impaired following ATOM40 ablation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data highlight the important role of ATOM40 for maintaining the mitochondrial proteome by enabling import of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We showed that loss of ATOM40 leads to the destabilization of the whole ATOM complex15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with this, SILAC analysis of mitochondria deficient for ATOM40 (10.3-fold reduction) revealed strongest effects on the two core subunits ATOM14 (9.7-fold red.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and ATOM11 (9.0-fold red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), the former protein stabilizing the core complex and the latter promoting the association of the core with its receptor subunits ATOM46 and ATOM69 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, downregulation of the receptors ATOM46 (6.0-fold) and ATOM69 (4.6-fold) is presumably a consequence of the loss of ATOM11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, ATOM12 (2.4-fold red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), exhibiting an antagonistic function to ATOM11, is least affected in addition to the recently identified new subunit ATOM19 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14) (2.6-fold red.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Another, more specialized translocase in the mitochondrial OM of trypanosomes is the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) facilitating folding and insertion of -barrel proteins into the OM19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pore-forming subunit of SAM is the highly conserved SAM50, which itself is a -barrel protein and requires ATOM40 for import into mitochondria19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, SAM50 levels were considerably reduced (3.4-fold) in mitochondria lacking ATOM40 (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To exclude the possibility that inhibition of mitochondrial protein import may indirectly cause the depletion of non-mitochondrial proteins that would potentially be detected as false positive hits in an ImportOmics experiment if co-purified with mitochondria, we quantitatively analysed whole lysates of induced (+Tet) versus uninduced (Tet) ATOM40-RNAi cells to a depth of 5,144 proteins (Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the SILACMS analysis of these whole-cell extracts, we determined 523 proteins with a minimum fold-change of 1.5 (P value  less_than 0.05, n=3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these, 515 proteins were reduced in abundance of which the RNAi target ATOM40 and its direct partner proteins ATOM14 and ATOM11 were most affected, while only eight proteins were upregulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further analysed the distribution of 918 mitochondrial and 1,160 non-mitochondrial reference proteins detected in this experiment and found the steady-state levels of 411 mitochondrial but only three non-mitochondrial reference proteins to be reduced in abundance by at least 1.5-fold (P value  less_than 0.05, n=3; Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, based on our proteome-wide SILAC analysis of whole-cell extracts, we conclude that the depletion of ATOM40 specifically diminished the mitochondrial proteome but not the cellular proteome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To demonstrate the specificity of our ImportOmics method, we compared the effects of RNAi-mediated knockdown of ATOM40 and SAM50 by SILACMS analyses of organelle-enriched fractions prepared from RNAi cells by single-step extraction using digitonin21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the extensive decrease of the mitochondrial proteome following ATOM40 ablation (Supplementary Fig 3b, Supplementary Data 4), knockdown of SAM50 at an early time point only resulted in a specific depletion of its -barrel substrates VDAC, the VDAC-like protein Tb927.11.10780 and ATOM40 together with its closely associated partner ATOM14 (Supplementary Fig 3c, Supplementary Data 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data also show the scalability of the method as it was combined with a fast and simple fractionation step requiring only a low number ( less_than 108) of cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To eventually define a high-confidence mitochondrial importome, we determined significance thresholds for SILAC ratios of our data set from gradient-purified mitochondria (Fig 2b) using the two sets of mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial reference proteomes (Supplementary Fig 4a,b, Supplementary Data 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The validity of this approach is shown by the clear separation of the two reference sets (Supplementary Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, we established here the mitochondrial importome comprising 1,120 proteins (Fig 2b, shaded area).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining 1,256 proteins largely represent co-purifying contaminants in gradient-purified mitochondrial fractions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We achieved high coverage of the mitochondrial inner membrane (IM) (269/282 proteins, 95.4%) and OM constituents (66/81, 81.5%)7 in our mitochondrial fractions (Fig 2c,d, Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, the previously determined IM and OM protein compositions were obtained from highly purified mitochondrial subfractions7, whereas the source for this study were isolated mitochondria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, not all OM constituents (25/66, 37.9%) are part of the importome (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biogenesis of some trypanosomal integral OM proteins does not require ATOM40, but depends on pATOM36 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also in yeast, several OM proteins with one or more transmembrane -helical segments are inserted independently of Tom40 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some require the mitochondrial import complex24, while others may insert spontaneously or even use as yet unidentified insertases23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Most importantly, though, the discriminative power of our ImportOmics method is clearly demonstrated by the distribution of non-mitochondrial reference proteins with 496 out of 525 (94.5%) not being affected following ATOM40 knockdown (Fig 2e,f, Supplementary Data 1) Thus, only 29 (5.5%) of the non-mitochondrial reference proteins, but 789 (84.5%) of the mitochondrial ones are part of the newly established importome (Fig 2f), underscoring the effectiveness of our method for the global characterization of the imported mitochondrial proteome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Identification of 331 new mitochondrial candidate proteins', 'We explored our importome data set for new mitochondrial constituents and identified 331 proteins for which a mitochondrial localization has not been reported (Fig 3a, Supplementary Data 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Justified by the virtual absence of obvious contaminants (for example, cytoplasmic ribosomal, flagellar and cytoskeletal proteins) in our mitochondrial importome, we deemed these proteins new mitochondrial candidate proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate our data, we selected five candidates and further six proteins with a reported, but so far unconfirmed mitochondrial localization, tagged their C termini using the c-Myc epitope and expressed them in procyclic T. brucei cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunofluorescence analysis showed that all tagged proteins co-localized with ATOM40 (Fig 3b, Supplementary Fig 5), thus

presequences were predicted for 152 new candidates (46%) (Fig 3c, Supplementary Data 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison, 845 proteins (68.3%) of our mitochondrial reference set contain putative targeting sequences (Supplementary Data 2a), which is in accordance with yeast data23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We here propose that many of the newly identified mitochondrial candidate proteins may likely possess internal or so far uncharacterized targeting signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, only 4 of the 11 newly validated mitochondrial proteins contain a predicted N-terminal presequence (Supplementary

protein BLAST analysis to identify functional orthologues in yeast, mouse or human (Supplementary Data 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We retrieved BLAST hits for 91 new mitochondrial candidates and of these, 46 had orthologues in all three species (Fig 3e), indicating that they are evolutionary conserved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, all 46 orthologues were recently localized to human mitochondria9 and 42 to

proteome of T. brucei by more than 25%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe that this rich dataset will trigger many follow-up studies leading to a better understanding of mitochondrial biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases localize to mitochondria', 'We reasoned that the ImportOmics method should allow for the identification and localization of mitochondrial proteins that do not exclusively reside in mitochondria but exhibit dual or multiple subcellular locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In T. brucei, the mitochondrial genome is devoid of tRNA genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This lack is compensated for by import of a small fraction of essentially all cytosolic tRNAs25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, with very few exceptions, the same set of tRNAs is present in both the cytosol and the mitochondrion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To function in translation, each tRNA needs to be charged with the correct amino acid by its corresponding aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T. brucei has 23 distinct aaRSs, 17 of which are encoded by single-copy genes, while three are encoded by two genes (LysRS-1/-2, AspRS-1/-2 and TrpRS-1/-2), corresponding to the cytosolic or mitochondrial version of the enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we would assume that all of the 17 aaRS encoded by single-copy genes are dually localized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We attempted to demonstrate the postulated dual localization for the trypanosomal tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) using two different biochemical fractionation methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 4a illustrates that in a digitonin extraction of whole cells, the C-terminally c-Myc-tagged TyrRS cofractionates with the cytosolic marker EF1a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same observation is made when gradient-purified mitochondria are analysed (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these results, we would conclude that TyrRS is exclusively cytosolically localized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ImportOmics, however, leads to a different conclusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this approach, we could demonstrate the mitochondrial localization of 15 aaRSs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These comprise the mitochondria-specific enzymes LysRS-2, AspRS-2 and TrpRS-2, while the others are predicted to be dually localized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 4c, Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that these aaRSs are specifically downregulated in gradient-purified mitochondrial fractions on knockdown of ATOM40 excludes them to be cytosolic contaminants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with this, LysRS-1, which is known to be a cytosol-specific enzyme25, while still detected in small amount in isolated mitochondria, was not affected following ATOM40 depletion (Fig 4c, Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, ImportOmics allows for the reliable assignment of mitochondrial proteins with

potential for globally identifying substrates of different import factors as indicated by our SILAC data from ATOM40-RNAi and SAM50-RNAi experiments (see Fig 2b and Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further explore this intriguing possibility, we decided to target the mitochondrial disulfide relay system involved in the import of the majority of soluble intermembrane space (IMS) proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In yeast and human, this pathway, which also mediates the oxidative folding of its substrates, is termed mitochondrial intermembrane space assembly (MIA) pathway and requires the oxidoreductase MIA40 and the sulfhydryl oxidase ERV1/ALR26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the so far characterized MIA pathway substrates in yeast and human are small and rich in cysteines that are arranged in either twin-Cx3C or -Cx9C motives (with x being any amino acid except cysteine).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The double cysteine motifs stabilize their typical helixloophelix core structure by formation of disulfide bonds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typical representatives of these classical MIA substrates are the tiny TIM proteins, for example, TIM9 and TIM10 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional substrates of this pathway such as Tim22 (refs 26, 28) are more complex and thus less easily identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In T. brucei, the MIA pathway is unusual as this organism

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The ImportOmics method opens new avenues for globally studying protein import into organelles through the combination of RNAi, subcellular fractionation and quantitative MS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method can be adapted to different cellular protein import systems by targeting a distinct, central component of their protein import machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is a versatile method that can be used in any other organism in which inducible knockdown of a distinct component of an organellar protein import machinery is feasible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We see advantages over other approaches as the method provides specific information about which proteins are imported into the organelle including the detection of proteins that are only partially localized in this membrane-surrounded cellular compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method is highly specific and applicable to organelles that cannot be purified to homogeneity, although we see that the depth of the established importome increases with the purity of the organelle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We envision that the method offers many opportunities for studying organelles that represent endpoints of protein trafficking routes including mitochondria-related organelles (for example, hydrogenosomes, mitosomes), peroxisomes, chloroplasts and other plastids or the nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of these organelles are difficult to purify and ImportOmics may therefore be especially suited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, it holds great potential for globally identifying in vivo substrates of various protein import pathways, for example, through ablation of individual import receptor proteins or distinct components of different protein import machines within the same organelle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to mitochondria and glycosomes as highlighted in this work, ImportOmics should be in particular useful for the study of chloroplasts and other plastids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In plastids, ImportOmics may allow for assigning substrates to the different thylakoid protein import systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In plant and algae systems, we can envision comparative ImportOmics experiments targeting mitochondria and plastids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We hope that the method will be widely used in cell biology research to further advance our knowledge of how cell organelles master the challenge to maintain and depend on a proteome that is synthesized in the surrounding cytosol.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

demarcating mitochondrial/glycosomal proteins from other proteins were calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we first defined T. brucei-specific mitochondrial/glycosomal and non-mitochondrial/non-glycosomal protein reference sets based on literature and entries in the TriTrypDB49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mitochondrial reference proteome consisted of proteins annotated as mitochondrial in the TriTrypDB49 (version 8.1 as of September 2014) completed by 18 mitochondrially encoded proteins (http://dna.kdna.ucla.edu/trypanosome/seqs/index.html) and proteins reported as mitochondrial in published studies7,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61 covering, among others, mitochondrial ribosomes59, the mitochondrial (outer) membrane proteome7,50, RNA-editing proteins55, the mitochondrial RNA-binding complex 1 (MRB1) complex52,53, mitochondrial carrier proteins60, the respiratome51 and the ATPase61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reference proteome was used to compare the data obtained in this study with the set of so far known and published mitochondrial proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the definition of significance thresholds, however, proteins of the OM (except for -barrel proteins and components of the ATOM complex) were removed from the list since a number of OM proteins do not depend on ATOM40 for membrane insertion and, thus, are not expected to be affected by the ATOM40 knockdown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details about the mitochondrial reference set comprising 1,238 proteins are provided in Supplementary Data 2a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The non-mitochondrial reference proteome comprising 1,542 proteins included proteins used as such before to define the T. brucei MitoCarta58 as well as proteins of the flagellar proteome62 and cytosolic ribosomal proteins63 less proteins with a predicted mitochondrial targeting sequence as determined by TargetP 1.1 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/) (Supplementary Data 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reference proteomes were used to calculate F1 scores integrating the number of true positives (TP), false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The F1 score is defined as harmonic mean of precision TP/(TP+FP) and sensitivity TP/(TP+FN) and was calculated for given SILAC ratios (mean log2 values) starting at the lowest ratio at which at least one TP and one FP were present in the data pool and increasing stepwise in 0.01 increments until the maximum ratio was reached.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This calculation was performed for both the mitochondrial and the non-mitochondrial reference proteome resulting in distinct F1 scores for each reference proteome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the ratio giving the maximum F1 score, the number of proteins in the data pool that are present in the reference proteome tested is highest and the number of proteins present in the opposite reference proteome is lowest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum F1 score that imposes the more stringent filter on the data set was set as significance threshold (that is, t2=0.62; see Supplementary Fig 4) to define the mitochondrial importome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, proteins with a SILAC ratio of less than or equal to 0.62 and a P value of  less_than 0.05 were considered significantly decreased in abundance in gradient-purified mitochondria from ATOM40 knockdown compared to control cells and considered as mitochondrial proteins of high confidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The reference set for glycosomal proteins was based on a study of the glycosomal proteome for the procyclic form of T. brucei and included all glycosomal proteins classified therein as highly confident38 (Supplementary Data 11a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the non-glycosomal reference proteome, the set of mitochondrial reference proteins as described above reduced by all entries annotated as glycosomal proteins of high confidence by Güther et al.38 was used (Supplementary Data 11b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significance thresholds based on F1 scores were determined as described above for the mitochondrial importome and were as follows: t2=0.59 for the glycosomal and t1=0.33 for the non-glycosomal reference proteome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

#@NEW_LINE#@#  Classical MIA pathway substrates present in the genome of T. brucei were predicted based on a global Cx3C/Cx9C motif search approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We searched the genome of Trypanosoma brucei brucei TREU927 for proteins ( less_than 50 kDa) containing two or more Cx3C or Cx9C motifs, which is characteristic for mitochondrial IMS proteins, using the Protein Motif Pattern tool implemented in the TriTrypDB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a list of MIA substrate-like proteins with sequence or structural similarity to MIA substrates described in other organisms was assembled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This list contains candidates from a domain-based search (similar to Cavallaro64), which was performed using the InterPro Domain tool of the TriTrypDB with the following search criteria: organism, Trypanosoma brucei brucei TREU927; Pfam domains, PF06747, PF08583, PF05051, PF02297, PF05676 and PF10203; Interpro domain, IPR009069.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The list was extended by published tiny TIM-like proteins31,33 and proteins referred to as homologues of known MIA substrates in the TriTrypDB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a complete list of the predicted MIA pathway substrates, see Supplementary Data 9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Statistical significance test and GO analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For statistical significance testing, we used the two-sided Fishers exact test to calculate P values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Raw P values were corrected using the BenjaminiHochberg procedure, which controls the false discovery rate at significance level alpha.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the ERV1 knockdown experiment, proteins with a P value  less_than 0.05 and a twofold decrease in abundance were considered significantly affected by the ERV1 knockdown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For confirmation, this set of proteins was tested for overrepresentation of predicted MIA substrate-like proteins or Cx3C/Cx9C motif-containing proteins against all proteins quantified in this experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both classes of predicted MIA pathway substrates as well as their combination were highly enriched indicated by P values of 6.05E22 (MIA substrate-like), 6.56E18 (Cx3C/Cx9C motif) and 1.29E19 (combined).

annotation, missing information about ancestor terms were retrieved using the GO.DB R package, lists of GO terms were reduced to GO Slim terms according to the GO slim Developed by GO Consortium database (http://geneontology.org/), and redundant GO terms were removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis of GO terms that are overrepresented among the glycosomal candidate proteins was performed using the TopGO R package and all proteins quantified in the PEX14-RNAi dataset (Supplementary Data 10) as background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GO terms with a corrected P value of  less_than 0.05 were considered
