The Gq signalling pathway inhibits brown and beige adipose tissue  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates nutritional energy as heat via the uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) and BAT activity correlates with leanness in human adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we profile G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in brown adipocytes to identify druggable regulators of BAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty-one per cent of the GPCRs link to the Gq family, and inhibition of Gq signalling enhances differentiation of human and murine brown adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, activation of Gq signalling abrogates brown adipogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further identify the endothelin/Ednra pathway as an autocrine activator of Gq signalling in brown adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of a constitutively active Gq protein in mice reduces UCP1 expression in BAT, whole-body energy expenditure and the number of brown-like/beige cells in white adipose tissue (WAT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, expression of Gq in human WAT inversely correlates with UCP1 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our data indicate that Gq signalling regulates brown/beige adipocytes and inhibition of Gq signalling may be a novel therapeutic approach to combat obesity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is important for basal and inducible energy expenditure in mammals1,2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, recent findings indicate that adult humans possess metabolically active BAT6 and that obese subjects have reduced activity of BAT7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BAT uniquely expresses the uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1), a mitochondrial protein which uncouples ATP production from oxidative phosphorylation leading to energy expenditure in a thermogenic manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, white adipose tissue (WAT) is mainly responsible for energy storage and is an important endocrine tissue that releases adipokines, which in turn regulate energy intake and expenditure8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brown-fat like cells have recently been described in WAT depots9 and their number and activity can be strongly induced by cold exposure, a process described as browning2,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a large family of seven transmembrane proteins11,12 that regulate important biological processes in diverse tissues including adipose tissue13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 25% of currently marketed drugs target GPCRs, illustrating their importance in disease and therapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GPCRs are coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins, which are composed of G,  and  subunits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of GPCRs leads to the disassociation of G from the G dimer, allowing the binding and regulation of signalling effectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The downstream signalling of GPCRs is in part determined by their G protein coupling15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are four main classes of G proteins: Gs, Gi, Gq and G12/13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of Gs and Gi leads to the stimulation or inhibition of cAMP signalling, respectively, while Gq activates phospholipase C (PLC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  G12/13 activates the small GTPase Rho, a pathway also known to be modulated by the Gq family of proteins16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Until now, the analysis of BAT GPCRs has focused mainly on a few Gs-coupled receptors (for example, -adrenergic4 and adenosine18 receptors) that activate cAMP signalling and UCP1-dependent thermogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The function of other G GPCR families in adipocytes is not as clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, in the present study, we investigate the expression pattern of non-odorant GPCRs in brown adipocytes (BAs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis reveals that Gq-coupled receptors are highly expressed in brown adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, using pharmacological and genetic approaches, we found that Gq, via modulation of RhoA signalling, regulates adipogenesis of BAs in vitro and in vivo.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'GPCR expression of brown adipocytes', 'To identify the expression pattern of non-odorant/tastant GPCRs in BAs, we profiled the transcript levels of 347 GPCRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detected 182 GPCRs in preadipocytes and 230 in mature BAs (Supplementary Tables 1,2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18 GPCRs and 66 GPCRs were uniquely expressed in preadipocytes and mature BAs, respectively (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the IUPHAR database (http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/)19 to define GPCRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Class A and adhesion GPCRs represented the two largest classes in both pre- and mature BAs (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During differentiation, class A receptors increased from 139 to 188 receptors, whereas 13 out of the 20 adhesion GPCRs expressed in preadipocytes decreased upon differentiation with five of them decreasing below the detection limit (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With respect to coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins, we found that 14.0 and 31.5% of the GPCRs detected in BAs interact with Gs and Gi, respectively (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, 21.5% of the GPCRs expressed in BAs are predicted to link with Gq/11 (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preadipocytes exhibited a similar pattern of GPCR linkage (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During differentiation, the expression levels of 91 GPCRs changed more than twofold, with 26 and 65 showing a decrease or increase in expression, respectively (Supplementary Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During brown adipogenesis, Gq- and Gi-coupled GPCRs were the largest group of receptors with known G protein linkages to be down- and upregulated, respectively (Supplementary Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: GPCR profiling and Gq signalling in murine brown adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Venn diagram showing unique and

Receptor, Muscarinic 3 (Chrm3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both quantitative PCR (qPCR) and TaqMan GPCR array data demonstrated high expression of Ednra mRNA in preadipocytes and an increase of Ednra during differentiation (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ednrb increased 280-fold (qPCR) and 332-fold (GPCR array) during differentiation; Adra1a increased 83-fold (qPCR) and 322-fold (GPCR array);

not change significantly during differentiation (Supplementary Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, GPCR/Gq/11 signalling might contribute to the differentiation and function of BAs; however, virtually no information exists regarding this signalling pathway in BAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Regulation of adipogenesis by Gq', 'We inhibited Gq/11 signal transduction using pharmacological and genetic approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with FR900359 (FR; 1 M), a natural inhibitor of Gq/11 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20), enhanced differentiation of murine BAs, as demonstrated by increased Oil Red O staining (Fig 1d) and elevated protein levels of the adipogenic markers aP2 and PPAR as well as of the thermogenic marker UCP1 (Fig 1e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To complement the pharmacological approach, we used lentiviral small hairpin RNA (shRNA) directed only against Gq (shGq).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of Gq by 50% (Supplementary Fig 1e) significantly increased adipogenesis, with increased lipid staining (Fig 1d) and expression of adipogenic markers and UCP1 (Fig 1g,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inactivation of Gq signalling thus promotes differentiation of murine BAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To determine the impact of increased Gq signalling on brown adipogenesis, we first selectively enhanced Gq signalling using a Gq-coupled designer GPCR (DREADD)21 that represents a modified M3 muscarinic receptor (Dq)22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dq couples exclusively to Gq and is activated by otherwise pharmacologically inactive clozapine-N-oxide (CNO)22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brown preadipocytes were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing Dq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To analyse Gq-induced responses in living cells in a label-free manner, we used biosensor technology based on dynamic mass redistribution (DMR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of Dq-expressing cells with CNO (1 M) induced a concentration-dependent DMR response with half-maximal activation at 269 nM (Fig 1i,j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, no DMR response was observed in buffer- or CNO-treated wild-type cells (Supplementary Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Dq-induced DMR response was markedly different from the optical traces obtained by stimulation of Gs with isoprenaline (Supplementary Fig 1g,h), implying that DMR can be used to monitor different G protein signalling pathways in BAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of Dq cells with FR abolished the CNO-induced DMR response, providing further evidence for FR as a Gq inhibitor (Fig 1j and Supplementary Fig 1i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Dq stimulation during BA differentiation reduced Oil Red O staining (Supplementary Fig 1j), suppressed expression of adipogenic markers aP2 and PPAR and of UCP1 (Fig 1k,l).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of non-transduced control cells or cells transduced with a control virus (LVctrl) with CNO did not affect differentiation (Fig 1k,l and Supplementary Fig 1j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of Dq without CNO stimulation did not alter BA differentiation (Fig 1k,l and Supplementary Fig 1j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Secondly, we used lentiviral vectors to express a constitutively active mutant of Gq (LVGqQL) as a means to enhance Gq signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We validated the activity of GqQL in brown preadipocytes by measuring IP1 in non-transduced cells and cells that express either GFP or GqQL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IP1 is a downstream metabolite of PLC and IP3, a pathway known to be activated by Gq GPCRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that IP1 levels were highly increased in preadipocytes that express GqQL compared with GFP-expressing or control cells (Supplementary Fig 1k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GqQL overexpression during adipocyte differentiation reduced Oil Red O staining and inhibited the expression of adipogenic and thermogenic markers (Fig 1m,n and Supplementary Fig 1l) in a similar manner as did the DREADD approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Endothelin/Ednra regulation of brown adipocytes', 'To identify an endogenous receptor that activates Gq signalling in BAs, we focused on Ednra, one of the most highly expressed Gq-coupled GPCRs in preadipocytes and BAs (Supplementary Tables 1,2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both preadipocytes and BAs express constituents of the ET system: Endothelin-1 (ET-1), ET receptors type A and B (Ednra and Ednrb) and ET converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although ECE-1 was expressed at low levels in BA, it is not the only enzyme that can catalyse the production of ET-1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, ET-1 was released by both cell types (Fig 2a) and its secretion was inhibited by noradrenaline (NE) (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Role of Endothelin-1 in differentiation and downstream signalling of Gq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Release

'In the present study, we screened for non-chemosensory GPCRs in murine brown preadipocytes and mature adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GPCR profiling revealed that BAs express more than 180 GPCRs and that the expression pattern changes greatly upon differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of GPCRs detected is in agreement with previous analysis performed on human subcutaneous adipose tissue and murine metabolic tissues that detected 163 and 198 GCPRs, respectively29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In BAs, we found that Gq-coupled receptors were one of the largest groups and that their expression was highly altered during differentiation, indicating a potential role in adipogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we show that Gq signalling is a crucial inhibitor of adipocyte differentiation, through activation of the Rho/ROCK signalling cascade, a major regulator of BA differentiation26 (Fig 4g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Treatment with the Gq inhibitor FR enhanced the adipogenic and thermogenic potential of BAs, indicating either the presence of constitutively active Gq receptors and/or an autocrine loop of Gq signalling in BAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of highly expressed Gq-coupled GPCRs indicated that murine BAs and human brown/beige cells express ET receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, murine BAs also express the enzymes necessary for ET production and secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stimulation with ET-inhibited adipogenesis, while the inhibition of Gq and Ednra, but not Ednrb, rescued adipogenesis of ET-treated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, Xue et al.31 identified Endrb as a genetic marker that positively correlates with the thermogenic capacity of cloned human BAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibition of Ednra alone increased the differentiation of untreated cells, indicating endogenous activity of the ET system in BAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our data implicate the ET-1/Ednra signalling axis as an autocrine/paracrine inhibitor of brown/beige adipogenesis via Gq signalling (Fig 4g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to its function in BAT, ET-1 plays an important role in the vasculature and excessive ET-1 contributes to atherosclerosis32 as well as to the disturbed insulin-induced vasorelaxation in obesity33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our data also indicate an inhibitory role of Gq in BAT function and browning in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of GqQL induced a phenotype of BAT reminiscent of whitening, while preventing the browning of WAT in mice exposed to cold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, activation of Gq signalling in brown/beige adipocytes resulted in reduced whole-body energy expenditure of cold-exposed mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our data show that the Gq signalling pathway inhibits brown and beige adipose tissue in vivo and the studies done using cultured adipocytes show that Gq signalling inhibits adipogenesis in a more general manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we found a negative correlation between Gq and UCP1 mRNA expression in human abdominal WAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although abdominal adipose tissue is predominantly white, it can be induced to brown and inducible brown-like cells have been identified in abdominal fat after -3 adrenergic receptor treatment34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies are required to investigate the role of alterations in the expression of BAT marker genes in abdominal fat depots in adult humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Gq signalling is not only involved in regulation of adipocyte differentiation and non-shivering thermogenesis, but also in the CNS regulation of appetite35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, our results demonstrate a previously unappreciated role in brown/beige adipogenesis for Gq, to which 20% of the GPCRs expressed in these cells are predicted to couple.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that antagonizing Gq signalling by targeting Gq-coupled GPCRs and/or by directly inhibiting Gq represent previously unexplored ways to enhance the amount of brown/beige fat and thus increase energy expenditure.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
