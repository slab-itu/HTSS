Discovery of relict subglacial lakes and their geometry and mechanism of drainage  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Recent proxy measurements reveal that subglacial lakes beneath modern ice sheets periodically store and release large volumes of water, providing an important but poorly understood influence on contemporary ice dynamics and mass balance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because direct observations of how lake drainage initiates and proceeds are lacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present physical evidence of the mechanism and geometry of lake drainage from the discovery of relict subglacial lakes formed during the last glaciation in Canada.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These palaeo-subglacial lakes comprised shallow ( less_than 10 m) lenses of water perched behind ridges orientated transverse to ice flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that lakes periodically drained through channels incised into bed substrate (canals).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Canals sometimes trend into eskers that represent the depositional imprint of the last high-magnitude lake outburst.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subglacial lakes and channels are preserved on top of glacial lineations, indicating long-term re-organization of the subglacial drainage system and coupling to ice flow.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'There are hundreds of reported and thousands of predicted subglacial lakes beneath the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subglacial lakes provide a unique microbial ecosystem and depositional environment capable of providing insight into past ice sheet evolution and stability3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lake drainage is documented by deflation of the overlying ice surface on annual timescales5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Drainage is thought to occur over hundreds of kilometres through the subglacial hydrological network and may involve discharge into downstream lakes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we have insufficient knowledge of the lake-drainage process (that is, how drainage initiates and proceeds) to properly constrain its dynamic impact8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Postulated channelized drainage of subglacial lakes5,11 is based on observations and modelling of alpine jökulhlaup systems, where the formation of conduits incised into the ice (Röthlisberger-channels) is well established12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the longer duration drainage of lakes beneath ice sheets implies a different subglacial hydraulic regime14 and is a key unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Do lakes drain through channelized conduits or distributed sheets/cavities, and how do they evolve downstream?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If drainage is via conduits, how many are there, are they incised into sediment or ice, and what is their geometry?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Palaeo-subglacial lakes are widely predicted beneath the former Laurentide Ice Sheet11,15, but investigation of their geological signature and drainage pathways are rare16,17,18 because of the difficulty of distinguishing between proglacial and subglacial lake sediments19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this paper, based on a range of sedimentary, geomorphological and geophysical techniques, we identify relict subglacial lakes and their drainage routeways in Alberta, Canada.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study area encompasses the proposed position of an ice saddle resulting from the coalescence of the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets where model predictions indicate a proclivity for subglacial meltwater convergence and ponding15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest subglacial lakes comprised shallow lenses of water perched behind ridges orientated transverse to ice flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lake drainage occurred repeatedly through channel(s) incised into bed substrate, some of which evolve downstream into R-channels cut up into the overlying ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The formation of subglacial lakes beneath this portion of the Laurentide Ice Sheet may have been associated with the cessation of fast ice-flow.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Geomorphology', 'High-resolution mapping of glacial bedforms from LiDAR in the foothills of central Alberta, western Canada (see the Methods for details), reveal linear clusters of  less_than 5 km diameter flat spots connected by subglacial meltwater channels and eskers (Figs 1, 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These flat spots tend to occur behind low-relief ( less_than 10 m) geologically controlled ridges and palaeo-valleys aligned perpendicular to south east (SE) orientated glacial lineations (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We documented 51 locations within the 11,000 km2 study area where channels emanate from flat spots of which 11 connect to another flat spot downstream.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In eight localities, meltwater channels show a downstream transition into 1040 m wide by 110 m high eskers (for example, Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The channels are either aligned roughly parallel to the former ice-flow direction or down local slopes (Figs 1b and 2a and Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Channels that are connected to palaeo-subglacial lakes have undulating thalwegs that cut across downstream ridges and are typically 200300 m wide, 410 m deep and between 700 and 1,700 m long.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cross-sectional area of the channels is not related to the size of the flat spots (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Glacial geomorphology and GPR profiles at Site 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Location of the palaeo-subglacial lakes in Alberta, Canada.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coloured elevation gradient is the extent of the LiDAR data from which we conducted the mapping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Site 1 is shown in b and Site 2 is shown in Fig 2a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CIS=Cordilleran Ice Sheet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Glacial geomorphology of Site 1 showing the location of a palaeo-subglacial lake (flat spot) connected by a number of inflowing and outflowing subglacial meltwater channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note the downstream transition of the main subglacial meltwater channel into an esker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lines 15 are a GPR profile across the flat spot (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Line 15 is a GPR profile across a meltwater channel (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lines 2334, 2728 and 30 are GPR lines shown in ce.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Supplementary Fig 1a for mapping of flat spots, meltwater channels, eskers and outwash fans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) GPR long profile of esker running downstream from the top of the macroform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) GPR cross-profile of esker showing reflectors that drape a poorly attenuated core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) GPR long profile of esker downstream of the macroform.Full size image', 'Figure 2: Glacial geomorphology at Site 2 and its geophysical and sedimentological characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Glacial geomorphology of Site 2, showing the location of a palaeo-subglacial lake (flat spot) connected to a number of inflowing and outflowing subglacial meltwater channels and eskers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lines 3944 are a GPR profile shown in b.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In summary, mapping of glacial landforms from high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) revealed the presence of flat spots associated with channels and eskers (Figs 1, 2, 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Investigation of the structure and sediments of two flat spots suggests they comprise  less_than 10 m of glaciolacustrine sediment (Fig 2b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A subglacial lake origin is favoured because of their association with subglacial meltwater channels and eskers (Figs 1b and 2a), some of which appear to cut into the glaciolacustrine sediments and must therefore have formed after the flat spot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, a proglacial lake origin is difficult to reconcile with the open configuration of many of the flat-spots (Figs 1b and 2a), requiring awkward ice-margin positions to dam the basins and pond water during north west (NW) ice retreat (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the deposition of thick basin infills (up to 10 m) is at odds with well-preserved subglacial bedforms not overprinted by moraines or thick deglacial deposits, marking still-stand positions, plus there is no evidence of upwards fining indicative of a retreating ice margin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our discovery of palaeo-subglacial lakes and their drainage architecture therefore provides a unique opportunity to characterize its depositional archive and drainage imprint, and to assess the latest theories for lake drainage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given the geometry of the flat spots (hundreds of metres to few kilometres in diameter), the thickness of the sediment fill ( less_than 10 m) and the subdued relief of the glacially lineated topography, the lakes must have existed as shallow (few m deep), sediment-floored water lenses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modelling of the hydraulic potential surface15 suggests low ice-surface slopes (12 m/km) are required to form the lakes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is analogous to many of the active subglacial lakes found beneath low-gradient ice streams in Antarctica21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spatial distribution of lakes perched behind ridges orientated transverse to ice flow and spaced at 510 km intervals is comparable in scale and arrangement to low basal shear stress regions (that is, slippy patches) between rib-like patterns of high basal shear stress (that is, sticky patches), revealed by inversions of basal shear stress beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in our case, variations in basal friction would have arisen from the bed topography (that is, water damming behind ridges) rather than dynamic instabilities in the effective pressure22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The drainage of subglacial lakes is typically assumed to occur through Röthlisberger-channels incised in ice (R-channels)5,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we demonstrate the potential for periodic drainage through channels eroded into the substrate (canals; Fig 4 and Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with more recent modelling studies, which require greater rates of tunnel closure by till deformation to produce the long-duration drainage events observed beneath Antarctica15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The channels were probably incised during a series of basal meltwater production, storage and drainage cycles as their cross-sectional area is not related to the size of the palaeo-subglacial lakes (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The downstream transition from meltwater channels (canals) into 1040 m wide by 110 m high eskers (for example, Fig 1b), demonstrates both an evolution from canals to R-channels, and a switch from sediment erosion to deposition (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deposition is typically associated with a drop in water velocity, which will occur when there is a reduction in the hydraulic gradient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may arise from a change in the slope of the bed or ice, and/or a change in effective pressure, and is consistent with the formation of eskers at the toe of bed slopes, and near the ice margin as evidenced by outwash fans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the formation of an esker-fan 4 km downstream of the palaeo-subglacial lake at Site 1 (Fig 1b) reveals the potential for subglacial lakes to persist beneath thin ice close to the glacier margin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An implication of water drainage through R-channels is that they may not leave a geomorphic imprint if sediment supply is limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The switch from canals to R-channels is consistent with our current theoretical understanding of subglacial floods (see Supplementary Discussion and Supplementary Figs 7 and 8 for details)14,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The form of a channel (that is, whether a canal or R-channel develops) is strongly dependent on the effective pressure, N (ice overburden pressurewater pressure).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An increase in N will cause ice viscosity to decrease and sediment stiffness to increase such that canals will tend to form when N is high, whereas R-channels are favoured when N is low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Critically, the flood theory predicts a decrease in N over a fairly short distance adjacent to the lake and the length of this region is about a kilometre, which is roughly consistent with the observed length scale of the meltwater channels ( less_than 2 km).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the observed transition from canals to R-channels is consistent with theory and may occur if the ratio of sediment stiffness to ice viscosity passes through one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Conceptual model and geometries of periodic subglacial lake drainage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Water ponding behind transverse ridges is shown; when the lake fills or the water pressure becomes high enough water drains across the ridge (b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This occurs through a canal cut down into the sediment that evolves downstream into an R-channel cut up into the ice (b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Filling and draining of the lake may occur many times, with the final drainage depositing an esker in the R-channel (c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) The relict lake and its drainage imprint are shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Graphic is not to scale.Full size image', 'GPR investigation of an esker downstream of a subglacial lake and meltwater channel (Fig 1ce) has allowed the identification of a number of distinctive facies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The central, poorly attenuated core, which is typical of fine-grained sediment such as diamicton or bedrock (Fig 1d), may have been squeezed into the low-pressure conduit during a period of low flow and sediment supply24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reflectors draped over the core can be traced across the 20-m width of the esker, indicating water flow across the entire width of the esker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chaotic and discontinuous reflectors are consistent with rapid anti-dune aggradation of coarse bedload in low-flow depths ( less_than 3 m) and high-flow velocities25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Downstream dipping reflectors towards the top of the sequence relate to foreset accretion in the lee of a depocentre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This macroform manifests as a ridge enlargement at the surface and suggests conduit enlargement during high sediment supply and flow velocity25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Downstream of the esker macroform, continuous sub-horizontal reflectors record vertical accretion by a high-velocity flow where tunnel growth exceeds sediment supply creating accommodation space25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, the GPR data across the esker are consistent with observations of high-magnitude outburst flood eskers formed during a single, rapid drainage event26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The esker, therefore, represents the final drainage of the palaeo-subglacial lake along an at least 1040 m wide by 110 m high R-channel (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If most of the material in the esker (volume: 130,000 m3) was derived from the upstream canal (volume: 560,000 m3), then at least four similar-sized lake drainage events are required to erode the composite canal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we interpret this as evidence for periodic jökulhlaup-style floods beneath contemporary ice sheets, capable of eroding and depositing large volumes of subglacial sediment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with work in NE Alberta that invoke periodic high-magnitude outbursts from subglacial lakes to explain the evolution of large (up to several kilometres wide, tens of kilometres in length and hundreds of metres deep) tunnel valleys cut into sediment27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The depositional environment of the middle unit (2) in the sediment core is interpreted as a low-energy ice-proximal water body dominated by fine-grained outwash and rain-out sedimentation, which is consistent with a subglacial lake origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The organic carbon content of the lake sediments (0.42.8%) is within the range of sediments sampled from small subglacial lakes emerging from beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preservation of horizontal laminations and the absence of a capping till or features associated with shearing suggest that overriding ice did not recouple with the bed and erode sediments from the lake3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the lake must have emerged from under the ice during deglaciation at 16 ka BP or the ice exerted low basal shear stress, likely due to stagnation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis is supported by a mid-Holocene age of 6,870±91 cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BP towards the top of unit 2, which suggests a transition to a subaerial lake environment, with the initiation of peat formation occurring during the late Holocene at 2,460±71 cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lowest three ages range from 23 to 29 cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ka BP and are not in stratigraphic order, which is consistent with a subglacial lake origin, whereby much of the carbon was derived from allochthonous older soils that pre-date the last phase of glacial activity (2616 ka BP)28 and from surface and basal melt inputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Development of palaeo-subglacial lakes and the preservation of their associated deposits above glacial lineations (Figs 1b, 2a and 3) demonstrate a significant hydrological reorganization of the ice-sheet bed during the last deglaciation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The glacial lineations are the imprint of a SE-flowing terrestrial ice stream29, which is typically thought to be strongly influenced by the presence of saturated basal sediments and abundant distributed meltwater, facilitating enhanced deformation and/or sliding of ice across its bed30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We interpret the switch from glacial lineations to subglacial lakes as a record of shut-down of ice streaming, initiated by or resulting in, the development of a channelized drainage system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Critically, fast ice flow will lower the ice-surface slope, which is one means of increasing the potential for subglacial ponding6 and triggering a switch in meltwater regime to one dominated by channelized drainage of subglacial lakes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The long-term development of such an efficient and localized water storage and drainage network capable of withdrawing water from other areas of the bed may be to increase basal resistance, causing ice-stream deceleration or even stagnation, as suggested for the Whillans Ice Stream, West Antarctica31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although lake drainage events may cause transient increases in ice flow5, we also propose the importance of long-term hydro-dynamic feedbacks, which might do the opposite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To our knowledge, this is the first time former subglacial lakes and their drainage architecture have been directly observed beneath the North American ice sheets, and therefore provides a unique glimpse into one of the least explored and understood environments on Earth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are able to provide new constraints on the mechanism and geometry of subglacial lake drainage that are consistent with our current theoretical understanding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show the potential for long-term hydro-dynamic re-organizations, demonstrated by the association of subglacial lakes with the cessation of fast ice-flow in the region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results provide constraints for the modelling of similar subglacial lake drainages beneath the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets.'
