Uncleaved prefusion-optimized gp140 trimers derived from analysis of HIV-1 envelope metastability  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The trimeric HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) is critical for host immune recognition and neutralization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite advances in trimer design, the roots of Env trimer metastability remain elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we investigate the contribution of two Env regions to metastability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we computationally redesign a largely disordered bend in heptad region 1 (HR1) of SOSIP trimers that connects the long, central HR1 helix to the fusion peptide, substantially improving the yield of soluble, well-folded trimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural and antigenic analyses of two distinct HR1 redesigns confirm that redesigned Env closely mimics the native, prefusion trimer with a more stable gp41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we replace the cleavage site between gp120 and gp41 with various linkers in the context of an HR1 redesign.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electron microscopy reveals a potential fusion intermediate state for uncleaved trimers containing short but not long linkers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results outline a general approach for stabilization of Env trimers from diverse HIV-1 strains.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Amajor goal of vaccine development for human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) is to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) by vaccination1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All bNAbs identified thus far target the envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer on the surface of HIV-1 virions2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precursor Env protein, gp160, is trafficked from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi and cleaved by cellular proteases of the furin family into its mature form3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cleaved Env trimer engages host receptors to mediate viral entry and is the primary target of protective humoral immune responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The functional Env is a trimer of heterodimers, each containing a receptor-binding protein, gp120, and a transmembrane fusion protein, gp41, which are held together by non-covalent interactions4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mature Env is also metastable, as it is poised to undergo dramatic and irreversible conformational changes upon receptor and co-receptor binding to mediate membrane fusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This inherent metastability facilitates immune evasion by inducing gp120 shedding5 and generating a diverse assortment of native, more open and non-native Env conformations6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Various strategies have been proposed to overcome Env metastability and to create stable, homogeneous gp140 trimers for structural and vaccine studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One approach involved deletion of the cleavage site between gp120 and the gp41 ectodomain (gp41ECTO), and addition of trimerization motifs to the C terminus of gp41ECTO to stabilize the trimer7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another approach covalently linked the cleaved gp120 and gp41ECTO domains with an engineered disulfide bond (termed SOS), destabilized the gp41 postfusion conformation through addition of an I559P mutation (termed IP) and improved trimer solubility by truncating the hydrophobic membrane-proximal external region at residue 664 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This latter design, designated SOSIP.664, when applied to clade-A BG505 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11), produced a stable, soluble and cleaved gp140 trimer with an outstanding antigenic profile12,13 and excellent structural mimicry of the native spike14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The atomic structures of BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer from X-ray crystallography14,16 and cryo-electron microscopy (EM)15 provided a detailed picture of this long-sought vaccine target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some bNAbs that were previously crystallized with gp120 core and scaffolded V1V2, such as PGV04 and PG9, have now been found to interact with other structural elements present only on the native trimer to enhance recognition of native virions14,15,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the SOSIP trimer as a sorting probe, new bNAbs have been identified and characterized18,19,20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SOSIP design has also been extended to other HIV-1 strains23,24,25 and permitted the incorporation of additional stabilizing mutations26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, the immunogenicity of SOSIP trimers in rabbits and non-human primates was reported, paving the way for human vaccine trials28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the full benefit of retaining cleavage between gp120 and gp41 has been demonstrated for the SOSIP trimer, the utility of flexible linkers at the cleavage site has also been successfully explored with the design of single-chain gp140 (sc-gp140)29 and native flexibly linked (NFL) trimers30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Furin co-expression and bNAb affinity purification are required for the production of soluble, cleaved SOSIP trimers11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Negative selection29,30 and multi-cycle size exclusion chromatography (SEC)29 have recently been reported for purification of well-folded, uncleaved gp140 trimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complexity in production of native-like trimers has limited the use of nucleic acid vaccine platforms32,33,34 and also raised the question of whether we have adequately addressed the causes of HIV-1 Env metastability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we investigate the primary causes of HIV-1 Env metastability and explore alternative trimer designs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that the disorder observed at the HR1 N terminus (residues 547569) is indicative of metastability that could potentially be minimized by protein engineering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we evaluate 10 BG505 gp140 trimers with computationally redesigned HR1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These constructs show substantially higher trimer yield and purity, with native SOSIP-like properties demonstrated by crystal structures, negative-stain EM and antibody binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next examine the structural and antigenic effects of replacing the furin cleavage site between gp120 and gp41 with a linker in the context of a selected HR1 redesign.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analyses uncover the sensitivity of gp140 folding to modification of this proteolytic site, with a potential fusion intermediate state observed for trimers with short linkers lacking the SOS mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the HR1-redesigned trimers with a long linker, termed uncleaved prefusion-optimized (UFO) trimers, adopt a native-like conformation that retains many salient features of the SOSIP trimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we demonstrate the utility of a generic HR1 linker in trimer stabilization for diverse HIV-1 strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our rational approach towards redesign of two critical regions of gp140HR1 and the cleavage siteprovides valuable insights into HIV-1 Env metastability as well as novel platforms for trimer-based vaccine design.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Ensemble-based design of the HR1 N terminus', 'We hypothesized that the N terminus of HR1 (residues 547569) is a critical determinant of HIV-1 trimer metastability because it is poised to elongate the HR1 helix during fusion and is disordered in all but one crystal structure of the SOSIP trimer35 and one cryo-EM structure of full-length, wild-type (WT) Env36, where it still appears less ordered in comparison with the surrounding regions (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such disorder at the top of the long HR1 central helix may seem unexpected since this region resides in the core of the Env complex; however, because this region is expected to form a helix in the postfusion state, as in the equivalent region of influenza hemagglutinin and other type 1 viral fusion proteins37, it must remain less ordered or adopt a different conformation in the prefusion state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the SOSIP design, in addition to an engineered disulfide bond (A501C/T605C), the I559P mutation was introduced to destabilize the postfusion state10 and was critical for the production of high-quality trimers, strongly supporting the notion that this HR1 region might be related to metastability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, the HR1 bend was rationally redesigned to stabilize the prefusion conformation rather than to destabilize the postfusion conformation as in the SOSIP trimer (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this WT HR1 region consists of 21 residues, the C distance between G547 and T569 is merely 24.8 Å, which is equivalent to a fully extended polypeptide backbone of only 6.3 residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we examined two loop lengths8 and 10 residuesfor the HR1 redesign, allowing for a small degree of flexibility while markedly shortening the WT HR1 loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We utilized ensemble-based de novo protein design (see Methods) to identify sequences that may stabilize the prefusion conformation (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given a specified loop length, a large ensemble of backbone conformations was generated to bridge the gap between G547 and T569 (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For 8-residue loops, the C root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) ranged from 1.3 to 5.7 Å with an average of 2.3 Å, whereas 10-residue loops exhibited an average C RMSF of 3.6 Å (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After an exhaustive sampling in sequence space, all designs were ranked by their energy scores (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 5 top-ranking sequences for each loop length, totaling 10, were advanced to experimental validation (Supplementary Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Computational redesign of the HR1 N terminus and cleavage site in the context of a prefusion Env structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Atomic model and

redesigns', 'As demonstrated for SOSIP, sc-gp140 and NFL trimers, biochemical and biophysical properties can provide an initial assessment of trimer designs11,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following a similar strategy, we assessed the 10 HR1-redesigned BG505 trimers containing the same T332N (to restore the N332 epitope), SOS (A501C/T605C) and R6 mutations as in the SOSIP.664 trimer (except for I559P).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As noted, different purification protocols can produce trimers of varying quality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we adopted a rather simple protocol utilizing materials that are readily available to most researchers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All constructs were expressed transiently in HEK293F cells with co-transfected furin as previously described11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The secreted Env proteins were purified using a Galanthus nivalis lectin (GNL) column followed by SEC on a Superdex 200 10/300 column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One-litre expression produced sufficient quantities (37 mg) of HR1-redesigned trimers, compared with three 2-l expressions for the SOSIP trimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although GNL purification does not yield the purest trimers24, it enables comparison of basic properties between various trimer constructs such as monomer, dimer and higher multimeric species (aggregates) that would otherwise be filtered out by more sophisticated purification methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We compared the SEC profiles through simple metrics, utilizing ultraviolet (UV) 280 nm absorbance values (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The UV value of the trimer peak was used as an indicator of the trimer yield, with the aggregate and dimer/monomer peaks measured as percentages of their UV values versus that of the trimer peak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2-l SOSIP expression showed an average UV value of 371 for the trimer peak, with average percentages of 31% and 49% for the aggregate and dimer/monomer peaks, respectively (Fig 2a, top).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The five 8-residue HR1 redesigns showed significantly increased trimer yield with reduced aggregate and dimer/monomer peaks in the SEC profiles (Fig 2a, middle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, HR1 redesigns 1 and 2 were the best performers in this group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the HR1 redesign 2 showed a near-twofold increase in the trimer peak, with a 16 and 22% reduction for aggregate and dimer/monomer peaks relative to SOSIP, indicative of improvement in both trimer yield and purity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The five 10-residue HR1 redesigns showed a similar but less pronounced improvement (Fig 2a, bottom).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notwithstanding, HR1 redesign 10 showed a UV value for the trimer peak that is comparable to the SOSIP trimer from 2-l expression, with the same low level of unwanted Env species as HR1 redesigns 1 and 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding was consistent with the blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) that showed more intense trimer bands on the gel (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trimer-containing fractions eluted at 10.2510.75 ml were used for the initial assessment of trimer stability by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all 10 tested HR1 redesigns, we observed similar unfolding peaks with a thermal denaturation midpoint (Tm) ranging from 65.7 to 69.2 °C (Supplementary Fig 2b), closely resembling the Tm of 68.1 °C reported for the SOSIP trimer11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Biophysical properties and crystal structures of HR1-redesigned Env trimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) SEC profiles of 293F-expressed, GNL-purified WT

redesigns retained the thermal stability of parent SOSIP.664 trimer, they also increased the trimer yield and reduced other undesirable Env species, supporting the notion that this HR1 connecting loop is a key determinant of HIV-1 trimer metastability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Crystallographic analysis of two HR1 redesigns', 'HR1 redesigns 1 and 9 were selected for crystallographic analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two constructs differed in their redesigned loop lengths (8 versus 10 residues) and SEC profiles, with a higher dimer/monomer peak observed for HR1 redesign 9 (Fig 2a), which provided an opportunity to examine how HR1 loop length and design variation affect trimer structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to the stringent requirement of sample homogeneity for crystallization, we prepared the HR1-redesigned and WT SOSIP trimers as previously described38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, all trimers were produced in N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I-negative (GnTI/) HEK293S cells and purified using a 2G12 affinity column followed by SEC on a Superdex 200 16/600 column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the WT SOSIP trimer, the SEC profile displayed a notable aggregate peak of high molecular weight with a UV value that is 58% of the trimer peak, and a lower peak containing gp140 monomers and dimers (Fig 2b, upper panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the 2G12-purified HR1 redesigns showed a marked improvement in trimer yield and purity (Fig 2b, lower panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, HR1 redesign 1 showed an almost undetectable level of monomers and dimers, whereas HR1 redesign 9 still contained a small fraction of impurities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the SEC profiles of 293S-expressed, 2G12-purified trimers are consistent with those of the 293F-expressed, GNL-purified trimers described above (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding was further confirmed by BN-PAGE of SEC fractions (Supplementary Fig 3a,b) and thermal stability of the modified trimers measured by DSC (Fig 2b), suggesting that the improved trimer properties are an intrinsic feature of the HR1 redesigns and independent of the expression and purification systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Co-crystallization with antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) of PGT128 and 8ANC195 yielded Env complex structures at resolutions of 6.9 and 6.3 Å for HR1 redesigns 1 and 9, respectively (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig 3c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the redesigned trimers showed nearly identical structures to that of the SOSIP trimer14,15,16 at this modest resolution, with C root-mean-square deviations (RMSD)  less_than 0.25 Å (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the results confirmed that gp140 trimers with shortened and redesigned HR1 still adopt a native-like prefusion conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The limited resolution of the crystal structure allowed us to only determine the approximate backbone conformation of the redesigned HR1 loop, but nevertheless provided insights into how these two distinct designs stabilize the prefusion trimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that the shortened loop (8 or 10 versus 21 residues in WT) and redesigned sequence disrupt the heptad repeat motif that extends the HR1 helix in the postfusion state, thereby stabilizing the prefusion form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, both HR1 redesigns contained proline, at positions 2 and 6 in the 8-residue loop and at position 8 in the 10-residue loop (Fig 2c), which likely increases the rigidity of the backbone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, Asp 6 in HR1 redesign 9 is poised to form a salt bridge with Arg 579 of the neighbouring HR1 helix, stabilizing the slightly turned loop (Fig 2c, right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, gp140 appears to be highly tolerant of the HR1 redesign, which can enhance the efficiency of protein production without sacrificing overall structural integrity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 X-ray crystallographic data collection and refinement statistics.Full size table', 'Antigenic

to investigate whether the HR1 redesign would affect Env trimer binding to bNAbs and non-NAbs using bio-layer interferometry (BLI) with immunoglobulin G (IgG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, we studied trimers prepared using a simple GNL purification so that we could compare the basic properties of different trimer constructs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BN-PAGE of SEC fractions obtained from a Superdex 200

bNAbs41,42,43,44, all three trimers showed nearly identical binding profiles, suggesting that HR1 redesign had little effect on the presentation of this conserved site of vulnerability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar pattern was also seen for NAb b12, which engages the CD4bs with a different angle of approach than VRC01 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For bNAbs targeting the V3 stem and surrounding glycans, including N332 (PGT121, PGT128 and PGT135 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39)), and the high-mannose gp120 glycan cluster (2G12 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  46)), all three trimers showed identical binding profiles, indicating that these glycan epitopes remained intact upon HR1 redesign.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we measured trimer binding to two bNAbs that recognize conformational epitopes spanning regions in both gp120 and gp41 (refs 19, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All three trimers bound strongly to PGT151 with a fast on-rate and a flat dissociation curve, while subtle differences were observed in 35O22-binding kinetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Next, we measured trimer binding to a panel of representative non-NAbs (Fig 3d and Supplementary Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All three tested trimers bound to CD4bs-specific b6 and F105.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HR1-redesigned trimers displayed weaker binding to F105 than did the SOSIP trimer, with a slightly faster off-rate detected for HR1 redesign 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no differences in kinetics were observed for b6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For V3-specific 19b and 447-52D, all three trimers showed fast association and slow dissociation, indicative of some V3 exposure in the trimer preparation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously, 19b was found to bind the SOSIP trimer by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), but only to a limited extent by EM and surface plasmon resonance (SPR)11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, SPR analysis of 2G12-purified BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer showed consistent results (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differences in experimental set-ups such as analyte immobilization (see Methods and ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12) may have contributed to the more visible V3 exposure by BLI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the V3 exposure may be minimized by conformational fixation as recently demonstrated for the SOSIP trimer26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then tested F240 and 7B2, which recognize the immunodominant epitopes in cluster I of gp41ECTO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SOSIP trimer appeared to bind both antibodies at a low level with a slight preference for F240.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the two HR1 redesigns showed reduced binding to F240 and almost negligible binding to 7B2, indicating a more closed or less flexible gp41ECTO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also investigated two CD4i antibodies, 17b and A32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All three trimers showed no binding to 17b in the absence of soluble CD4 (sCD4), with HR1 redesign 1 exhibiting only a minimal level of A32 recognition although all trimers bound very weakly to this antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Overall, the two HR1 redesigns displayed broadly similar patterns in their recognition by bNAbs with the exception of altered kinetics for apex-directed quaternary bNAbs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While all three trimers showed some V3 exposure, the two HR1 redesigns appeared to shield non-neutralizing gp41ECTO epitopes more effectively than the SOSIP trimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed binding to non-NAbs may be attributed to the use of IgG instead of Fab that can substantially enhance avidity and the use of a different immobilization strategy in the BLI experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Replacing the furin cleavage site with short linkers', 'Sharma et al.30 reported a native-like, cleavage-independent gp140 trimer designated NFL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In another study, Georgiev et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  replaced the cleavage site between gp120 and gp41 with linkers of up to 20 residues (termed sc-gp140)29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the presence of aberrant structures was speculated for sc-gp140 trimers with short linkers29, the precise effect of cleavage site modification on gp140 folding and structure remained unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We addressed this critical issue in the context of HR1 redesign 1, which had been validated both structurally and antigenically (Figs 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We first examined the outcome of replacing the cleavage site-containing region (residues 500519) with a redesigned connecting loop between gp120 and gp41 (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C distance between R500 and F519 is 16.8 Å, equivalent to a fully extended backbone of 4.4 residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ensemble-based protein design yielded a large pool of 8-residue loops connecting R500 and F519 (Supplementary Fig 7a).

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'An effective HIV-1 vaccine will likely involve immunogens that mimic the native, prefusion trimer47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, development of such trimer immunogens has been hampered by the labile nature of the Env spike and, until recently, the lack of structural details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This obstacle was spectacularly overcome by the BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 trimer11, which facilitated high-resolution analyses of Env structure14,15,16,35 and provided a rational basis for vaccine design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent advances include expansion of the SOSIP design to other HIV-1 strains23,24, incorporation of new stabilizing mutations26 and removal of furin dependency by using cleavage site linkers27,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a premium is placed on trimer purification to remove unwanted Env forms and misfolded trimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trimer purification is currently achieved by complex methods such as bNAb affinity column, negative selection and multi-cycle SEC, which can be adapted for industrial-scale production but will likely require special considerations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is plausible that trimer impurity and production inefficiency are linked to the fundamental causes of Env metastability that have not been completely resolved by previous trimer designs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we investigated the underlying causes of HIV-1 Env metastability with a rational design strategy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first directed our attention to an HR1 region that undergoes drastic conformational change during viral fusion with host cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This region (residues 547569) has not been explicitly explored, with the exception of the I559P mutation in the SOSIP design10 that was originally speculated to destabilize the postfusion state10 and validated by recent structural studies35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We shortened and computationally optimized this region in an attempt to stabilize the prefusion trimer conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significantly, almost all HR1 redesigns showed substantial improvement in trimer yield and purity, suggesting that this disordered HR1 region is a major site of metastability and may indeed be a source of folding inefficiency and sample impurity in the production of soluble Env trimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural analysis and antigenic profiling together established HR1 redesign 1 as a primary candidate to investigate the effect of cleavage site modification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While linker length has been extensively examined for NFL and sc-gp140 trimers29,30, its effect on trimer metastability has not been addressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The major effort in those studies had been to remove unwanted Env species resulting from cleavage site modification rather than to determine their cause.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined various cleavage site linkers in the context of an HR1 redesign.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the uncleaved gp140 form, the tendency for Env misfolding appeared to be inversely correlated with linker length, as revealed by the analysis of CST, CSF and CSL trimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By collapsing the trimer ensemble into two predominant states, the CST and CSF designs captured possible fusion intermediates that are most likely inherent to uncleaved gp140 trimers but were previously inaccessible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future high-resolution studies of such intermediate states could greatly enhance our understanding of the HIV-1 fusion mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The results from a generic HR1 linker have important implications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high trimer yield and purity obtained from this simple GS linker and further improvement by computational design suggested a general strategy for identifying vaccine-suitable strains and designing stable gp140 trimers based on these strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, given the presence of an HR1-like region in most enveloped viruses using the type 1 fusion mechanism48,49,50, the generic HR1 redesign is potentially a universal strategy to stabilize soluble envelope trimers for vaccine development.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Data were collected using a FEI Tecnai Spirit electron microscope operating at 120 kV, with an electron dose of 30 e Å2 and a magnification of × 52,000 that resulted in a pixel size of 2.05 Å at the specimen plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were acquired with a Tietz 4k × 4k TemCam-F416 CMOS camera using a nominal defocus of 1,000 nm and the Leginon package60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Image processing and 3D reconstruction', 'Particles were selected automatically from the raw micrographs (Supplementary Fig 12) using DoG Picker and put into a particle stack using the Appion software package61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial, reference-free, two-dimensional (2D) class averages were calculated using particles binned by two via iterative multivariate statistical analysis/multireference alignment and sorted into classes62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particles corresponding to trimers or to trimers bound to PGV04 were selected into a substack and binned by two before another round of reference-free alignment was carried out using the iterative multivariate statistical analysis/multireference alignment and Xmipp Clustering and 2D alignment programmes63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To analyse the quality of the trimers (closed native-like, partially open native-like and non-native), the reference-free 2D class averages were examined by eye using the metrics previously described23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An ab initio common lines model (Supplementary Fig 13) was calculated from reference-free 2D class averages in EMAN2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  64) imposing symmetry C3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model was then refined against raw particles for an additional 25 cycles using EMAN65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resolutions of the final models were determined using a Fourier Shell Correlation cutoff of 0.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of particles collected and used for the final 3D reconstructions is summarized in Supplementary Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the CSF reconstructions (states 1 and 2), after 2D classification, unbinned particles were refined against a density map of the unliganded trimer (Supplementary Fig 13) filtered to a 60-Å resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3D classification was then performed in RELION version 1.4b resulting in six classes within each data set66,67.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stable classes were selected for further processing followed by various steps of additional 3D classification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stoichiometric classes were selected for further refinement to generate the final maps for states 1 and state 2, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The EM maps were contoured at different threshold values to facilitate a thorough comparison of the obtained 3D reconstructions (Supplementary Fig 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Bio-layer interferometry', 'The kinetics of trimer binding to bNAbs and non-NAbs was measured using an Octet Red96 instrument (fortéBio, Pall Life Sciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All assays were performed with agitation set to 1,000 r.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in fortéBIO 1 × kinetic buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final volume for all the solutions was 200 l per well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assays were performed at 30 °C in solid black 96-well plates (Geiger Bio-One).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A unit of 5 g ml1 of antibody in 1 × kinetic buffer was loaded onto the surface of anti-human Fc Capture Biosensors (AHC) for 300 s. A 60-s biosensor baseline step was applied before the analysis of the association of the antibody on the biosensor to the Env trimer in solution for 200 s. A twofold concentration gradient of trimer starting at 200 nM was used in a titration series of six.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dissociation of the interaction was followed for 300 s. Correction of baseline drift was performed by subtracting the averaged shift recorded for a sensor loaded with antibody but not incubated with trimer, or a sensor without antibody but incubated with trimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Octet data were processed by fortéBios data acquisition software v.8.1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental data were fitted for V1V2 apex-directed bNAbs using a global fit 1:1 model to determine the KD values and other kinetic parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'The authors declare that all data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article and its Supplementary Information files.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coordinates and structure factors for HR1 redesigns 1 and 9 are deposited with the RCSB protein data bank (PDB) under accession codes 5JS9 and 5JSA, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The negative-stain EM reconstructions are deposited in the electron microscopy data bank (EMDB) under accession codes EMD-6590 (CSF state 1), EMD-6591 (CSF state 2), EMD-6592 (CSF state 1 bound to PGV04), EMD-6593 (CSF state 2 bound to PGV04), EMD-6621 (CSF-SOS), EMD-6622 (CSF-SOS bound to PGV04), EMD-6623 (CSL), EMD-6634 (CSL bound to PGV04), EMD-6625 (CSL-SOS), EMD-6626 (CSL-SOS bound to PGV04), EMD-6627 (HR1 redesign 1) and EMD-6628 (HR1 redesign bound to PGV04).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
