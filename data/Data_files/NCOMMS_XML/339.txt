Microelectrode characterization of coral daytime interior pH and carbonate chemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Reliably predicting how coral calcification may respond to ocean acidification and warming depends on our understanding of coral calcification mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the concentration and speciation of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) inside corals remain unclear, as only pH has been measured while a necessary second parameter to constrain carbonate chemistry has been missing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the first carbonate ion concentration (CO32) measurements together with pH inside corals during the light period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe sharp increases in CO32 and pH from the gastric cavity to the calcifying fluid, confirming the existence of a proton (H+) pumping mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show that corals can achieve a high aragonite saturation state (arag) in the calcifying fluid by elevating pH while at the same time keeping DIC low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a mechanism may require less H+-pumping and energy for upregulating pH compared with the high DIC scenario and thus may allow corals to be more resistant to climate change related stressors.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Atmospheric CO2 has increased from 280 parts per million (ppm) during pre-industrial times to 400 ppm today1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase has led to invasion of CO2 into the surface ocean, which has shifted the acidbase equilibrium and modified the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) species composition such that the proton concentration (H+) has increased, and pH and CO32 have decreased; a process commonly known as ocean acidification (OA)2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since OA reduces calcification rates in many, though not all, corals4,5,6,7,8, it is particularly detrimental to the health of coral reefs and their associated ecosystem functions and biogeochemical processes4,7,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decline in coral calcification rates is thought to be linked to reductions in seawater CO32 and thus arag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because calcification occurs in a semi-isolated compartment where conditions are largely controlled by the coral10, the exact mechanism by which OA reduces calcification is difficult to decipher11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand and predict how corals might respond to current and future CO2 increases, climate warming and other stressors, we need a better understanding of coral calcification mechanisms, particularly how a high pH and arag state is achieved inside the calcifying fluid and the sources as well as speciation and concentration of DIC that sustain calcification5,11,12,13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In order to precipitate CaCO3 in a place separated from seawater by multiple layers of tissue, corals ultimately must be able to import Ca2+ ions and DIC from seawater and transport them to the site of calcification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These processes remain poorly understood and controversial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although proposed routes of ion and molecule import differ in their details, potential import processes can be broadly grouped into three categories: (1) passive CO2 diffusion, (2) active bicarbonate and other ion transport and (3) whole seawater import though the time scale of each of these processes will differ10,16,17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Which of these three processes dominates the import pathway for DIC species remains unknown in part because a complete characterization of the internal carbonate chemistry of corals is lacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the import of necessary ions, corals must raise the aragonite saturation state of the calcifying fluid to obtain rapid rates of calcification18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is widely believed that this is achieved through a H+ efflux pump that creates high pH and, via chemical equilibrium and kinetic limitations, high CO32 in the calcifying space5,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The H+ efflux pump is proposed to be coupled to Ca2+ influx via a CaH ATPase10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This theoretical model for coral calcification is considered the foundation for hypotheses explaining the response of calcification to future acidification5, yet direct measurements of at least two of the several carbonate system parameters to fully substantiate this conceptual model for coral calcification are lacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on either indirect geochemical tracer evidence12 or sensor-based pH data combined with the assumption of either active HCO3 transport or whole seawater import13,20, several studies have also suggested that corals concentrate DIC to roughly twice the seawater value at the site of calcification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Others, however, have assumed that coral internal DIC is similar to or lower than that in seawater5,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, while a linkage between H+-pumping and carbon species transportation has recently been suggested12, confirmation by direct measurements is required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, despite decades of research, our knowledge of the internal carbonate chemistry of corals is still limited and direct evidence is needed to definitively constrain coral calcification mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Microelectrodes are a powerful tool for the direct measurement of chemical concentrations within organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reliability and accuracy of pH and other microelectrodes have been well-established in the literature and in our work (see Methods section below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous pH microelectrode studies have shown that pH increases near the coral surface and in the upper region of the polyps gastric cavity due to photosynthesis, but decreases deeper in the cavity (coelenteron)22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, a high pH has been measured in the calcifying fluid using both pH microelectrodes (pH: 9.310.1) and pH sensitive dyes (pH: 8.59.0) (refs 5, 13, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments showed that corals increase the pH of the calcifying fluid to achieve a high arag, which facilitates rapid rates of calcification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to fully characterize internal coral carbonate chemistry, pH alone is not sufficient and another carbonate system parameter such as CO32, DIC, or total alkalinity (TA) must be assumed12,13 or preferably directly measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we use CO32 microelectrodes together with pH microelectrodes to directly measure two necessary system parameters and calculate concentrations of all other carbonate species within corals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our novel findings are that CO32 and carbonate saturation state inside the coral calcifying fluid are high and calcifying fluid DIC concentration is low.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'pH and CO32 depth profiles', 'pH and CO32 microelectrodes were used to characterize the interior of coral polyps (see Methods section below) under ambient seawater pH and in the light (500 mol photons m2 s1), when photosynthesis stimulates high rates of calcification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We advanced a microelectrode inside the polyps gastric cavity at a resolution of 50 m per step (5 m in one case) parallel to the polyp wall until it broke on the solid CaCO3 base (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repeated micro-profile measurements from seawater into the lower part of the coelenteron revealed that the profiles were reproducible (Fig 1b, Supplementary Figs 1a,b and 2) even though polyp contraction sometimes affected the observed depths (Supplementary Fig 2) and introduced noise in the electrode data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Microelectrode profiling and electrode performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Close-up view of the coral T. reniformis showing the tip of a microelectrode as it

(which is a noise-free reading and is marked as ×), the microelectrode tip broke.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pH microelectrodes were calibrated on the NBS scale, which is about 0.10.15 unit greater than that on the total scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars (s.d.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  are defined in the Methods section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positive depths are inside the coral polyp while negative depths are in the overlying seawater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars are smaller than the symbols in the overlying water.Full size image', 'We obtained several full-depth profiles of pH and CO32 through the polyp mouth, the coelenteron, and into the calcifying fluid for three tropical coral species: Orbicella faveolata, Turbinaria reniformis and Acropora millepora.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For O. faveolata, pH (in National Bureau of Standards, NBS, scale) increased from 8.1 and CO32 from 180 mol kg1 in the overlying seawater to 8.38.5 and 300 mol kg1, respectively, in the upper part of the polyp due to photosynthesis (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deeper in the polyps the pH decreased to a value of 7.7, which was consistent with earlier studies13,22,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correspondingly, in the deeper portion of the polyp, CO32 decreased to 100 mol kg1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, within a short distance, pH increased sharply to as high as 9.7, confirming previous work5,13,23, while CO32 increased six fold to 600 mol kg1 before the electrode tip broke.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We interpret this rapid increase in pH and CO32 as evidence that the microelectrodes obtained measurements within the calcifying fluid prior to breaking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Coral internal pH and CO32 profiles through the polyp mouths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) pH and (b) CO32 of Orbicella faveolata corals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) pH and

ranging from 8.8 to 9.3 (Fig 2c) and highest CO32 from 1000 to 1400 mol kg1 (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In A. millepora, the electrode advancement step was reduced to 5 m due to the smaller polyps compared with the other species, resulting in a very fine-scale pH profile, which demonstrated a sharp increase in pH from 8.15 to 8.65 within only a short distance of 1060 m (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, we observed a 15-fold increase in CO32 from 100 mol kg1 in the coelenteron to 1500 mol kg1 in the calcifying fluid within a distance of 50 m in this species (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Composite depth profiles of CO2, DIC, TA and arag', 'Our methods did not allow simultaneous profiling of pH and CO32 at the same spots due to both technical challenges and high heterogeneity inside a coral polyp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we constructed composite profiles of pH and CO32 based on the range of our data across all three species and calculated CO2, DIC, TA and arag profiles (Supplementary Table 1), assuming the DIC system was in chemical equilibrium (see Methods section below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These composite profiles were then used to generate a more complete picture and a conceptual model of coral calcification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Overall, our study shows that DIC decreases slightly near the polyp surface and in the upper part of the coelenteron due to photosynthetic CO2 consumption (Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Farther down in the polyp calculated DIC increases due to respiratory input of CO2 and reaches a peak at the bottom of the coelenteron before rapidly declining again in the calcifying space (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calculated TA in the coelenteron is nearly constant throughout most of the gastric cavity space, but increases dramatically in the calcifying fluid (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, in agreement with direct TA measurements of the coelenteron fluid25 and some model assumptions5,21, DIC and TA values in the coelenteron solution are not substantially different from those of the overlying seawater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Conceptual model of coral calcification and CO2 transport mechanism and distributions of

the coelenteron solution (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase is not only due to an increase in DIC from respiration but is substantially enhanced by the nearly invariable TA (Fig 3b, Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we attribute this CO2 increase to both respiration input and the conversion of CO32 and HCO3 to CO2 by H+ exported from the calcifying fluid (Fig 3a)  a mechanism suggested earlier as being important for Symbiodinium spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  photosynthetic needs19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inside the calcifying fluid CO2 is nearly zero (Fig 3b), primarily due to the fluids very high pH (Fig 2a,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This very large CO2 difference (30 mol kg1, Supplementary Table 1), based on direct measurements for the first time, confirms recent indirect evidence from geochemical tracers12 that a high rate of CO2 molecular diffusion from the coelenteron through the tissue into the calcifying fluid provides an important source of DIC for CaCO3 precipitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'CO2 flux into the calcifying fluid', 'We estimated the CO2 influx to the calcifying fluid by both a 1-D diffusion model and an exchange model between the coelenteron and the calcifying fluid21,26 (equations and parameters are given in the Methods section and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CO2 diffusive flux was estimated to be as high as 217433 nmol cm2 h1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, the CO2 influx was estimated by the exchange model to be 82301 nmol cm2 h1 (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This range of CO2 influx and consumption rate compares favourably with coral calcification rates measured in the past (1501000, nmol cm2 h1) (refs 10, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the observations and model calculations presented here, we postulate that the corals proton pumping ability is essential not only for creating a high aragonite saturation state in the calcifying fluid (favouring calcification), but also for creating a sharp CO2 gradient facilitating DIC influx to support calcification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This CO2 transport mechanism is consistent with dual isotopic evidence18,28 and geochemical proxies12 showing that respired CO2 is an essential source of DIC for calcification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This passive CO2 transport mechanism may reduce the need for the active transport of HCO3 by processes such as transmembrane or vacuolar transport though the ultimate source of DIC for calcification comes from external seawater via photosynthesis, diffusive flux and whole seawater import.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Low DIC in the calcifying fluid', 'Despite the great CO2 flux into the coral calcifying fluid, our analysis reveals that the fluid DIC is not that different from seawater concentrations due to the consumption of DIC during calcification, which balances the CO2 influx (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though TA in the calcifying fluid is elevated (1.21.9 times that of overlying seawater) it is not as high as previously reported values12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Allison et al.12 have recently used geochemical tracers to determine pH (from B isotope ratio) and estimate DIC (from B/Ca ratio) and concluded that in order to achieve a high aragonite saturation state, corals must internally concentrate DIC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Others also assumed that corals concentrate internal DIC to about twice, or more, the concentration of seawater13,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our direct pH and CO32 measurements show that while arag inside the calcifying fluid is elevated, DIC is not elevated with respect to background seawater.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our microelectrode profiles of pH and CO32 through coral polyps provide the first direct evidence for elevated CO32 in the calcifying fluid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CO32 (6001500 mol kg1) and corresponding aragonite mineral saturation states (arag=822) in the calcifying fluid are high and consistent with expectations based on inorganic CaCO3 formation experiments11, previous experiments12 and model frameworks5,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data from the calcifying fluid was only obtained in a small subset of the numerous profiles collected, most likely because the calcifying fluid layer is very thin (likely only a few micrometers) and existed in pockets13,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most cases, the electrode tips broke within one step (50 m) between the bottom of the polyp gastric cavity space (coelenteron) and the hard CaCO3 skeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some cases, however, the data suggest the space between the coelenteron and the skeleton could be thicker than previously thought (up to 100 m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, it is possible that the newly formed CaCO3 minerals are porous allowing the glass microelectrode tip to slightly penetrate the mineral surface, thus giving an inaccurate measure of the calcifying fluid thickness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It would be desirable to collect profiles with a better constraint of vertical and lateral heterogeneity of carbonate properties inside corals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless a high pH, high CO32 layer was unequivocally detected right above the CaCO3 skeleton, though further work is needed to better define its thickness and assess its spatial variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the pH upregulation in the calcifying fluid measured by microelectrodes does overlap with those by the dye-based method13 and boron isotope method12, the highest values have been obtained from microelectrodes (9.7 here, 9.3 and 10.1 by two others, see Table 1)5,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences between the approaches may result from differences in coral species, colony size30, measurement condition and location within the colony13,14, and time-scales over which the approaches integrate30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Comparison of pH values measured in coral calcifying fluid by microelectrodes and other methods.Full size table', 'If the very high pH of 9.0 or higher measured by microelectrodes reported here or elsewhere is typical of coral calcifying fluid, a high DIC internal solution (2 × of seawater DIC or higher) would indicate that internal arag could be as high as 30 to 55 (Fig 4a), which is inconsistent with arag values inferred from abiotic experiments18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it seems that the most reasonable internal DIC is about 1 × of seawater value, which is consistent with our results from the two direct carbonate parameter measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While further research is required to confirm our conclusion, our findings strongly shift the argument towards one of a lower calcifying fluid DIC concentration5,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Aragonite mineral saturation state (arag) and buffer index in the coral calcifying fluid as functions of pH and DIC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) arag and (b) buffer index.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The buffer index is given as mmol kg1 of H+ pumping (H+ loss or TA gain) per unit of pH upregulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This index is calculated numerically with CO2SYS (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  37) (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here DIC=1800 mol kg1 is roughly the same as seawater value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pH is on the NBS scale.Full size image', 'One important difference between low versus high DIC scenarios is the necessary amount of protons that a coral must pump out (which results in an increase in TA) to raise its internal pH by one unit (in mmol-H+ per kg per pH unit).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This buffer index for the high DIC scenario is at least twice that for the low DIC scenario, thus more protons must be removed in a high DIC scenario to achieve the observed calcifying fluid pH (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we conclude that the low DIC scenario would require less energy than the high DIC scenario as proton-pumping requires ATP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparisons of a relative change in energy requirement to upregulate internal pH between high external CO2 under future OA conditions and 400 ppm current conditions following the method of Ries5 also supported our conclusion (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Table 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, if proton removal from the coelenteron is increasingly difficult as a result of higher seawater H+ concentrations under OA conditions31, the low DIC scenario should be advantageous as less H+-pumping will be required to further raise pH in the calcifying fluid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Overall, this suggests that corals that use passive CO2 diffusion as an important pathway for DIC supply, and maintain low DIC in their calcifying fluid, may require less energy to calcify at high rates, which could potentially make them more resistant to OA and other stressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at the same time, the lower buffering capacity of low DIC and moderate TA calcifying fluid means that the ability to maintain high fluid pH will be vulnerable to changes in the physiological and biochemical conditions that control H+-pumping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, a weakening of proton pumping during dark periods may lead a coral with low internal DIC towards decalcification more readily than otherwise expected in a high DIC scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a high internal DIC could allow corals to reach a high carbonate saturation state at lower internal pH (Fig 4a)13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, additional studies using microelectrodes and other techniques in corals under OA conditions in combination with other stressors and environmental conditions (i.e., elevated temperature, nutrient levels and daytime versus nighttime) are a critical next step in elucidating coral calcification mechanisms under future ocean conditions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Coral collection and preparation', 'The measurements focused on three species of corals: O. faveolata, T. reniformis and A. millepora.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All species contain photosynthetic

nearly 0 (that is an uncertainty of CO2 between 0.5 and 0.1 mol kg1 only changes CO2 gradient from 29.9 to 30.3 mol kg1) (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, a conservative internal pH value of 9.1 and a high value of 9.5 lead to similar estimates of CO2 gradient and flux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Flux can also be calculated as the exchange rate between two adjacent boxes, the coelenteron and the calcifying fluid:', '', 'where, kco2 is the exchange coefficient (0.762.8 cm s1) across biological tissues determined by an isotopic exchange method41, which has been used in two recent coral CO2 flux model simulations21,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In principle, the two coefficients are linked by:', '', 'A lower CO2 flux calculated based on equation 3 than equation 2 may indicate that the CO2 diffusion coefficient across the coral tissue (or the coral tissues permeability) is lower than that of the seawater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Amount of H+-pumping per unit pH upregulation', 'We define this parameter based on the buffer factor concept, discussed in details by Frankignoulle42, Hofmann et al.43 and Egleston et al.44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We take the buffer factor  defined below as a measure of how strong the calcifying fluid can buffer its pH:', '', 'We rearranged the definition to TA/pH=2.3, which represents the amount of proton pumping (or TA gain) a coral must do to upregulate its calcifying fluid pH by one unit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was calculated numerically by following the same approach as the Revelle Factor calculation in the CO2SYS program37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first set four DIC values and for each DIC value we allowed a range of pH changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we derived TA values for the various DIC and pH combinations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, a ±1 mol kg1 disturbance is applied to TA values and the corresponding perturbation in pH is derived using the TA and DIC pairs as the input parameters in CO2SYS (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Energy consumption for pH upregulation', 'We calculated the relative energy changes of pH upregulation between different OA conditions as specified by Ries5 using the Nernst equation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The
