Prediction and validation of protein intermediate states from structurally rich ensembles and coarse-grained simulations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Protein conformational changes are at the heart of cell functions, from signalling to ion transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the transient nature of the intermediates along transition pathways hampers their experimental detection, making the underlying mechanisms elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we retrieve dynamic information on the actual transition routes from principal component analysis (PCA) of structurally-rich ensembles and, in combination with coarse-grained simulations, explore the conformational landscapes of five well-studied proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modelling them as elastic networks in a hybrid elastic-network Brownian dynamics simulation (eBDIMS), we generate trajectories connecting stable end-states that spontaneously sample the crystallographic motions, predicting the structures of known intermediates along the paths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show that the explored non-linear routes can delimit the lowest energy passages between end-states sampled by atomistic molecular dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The integrative methodology presented here provides a powerful framework to extract and expand dynamic pathway information from the Protein Data Bank, as well as to validate sampling methods in general.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Proteins function as sensors that cycle between different states in response to external stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, stable conformers captured experimentally represent the end states of the functional cycle, while short-lived or highly flexible intermediates along the transitionwhich often hold the key to understand molecular mechanismsare difficult to trap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a host of theoretical strategies have been developed to sample transition pathways, the intrinsic difficulty to predict the routes for conformational change and the lack of experimentally resolved intermediates hamper the validation of path-sampling methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Hitherto, in silico pathways are typically evaluated on the basis of stereochemical quality of the structures or by tracking progression along system-defined coordinates1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the selection of heuristic collective variables (CVs) is non-trivial and dimensionality reduction can be problematic3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural quality or progression along a few order parameters does not assure that a pathway samples biologically relevant routes to connect end-states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An interesting approach, proposed by Weiss and Levitt4, is to benchmark path-sampling methods against proteins with at least three distinct states solved, and measure how close the sampled pathway spontaneously approaches known intermediates in terms of root mean square deviation (rMSD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Still, such procedure cannot assess the feasibility of the movements or to what extent they correspond to the biological motions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this issue we propose to take a step beyond simple two- or three-state benchmarking by making an ensemble-level analysis that considers all structural information available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) for a given protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there have been works systematizing protein motions in databases5, a general and reliable framework to unlock and expand the pathway information contained in structural ensembles is still missing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Principal component analysis (PCA)6 is a powerful technique to decode ensemble motions and has been successfully applied to extract principal components (PCs) from experimental ensembles and to evaluate normal modes (NMs)7,8,9,10, as well as essential motions obtained from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, McCammon and co-workers12,13,14 showed the utility of PCs obtained from X-ray structural ensembles as CVs to track MD; a recent work used PCs to estimate free-energies of transitions15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we build on the idea to use the two dominant PCs as complex multidimensional reaction coordinates to reveal the direction of ensemble-encoded conformational changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The key to our analysis is a selection criterion different from previous ensemble-based studies16, more focused on the quantity rather than the quality of the sampling by experimental structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We argue that, only when the solved structures (regardless of their number) sample at least three different interconnected conformations, the PCs provide optimal CVs to highlight transition paths in the conformational landscape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By focusing on five structurally rich and diverse model systems we demonstrate that X-ray ensemble PCA accurately clusters resolved structures into different functional states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that for these proteins, the representation of the conformational space is robust even with minimal numbers of structures as long as they are well distributed along interconnecting paths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The projection of experimental conformers onto the PC-space provides an excellent visual representation of the structural landscape for a protein with known intermediates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, it also allows for immediate evaluation of the sampled pathways as it gives information on the natural sequence of on-pathway intermediates, which in turn can reveal information on their functional significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On the basis of the proposed ensemble PCA, we compare the performance of a novel coarse-grained (CG) path sampling algorithm named eBDIMS, using elastic network model (ENM) driven10 Brownian17 simulations, with several well-established methods as well as with state-of-the-art MD simulations (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Path sampling algorithms span from simple morphings18 based on interpolations in Cartesian19 or internal coordinates20, to geometrical targeting21 or atomistic techniques based on energy minimization4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of MD-based approaches are applied to explore transitions, for example the nudged elastic band22 or the strings method23,24, as well as enhanced sampling algorithms such as conformational flooding25, metadynamics26, accelerated MD27 or the accelerated weight histogram (AWH) method28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although accurate, these techniques are computationally expensive and limited to small systems and short timescale transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CG-models29,30, where each residue is reduced to a few beads interacting by simple potentials, minimize computational costs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among CG-methods, ENMs31,32 are conceptually simple but capable of predicting accurately conformational changes33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite reducing protein architecture to a minimalist network of C-carbons connected by springs, NMs computed from the ENM potential describe transitions between X-ray pairs with surprising precision5,34,35,36 and reproduce the flexibility from experimental ensembles or long MD simulations8,9,10,37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For years, ENMs have been at the core of transition methods from simple interpolations39, to two-state ENMs2,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Being limited to an equilibrium basin, pathway generation requires iterative computation and deformation along selected NMs, which can produce stereochemical distortions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these issues can be reduced applying internal coordinates20, structure corrections41, or just using the modes to bias more realistic simulations42,43, mode selection still poses a problem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here the use of the network potential in the context of a BD simulation avoids unrealistic structure deformations and provides spontaneous sampling along the relevant modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that, compared with other approaches, eBDIMS smoothly samples the experimentally encoded motions, and can predict the sequence of intermediates as accurately as Climber, an atomistic method4 based on the Energy Calculation and Dynamics (ENCAD) molecular-mechanics force-field, but with the versatility of a simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The integrated analysis of the PCs and the in silico pathways provides novel insights into the conformational changes of the studied proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further demonstrate that simple algorithms such as eBDIMS or Climber accurately sample the conformational space given by experimental data and MD, predicting the lowest energy paths defined by transition intermediates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, the methodology outlined here provides a powerful framework to extract and expand dynamic information from the rapidly growing PDB to evaluate sampling methods or even the functional status of new experimental structures.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Pathway validation by PCA of structurally-rich ensembles', 'We studied five proteins of different size, stoichiometry and motions (Supplementary Table 1) that specifically have well-defined intermediates between end-states (either described in the literature or in the PC1-2 space; see Methods), to perform robust ensemble PCA (Fig 1, Supplementary Fig 1, Supplementary Table 2) for eBDIMS pathway validation (see further examples in Supplementary Fig 2 and Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trajectories were compared with linear (NOMAD-Ref44, MinActPath45 and iENM46) and non-linear path-sampling algorithms (iMods20, NMSIMs47 and Climber4) (Supplementary Tables 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also created ensembles along the lowest frequency NMs10 to study intrinsic motions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apo-like, resting or inactive form was the reference for PCA; all analyses focused on the two major PCs, covering 70% of the variance (Supplementary Table 2) and 95% of the transitions (Supplementary Table 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For non-linear methods, trajectories were computed in forward/reverse directions, and eBDIMS pathway asymmetry quantified (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, eBDIMS trajectories were compared with the free energy landscapes (FELs) sampled by MD for three representative examples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interactive PC1-2 plots are provided in Supplementary Data 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternative version can be found at http://data.tcblab.org/doi/10.1038/ncomms12575/Transitions.html.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Reconstruction of the structural landscape by PCA from structurally rich ensembles and generation of transition pathways by eBDIMS.The workflow is shown for a typical example (RBP, details in Fig 2): structures are collected from the PDB (left panel) and the end-states are selected based on the literature; the ensemble is aligned to the inactive or apo state of the protein for PCA, and forward and reverse trajectories are independently computed with the eBDIMS sampling method (middle panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the two principal PCs are used for projection analysis of the trajectories (right panel), allowing for straightforward detection of on-pathway intermediate states.Full size image', 'Escherichia coli ribose-binding protein (RBP)', 'RBP is a periplasmic protein that binds ribose with a 6Å hinge motion of two similar domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although its crystallographic ensemble only contains eleven structures, they cover the entire closing process;

however, this mode is not the best aligned with the difference transition vector between the end points (Supplementary Fig 4a and Supplementary Table 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trajectory projection onto the PC1-2 subspace shows that the examined methods differ notably in how they sample the X-ray motions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although they all approach the existent intermediates (Fig 2c, right), reaching as close as 0.51.5 Å rMSD (Fig 2d and Supplementary Table 5), the PC1-2 Euclidean distances discriminate between paths that resemble a straight interpolation and the ones that explore the subtle PC2 oscillations that accompany protein closure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, eBDIMS and Climber converge in the reverse pathway through a straight-like route with a slightly smaller rotational deviation along PC2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the asymmetry score is low (0.1;

the dsRBDs need to rotate dramatically (180o) to position RNA on it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this region is negatively charged, requiring Mg2+-coordination to mitigate dsRNA repulsion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In absence of Mg2+, dsRNA binds outside the valley in a non-catalytic form (1YYO, 2NUE), but with Mg2+ present, it moves inside the valley leading to a catalytic form (2NUG, 2NUF, 2EZ6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since a true apo structure is missing, the 11 RNA-bound crystallized structures represent intermediate snapshots in dsRNA processing between non-catalytic/catalytic states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we focused on the transition between the non-catalytic complex RNaseIIIRNA4 (1YYO), and the pre-catalytic RNaseIIIRNA3 (1YYW), where dsRNA is reorienting (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between these two conformers (18 Å rMSD), there is a well-characterized intermediate, RNaseIII E110QRNA2 (1YZ9; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here the complexity of the movements decomposes the ensemble into two similarly weighted components (Fig 4b and Supplementary Table 2): PC1 describes dsRBD-arms opening or breathing49 (51% variance), while PC2 tracks their concerted rotation (43% variance) (Supplementary Fig 3c) capturing most of the transition (see Supplementary Table 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether they separate the structures into four functional groups: the 1YYO cluster, the intermediate 1YZ9, the pre-catalytic 1YYW cluster and catalytic 2EZ6 cluster (Fig 4c, left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along PC1 the structures separate into only three groups according to dsRBD-opening, because the closed non-catalytic and catalytic complexes are not differentiated; PC2 clearly distinguishes their opposite orientations (with the RNA-binding surface looking outwards/inwards to the catalytic valley).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four of the methods (Fig 4c, right) cannot track this challenging transition, which both eBDIMS and Climber sample smoothly visiting the 1YZ9 intermediate within 4 Å rMSD (Fig 4d, Supplementary Table 5 and Fig 6a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As above, the lowest NMs point to the nearest intermediate rather than to the transition direction (Supplementary Fig 4b and Supplementary Table 7); at the 1YYW bifurcation, they split into two directions pointing back to 1YYO or to the Mg2+-bound region (not shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the asymmetry score is high (0.4; Supplementary Fig 5) but the trajectories approach on-pathway X-ray structures in both directions: the forward path crosses the 1YZ9 point as expected, and the reverse deviates along PC2 approaching the region populated by Mg2+-bound structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the transition from the pre-catalytic (1YYW) towards the catalytic state (2EZ6) is the next natural step along the RNaseIII cycle with Mg2+ present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests a multi-step mechanism (Fig 6a,b) agreeing with experimental models49 in which, as RNA binds (1YYO), the dsRBDs first separate along PC1 (crossing 1YZ9) and once they are wide-open, start to rotate along PC2 to reach 1YYW (90o rotation, forward).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, as the bias (that is, Mg2+ in vivo) favours closing again (reverse), the dsRBDs naturally approach the catalytically competent region (180o) up to a point where they start to rotate back to resting position (1YYO).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the eBDIMS trajectory suggests that the topologically accessible route to relax and close the protein naturally approaches the catalytically competent form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our eBDIMS simulation does not mimic the presence of Mg2+, but the fact that it spontaneously approaches the region populated by such conformations implies that the transition to a catalytic complex is pre-conditioned by the peculiar domain arrangement independent from electrostatic effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MD spontaneous sampling from the unbound structures seems to supports this, hinting at two possible different pathways (Supplementary Fig 6c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Conformational transition of A. aeolicus RNA endonuclease III (RNaseIII).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Crystallographic dimers for closed non-catalytic state (1yyo) and open pre-catalytic state (1yyw), showing the dsRNA-binding domains (RBDs) in green and the rest of the protein in red surface;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The aim of this work was to explore the possible reconstruction of protein transition pathways by prediction of intermediates from pairs of static structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For that purpose, we developed a new sampling method, eBDIMS, and in parallel, a thorough PCA-based validation scheme to assess its biological relevance as well as to retrieve pathway information from structural ensembles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although PCA has been used to extract motions sampled by MD11, or to evaluate NMs from experimental ensembles8, here it is applied to ensembles with enough sampled states to reconstruct the conformational landscape along meaningful CVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have shown that PCA of such ensembles automatically yields reaction coordinates that contain the one-dimensional system-defined parameters typically described for each protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the variance distribution informs on the dimensionality of the transitions: whether they are reducible to one (RBP or 5NTase) or a few coordinates (RNaseIII) or rather need several (GLIC) to be fully described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complexity of the PCs emphasizes the risk of biasing trajectories using simple variables, and also suggests that a deeper study of ensemble-PCs can help to understand how complex motions are coupled in transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, structure clustering by PCs can distinguish not only functional states, but also specific experimental conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the GLIC ensemble, PCA clustering detected a previously unnoticed partition of the solved structures into two groups dependent on the two crystallization temperatures used for solving them (277 and 293K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that the only outliers in both groups are either bound to molecules or harbour mutations to perturb channel activity suggests a possible link between intrinsic mobility of the extracellular piece and the channel status which is reflected in its compactness in the crystal lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the PCA method by itself can help to assign a functional status to new structures, understand how they relate to each other or even raise experimentally testable hypotheses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'More important, PC-clustering automatically provides the most probable sequence of structures along a transition avoiding uncertainties introduced when dealing with several heuristic variables in complex transitions such as GLIC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By extracting the common pattern of motion not for a pair but for all representative conformations for a protein, the PCs uncover the ensemble-encoded routes for conformational changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the PC1-2 bidimensional space as reference for benchmarking, it is also straightforward to evaluate how well sampling algorithms explore the conformational space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The projections onto the major PCs clearly distinguish feasible trajectories, characterized by a smooth and stable sampling of the experimental motions that spontaneously approaches intermediate states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of this stringent evaluation, we demonstrate that it is possible to reconstruct the structural landscape and predict possible intermediate structures using path-sampling algorithms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the CG eBDIMS trajectories greatly overlapped with the atomistic method Climber, based on pulling and energy minimization of the force-field ENCAD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of a pure ENM topology-based simulation such as eBDIMS to predict intermediate states is a strong demonstration of the emerging paradigm that the large-scale functional dynamics of proteins is greatly encoded in their overall shape32 and does not depend on fine-grained sequence details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While in some proteins (for example, RNaseIII) apparently there is one topologically accessible sequence of motions that allows for a transition, in others (for example, GLIC) several concerted motions proceed simultaneously until completion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that the ability to spontaneously sample a transition is pre-encoded in the structures, not only for ligand-free forms63 but throughout the conformational change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that the NMs were well aligned with either the distribution of structures around each basin, and/or with the actual direction of changes defined by the nearest intermediates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been common practice to evaluate the significance of NMs by their overlap with the difference vector between conformations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it is a fair approximation for most proteins, it can fail when the experimental path follows an intermediate that departs enough from both end points (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, it becomes clear why following the modes better overlapped with the transition vector can render distorted pathways as such motions are often not sampled experimentally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, most ENM-based algorithms perform extremely well providing fast approximations to the experimental paths in simple cases (see Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interestingly, both Climber and eBDIMS show nearly identical divergence in the forward/reverse pathways; however, considering PCs variance, this asymmetry is small and only for some examples hints to distinct sequences of motions as a protein progresses along its functional cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter is notable in the hysteresis-like cycle between RNaseIII RNA-bound structures (Fig 4c), with nearby intermediates in both directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this extremely complex transition, eBDIMS and Climber suggests asynchronous motions (RBDs opening/rotation in the forward route, followed by closing/rotation in the reverse).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here pathway divergence, already evident from the PC1-2 distribution of experimental conformers, contains information about the sequence of movements in a multi-step complex landscape; unbiased MD from unbound forms (Supplementary Fig 6c) also hints to differences in the preferred forward/reverse paths as suggested for some proteins1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when asymmetry is low, comparison with the FELs from MD rather suggests the equivalence of forward/reverse routes: in the three cases examined, they appear to delimit not different linear paths, but rather an area in the conformational landscape that overlaps with the lowest energy passage connecting the end-state basins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the crystallographically trapped intermediates in all cases tend to distribute along the edges of these regions, pointing that they correspond to meta-stable states but not to energy minima in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apparently, transitions from open (enthalpy-driven) and closed (entropy-driven) forms provide two alternative but energetically feasible solutions for a path, indicating the usefulness of non-linear methods to explore lowest energy channels in the protein landscape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'With the rise of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM)64 and time-resolved X-ray techniques65 capable of trapping structures in several conformations at once, the proteins solved in three states or more will no longer be anecdotic but rather standard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the methodology here outlined offers a powerful approach to rationally categorize as well as extract dynamic information from experimental ensembles, expand them by computation of feasible intermediate states and suggest the lowest-energy passages connecting them, thus paving the way for an intelligent exploration of the conformational space.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Model ensembles and intermediate definition', 'We selected proteins that undergo large conformational changes (Supplementary Table 1), and for which ensembles containing at least three clearly distinct conformations are available, allowing the computation of robust PCs to neatly cluster onto functional states; all these examples but GLIC were previously studied by Weiss and Levitt4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consider those ensembles as structurally rich in terms of sampling, regardless of the number of structures present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This selection criterion is different from all previous studies, focused on the quantity of structures available for a protein rather than the actual sampling covered by them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In practice, it means that each ensemble: (i) has at least three different well-defined functional clusters in the PC1-2 subspace and (ii) the first PCs have a significant weight describing distinctive large-scale motions that cover 70% of the structural variance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate here that such ensembles provide extremely robust PCA, being possible to reproduce 70% of the complete ensemble motions and variance distribution with just three structures sampling the transition path that is, one for each end-state and one intermediate (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig 1); robustness is higher as larger is the scale of the conformational change and the variance accumulated in the first PCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In order to retain the maximal structural information and perform full-length PCA, we selected near complete structures sharing 95% sequence identity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structures with less than five missing residues and not targeting hinge regions were repaired and this residue limit was extended only when reconstruction did not perturb the PCA results (that is, modelled structures fell into already populated clusters); this condition excluded myosin from the original Weiss benchmark.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The systems selected range from a middle sized protein such as RBP (271 residues) to the large GLIC pentameric assembly (1540 residues), and their conformational changes involve very different types of rearrangements, from subtle cooperative motions in GLIC (rMSD=2.6 Å) to large-scale complex rigid-body rotations and translations for RNaseIII (rMSD=18 Å) or hinge domain bending and twisting in RBP (rMSD=6 Å).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For each protein, the starting structure (state 1), used as reference for ensemble alignment, was defined as that in the inactive, resting or not-stimulated state (that is, not bound to ligand, substrate, signal and so on) as opposed to a target or active conformation (state 2; Supplementary Table 1) in order to facilitate the interpretation of projections as deformations with respect to a real structure instead of a geometric average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once the ensembles and the end-structures were defined, we computed
