Subducting seamounts control interplate coupling and seismic rupture in the 2014 Iquique earthquake area  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'To date, the parameters that determine the rupture area of great subduction zone earthquakes remain contentious.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On 1 April 2014, the Mw 8.1 Iquique earthquake ruptured a portion of the well-recognized northern Chile seismic gap but left large highly coupled areas un-ruptured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Marine seismic reflection and swath bathymetric data indicate that structural variations in the subducting Nazca Plate control regional-scale plate-coupling variations, and the limited extent of the 2014 earthquake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several under-thrusting seamounts correlate to the southward and up-dip arrest of seismic rupture during the 2014 Iquique earthquake, thus supporting a causal link.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By fracturing of the overriding plate, the subducting seamounts are likely further responsible for reduced plate-coupling in the shallow subduction zone and in a lowly coupled region around 20.5°S.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data support that structural variations in the lower plate influence coupling and seismic rupture offshore Northern Chile, whereas the structure of the upper plate plays a minor role.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The Chilean subduction zone can be divided into different seismo-tectonic segments that are known to have repeatedly ruptured over the last centuries during great and giant megathrust earthquakes every 100150 years1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern of recurring earthquakes defines the northern Chile seismic gap (18°S24°S; Fig 1a) with a last great event about 137 years ago (Mw 8.6 Iquique earthquake in 1877)1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The anticipation of an impending great earthquake has motivated numerous international field campaigns onshore, making the area one of the best-studied seismic gaps worldwide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along its 550 km, the seismic gap is characterized by a heterogeneous plate-coupling distribution (Fig 1b)2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  South of 21°S a highly coupled patch is presented with moderate to high coupling ( greater than 0.5) extending into the shallow-most part of the subduction zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in the central part of the seismic gap (1920.5°S) high coupling is only met in a small patch ( greater than 60 km landward from the deformation front) and decreases to values  less_than 0.5 towards the trench.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two patches are separated by a lowly coupled region around 20.5°S.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  North of 19°S coupling is less well constrained due to the large distance of the coastline2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to most subduction zones, the vast majority of stress accumulation across the North Chilean plate boundary occurs offshore, where plate coupling is highest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding deformation patterns offshore is thus important for studying seismogenesis at the margin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Map of northern Chile and southern Peru.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Seafloor bathymetry offshore northern Chile and southern Peru (data from GEBCO_08 Grid; version 20091120) including the slip areas of the 1995 Antofagasta, 2001 Peru and 2007 Tocopilla earthquakes22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The black arrow indicates the average annual movement of the Nazca Plate with respect to South America25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Compilation of swath bathymetry (seaward of the deformation front) and plate-coupling2 (landward of the deformation front) for the northern Chile seismic gap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slip contours of the 1 April 2014 Mw 8.1 Iquique earthquake and the 3 April 2014 Mw 7.6 aftershock from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 The oceanic plate off the highly coupled southern segment of the seismic gap is characterized by large NS trending horst and grabens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seaward of the moderately coupled central part that ruptured during the 2014 Iquique earthquake individual seamounts of the Iquique Ridge alter the morphologic signature of the oceanic plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Around 19°S the structure of the oceanic plate changes again, from a complex three-dimensional setting (seamounts, horst and grabens, spreading fabric) in the south to a more simple setting (spreading fabric only) farther north.Full size image', 'In January 2014, a series of earthquake swarms were followed by the 1 April 2014 Mw.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8.1 Iquique earthquake that, together with a Mw.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7.6 aftershock 2 days later, ruptured the moderately coupled central part of the seismic gap2,5,6,7,8,9 (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different slip models have been published for the earthquake deviating in the absolute amplitude of peak slip (between 4 and 7 m)2,5,6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, all slip models comply that earthquake rupture extended only over a 150-km-long stretch (between 19 and 20.5°S) and did not migrate farther along-strike into the highly coupled southern part of the seismic gap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slip models also agree on the fact that peak slip occurred down-dip of the hypocentre and that earthquake rupture diminished towards the shallow-most up-dip part of the subduction zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we present an unpublished compilation map of swath bathymetry of the seafloor and marine multichannel seismic reflection images of the overriding plate and plate-boundary fault zone of the northern Chile seismic gap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new data show multiple large seamounts on the oceanic plate seaward of the deformation and along the plate interface under the marine forearc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those subducting seamounts likely exert a primary control on regional-scale plate-coupling variations and on the limited up-dip and southward extent of seismic rupture during the 2014 Iquique earthquake.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Oceanic plate structure seaward of the deformation front', 'The moderately coupled central part of the seismic gap2,3,4 that ruptured during the 2014 Iquique earthquake matches the width of the Iquique Ridge interpreted to be subducted under the marine forearc (Fig 1)4,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ridge, however, does not form a spatially continuous prominent swell in the seafloor of the incoming plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the oceanic plate close to the subduction zone is characterized by a subdued topography, slightly shallower (yellowish colours) than the surrounding seafloor (green colours), that is overprinted by multiple ( greater than 10) conical seamounts in the limited area with swath bathymetric coverage (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Deformation of the plate boundary and overriding plate', 'However, we find that seamounts are not only located seaward of the deformation front, but also on the downgoing plate under the marine forearc (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About 20 km landward of the deformation front, at the southern end of the area that ruptured during the 2014 Iquique earthquake, a large seamount (1.8 s two-way-traveltime (TWT) high and 20 km wide) is subducting under the marine forearc (Fig 2c;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The multiple seismically imaged subducting seamounts (Fig 2) indicate that the moderately coupled central part of the northern Chile seismic gap, which ruptured during the 2014 Iquique earthquake, and the lowly coupled area around 20.5°S have a distinct tectonic evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the physical state of the plate-boundary fault zone is widely affected by the presence of excess relief on the subducting plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subducted seamounts and, more generally, variations in subducting seafloor roughness are believed to influence the characteristics of plate-coupling and seismic rupture at different plate boundaries14,15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wang and Bilek17 argue that a subducting seamount causes pervasive fracturing around the initial plate boundary, therewith creating favourable conditions for aseismic creep and small earthquakes and unfavourable conditions for large earthquake rupture to propagate across that area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The seismic reflection lines image the plate-boundary fault zone as a group of reflections, possibly formed by several sub-parallel surfaces containing fluids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this we cannot identify the main decollement, which may be only a few centimetres thick.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, extensive localized deformation in the upper plate above and around the subducting seamounts, as imaged by the seismic data, supports the interpretation that in the area of the 2014 Iquique earthquake the entire overriding plate, including the plate-boundary fault zone, is widely fractured and faulted by the deformation caused by the subducting seamounts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The deformation associated with 24-km-tall under-thrusting seamounts (Fig 2), of the extension of the Iquique Ridge now located under the marine forearc, may cause the conditions that prevent the long-term accumulation of elastic energy in the shallow-most up-dip part of the subduction zone as well as in the lowly coupled region around 20.5°S (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the seamounts imaged at the southern end of the rupture area of the 2014 Iquique earthquake that extend to the depth of peak slip (around 20.5°S; SO104-27, Fig 2c) possibly physically prevented seismic rupture during the 2014 Iquique earthquake from migrating southwards, into the highly coupled southern area of the northern Chile seismic gap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar seamounts imaged at the shallow plate interface (Fig 2a,b) might have further prevented seismic rupture from propagating into the shallow-most up-dip part of the subduction zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'South of 21°S the oceanic plate facing the highly coupled southern segment of the northern Chile seismic gap lacks large seamounts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, oceanic plate morphology at the trench is controlled by prominent (0.51.5 km vertical displacement) horst and grabens that result from bend-faulting of the incoming plate (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar subducting plate morphology is observed offshore large areas of northern Japan, where seismic rupture during the giant 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku-Oki earthquake extended up-dip to the trench triggering the large tsunami18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, north of 19°S where plate-coupling is not well constrained, neither large seamounts nor bending-related horst and grabens are observed seaward of the deformation front (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, comparatively smaller bending-related half grabens are formed along the trench by reactivation of NWSE trending spreading fabric formed at the palaeo-spreading centre20,21 (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our data support that the change to a complex three-dimensional plate interface, which is affected by the subduction of large seamounts in the moderately coupled central part (1920.5°S) of the northern Chile seismic gap, possibly exerts a first-order control on plate-coupling and seismic rupture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the 2014 Iquique earthquake, the subducted seamounts may have physically limited along-slope and up-dip migration of seismic rupture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the deformation associated with the under-thrusting seamounts possibly creates favourable conditions for aseismic creep through extensive fracturing around the initial plate-boundary fault zone, therewith favouring the overall reduced coupling rates in the shallow-most up-dip part of the subduction zone as well as in the lowly coupled region around 20.5°S.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our results support a segmentation of the seismic gap, a more cumulative earthquake record is necessary to understand how smaller events such as the 2014 Mw.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8.1 Iquique earthquake interact with bigger events that historically have ruptured the entire segment.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
