Stacked antiaromatic porphyrins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Aromaticity is a key concept in organic chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though this concept has already been theoretically extrapolated to three dimensions, it usually still remains restricted to planar molecules in organic chemistry textbooks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stacking of antiaromatic -systems has been proposed to induce three-dimensional aromaticity as a result of strong frontier orbital interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, experimental evidence to support this prediction still remains elusive so far.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that close stacking of antiaromatic porphyrins diminishes their inherent antiaromaticity in the solid state as well as in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antiaromatic stacking furthermore allows a delocalization of the -electrons, which enhances the two-photon absorption cross-section values of the antiaromatic porphyrins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This feature enables the dynamic switching of the non-linear optical properties by controlling the arrangement of antiaromatic -systems on the basis of intermolecular orbital interactions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The parallel orientation of two or more planar -conjugated molecules is usually referred to as -stacking1,2,3,4, which often controls the structures of supramolecules and liquid crystalline materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also important in biological systems, where it controls in many cases the structure and functionality of DNA and proteins (tertiary structure)5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stacked aromatic -systems are also key components in optoelectronic organic devices, as the close contact of -systems with a large orbital overlap offers an effective conduction pathway for charge carriers, which affords high-performance conducting materials6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the solid state, large planar -conjugated molecules often adopt  stacked structures with interplanar distances that typically range from 3.4 to 3.6 Å, that is, the sum of van der Waals radii for sp2-hybridized carbon atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a complete overlap of two -systems (face-centred stacking) would be difficult on account of the resulting severe electrostatic repulsion between the -electrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, a slipped stacked structure (offset stacking) is more commonly observed, where dispersion forces between -electrons and peripheral protons dominate the attractive interaction between two -systems7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the orbital interactions between the -systems are substantially reduced in the offset stacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To achieve more effective intermolecular electronic communication via a closer stacking of -conjugated molecules, a new approach is required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The stacking of antiaromatic compounds represents one promising strategy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Corminboeuf et al.8 have proposed that stacking of two antiaromatic systems in methano-bridged superphanes such as cyclobutadiene dimer 1 (Fig 1) can eliminate their antiaromaticity due to the resulting three-dimensional aromaticity, which results from mutual interactions between frontier orbitals of each -system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This intriguing proposal was further supported by a theoretical study of Bean and Fowler9 on the ring current effect in antiaromatic cyclophanes with a very short interplanar distance between the two -systems (2.2 Å).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In such systems, intermolecular electronic delocalization should be significantly increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, experimental support to substantiate this prediction still remains elusive on account of the synthetic difficulties associated with constructing superphanes from unstable antiaromatic compounds10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Structures of antiaromatic superphane 1 and norcorroles.The bold lines in 3a and 3b indicate one of their 16 -electronic circuits.Full size image', 'We have recently developed an efficient synthesis of stable antiaromatic porphyrins such as dimesitylnorcorrole Ni(II) (3a), which can be obtained on a gram scale11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Norcorrole is a ring-contracted porphyrin that contains two meso-carbons fewer than a regular porphyrin12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the Hückel rule, norcorrole Ni(II) complexes should be characterized as distinctly antiaromatic, given their 16 -electronic circuit and the planar structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, we attempted the synthesis of norcorroles with less bulky peripheral substituents in order to facilitate  stacking in the solid state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discovered that diphenylnorcorrole Ni(II) (3b) adopts a triple-decker  stacked structure in the solid state with a very short interplanar distance (3.149 Å).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, a significant reduction of antiaromaticity of the norcorrole skeleton was observed for 3b in the solid state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following that discovery, we constructed the tethered norcorrole dimers 5a and 5b to confirm the substantially diminished antiaromaticity of the stacked antiaromatic systems in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These stacked norcorroles represent the experimental evidence for the emergence of aromaticity in antiaromatic -systems upon stacking.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In summary, we have presented an experimental example of closely stacked antiaromatic -conjugated systems using norcorrole Ni(II) complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the stacked norcorroles, significantly diminished antiaromaticity was observed, as well as the emergence of aromatic features such as enhanced stability, bond length equalization and effective electronic delocalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As stacked antiaromatic compounds allow an exceptionally close alignment of -conjugated systems and accordingly large intermolecular orbital interactions, they constitute a design principle for materials with potential applications in organic electronics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, this study demonstrates the possibility to tune the non-linear optical properties of such antiaromatic -systems dynamically by controlling their spatial arrangement through supramolecular interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although antiaromatic compounds currently still lack practical applications, this study should provide the conceptual basis for a multitude of applications in nonlinear optical materials.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
