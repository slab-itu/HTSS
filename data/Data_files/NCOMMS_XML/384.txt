Mapping quantum state dynamics in spontaneous emission  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The evolution of a quantum state undergoing radiative decay depends on how its emission is detected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the emission is detected in the form of energy quanta, the evolution is characterized by a quantum jump to a lower energy state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, detection of the wave nature of the emitted radiation leads to different dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we investigate the diffusive dynamics of a superconducting artificial atom under continuous homodyne detection of its spontaneous emission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using quantum state tomography, we characterize the correlation between the detected homodyne signal and the emitters state, and map out the conditional back-action of homodyne measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By tracking the diffusive quantum trajectories of the state as it decays, we characterize selective stochastic excitation induced by the choice of measurement basis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate dramatic differences from the quantum jump evolution associated with photodetection and highlight how continuous field detection can be harnessed to control quantum evolution.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In spontaneous emission, an emitter decays from an excited state by releasing radiation into a quantized mode of the electromagnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the point of view of quantum measurement theory, the lightmatter interaction entangles the quantum state of the emitter with its electromagnetic environment1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emission field may therefore serve as a pointer state used to indirectly monitor the emitters evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent measurements of the field convey information about the state of the emitter and consequently cause back-action3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically, spontaneous emission is detected in the form of energy quanta, resulting in an instantaneous jump of the emitter to a lower energy state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if the emission is measured with a detector that is not sensitive to quanta, but rather to the amplitude of the field, the emitters state undergoes different dynamics over finite timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, the emitter is predicted to diffuse through its state space rather than abruptly decay to the ground state in a quantum jump, and the choice of measurement on the pointer will affect the dynamics of diffusion4,5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this work, we perform homodyne measurements of the spontaneous emission from an effective two-level system, formed by the strong lightmatter interaction between a superconducting circuit and a microwave cavity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By performing phase-sensitive amplification, we selectively amplify and de-amplify orthogonal quadratures of the emission field, enforcing a choice of measurement basis on the pointer state and limiting the measurement back-action experienced by the emitter8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use quantum state tomography, in addition to weak measurements, to study the back-action of homodyne measurements and track the time evolution of the emitters state under radiative decay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to the evolution expected for photodetection, we observe quantum trajectories3,8,10 that stochastically diffuse through the state space of the emitter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For certain phases of homodyne detection we observe that the emitter evolves towards its excited state under radiative decay5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This stochastic excitation demonstrates how phase-sensitive amplification of spontaneous emission can be utilized to control the emitters evolution.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Experimental set-up', 'Our system (Fig 1a) consists of an effective two-level emitter formed by the resonant interaction of a transmon circuit11 and a three-dimensional waveguide cavity12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strong lightmatter interaction between the circuit and the cavity strips them of their individual character and gives rise to hybrid circuit-cavity states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use the lowest energy transition (0/2=6.83 GHz) as an effective two-level system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deliberate coupling to a 50  transmission line results in a radiative decay rate =2.3 × 106 s1.

the pseudo-spin raising (lowering) operator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interaction couples an arbitrary field quadrature aei+aei to a corresponding emitter dipole ei++ei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the Heisenberg uncertainty relations, the emitted radiation exhibits quantum fluctuations in its quadrature amplitudes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If these fluctuations are measured, they provide information on the emitter state and drive its stochastic evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, if the fluctuations are de-amplified, their information is no longer available, eliminating the corresponding stochastic back-action on the emitter state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Experimental set-up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The experiment uses a near-quantum-limited Josephson parametric amplifier, labelled here as a

#@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, we treat the quantum noise as a Weiner process; the fluctuations of the measurement signal dVt in an infinitesimal time step dt are described by stochastic noise increments dWt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Known as Weiner increments3, these are zero-mean, Gaussian random variables with variance dt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To accurately reflect this stochastic and dimensionless nature of the homodyne signal, we scale dVt such that it has a variance 2=dt, with the full measurement record given by .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To experimentally demonstrate that our homodyne detection scheme is sensitive to a single quadrature of the emitters dipole, we prepare the emitter in a specific state, perform homodyne measurement with =0, and integrate the resulting signal (Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

emitter is prepared in the state +x (Fig 2e), we observe that some of the conditioned states evolve towards the excited state5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This stochastic excitation is unique to amplitude measurements of the field quadrature, since such excitation is not possible under photodetection6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, when the emitter is prepared in the state +y, an eigenstate of the imaginary part of our measured operator =(x+iy)/2, the emitter dipole corresponds to the de-amplified quadrature of the emission field, and no stochastic excitation is observed (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This different state preparation is equivalent to preparing the emitter in the same state +x (as depicted in Fig 2e) and instead changing the homodyne phase by /2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This demonstrates how the choice of homodyne measurement phase can be used to control the evolution of the emitter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We take advantage of the deterministic evolution of the emitter,

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In recent years, several experiments have demonstrated control over the emission process by either altering vacuum fluctuations16 or engineering the electromagnetic environment17,18, allowing spontaneous emission to be used as a resource for quantum information19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the entanglement between a quantum emitter and its spontaneous emission field has been studied in experiments using natural atoms1 and solid state systems2, and can be used to herald entanglement between spatially separated systems21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work highlights how spontaneous emission can also be used as a resource for quantum measurement, where the emission field serves as a pointer system for indirect measurements of the emitter state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contemporary experiments7,8,9,10,22,23,24,25,26 that harness Bayesian statistics or use quantum optics to track the evolution of quantum states have yielded a deeper understanding of quantum measurement evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we have shown how specific quadrature measurements of the fluorescence from a quantum emitter result in a rich conditional evolution of the state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have harnessed this evolution to map out the back-action associated with such measurements, and we have tracked the individual quantum trajectories an emitter takes when decaying through fluorescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the instantaneous dynamics of emission due to measurements of quanta, here we show that spontaneous emission may also occur over finite timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Measurements, and more broadly, control over a quantum environment, can in principle be used to steer quantum evolution27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though the physical mechanism of energy decay remains constant between homodyne detection and photodetection, by changing the basis for the measurement of the emission field, we have significantly altered the emitter states dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, quantum noise of the pointer state drives the evolution of the emitter, demonstrated clearly by our use of a phase-sensitive amplifier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By squeezing the pointer state, we change the nature of its quantum fluctuations, and therefore cause selective measurement back-action on the emitter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such control over the quantum lightmatter interaction has the potential to advance techniques in fluorescence based imaging, and will be essential in quantum feedback control3,9,29 of quantum systems.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
