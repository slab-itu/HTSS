Quantum criticality at the superconductor-insulator transition revealed by specific heat measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The superconductorinsulator transition (SIT) is considered an excellent example of a quantum phase transition that is driven by quantum fluctuations at zero temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantum critical point is characterized by a diverging correlation length and a vanishing energy scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low-energy fluctuations near quantum criticality may be experimentally detected by specific heat, cp, measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use a unique highly sensitive experiment to measure cp of two-dimensional granular Pb films through the SIT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specific heat shows the usual jump at the mean field superconducting transition temperature  marking the onset of Cooper pairs formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the film thickness is tuned towards the SIT,  is relatively unchanged, while the magnitude of the jump and low-temperature specific heat increase significantly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This behaviour is taken as the thermodynamic fingerprint of quantum criticality in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Quantum criticality is a central paradigm in physics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It unifies the description of diverse systems in the vicinity of a second-order, zero-temperature quantum phase transition, governed by a quantum critical point (QCP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  QCPs have been discovered and extensively studied primarily in metallic and magnetic systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At many of these QCPs, especially in two dimensions (2D), conventional mean-field and Fermi-liquid theories fail in lack of well-defined quasiparticles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  QCPs inspired innovative non-perturbative approaches1,2,3,4, including those relevant to field theory/gravity duality5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In 2D superconducting films, the zero-temperature superconductorinsulator transition (SIT) has been viewed as a prototype of a quantum phase transition that is controlled by a non-thermal tuning parameter g6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimentally, the transition has been driven utilizing various g such as inverse thickness7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16, magnetic field12,13,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26, disorder25,27,28 chemical composition29 and gate voltage30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For g less_than gc the film is a superconductor with well-defined quasiparticles and superconducting collective modes as well as a finite 2D superfluid density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As g is increased, the system enters the critical regime in which excitations are strongly correlated, while the superfluid density vanishes as ggc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For g greater than gc, the system becomes insulating with gapped charge excitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', '2D superconducting granular films have been shown to exhibit signs for Cooper-pairing effects such as the presence of an energy gap,  well into the insulator phase31, and it has been argued that they may be modelled by a bosonic quantum field theory with O(2) symmetry32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar findings were found for disordered thin films27,29,33 in which disorder is assumed to generate emergent granularity34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If one ignores the broadening of the SIT due to inhomogeneities, divergent correlation length and time are expected at the transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, recent optical conductivity measurements have detected signatures of the critical amplitude (Higgs) mode, becoming soft at the SIT35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One of the salient thermodynamic signatures of a QCP is the presence of excess entropy or specific heat1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In heavy electron metals, this has been observed as the divergence of linear specific heat coefficients, or electronic effective mass, which signals a deviation from conventional Fermi-liquid theory behaviour37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a signature would be very important to measure in the SIT system, to probe the critical thermodynamics near this non-mean-field-type QCP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Entropy S(T) is a fundamental physical quantity of significant importance for the quantum phase transition; however, its absolute value cannot be directly measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the specific heat cp(T) at constant pressure can have its absolute value determined experimentally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apart from its interest regarding QCP, it is above all the most appropriate physical property to categorize the order of a phase transition or to probe signatures of fluctuations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite its crucial interest, specific heat experiments have never been performed close to the QCP in the context of the SIT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main reason is that the systems under study are 2D ultra-thin films involving ultra-low mass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The substrate mass onto which thin films are deposited is usually much larger than that of the film itself rendering ultra-thin film specific heat unmeasurable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report on the first experimental demonstration of excess specific heat in 2D granular films spanning the superconductorinsulator quantum phase transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We employ a unique technique based on thin suspended silicon membrane used as a thermal sensor that enables ultra-sensitive measurements of the specific heat of superconducting films close to the SIT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the mean-field critical temperature, , remains basically unchanged through the SIT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the specific heat jump at  and the specific heat magnitude at temperatures lower than the critical temperature increase progressively towards the transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are interpreted as thermodynamic indications for quantum criticality close to the QCP.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The results presented show that the low-temperature specific heat is enhanced towards the QCP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present a possible scenario for the effect of quantum criticality on the electronic specific in the superconducting state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recall that for a weakly interacting metal, such as Pb, the normal-state specific heat follows equation (1), where the electronic contribution coefficient is given by:', '', 'here g is the single-particle density of states at the Fermi energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, for free electrons, n=m is proportional to the electron mass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Excess specific heat is not expected near an ordinary disorder driven metal-to-insulator transition via Anderson localization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In such a transition, the linear coefficient persists into the insulator phase as measured in, for example, silicon-doped phosphorous system47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore the enhancement observed here at low temperatures, T less_than , indicates that it is related to pairing and superconductivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The BCS prediction for the electronic specific heat in the superconducting state is given by:48', '', 'hence, it depends on the same n as that of the normal state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the BCS specific heat jump also scales with n since48,', '', 'Since, as we demonstrated experimentally,  remains constant through the SIT, we interpret the cs enhancement as a signature of the renormalization of the electron mass appearing in the coefficient n. This is described through the presence of a self-energy in the Green function formalism, which is an interaction driven effect in the vicinity of the QCP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed close to a QCP, following quantum field theory, the electron effective mass is renormalized by the self-energy  by49,50:', '', 'where  depends on the many-body interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These interactions can be with phonons or with other electrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the main contribution to the self-energy arises from the interaction of the fermions with low-energy collective superconducting quantum fluctuations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These quantum fluctuations can be either gapless phase-density fluctuations (called Goldstone/plasmon modes) or amplitude fluctuations (called Higgs modes), both lead to an infrared singularity in the self-energy51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be phenomenologically modelled by a divergent *(T) by replacing equation (3) by:', '', 'The specific heat curves depicted in Fig 2c imply that such an interpretation would require a *(T) that would significantly increase at low temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that a divergence of linear specific heat coefficient n has been widely observed at the QCP separating a magnetic and paramagnetic Fermi liquids2 in good agreement with what is currently observed in granular superconducting Pb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In those systems, the temperature dependence of n was predicted to be2: .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our limited temperature interval, we find that a better fit is given by assuming a power-law dependence of * on temperature (Fig 3):', '', 'where both 0 and  increase as the thickness t decreases towards the QCP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The appropriateness of such scaling is illustrated in Fig 3, where all curves can be collapsed by the same equation 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, the bosonic degrees of freedom due to order-parameter fluctuations of phase and amplitude should also contribute to the specific heat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, such specific heat, cboson, was computed for the 2D O(2) relativistic GinzburgLandau theory, by the non-perturbative renormalization group4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are shown in the Methods section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cboson/T2 exhibits a peak that reflects a relative enhancement of order 2 at the QCP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This peak is associated with the excess of low-temperature entropy of the softening amplitude fluctuations (Higgs mode).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As for the granular superconducting films, the overall magnitude of the bosonic specific heat is controlled by the density of grains so that , which is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than the measured excess specific heat scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the effects of the bosonic collective modes close to the QCP are measurable only indirectly through their effects on the electronic effective mass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To conclude, we experimentally demonstrated the enhancement of specific heat towards the QCP in a granular superconductor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is interpreted as the thermodynamic indication for quantum criticality in the quantum critical regime of the SIT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A possible mechanism for this specific heat enhancement is the increase of the electronic effective mass in the vicinity of the quantum phase transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effective mass increase is correlated to the self-energy emerging from the interactions between the fermions and bosonic collective modes that become pronounced close to the quantum critical point of the SIT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From our results, it is not possible to tell whether the specific heat decreases as the sample is pushed deep into the insulating phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data become too noisy to draw any definite conclusion since the film becomes too thin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The direct detection of the collective modes by specific heat require either more sensitive instrumentation or more adapted systems.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
