Dendro-dendritic cholinergic excitation controls dendritic spike initiation in retinal ganglion cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The retina processes visual images to compute features such as the direction of image motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starburst amacrine cells (SACs), axonless feed-forward interneurons, are essential components of the retinal direction-selective circuitry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent work has highlighted that SAC-mediated dendro-dendritic inhibition controls the action potential output of direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs) by vetoing dendritic spike initiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, SACs co-release GABA and the excitatory neurotransmitter acetylcholine at dendritic sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use direct dendritic recordings to show that preferred direction light stimuli evoke SAC-mediated acetylcholine release, which powerfully controls the stimulus sensitivity, receptive field size and action potential output of ON-DSGCs by acting as an excitatory drive for the initiation of dendritic spikes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, paired recordings reveal that the activation of single ON-SACs drove dendritic spike generation, because of predominate cholinergic excitation received on the preferred side of ON-DSGCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, dendro-dendritic release of neurotransmitters from SACs bi-directionally gate dendritic spike initiation to control the directionally selective action potential output of retinal ganglion cells.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The algorithms underlying neuronal circuit-based computations are embedded in network connectivity, and implemented by the functional operations of component synapses and neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The retina provides an ideal neuronal circuit to investigate such algorithms1, as the visual world is computed by a relatively simple three-layered network to drive action potential output in classes of retinal ganglion cells which signal salient visual features, such as the direction of image motion to the higher brain2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the retina the direction of image motion is signalled by classes of direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (DSGCs), which generate robust patterns of action potential output in response to light stimuli moving across or within their receptive fields in a preferred direction, but respond weakly to identical stimuli moving in the opposite null direction2,3,4,6,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The direction-selective action potential output of DSGCs is believed to be computed by the integration of a directionally un-tuned excitatory input, predominately mediated by glutamate release from bipolar cells11,12,13, with a directionally tuned inhibitory synaptic input generated by the dendritic release of GABA from axonless feed-forward interneurons, termed starburst amacrine cells (SACs)9,14,15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SACs represent essential components of the direction-selective circuitry of the retina18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both ON- and OFF-SACs are distributed, in a mosaic throughout the retina19, and possess a unique radial dendritic morphology, in which each dendrite operates in electrical isolation14,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functionally, two-photon calcium imaging has revealed that SAC dendritic calcium responses are preferentially generated when light stimuli move from the soma towards terminal dendritic sites14, a direction-selective calcium signal that is thought to generate the dendritic release of neurotransmitters from terminal dendritic synaptic output zones22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The directional tuning of DSGCs is disrupted by the pharmacological antagonism of GABAA receptors23,25, evincing a prominent role of SAC-mediated synaptic inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, electrophysiological and high-resolution morphological studies have demonstrated that the SAC-mediated inhibitory synaptic control of null direction light responses is mediated by a greater GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic conductance, synapse number, and distribution of dendro-dendritic synapses on the null side of DSGCs16,17,26,27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SACs are, however, not simply feed-forward inhibitory interneurons, as ultrastructural and functional evidence indicates that both GABA and acetylcholine (ACh) are co-released by SACs to drive postsynaptic inhibition and excitation16,23,25,26,27,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The physiological role of the co-released neurotransmitter ACh is however less well understood, and controversy remains on the contribution of this feed-forward excitatory signal to the generation of light-evoked DSGC action potential output, and its role in the computation of direction selectivity12,16,23,26,29,30,36,37,38,39,40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, SAC-mediated cholinergic signalling has been demonstrated to powerfully control the action potential output of DSGCs in response to time-varying visual stimuli, and act as an essential excitatory signal under mesopic, low contrast, conditions40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Light-evoked feed-forward SAC-mediated cholinergic excitation may therefore function to provide local dendritic depolarization that acts to gate bipolar-cell-mediated glutamatergic excitation of DSGCs41, which is largely mediated by NMDA receptors42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent work has, however, highlighted that dendritic spike generation plays a major role in computation of direction selectivity43,44,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct dendritic recordings have revealed that light-evoked action potential firing of rabbit DSGCs is driven by the initiation of a cascade of dendritic spike generators, a dendritic computation that is silenced by SAC-mediated inhibition45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As GABA and ACh are released from dendritic sites of SACs16,23,25,26,27,33,34,35,36, these observations suggest that SAC-mediated cholinergic excitation may also function to control dendritic electrogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we use multi-site electrophysiological recording techniques to demonstrate that the dendro-dendritic release of ACh from SACs powerfully positively gates the initiation of dendritic spikes to control the stimulus-sensitivity, receptive field structure and the magnitude of light-evoked action potential output of DSGCs.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Paired recordings from ON-SACs and ON-DSGCs', 'The role of SACs in the directional selective circuitry of the retina has largely been explored with reference to ON-OFF-DSGCs, a cell-type which receives synaptic input in both the ON- and OFF-sublamina of the inner plexiform layer (IPL)4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, ON-DSGCs are exclusively driven by the ON pathway, and possess a dendritic tree restricted to the ON- sublamina of the IPL4,5,6, providing a simplified circuit for the dissection of the role of SACs in the computation of direction selectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct electrical recording from the dendrites of ON-DSGCs has revealed that active dendritic integration plays an instrumental role in the generation and control of light-evoked action potential firing and the computation of direction selectivity45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the role that SAC-mediated cholinergic signalling plays in this computation we first made paired recordings from morphologically identified ON-SACs and ON-DSGCs maintained in fragments of the adult rabbit retina ex vivo (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Starburst amacrine cell-mediated cholinergic excitation and GABAergic inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Reconstruction of a connected pair of ON-SAC (green) and ON-DSGCs (black).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Paired recording revealed the obligatory co-release of ACh and GABA from ON-SACs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overlain voltage traces show the transformation of SAC-driven synaptic excitation of an ON-DSGC to synaptic inhibition when nAChRs were blocked with Mecamylamine (MMA, 10 M, blue traces;

SAC current input: amplitude=0.65±0.06 nA; duration=10 ms; n=16 pairs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In connections that exhibited excitatory PSPs, the selective pharmacological blockade of nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) abolished the excitatory response to reveal postsynaptic inhibition (Fig 1a-c; amplitude distribution in mecamylamine (MMA, 10 M) significantly different from control, P less_than 0.0001; KolmogorovSmironov test; median significantly different from control, P less_than 0.0001, MannWhitney test; n=9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, the specific GABAA receptor antagonist GABAzine (10 M) unmasked nAChR-mediated excitation in connections that exhibited net inhibition under control conditions (Fig 1d,e; P less_than 0.0001; KolmogorovSmironov test; median significantly different from control, P less_than 0.0001, MannWhitney test; n=6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pharmacologically isolated cholinergic excitatory and GABAergic inhibitory PSPs exhibited a characteristic difference in their time to onset following SAC activation, with the onset of GABAergic inhibitory PSPs leading that of cholinergic excitatory PSPs (Fig 1fh, Supplementary Fig 1ab; IPSP onset time=6.6±0.9 ms; EPSP onset time=10.3±1.3 ms, P=0.0432; T=2.295; onset time measured at 5% of PSP amplitude; IPSP rise time=8.9±1.9 ms; EPSP rise time=5.8±0.5 ms; rise time measured between 10 and 90% of PSP amplitude; n=14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference could not be accounted for by a presynaptic mechanism, such as temporal jitter in the engagement of dendritic transmitter release, as the distribution of onset latencies around the mean was similar for pharmacologically isolated excitatory and inhibitory PSPs (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The onset time of SAC-evoked PSPs could however be influenced by the time course of transmitter diffusion from SAC dendritic sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have suggested cholinergic signalling may occur in a paracrine fashion in the retina, and so may not be reliant on structurally determined dendro-dendritic synapses17,41, an idea consistent with the observed slower onset time of the pharmacologically isolated cholinergic PSPs observed here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note, however, that previous paired recordings have revealed similar onset times of SAC-mediated cholinergic and GABAergic postsynaptic currents in DSGCs, when temporally overlapping excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents were separated under somatic voltage-clamp by reversal potential16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functionally, the different onset of dendro-dendritic excitation and inhibition observed here would be predicted to lead to the generation of biphasic compound PSPs, if both GABA and ACh are co-released from a single ON-SAC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed when pharmacologically isolated excitatory and inhibitory components were arithmetically summed, a clear biphasic compound PSP was generated (Fig 1h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, SAC-evoked PSPs recorded under control conditions frequently exhibited a biphasic waveform, that was clearly evident in single trials and when consecutive responses were digitally averaged (Fig 1d,h, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data reveal that ACh and GABA are co-released from single ON-SACs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We next enquired if the synaptic impact of ON-SACs aligned with the directional tuning of postsynaptic ON-DSGCs (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do this we mapped the action potential output of ON-DSGCs generated by light bars moved across their receptive fields and made paired recordings from ON-SACs positioned close to the edge of the dendritic arbour first activated by light stimuli moving in a preferred direction, the preferred side, or ON-SACs positioned close to the edge of the dendritic arbour first activated by null direction light stimuli, the null side (Fig 2a,b inset and Fig 2c,d, inset, Supplementary Fig 2; light bar size=100 by 300400 m, moved in one of 12 directions at 0.24 mm s1; direction selectivity index (DSI)=0.93±0.03; SAC-DSGC soma separation=270±14 m; n=17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the somata of ON-SACs were positioned close to the edge of the preferred side of ON-DSGCs, and the sites of close dendro-dendritic SAC-DSGC apposition restricted to the preferred side, net excitatory responses were generated (Fig 2a,b,e; PSP amplitude=2.02±0.37 mV, integral=31.4±4.3 V.s; n=6 pairs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, when the somata and sites of dendro-dendritic apposition were focussed on the null side, responses were on average inhibitory, but demonstrated a wide range (Fig 2c-e; PSP amplitude=0.59±0.8 mV; integral=33.7±21.0 V.s; n=11 pairs; significantly different from preferred side: P=0.035, T=2.31; integral: P=0.041, T=2.24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under current-clamp recording conditions, therefore, the balance of SAC-mediated cholinergic excitation outweighs that of inhibition on the preferred side of ON-DSGCs, while inhibition outweighs excitation on the null side (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding parallels the targeted dendritic impact of SAC-mediated excitation and inhibition reported for ONOFF DSGCs16,26,27,36, and so reveals stereo-typed dendro-dendritic circuitry in the ON- and OFF-sublamina of the inner plexiform layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: The impact of ON-SACs aligns with the directional tuning of postsynaptic ON-DSGCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Reconstruction of a connected pair of ON-SAC (green) and ON-DSGCs (black), showing the sites (red symbols), and vectorial angle (red arrow, relative to SAC somata) of close dendro-dendritic appositions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Morphologies have been aligned to the preferred direction vector of ON-DSGC light responses (b inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all panels the preferred side of the ON-DSGC, the dendritic field first activated by light stimuli moving in the preferred direction, lies above the horizontal dashed line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the SAC somata and all dendro-dendritic close appositions are positioned on the preferred side of the postsynaptic ON-DSGC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Paired recordings from the illustrated cells (a) revealed that activation of the SAC-evoked excitatory PSPs in the ON-DSGC (grey traces, red trace is a digital average).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The somatic current-evoked presynaptic SAC voltage responses are shown below (green trace).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Reconstruction of an ON-SAC located in the null side of an ON-DSGC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The morphologies have been aligned to the ON-DSGC light response vector (d inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Paired recordings from the illustrated cells (c) revealed SAC-mediated inhibitory PSPs (grey traces, blue trace is a digital average).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Summary of the impact of SACs located on the preferred and null sides of postsynaptic ON-DSGCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The morphologies of postsynaptic ON-DSGCs are shown as overlain and spatially filtered (50 m, black) reconstructions registered to the preferred direction of light responses, shown schematically by the yellow light bars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nested within this field are perimeter representations of SACs (green).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arrows indicate the vector angle of SAC-DSGC close dendro-dendritic appositions coloured according to their postsynaptic impact (red excitatory, blue inhibitory PSPs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vector length represents 1 contact per m.

Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antagonism of nAChRs dramatically reduced the robust action potential firing of ON-DSGCs evoked by light bars moved in the preferred direction and virtually eliminated the sparse action potential firing evoked by null direction stimuli, an effect evident in somatic whole-cell and cell-attached recording modes (Fig 3ac;

n=28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of whole-cell recorded light responses revealed that nAChR antagonists significantly reduced the membrane depolarization evoked by preferred direction light stimuli, and transformed null direction responses from weakly excitatory to inhibitory (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect could not be accounted for by the reduction of action potential firing, as this transformation was apparent when action potentials were digitally removed using a median filter (10 ms)46 (Fig 3d;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The retinal microcircuitry that underlies the processing of image motion has been solved at ultrastructural resolution9,17, but a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying the computation of direction selectivity requires investigation of circuit function at a similar scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we used multi-site somatic and dendritic electrophysiological recording techniques to demonstrate that the direction-selective action potential output of rabbit ON-DSGCs is powerfully controlled by SAC-mediated dendro-dendritic cholinergic excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In confirmation of previous findings obtained from ON-OFF-DSGCs16,26,34,35,36, our paired ON-SAC to ON-DSGC recordings revealed the dendro-dendritic co-release of ACh and GABA from SACs, which drove postsynaptic excitation and inhibition, mediated by the activation of nAChR and GABAA receptors, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, we observed that the postsynaptic impact of SACs was defined by their position in the receptive field of postsynaptic DSGCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SACs positioned on the preferred side, which made close dendro-dendritic appositions from dendrites oriented in the preferred direction of DSGCs, generated net excitatory responses in DSGCs, whereas, SACs located on the null side generated, on average, postsynaptic inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that when light stimuli enter the receptive fields of DSGCs in a preferred or null direction, the activation of SACs located on the periphery of the preferred and null side should differentially influence the action potential output of ON-DSGCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, when the direction-selective microcircuit was physiologically activated, the robust preferred direction light-evoked action potential output of ON-DSGCs was greatly attenuated by the pharmacological antagonism of nAChRs, and by the selective depletion of presynaptic ACh release from SACs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, we found across a broad range of light stimuli that the antagonism of nAChRs disassociated the tight relationship between the receptive and dendritic field areas of ON-DSGCs, and disrupted the characteristic generation of action potential firing evoked by preferred direction light bars as they entered the receptive field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Direct dendritic electrical recording, calcium imaging and computational modelling have shown that active dendritic integration underlies the wide-field responsiveness of DSGCs13,43,44,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multi-site somato-dendritic recording techniques have deconstructed this process to reveal that dendritic spikes are first initiated in the small calibre terminal dendrites of DSGCs45, which receive excitatory glutamatergic synapses from bipolar-cells51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Terminal dendritic spike generation has been found to be the first step in a multi-layered active integration cascade, as these spikes act as variable triggers for the generation of dendritic spikes in larger calibre parent dendrites that, once initiated, forward propagate to the axon to drive action potential output45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate that SAC-mediated cholinergic signalling is a major component of this integrative process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simultaneous somato-dendritic recordings revealed that the generation of terminal and large-amplitude parent dendritic spikes by light spots or preferred direction moving light bars were powerfully attenuated by the antagonism of nAChRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An effect underscored by the rescue of dendritic spike generation when cholinergic excitation was mimicked by local dendritic depolarization or the terminal dendritic application of ACh.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dendro-dendritic release of ACh therefore controls the action potential output of DSGCs by driving terminal dendritic spike generation, and enhancing the coupling between active dendritic integration sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that SAC-mediated cholinergic excitation acts as a dendritic subunit-specific gate of bipolar-cell signalling, that when activated by moving light bars powerfully controls the action potential output of DSGCs, to define the stimulus sensitivity and receptive field area over which the computation of direction selectivity is executed (Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An idea supportive of previous observations made from ON-OFF-DSGCs, which have revealed that cholinergic excitation acts to control bipolar-cell mediated glutamatergic excitation by supplying membrane depolarization to relieve the voltage-dependent block of NMDA receptor-mediated PSPs41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings however extend this idea to demonstrate that these excitatory inputs act in concert to drive the initiation of terminal dendritic spikes, and thus launch a cascade of dendritic spike generation which ultimately results in the driving of action potential output, providing a substrate for the localized dendritic processing of light stimuli3 (Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 10: Schematic summary of the role of SAC-mediated control of active dendritic integration compartments of

null side of DSGCs drove net postsynaptic inhibition, a finding that is consistent with the greater GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic conductance, and distribution of dendro-dendritic synapses on the null side of DSGCs16,17,26,27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at these sites, we find that dendro-dendritic cholinergic signalling plays a functional role, as the blockade of cholinergic excitation transformed null direction light-evoked voltage responses from weakly excitatory to strongly inhibitory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, when GABAergic inhibition was pharmacologically blocked, the antagonism of nAChRs attenuated moving light bar-evoked action potential output in all tested directions, as has been shown for ON-OFF-DSGCs23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, when the uptake of ACh was inhibited, both null and preferred direction light responses were strongly facilitated, and direction tuning disrupted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data reveal that a balance between the postsynaptic impact of SAC neurotransmitters is essential for the emergence of directional selectivity, questioning how action potential firing is suppressed by null direction light stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Dendritic recording and neuronal modelling has demonstrated that null direction light stimuli evoke sparse action potential output in rabbit DSGCs because of the SAC-mediated inhibitory control of dendritic spike initiation44,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct recording has demonstrated that this inhibitory control is restricted to terminal dendritic sites, as null direction synaptic inhibition does not inhibit the initiation of large-amplitude parent dendritic spikes in DSGCs generated in response to steps of direct current45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When considered together with our current work, these data suggest that the dominant SAC-mediated null side inhibition acts to clamp the terminal dendritic membrane potential at a voltage sub-threshold for the generation of terminal dendritic spikes, thereby negatively gating their generation by bipolar-cell-mediated glutamatergic and SAC-mediated cholinergic excitation (Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A structural substrate for the dual excitatory and inhibitory roles of SACs in the retinal circuitry is well documented16,23,26,27,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dendrites of ON- and OFF-SACs form dense choline acetyl transferase and vesicular ACh transporter delineated fascicles in the inner plexiform layer, the passage of which are closely followed by the dendrites of DSGCs51,53,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably this mapping is most refined for small terminal DSGC dendrites, the predominant site of SAC-DSGC synaptic connectivity22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultrastructural analysis of murine ON-OFF-DSGCs has, however, shown that the distribution of dendro-dendritic synapses is asymmetrical, with a 13-fold greater density established by SACs positioned on the functional determined null side of ON-OFF-DSGCs17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate in the simplified circuitry of the ON-sublamina of the inner plexiform layer that the postsynaptic impact of ON-SACs is position dependent, with cholinergic excitation dominating on the preferred, and GABAergic inhibition on the null side, consistent with previous results from ON-OFF-DSGCs16,26,27,28,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As our paired recordings, and previous results, have revealed the obligatory co-release of ACh and GABA from SACs, these data suggest that ACh may be released from, or have postsynaptic impact at, sites other than dendro-dendritic synapses, a finding that is supported by the relatively long time to onset of cholinergic PSPs, and the effects of manipulating ACh hydrolysis47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, direct dendritic recordings revealed that light stimuli, and direct activation of SACs drove localized nAChR-dependent dendritic excitation, which was integrated locally in the dendritic arbour to control dendritic spike initiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings are therefore consistent with a model in which ACh operates in a localized paracrine fashion in the IPL17,41, at sites constrained by the co-fasciculation of SAC and DSGC dendrites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The development of new tools for the direct visualization of ACh release and diffusion are, however, required to definitively address this issue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our findings we conclude that the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters released from the dendrites of feed-forward interneurons in the output layer of the retina are integrated together with direct bipolar-cell-mediated glutamatergic excitation to drive and control the generation of dendritic spikes in DSGCs, the initiation of which determines the light stimulus sensitivity, receptive field size and direction selectivity of action potential output (Fig 10).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
