Humans choose representatives who enforce cooperation in social dilemmas through extortion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Social dilemmas force players to balance between personal and collective gain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In many dilemmas, such as elected governments negotiating climate-change mitigation measures, the decisions are made not by individual players but by their representatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the behaviour of representatives in social dilemmas has not been investigated experimentally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here inspired by the negotiations for greenhouse-gas emissions reductions, we experimentally study a collective-risk social dilemma that involves representatives deciding on behalf of their fellow group members.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Representatives can be re-elected or voted out after each consecutive collective-risk game.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selfish players are preferentially elected and are hence found most frequently in the representatives treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Across all treatments, we identify the selfish players as extortioners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As predicted by our mathematical model, their steadfast strategies enforce cooperation from fair players who finally compensate almost completely the deficit caused by the extortionate co-players.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Everybody gains, but the extortionate representatives and their groups gain the most.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Although humans are regarded as champions of cooperation1,2, there are social dilemmas that so far have defied solutionwe have not yet collaborated successfully to stop the increase of global greenhouse-gas emissions3,4, Europe continues to overexploit its marine fish stock5 and the European Union has so far failed to reach an equitable solution to accommodating the large number of refugees arriving from Africa and the Middle East6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these and other dilemmas, essential decisions are made not by individual social actors but by representatives such as officials from elected governments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Representatives have been shown to display a more competitive mindset than ordinary group members7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the behaviour of representatives in a social dilemma has, to our knowledge, not been investigated experimentally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To fill this gap is the aim of our paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While we believe that our results apply to the role of representatives in social dilemmas more broadly, we have drawn our main inspiration and the concrete setting of our experiments from the challenge to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This challenge is now usually interpreted as limiting global warming to below 2 °C compared with the pre-industrial period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prevent temperature from exceeding this limit, greenhouse-gas emissions should be reduced from about 2020 onwards; by 2050, emissions should fall to a level of 50% of the year 2000 emissions4,9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as representatives attend climate summits to negotiate their countrys share in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, they are eagerly watched by their voters who might not re-elect their representatives when others negotiate a lower share13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though everybody profits only if dangerous climate change is averted, none of the many climate summits has achieved sustained emissions reductions, the relative success of the Paris negotiations at COP21 notwithstanding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The global emissions-reduction problem has been simulated experimentally in the collective-risk social dilemma game14,15,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of volunteers can invest anonymously from their individual endowments into a climate account in each of 10 consecutive rounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the group collectively reaches a specified target sum, everybody receives in cash what she has not invested from her endowment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if the group fails to reach the target, individuals risk losing all their remaining endowment with a high probability, mimicking the drastic economic losses that result from dangerous climate change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The social dilemma arises because all players benefit only if the collective target is reached, but individual payoff is maximised by lower-than-average contributions, spurred by the hope that others will compensate to reach the target13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In contrast to previous work, we have here assembled 15 groups of 18 players each where the groups are sub-divided into 6 countries of 3 players each who elect, re-elect or vote out their representative for the 6 representatives summit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For control, we have assembled 15 groups of 6 players each (as in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14) and 15 groups of 18 players each.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 3 consecutive collective-risk games with 10 rounds each, each player in the 6-players and 18-players treatments contributes from her initial endowment of 40; in the 6-representatives treatment, each representative contributes from the combined endowments (120) of her watching country mates and on their behalf (Fig 1; see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The target sum that must be collected by each group to prevent simulated dangerous climate change is 120 in the 6-players treatment and 360 both in the 18-players and the 6-representatives treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Design of the three treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The 6-players treatment, (b) the 18-players treatment, (c) the 6-representatives treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each game consists of 10 rounds, during which players need to raise sufficient contributions to reach a specified target sum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Games 2 and 3 are replicates of game 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The players remain the same in the 6-players and the 18-players treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the 6-representatives treatment, representatives are randomly picked in game 1 and re-elected or voted out for games 2 and 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Re-election of a representative may depend on the representatives performance in previous games.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, except for the first four groups, after games 1 and 2 all players in the 6-representatives treatment are asked to write non-binding pledges about how they would contribute if elected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Players are only informed about the pledges of members of their own subgroup.Full size image', 'We find that selfish players are preferentially elected and are hence found more frequently in the six-representatives treatment than in the other two treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Across all treatments, we identify the selfish players as extortioners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We develop a mathematical model and confirm its prediction that the extortioners steadfast strategies enforce cooperation from fair players who finally compensate almost completely the deficit caused by the extortionate co-players.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Simulated dangerous climate change', 'In the first game of the 18-players treatment and of the 6-representatives treatment, only 33% of the groups reach the target sum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, groups in the six-players treatment are almost twice as likely to collect sufficient contributions in the first game, with 60% of the groups reaching the target sum (Fig 2ac), similar to a previous study14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentage of groups reaching the target sum increases towards game 3 in the six-players and the six-representatives treatment, but the increase is not statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In game 3, the groups in the 18-players treatment are the least successful (Fig 2ac), but again differences are not statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Group success in reaching the target sum (left) and group investments (right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,d) Six-players treatment;

we use two-tailed tests throughout, with the group of six or 18 players as our statistical unit if not stated otherwise).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because in game 1, representatives are randomly picked from the group (see methods), the only difference between the two treatments is that representatives are contributing on behalf of their observing group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In such situations, representatives may have a more competitive mindset7, which would explain why groups in the six-representatives treatment reach the target less often.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total contributions show a small increasing trend from the first to the third game in all treatments (Fig 2e,f), but the differences are statistically significant only between games 1 and 2 in the six-representatives treatment (P=0.026, z=2.230, n=15, Wilcoxon signed-rank matched pairs test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Summed up over all three games per group, contributions relative to the target sum are lowest in the six-representatives treatment, significantly lower than in the six-players treatment (P=0.0061, z=2.742, n1=n2=15, MannWhitney U-test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Fair and selfish players', 'For the group to reach the target sum, each player must on average contribute half of her total endowmentthe fair share of 20 (60 per representative in the six-representatives treatment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, whenever the target sum is not reached, one or several players must have contributed less than their fair share.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We call these selfish players to distinguish them from the fair players who give at least their fair share.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentage of selfish players is highest in the 6-representatives treatment (Fig 3a), higher than in the 6-players treatment (P=0.01, z=2.559, n1=n2=15, MannWhitney U-test) and almost significantly higher than in the 18-players treatment (P=0.06, z=1.862, n1=n2=15, MannWhitney U-test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average contribution of a selfish player (relative to the fair-share contribution) is lower in the 18-players treatment than in both the 6-players (P=0.02, z=2.302, n1=n2=15, MannWhitney U-test;

after game 1: P=0.007, z=2.692, n=10; after game 2: P=0.0051, z=2.803, n=10, Wilcoxon signed-rank matched pairs test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, players fulfil their pledges when acting as representatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Identification of selfish players as extortioners', 'Theorists have predicted for a long time that cooperative and fair strategies such as Tit-for-Tat would eventually succeed in social dilemmas20,21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Why then would subjects vote for representatives who mainly pursue the success of their own subgroup while disregarding the risks for the whole community?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that the election procedure would favour representatives who motivate the other subgroups representatives to reach the target, but at the same time ensure that the own subgroup contributes less than other subgroups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individuals would like their representatives to be steadfast and to convince the other subgroups representatives to compensate for any missing contributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such behaviour is reminiscent of the recently discovered class of extortionate ZD strategies for the repeated prisoners dilemma24,25,26,27,28,29,30, where extortionate players incentivize their opponents to cooperate although they themselves are not fully cooperative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In pairwise encounters, these extortionate players cannot be beaten by any other strategy, and they are predicted to perform well among adaptive co-players24,25,27,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Methods section, we extend the theory of ZD strategies to the collective-risk social dilemma, and we prove that also in our experiment players may adopt extortionate strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such players exhibit the following three characteristics: (i) Extortioners gain higher payoffs than their co-players by contributing less towards the climate account; that is, if xi is the total contributions of an extortioner, and if xi is the average contribution of the other group members, then', '', '(ii) Extortioners persuade their co-players to make up for the missing contributions; that is, the collective best response for the remaining N1 group members is to choose xi such that the group reaches the target sum T,', '', '(iii) Extortioners are consistent, meaning that the properties (i) and (ii) are not only satisfied in one particular instance of the game, but in every game the player participates in.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We now test whether the selfish players in our experiment meet these three criteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Because we find both fair and selfish players in all three treatments, we perform a proof-of-principle with players of all treatments combined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To keep the group as statistical unit, we enter contribution averaged over all fair players of each group;

they are often successful in persuading their fair co-players to compensate for missing contributions (Fig 6); and they are consistent across different games.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, selfish players show all three characteristics of extortionate behaviour.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have introduced into the collective-risk social dilemma the innovation that contributions into the climate account are decided on not by individual players but by representatives (six-representatives treatment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For control, we have assembled groups of 6 players and 18 players in 2 further treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find selfish players in all treatments, but their concentration is highest in the 6-representatives treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selfish representatives are preferentially elected or re-elected if they either contribute less than the fair share or pledge to do so.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Having to cater to their electorates preferences thus has the adverse effect that representatives risk losing the climate game to win elections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, groups in the six-representatives treatment contribute less than groups in the six-players treatment (relative to the required target sum), and they receive lower average payoffs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, in games 2 and 3 the groups tend to reach the target sum more often in the 6-representatives than in the 18-players treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While fair representatives compensate for missing contributions in game 3, 18 players do not achieve that compensation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our representatives tend to be more successful in preventing simulated dangerous climate change than 18 players deciding themselves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that this representatives advantage is much greater with much larger groups such as real countries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The psychological consequences of acting as a representative of a group have been characterised as evoking both more competitive interaction goals and more competitive expectations of others7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A representative is faced with a powerful responsibility to provide good outcomes for her constituency and may face strong pressures by being monitored and evaluated7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mindset that is activated by the role of representative shows up clearly in our experiments when we compare the behaviour of six players randomly selected to decide for themselves with the behaviour of six representatives randomly selected to decide for their group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Otherwise the players find themselves in exactly the same situation in both cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As psychology predicts7, the six players groups are twice as successful as the six-representatives groups in reaching the target sum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When voting, players preferentially choose representatives who either have displayed a competitive mindset as former representatives or have pledged to do so if elected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In our experiments, selfish behaviour pays off only if others compensate any missing contributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selfish subjects apply an implicit form of extortion24they contribute less than is needed on average, but in a way that makes it optimal for their peers to become even more cooperative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of extortion in our experiments differs from that in the repeated prisoners dilemma, in which subjects strongly oppose exploitation31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here subjects in the six-players and six-representatives treatments eventually accept extortion up to a certain degree, especially in game 3, in which subjects have already gained some experience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that the higher tolerance towards extortioners in our experiment is due to the higher stakes involvedresisting extortion comes relatively cheap in the prisoners dilemma, but it endangers the entire payoff in the collective-risk game.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only in the 18-players treatment was extortion unsuccessful in persuading others to cooperate, presumably because in larger groups it becomes more difficult to induce individuals to behave in a desired way.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our identification of extortionate behaviour in the collective-risk social dilemma suggests two counteracting major effects when, with all due caution, we try to interpret the social dynamics of climate summits with our results in mind.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the one hand, the competitive advantage of selfish players in getting elected or re-elected appears to work against reaching a collective target such as preventing dangerous climate changethere might not be enough fair representatives around to support the target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, selfish players, who are ubiquitous and show up in all but 1 of the 135 individual collective-risk games, consistently act as extortioners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their steadfast strategies enhance the already-existing willingness of our fair players to contribute towards reaching the collective target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we compare extortionate to hypothetical non-extortionate selfish players, we concludewith more than just a hint of Machiavellian thinkingthat extortion benefits the prevention of dangerous climate change.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Experimental procedures', 'A total of 630 undergraduate students from the Universities of Bonn, Hamburg, Göttingen, Kiel and Münster voluntarily participated in 45 experimental sessions with either 18 or 6 subjects each in a computerized experiment (for example, ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subjects were separated by opaque partitions and each had a computer, on which they received the instructions for the experiment and with which they communicated their decisions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Throughout the whole experiment, subjects were anonymous, and they made their decisions under a neutral pseudonym.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'There are three treatments (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each treatment, we had 15 groups of subjects interacting in a variant of the collective-risk social dilemma game14: subjects received an initial endowment, and they were asked, in each of 10 rounds, to contribute money from this endowment into a climate account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the end of round 10, the game software checked whether total contributions of all group members matched (or exceeded) a previously specified target sum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If that was the case, subjects received their remaining endowment in cash (in a way that maintained the subjects anonymity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the collective target was not reached, subjects lost their remaining endowment with 90% probability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each game was repeated twice, such that every group played three games with all players keeping their pseudonyms (each time with a new endowment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the 6-players and the 18-players treatments, groups consisted of 6 and 18 subjects, respectively, and each subject had an initial endowment of 40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each round, subjects could choose whether to contribute 0, 2 or 4 to the climate account, and the decisions of all subjects were shown to all subjects after each round.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The target was reached if on average subjects contributed half their endowment (the target sum was 120 in the 6-players treatment, and it was 360 in the 18-players treatment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the 6-representatives treatment, groups of 18 subjects were sub-divided in 6 countries of 3 players.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For game 1, the computer randomly determined six representatives, one from each country.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only the representatives were able to contribute money to the groups climate account: they had 3 times 40 at their disposal, for investing 0, 6 or 12 in each of 10 rounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decisions of all representatives were shown to all 18 subjects after each round.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The target was to collect at least 360 in donations (60 per representative or 20 per subject).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the target was reached, subjects received a third of their countrys remaining endowment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'After games 1 and 2, the three subjects of each country could re-elect the previous representative or vote her out and elect a different member of their country with a majority vote.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Except for the first four groups of this treatment, subjects could compose both after game 1 and game 2 election pledges of up to 500 characters on their laptop that could be seen only by the 3 subjects of a country.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pledges described how the person would decide if elected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have blindly classified all pledges; those that promise to contribute less than the others, or less than the fair share have been classified as selfish and the others as fair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When making the voting decision, each subject knew the observed decisions of her previous representative and those of the other representatives, and saw the three election pledges within her country (each with the respective pseudonym and a button for voting).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cases with no majority vote, the computer decided randomly for the next representative (in 9% of cases).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Subjects knew that the total sum of money in the climate account, accumulated from all participating groups, would be used to publish a press advertisement on climate protection in a daily German newspaper simultaneously with the publication of the present study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, they received the little information version from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32 to explain the climate account, so that we could expect very weak motivation to invest in publishing the advertisement per se.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Theoretical model', 'Press and Dyson24 describe a class of so-called ZD strategies for the repeated prisoners dilemma, and they demonstrate that a subset of ZD strategies can be used to extort opponents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the collective-risk dilemma game used in our experiment is not a repeated two-player game.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, we thus extend the theory of ZD strategies to collective-risk dilemmas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an application, we show the existence of extortionate strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such strategies ensure that (i) a player gets at least the average payoff of the co-players; (ii) the collective best reply for the remaining group members is to reach the target; and (iii) the properties (i) and (ii) hold in any game the player participates in.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To this end, we consider a group of N individuals, with each group member having an initial endowment of E. The group engages in a collective-risk dilemma12: in each of R rounds, players can decide how much they want to contribute towards a common pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We denote player is contribution in round r by xi(r), and we assume that the minimum contribution per round is 0, whereas the maximum contribution is xmax=E/R.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To calculate the total contributions xi of player i, we sum up over all rounds, xi=xi(r).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The groups total contributions x are obtained by summing up over all individual contributions, x=xi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Payoffs for the collective-risk dilemma are defined as follows: if total contributions after round R exceed a threshold T, then all players receive their remaining endowment; that is, if xT, then player is expected payoff is Exi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Otherwise, if total contributions are below the threshold, all players risk losing their remaining endowment with some probability p greater than 0, and player is expected payoff becomes (1p) (Exi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementary Table 1 gives a summary of all used variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the experiment, players had to choose between three possible contribution levels in a given round, but for the model we assume for simplicity that players can contribute any amount xi(r)0, xmax.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the definition of ZD strategies given below can be extended to the case of discrete contribution levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To achieve an arbitrary contribution level y0, xmax, player i would need to randomize between the given discrete contribution levels such that the expected value satisfies Exi(r)=y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to Tit-for-Tat-like strategies in the Prisoners Dilemma, we define ZD strategies in the collective-risk dilemma as behaviours that condition their contribution in the next round on the co-players contributions in the previous round:', 'Definition (ZD strategies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Player i applies a ZD strategy for the collective-risk dilemma if is contributions xi(r) in every round r satisfy', '', 'where xi(r1) is the average contribution of the other group members in the previous round, with xi(0):=0, and s and  are parameters that can be chosen by player i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The parameter s is a measure for how a player reacts to the co-players contributions of the previous round.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parameter , on the other hand, determines a players baseline contribution level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two parameters cannot be chosen arbitrarilysince player is contribution needs to be in the interval 0, E/R, the two parameters need to satisfy', '', 'It is the following property that makes ZD strategies interesting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Proposition 1 (properties of ZD strategies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Suppose player i applies a ZD strategy with parameters s and .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', '1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If xi denotes the total contributions of player i, and if xi denotes the average total contribution of is co-players, then', '', '2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, if i and i denote the corresponding realized payoffs, then payoffs either satisfy i=i=0 (if the group fails to reach the threshold and dangerous climate change occurs), or', '', '
Proof
', '1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By summing up Equation (3) over all rounds 1rR, we obtain', '', 'As a consequence,', '', '2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In case players do not lose their remaining endowment, Equation (6) follows directly from Equation (5) because i=Exi and i=Exi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For a collective-risk dilemma with sufficiently many rounds R, Proposition 1 thus implies that xisxi+(1s)E.
