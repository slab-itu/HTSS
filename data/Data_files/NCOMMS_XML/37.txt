Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Was non-avian dinosaur physiology similar to modern reptiles, which are ectotherms having body temperatures controlled by exchange of heat with the environment, or to modern endotherms such as mammals and birds that maintain high and stable body temperatures through metabolic heat production and strict thermoregulation1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Endotherms are organisms that utilize internally generated heat to maintain their body at metabolically favourable temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ectotherms are organisms that have small or negligible internal heat production and rely on heat from the environment to reach metabolically favourable body temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, did some non-avian dinosaurs have physiological states intermediate between ectotherms and modern birds, conditions that have been termed basoendothermy or mesothermy10,11 and have similarities to extant species such as lamnid sharks and monotremes11?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Basoendothermy has been defined as an endotherm with a body temperature of  less_than 35 °C (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mesotherms have been described as organisms that rely on metabolic heat to raise their body temperatures above ambient temperature, but that do not defend a thermal set point as do endotherms11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An intermediate thermophysiology has also been hypothesized for basal, pre-modern birds12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Body temperatures are not an unambiguous determinate of physiology as, for example, animals with low metabolic rate can have elevated body temperature as a result of high body mass and increased capacity to retain heat; a feature that is sometimes termed gigantothermy, as seen in extant species such as leatherback turtles14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even within endotherms a wide range of physiological states exists, which can be reflected in body temperature10,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mesothermy in dinosaurs is supported by a recent theoretical study11 and highlights that the debate on dinosaur thermophysiology is not a question of a simple warm-blooded versus cold-blooded dichotomy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these complexities, body temperature determinations for extinct species place new constraints on physiology that were not previously possible, and allow us to test the predictions made by physiological models and growth rate analysis17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we constrain the body temperatures of extinct vertebrates from the analysis of proportions of multiply-substituted (13C18O-bearing; clumped) carbonate in fossil eggshells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis of abundances of multiply-substituted, 13C18O-bearing molecules in carbonates is an emerging approach to constrain mineral formation temperatures19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eggshells mineralize in the lower oviduct and so their isotopic composition should reflect body core temperatures of females during ovulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In practice, the parameter measured is the 47 value, which refers to the abundance of mass-47 CO2 (13C18O16O) in gas liberated by phosphoric acid digestion of carbonates compared with the abundance in reference gases of known isotopic composition CO2 (refs 20, 21, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously shown that 47 measurements on CO2 derived from carbonate moieties in biogenic phosphate minerals are correlated with the body temperature of the host animal16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is possible to reconstruct the body temperature of extinct vertebrates based on the measurement of isotopic ordering in fossil tooth enamel, but less reliably in the more readily diagenetically altered bone and tooth dentin17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CaCO3 eggshells are another target for body temperature reconstructions and potentially allow determinations of body core temperatures in animals where enough well-preserved bioapatite material is not available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the stable isotope composition of eggshells may also record information on the environments in which an animal lived and their diet23,24,25.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Clumped isotope data for modern eggshells', 'Measurements were carried out on a suite of modern calcite and aragonite eggshells comprising specimens from 13 different bird species and 9 reptiles to establish the ability of 47 measurements to distinguish between the body temperature of known endothermic and ectothermic animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data are presented in Table 1 and Fig 1 show that this is clearly achievable, with 47-derived temperatures from bird and reptile eggshells mirroring known body temperature differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In reptiles with small fluctuations in body temperature (for example, Galapagos tortoise), we also find that the average body temperature of the organism is accurately recorded by the eggshell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In organisms such as crocodilians that can exhibit more variability in body temperatures, we assumed ovulation occurred during the warm season given what is reported for survivorship of hatchlings in crocodilians and some other reptiles (Supplementary Tables 1, 5 and 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A caveat is that reptile body temperatures fluctuate daily and also vary depending on size and environment and thus the timing and temperature of eggshell mineralization may not be well constrained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, 47 temperature determinations for reptiles are plausible average body temperatures for adults based on instrumental measurements (Table 1; Supplementary Table 1; Fig 1) and are clearly resolved from isotopic temperatures derived from bird eggshells (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eggshells from smaller bird species known to have elevated metabolic rates and body temperatures also yield higher 47-derived temperatures compared with large flightless birds that tend to have lower body temperatures (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Stable isotope data from modern eggshells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are compared with published calibrations in Fig 1.Full size table', 'Figure 1: 47 measurements in modern eggshells.Data from modern bird and ectotherm eggshells are plotted against published inorganic calcite calibrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are given in Table 1 and temperature calibrations in Supplemental Note 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By convention temperature is plotted as 106/T2 (T in Kelvin) on the x axis, but we indicate T in °C at the top of the plot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Linear regressions on the absolute reference frame were calculated as described previously28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eggshell data and linear regression match more closely with the calibrations produced in the Caltech of Ghosh et al.19, and the Caltech all biogenics calibration of Eagle et al.26, than with that of Tang et al.41 (Supplemental Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slope of the regression through eggshell data is described as: 47=0.0493±0.0043 (106 T2)+0.1393±0.0447.Full size image', 'The application of a range of different temperature calibrations to modern eggshells produces results that match well with instrumental data on body temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the calibration of Ghosh et al.19, the eggshell 47-derived temperatures ranging from 37 to 45 °C for different bird species are similar to directly determined bird body temperatures of 3843 °C (Table 1; Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar values of 3645 °C are obtained using a calibration derived from a compilation of data generated from various biogenic carbonates in the Caltech lab (Table 1; Supplementary Note 2)26, as well as other calibrations as described in the Supplementary Note 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We show in Fig 1 and Supplementary Note 2 that the slopes of a regression through the eggshell data cannot be statistically distinguished from both the inorganic calcite calibration and biogenic data compilation generated at Caltech19,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For completeness, 47-based temperatures are estimated using four different calibrations (Supplementary Tables 13), although in the main text and figures we favour application of the Caltech biogenic calibration because it is based on the largest data set and therefore has lower uncertainty26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While it would be possible to use the eggshell-specific calibration, it is less data-rich and has uncertainties associated with not knowing precisely the expected body temperatures at which ectotherms mineralize their eggshells, and as a result is less constrained than the Caltech biogenic calibration (Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Preservation of fossil eggshells', 'Fossil eggshells likely have a higher potential for preservation than dentin and bone; high porosity, small crystal sizes and high protein and water contents (c. 50%) in the latter two materials/tissues tend to lead to massive recrystallization and isotopic resetting during fossilization27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This contrasts with the rigid CaCO3-dominated eggshells that many organisms produce.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, chicken eggshells are 9597% CaCO3 and therefore comprise much lower levels of organic matter than bone and dentin28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As geochemical preservation represents a key uncertainty in our analysis, here we have taken the approach of extensively characterizing each specimen using a hierarchy of approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, a comparative analysis of the stable isotope and trace-element composition of the eggshell and associated carbonates, including diagenetically altered bone and authigenically formed spar calcite, is used with the reasoning that unaltered primary eggshells will usually be different in composition from coexisiting carbonates from other origins (Fig 2; Supplementary Figs 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we examined thin sections of specimens using transmitted light microscopy and eggshell fragments using scanning electron microscopy to confirm the retention of primary growth textures and to look for diagenetic features (Fig 3; Supplementary Note 3; Supplementary Figs 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also carried out electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis to examine specimens for changes in calcite crystallographic orientation associated with eggshell recrystallization (Figs 4, 5; Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Examples of isotopic and trace-element data used to assess preservation.Supplementary Tables 13 contain raw data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional data plots are given in Supplementary Figs 46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) Data from Mongolian samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Illustration of the large offset between the calculated water 18O for three apparently well-preserved eggshells from Ukhaa Tolgod, and nodular and spar carbonates recovered from the same strata.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two other eggshells from Ukhaa Tolgod do not show this offset and so were considered of poor preservation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed description of the other Mongolian eggshell types and their preservation can be found in the main text and Supplementary Notes 1 and 3, but all were considered of uncertain preservation due to either petrographic analysis or the fact that they were from a different site and so the comparison between them and other carbonate phases was not possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c,d) Data from Auca Mahuevo samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  47 temperatures are noticeably higher for layer-2 specimens, compared with layer-4 specimens; layer-2 specimens are also higher in contents of elements such as lithium and magnesium which, in addition to petrographic and scanning electron microscopy analysis, lead to us considering layer-4 specimens to be better preserved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e,f) Data from Provence Basin samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eggshells from the Rousset locality, stratigraphic layer A, are notably distinct in both carbonate 18O (not shown) and calculated 18O of mineral formation water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rousset A eggshells are also comparatively enriched in strontium, but lower in lithium compared with eggshells from other stratigraphic layers and eggshells and soil carbonate nodules from the nearby Roques Hautes site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rousset A are distinct geochemically and eggshells were found to be most altered by EBSD analysis (Fig 5;

Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EBSD analysis showed no evidence for recrystallization of these specimens and also showed the preferred crystallographic orientation of the calcite c axis is present, but it did suggest some deformation of calcite crystals, possibly due to compression of the eggshells on burial (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not clearly known what impact this type of crystal deformation could have on clumped isotope signatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this feature is widespread in the oviraptorid eggshells examined here, measured clumped isotope values do not show evidence for extensive bond reordering, which would be expected to yield significantly lower 47 values than would be compatible with plausible body temperatures and the values measured (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we continued to consider these specimens apparently well preserved, with the caveat that the impact of compression is not fully understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of eggshells from the Djadokhta Formation at Ukhaa Tolgod are geochemically distinct from abiogenic nodular carbonates, bone and spar calcites recovered from the same site, indicating that pervasive diagenesis of carbonates had not occurred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two eggshells from Ukhaa Tolgod were considered poorly preserved, as their isotopic composition approached that of known diagenetic phases such as sparry calcites and altered bone (Supplementary Table 3; Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ukhaa Tolgod morphotype 2 eggshells were considered of uncertain preservation, as petrographic analysis suggested that they had areas of dissolution in the main eggshell structure that was much more extensive than in the oviraptorid specimens from the same site, but geochemically they were also distinct from diagenetic phases (Fig 2; Supplementary Fig 1; Supplementary Note 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four specimens from the Bayn Dzak and Bugin Tsav localities were considered of uncertain preservation as they had similar isotopic composition as diagenetic phases from Ukhaa Tolgod, although we note that, as they are from a different locality, this comparison may be less instructive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that primary and diagenetic carbonate phases could be fortuitously similar to one another in composition, and therefore our approach to excluding data is a conservative one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Auca Mahuevo titanosaurid specimens from different stratigraphic horizons are variably preserved based on geochemical, petrographic and EBSD analysis (Figs 2, 3, 4;

Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eggshell specimens from Roques Hautes in the Provence Basin are considered to be of poor preservation as microcharacterization showed evidence for secondary carbonate infilling of pore canals, and geochemically the eggshells had similar composition to contemporaneous soil carbonate nodules (Fig 2;

Supplementary Figs 3 and 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is an indication that eggshells from these strata are variably preserved and may even have areas of better and worse preservation within the same individual specimen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, we considered these specimens of uncertain preservation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One clear finding from our study is that eggshell specimens from different stratigraphic layers of the same formation can show very different states of preservation, and that variability can also exist within a stratigraphic layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full justifications of our assessment of the preservation of each specimen including geochemical data and representative petrographic and scanning electron microscopy images can be found in Supplementary Note 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Body temperature determinations from fossil eggshells', 'The apparently well-preserved Mongolian oviraptorid eggshells yield 47-derived temperatures of 31.9±2.9 °C (2 s.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), and the Auca Mahuevo layer-4 titanosaur eggshells yield temperatures of 37.6±1.9 °C (Table 2), supporting differing thermoregulation between these species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rousset level-BD specimens yielded 47 temperatures of 39.6±1.4 °C (Table 2) and so also supporting high body temperatures for some dinosaurs, although these data should be regarded as less reliable than data from Auca Mahuevo layer-4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, our confidence in the finding of relatively high body temperatures in sauropod dinosaurs is increased by their close agreement with previous results of carbonate-clumped isotope thermometry of sauropod teeth18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Geochemical data for soil carbonates, poorly preserved eggshells and known diagenetic phases (altered bone and spar calcites) are also presented for comparison (Fig 2;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have shown that when applied to eggshells, carbonate clumped isotope paleothermometry can be used to reconstruct body temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While uncertainties regarding preservation of clumped isotopic signals in fossil eggshells remain, through a hierarchy of approaches we identify a number of dinosaur eggshell specimens that we have no reason to reject as being altered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below we discuss the compatibility of 47 temperatures from the apparently well-preserved specimens with other data and with previous inferences on the nature of non-avian dinosaur physiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The comparison between oviraptorid eggshell 47 temperatures and those measured from contemporaneous nodular carbonates recovered from the same strata is important (31.9 versus 26.3 °C respectively; Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  47 temperatures from nodular paleosol carbonates have been shown to reflect warm month average temperatures34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the 6 °C higher temperatures derived from eggshells compared with nodular carbonates at Uhkaa Tolgod likely indicates that the oviraptorid dinosaurs were able to elevate body temperatures above environmental temperatures even when considering the warmest time of year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interpretation would be supported even if partial alteration of 13C18O signatures had influenced the absolute value of the oviraptorid body temperature determinations, because measurements on spar calcite and nodular carbonates from this site suggests that if diagenesis of oviraptorid eggshells had occurred it would likely have driven 47 temperatures towards colder values, not hotter (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'High body temperatures for large sauropod dinosaurs found here and in a previous study of sauropod teeth18 could be a result of endothermy comparable to large extant mammals and birds, but could also reflect gigantothermy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding in this study of lower temperatures in oviraptorid eggshells extends the range of inferred body temperatures in dinosaurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our oviraptorid data coupled with the sauropod data suggest that non-avian dinosaurs could be significantly variable in their thermoregulation and did all not have uniformly high (3643 °C) body temperatures as modern birds do (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are potentially consistent with a relationship between dinosaur body mass and body temperature, but if such a relationship exists it would need more data to accurately constrain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless, the fact that oviraptorid dinosaurs apparently could maintain body temperatures above those of the environment suggests that either they were ectotherms having thermoregulatory behaviours or other adaptations such as insulation, or that they had a metabolism and thermal physiology intermediate between ectotherms and extant birds (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional evidence supporting an intermediate physiology includes analysis of growth rates and sexual maturation in oviraptorids, which showed that sexual maturation occurred well before adult size was reacheda feature that is shared with reptiles and basal pre-modern birds12,13, but not extant birds35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, recent theoretical work based on growth rate analysis has provided evidence for mesothermy in a range of

comparison with extant species and that full endothermic homoeothermy evolved later and after the evolution of feathers and flight12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our novel data therefore provide independent evidence to support inferences from histology and physiological modelling that some dinosaurs were not fully endothermic as are modern birds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we cannot extrapolate how representative oviraptorid body temperatures are of theropods, or non-avian dinosaurs more broadly, at least in this one case our data combined with published growth rate analyses35 are consistent

temperature is accurately recorded by the eggshell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In organisms such as crocodilians that are from environments with more variability in body temperatures, we used warm season temperatures given what is reported for survivorship in crocodilians and some other reptiles: extremely high mortality rates in hatchlings of up to 100% are reported when environmental or incubation temperatures are below 27 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus crocodilian body temperatures associated with eggshell formation are likely to reflect warm season conditions and not growth during winter in

studied here appear to be equivalent to the majority of biogenic material studied to date in the Caltech lab (Fig 1) and suggest that alternative calibrations with shallower slopes (Supplementary Note
