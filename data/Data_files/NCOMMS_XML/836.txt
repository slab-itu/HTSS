Extreme oceanographic forcing and coastal response due to the 20152016 El Niño  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The El Niño-Southern Oscillation is the dominant mode of interannual climate variability across the Pacific Ocean basin, with influence on the global climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two end members of the cycle, El Niño and La Niña, force anomalous oceanographic conditions and coastal response along the Pacific margin, exposing many heavily populated regions to increased coastal flooding and erosion hazards.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a quantitative record of coastal impacts is spatially limited and temporally restricted to only the most recent events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report on the oceanographic forcing and coastal response of the 20152016 El Niño, one of the strongest of the last 145 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that winter wave energy equalled or exceeded measured historical maxima across the US West Coast, corresponding to anomalously large beach erosion across the region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shorelines in many areas retreated beyond previously measured landward extremes, particularly along the sediment-starved California coast.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) explains much of the interannual variability in sea surface temperature, sea-level pressure and atmospheric forcing across the equatorial Pacific, affecting global climate patterns1 and economies2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, global economic losses associated with the extreme El Niño of 19821983 have been estimated at over US$11.5 billion3 (in 2016 dollars), including significant losses along the coast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extremes of ENSO oscillations, El Niño and La Niña, have been linked to elevated coastal hazards, particularly during boreal winter (December-February) for the Eastern North Pacific (for example, Hawaii, California and the Pacific Northwest (that is, Oregon and Washington4,5) and Southwestern Pacific (for example, New Zealand6 and Australia7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  El Niño events have also been associated with hazardous coastal conditions in Japan during the boreal fall8, greater frequency of tropical cyclone development in the Eastern Pacific9 and rotational shifts of embayed beaches in Australia10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With seasonally elevated water levels, higher wave energy and southerly wave directional shifts common during El Niño, the North American west coast has historically experienced severe coastal erosion during El Niño winters, as reported during the 19821983, 19971998 and 20092010 events4,5,12,13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By various metrics, the 20152016 El Niño winter was one of the three strongest events in the historical record17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in the boreal winter of 20152016 the Oceanic Niño Index, a 3-month running mean of sea surface temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific18, reached the highest value in its 66-year history (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on a reconstruction that dates back to 1871 for the multivariate ENSO index19, a comprehensive assessment of conditions in the tropical Pacific Ocean20which is significantly correlated with wave energy flux across the Eastern North Pacific5the 20152016 winter was only exceeded by the similarly powerful El Niño events of 19821983 and 19971998 (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a detailed record of coupled oceanographic forcing (that is, waves and water levels) and coastal response during these powerful events is limited primarily to anecdotal reports for the 19821983 event13, and a few discrete published data sets from the winter of 19971998 (refs 12, 14, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, climate change projections suggest a possible increase in the frequency of extreme El Niño and La Niña events22,23, which would affect coastal communities across the entire Pacific Basin margin5, making it critical to document the forcing and response of historically strong events as a possible proxy for future coastal vulnerability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Historical time series of two ENSO indexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) from 1950 to

the US West Coast, focusing on the response of 29 beaches along the California, Oregon and Washington coasts, fronting a population of 25 million.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The region experienced substantial

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#

CA, Southern California).Full size image', 'Averaged across the six regions of the US West Coast, the winter shoreline retreat of 20152016 was the highest on record, with erosion 76% above the normal winter shoreline retreat, 27% higher than any other winter and easily eclipsing the El Niños of 20092010 (+12%) and 19971998 (9%) (Fig 4b; Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the regionally averaged scale, every region except for Central California experienced the highest seasonal shoreline retreat ever measured, and beaches in Central and North-central California recorded the most landward/eroded shoreline positions ever measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it should be noted that the full extent of erosion during the comparably powerful 19971998 event probably was not recorded due to two important factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, topographic survey coverage in 19971998 was not as spatially extensive as in more recent years, with some of the sections of coastline anecdotally most impacted (for example, California) having particularly poor or spotty coverage, or none at all.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the Lidar survey utilized to establish the post-El Niño shoreline for many of the California study sites was not collected until April 1998, when beaches were already rapidly recovering, aided by the greater availability of river-supplied sediments from the anomalously high rainfall that winter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was not the case in 20152016 for watersheds adjacent to the California sites where rainfall was significantly below average compared with a typical winter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In recent years, surveys were more frequent throughout the year and/or were conducted during beach minima conditions in the winter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the coastal erosion of 20152016 pushed many beach shorelines beyond recorded historical extremes, including 11 of the 18 beaches surveyed in California.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, a near-daily time series of sand levels from a site in Central California, shown to significantly represent beach behaviour across that region30, reached a 23-year minimum during the 20152016 winter, with only marginal recovery through September 2016, which still represented a record low seasonal value (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shoreline retreat recorded in 20152016 represents a fourfold increase over the prior, mild wave energy winter of 20142015 in Southern California, a fivefold increase over the prior winter in Central California, a threefold increase in North-central California and a twofold increase in Northern California and Washington (that is, the Columbia River littoral cell, which includes a beach in northernmost Oregon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seasonal erosion on Oregon beaches exceeded 20142015 levels by a factor of 1.3.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'During the winter of 20152016, highly elevated winter wave energy flux (50% above normal), coupled with seasonally elevated water levels (+11 cm), drove unprecedented levels of winter shoreline retreat (76% above normal), including the most landward shoreline positions measured for the majority of beaches in California since topographic data collection began 20 years ago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The historical significance of this El Niño can be determined by analysing the relatively consistent record of wave energy, water levels and beach behaviour across the study area (available since 1997), and buoy records that date back to the mid-1970s4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These historical records, with wave hindcasts that stretch back to the mid-20th century31,32, and ENSO index time series that date back to 1871 (refs 17, 18, 19) together suggest the 20152016 El Niño was one of the most powerful in the past 145 years, similar to 19821983 and 19971998.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The primary difference in wave energy flux between the most powerful El Niño events of the past two decades (that is, 19971998 and 20152016) appears related to a latitudinal shift in the primary storm tracks and resulting wave generation location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elevated wave energy flux during the winter of 20152016 exceeded the 19971998 event by 29% in Northern California and the Pacific Northwest, including a 44% increase off the coast of Washington.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, higher mean (+37%) and elevated wave energy (+27%) was measured during 19971998 for Central and Southern California compared to the 20152016 winter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distinct northerly wave direction anomaly and the smaller elevated wave energy flux anomaly in Southern California during 20152016 relative to 19971998 are likely related to storm tracks taking a more southerly route during the 19971998 El Niño33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 20152016, a coincident decrease in precipitation for Southern California compared with Northern California34 was the result of a northerly shift in storm tracks relative to 19971998.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A northerly shift in storm tracks during the El Niño of 19971998 compared with 19821983 is suggested by precipitation records across California34 as well as reports of significant flooding and coastal erosion13,35, indicating more pronounced impacts from local storms in Southern California during the 19821983 winter relative to 19971998.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This evidence of a progressive northerly migration of storm tracks during El Niño winters along the US West coast is consistent with the observed multi-decadal trend of poleward Hadley cell expansion and, therefore, the location of the sub-tropical jet stream36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measured multi-decadal increases in wave heights for the Pacific Northwest relative to California4,37,38,39 is evidence of this broader trend, as is the predicted poleward migration of storm tracks and correlative northerly shift in the focus of extreme wave impacts along the west coast of North America noted in global wave modelling projections for the 21st century40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While projections of El Niño frequency and magnitude for the 21st century are variable42,43, one recent study suggests a potential doubling of extreme El Niños22, similar to the strength of the 20152016 event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a trend would result in more significant hazards risk to coastal communities, which would be compounded by anticipated sea-level rise44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to providing insight into possible future conditions when extreme El Niños are more frequent, the 20152016 El Niño winter may have disrupted the dynamic equilibrium of many US West Coast beaches for years to come, much like the highly anomalous wave activity and coastal response along the Atlantic coast of Europe during the winter of 20132014, the most energetic since at least 1948 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although erosive conditions were clearly amplified in 20152016, large landward shifts in shoreline positions did not translate to pervasively severe erosion of the dunes and bluffs that back the beaches in the Pacific Northwest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is likely due to the fact that these beaches have generally been accreting since the previous 20092010 El Niño, and were in a significantly prograded state in summer 2015 due to the previous two mild winters (Figs 3a and 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, increased beach sand volumes moderated the landward erosion resulting from increased wave energy and water levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, recent nourishments along several beaches in Southern California also prevented shoreline retreat from reaching landward extremes during the winter of 20152016, thereby providing more storm protection for dunes and adjacent coastal infrastructure46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on this recent behaviour, such naturally or artificially sediment-rich coastal settings are likely to be more resilient to future storm impacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The potential for even more extreme coastal erosion during the 20152016 El Niño was also moderated by the earlier onset of peak annual high tides and the seasonal water-level anomaly associated with El Niño.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fall 2015 peaks in California, for example, were significantly earlier than the winter peaks that occurred during the El Niños of 19821983 and 19971998, thereby reducing the probability for the coincident arrival of the largest waves and water levels during the 20152016 event47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While natural or artificial increases in beach volumes may reduce erosion-related hazard risk during extreme El Niños at some beaches, hazard risk on many US West Coast beaches may be worsened by historical and possible future reductions in watershed sediment supply to beaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even with major reductions in the coastal sediment supply due to dam construction, which has reduced pre-historical riverine sediment supply by 50% in Southern California48 and by 80% down the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest49, coastal watersheds remain an important source of sand for many US West Coast beaches50,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, 21st century climate projections clearly suggest a significantly warmer climate for California, coupled with precipitation changes that range from negligible to a 26% reduction, with the most severe potential temperature increases and precipitation decreases tied to the upper end emissions scenarios52,53, mirroring current trajectories54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along with the historical trend of declining sediment supply, these 21st century climate projections would promote less runoff and reduced fluvial discharge rates55, likely further reducing the coastal sediment supply.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the risk of extended drought in the Southwest United States is expected to increase significantly in the coming decades56, which, if punctuated by the predicted more frequent extreme El Niño events22, could increase coastal hazard threats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduced fluvial discharge would cause sand supply to beaches to be particularly depleted in the years leading up to these energetic winters, and the resulting narrower pre-El Niño beaches would provide even less protection than normal from increased El Niño wave attack.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In California, the 20152016 El Niño serves as proxy for this potential trend: a multi-year drought57 limiting the coastal sediment supply, followed by an extreme El Niño event with accompanying elevated waves and water levels that severely eroded beaches across the region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 20152016 El Niño impacts were particularly acute in Southern and Central California due to the preceding drought combined with unusually low (50% below normal) winter precipitation34,58, which not only heightened coastal erosion but is also limiting subsequent beach recovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenomena is clearly observed in the sand height time series from Central California (Fig 4c), which shows a sharp decrease coincident with the onset of the drought in 2013, followed by record low sand heights in response to the 20152016 El Niño event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Record low sand levels have persisted in this location through September 2016.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More modest impacts to sediment supply coupled with mild wave energy winters preceding the event resulted in Pacific Northwest beaches being relatively resilient to the 20152016 El Niño.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Water levels anomalies of 717 cm above normal were measured across the US West Coast during the El Niño winter of 20152016, similar to anticipated global mean sea-level increases expected within the next few decades44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the 20152016 El Niño also provides an indication of future background coastal water-level conditions and the associated beach hazards that will become more common during typical winters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The added potential for severe flooding and erosion will be compounded during El Niño winters with higher wave energy and seasonally elevated water levels, posing increasing threats to coastal populations across the US West Coast and beyond.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
