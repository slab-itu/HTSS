Bacteria increase arid-land soil surface temperature through the production of sunscreens  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Soil surface temperature, an important driver of terrestrial biogeochemical processes, depends strongly on soil albedo, which can be significantly modified by factors such as plant cover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In sparsely vegetated lands, the soil surface can be colonized by photosynthetic microbes that build biocrust communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use concurrent physical, biochemical and microbiological analyses to show that mature biocrusts can increase surface soil temperature by as much as 10 °C through the accumulation of large quantities of a secondary metabolite, the microbial sunscreen scytonemin, produced by a group of late-successional cyanobacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scytonemin accumulation decreases soil albedo significantly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such localized warming has apparent and immediate consequences for the soil microbiome, inducing the replacement of thermosensitive bacterial species with more thermotolerant forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results reveal that not only vegetation but also microorganisms are a factor in modifying terrestrial albedo, potentially impacting biosphere feedbacks on past and future climate, and call for a direct assessment of such effects at larger scales.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Surface soil temperatures are a function of the downwelling electromagnetic radiation and of the albedo (reflectivity) of the soil surface1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surface temperature is known to influence a variety of ecological and biogeochemical soil processes, from plant germination and microbial activity, to evapotranspiration and gas emissions1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In temperate climates, biological factors such as plant cover, do in turn modify the albedo, thus influencing local temperatures3,4, but plant effects are of little relevance in arid lands, where vegetation cover is restricted or negligible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Much of the arid soil surfaces can be populated by cryptic photosynthetic assemblages known as biological soil crusts (or biocrusts)5,6, which are known to impart stability against erosion7, to modify the hydrological properties of soils8, and to contribute significantly to arid land fertility9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These communities also represent the major type of ecosystem on the continents before the advent of land plants in the Devonian10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When sufficiently developed, biocrusts can reduce the albedo of the soils they cover11, and in some instances their development has been linked to concurrent increases in soil surface temperature12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanism by which biocrusts decrease albedo, the extent of the phenomenon and the consequences on soil temperature and biological processes, if any, remain to be studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To explore these issues, we assessed soil surface temperature, pigment content and microbial composition in biocrusts of varying successional maturity, as they transitioned during development from early and largely cryptic, to mature and conspicuously dark, in a single site from the Colorado Plateau of North America.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that some cyanobacteria warm the soil surface by as much as 10 °C through the production of scytonemin, an alkaloid sunscreen pigment that strongly absorbs solar radiation and dissipates this energy as heat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This warming is not without consequences for the soil microbial communities, as the sunscreen-driven warming correlated with a replacement of the keystone heat-sensitive species Microcoleus vaginatus by the more heat-tolerant M.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  steenstrupii.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results and Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Ecological succession in biocrusts in these region starts with colonization by pioneer, soil-stabilizing, motile filamentous cyanobacteria15, and is followed by the eventual establishment of surface-bound, sessile heterocystous cyanobacteria16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the process, overall microbial biomass increases steadily, and eventually the surface darkens conspicuously16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used this progressive darkening to guide the collection of samples of different maturity from a single site, North of Moab, Utah.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a first sample set (Fig 1) we followed an apparent gradient of maturity that had developed with distance from a small wash (space for time) using repeated samples as replicates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were characterized post hoc with respect to major pigments (including chlorophyll a as a proxy of photosynthetic biomass), which increased across the gradient from very low concentrations corresponding to virtually uncrusted soils, to those that could be deemed as fully developed in comparison with published biocrust surveys18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also determined microbial biomass, and the biomass attributable to relevant microbial groups by absolute counts of relevant 16S rRNA gene copies (Supplementary Table 1 and Fig 1c) in this set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other sets of samples were selected to study temperature and albedo as a function of pigment content (Supplementary Table 2 and Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Characterization of cyanobacteria dominated biological soil crusts gradients of maturity (space for

flat, the conspicuous differences in albedo were likely due to the effect of microbial pigment accumulation rather than to particle size or surface roughness19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contribution of the latter may be of importance in later successional stages such as the more developed pinnacled dark biocrusts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Absorbance spectra of surface-bound bacterial biomass in the visible range (Fig 2a) indicated that the large majority of the pigments contributing to differential albedo were chlorophyll a, small amounts of carotenoids and the cyanobacterial sunscreen scytonemin20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No infrared (IR) absorbing pigments (like bacteriochlorophylls) were measurable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An integration of relative absorption over the visible wavelength range, showed that the sunscreen alkaloid scytonemin contributed most to absorption in mature samples, 6±0.8 (n=6) times more than chlorophyll a to visible photon absorption on the crust surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It seems clear that any albedo reductions associated with biocrust development are due largely to the accumulation of scytonemin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surface albedo is also influenced by the presence of microbially secreted exopolymeric substances, their removal results into a decreased albedo21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if the accumulation of exopolymeric substances with maturity increases the albedo, it plays against the trend described here, which in fact reinforces the hypothesis of scytonemin accumulation being the major force driving the observed albedo decrease with maturity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, measurements of the crust albedo under standard illumination conditions showed that it was predictably an inverse logarithmic function of scytonemin pigment content (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the various cyanobacteria that colonize biological soil crusts22, only the late-stage group of nitrogen-fixing, heterocystous cyanobacteria (in the order Nostocales) produce the compound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the abundance of scytonemin-producing Nostocales, based on the absolute copy number of 16S rRNA genes (Fig 1c), tracked the increase in scytonemin itself.

size image', 'In order to test the effects of scytonemin accumulation on biocrust temperature, we performed direct measurements on a subset of five selected samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These were exposed to natural autumnal sunlight around the brightest part of the day on a rooftop in Tempe (Arizona) (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Global visible radiation during those days peaked at 935 W m2, which corresponds to intensities reached at midday all year long in their original locality (National Solar Radiation Database).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed clear temperature differences among samples, with the hottest temperatures at any one time attained in the darker samples, and with maximal temperature differences between the two extremes of crust maturity reaching 10 °C around solar noon (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to receiving the same solar radiation flux, no significant differences in heat transfer between samples and the environment are likely among our samples, so we conclude that the observed temperature differences result from changes in albedo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As can be theoretically predicted if albedo drives the differences, the fourth power of the ratio between the temperatures attained by a given sample against that attained by a standard probe of fixed albedo should be a decreasing linear function of the samples albedo, and, thus, a saturating function of the concentration of the major absorber (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We included a temperature probe adjacent to the samples in Fig 3a as a standard, and show this relationship in Fig 3b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At low concentrations of scytonemin (that is,  greater than 50 mg m2) the relationship between pigment concentration and differential warming (Supplementary Fig 2) can be simplified to a linear relationship (which translates to an average temperature differential of 0.16 °C per mg of scytonemin per m2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However at scytonemin concentrations typical of the upper range in our survey (that is,  greater than 100 mg m2), warming reached a saturating effect, and further increases in pigment elicited a much reduced warming effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maximal biocrust concentrations of scytonemin reported from the literature and from our own surveys very rarely exceed 700 mg m2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of this, and because the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between sample and probe does not depend on downwelling light intensity, but only on albedo (see Methods), we do not expect that the soil warming effect by scytonemin relative to bare ground will exceed by much the values reported here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absolute temperatures reached by a biocrusted soil, however, will depend on overall heat transfer coefficients and ambient temperatures, so that biocrusts in low latitudes with already hot climates may potentially reach biologically deleterious temperatures, whereas for biocrusts in cold climates, that is, in polar settings or during winter months when activity is limited by temperature, the warming can be expected to be largely beneficial to biological entities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Soil surface

concentration was directly determined in each sample and used to arrive at albedo using the relationship in Fig 2.Full size image', 'A question that follows naturally from the previous findings is if the differential warming by sunscreen pigments we measured does in fact affect biological or biogeochemical processes in the crusts and soils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a recent contribution relating biological soil crusts community composition to temperature, it was shown that continental-scale temperature differentials (yearly averages) of smaller magnitude than those measured here (5 °C versus 10 °C, respectively) were sufficient to induce a clear biogeographic shift between two keystone biocrust microbes22, one type (M. vaginatus) being much more thermosensitive than the other (M. steenstrupii), whereas other environmental parameters failed to explain their biogeography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two organisms thus represent a form of biological sensor for an integrated response to warming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined changes in community structure along the gradient of maturity described in Fig 1 with deep 16S rRNA gene surveys using next-generation sequencing (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Focusing these analyses on the phototrophs (cyanobacteria and algae), we could in fact observe a clear replacement in the dominant cyanobacterial phylotypes, assignable to the motile, bundle forming, filamentous cyanobacteria15,23: M. vaginatus dominated in light, incipient crusts subject to the least differential warming, while M. steenstrupii became more abundant in the darker, more mature ones that reached maximal differential warming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As discussed previously15,22, M. vaginatus constitutes a very well defined monophyletic group and has a coherent, cold-loving phenotype, whereas, M. steenstrupii, which encompasses a much more diverse group of cyanobacteria (Supplementary Fig 3), is more thermotolerant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus soil warming due to microbial sunscreens, has an equivalent biological manifestation at the local (meter) scale as seen for climate variability at the continental scale22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Cyanobacterial

thermosensitive Microcoleus vaginatus by thermotolerant M. steenstrupii22 as dominant microbe coincides with the relative increase of sunscreen bearing cyanobacteria.Full size image', 'It is clear from these results that the role of microbes in soil warming and its potential for impact on species distributions and biogeochemical cycles should be considered in studies of arid and semi-arid systems at local and landscape scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arid lands where biocrusts feature prominently, cover 41% of the Earths land surface5; such crusts are thought to have dominated terrestrial ecosystems from much of the Proterozoic10, where the production of UVA suncreens such as scytonemin would have been of major fitness value after the oxygenation of the atmosphere24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these reasons, microbial effects on land surface albedo may have global scale repercussions historically and in the present, and should be evaluated in models of planetary radiation budgets as a new twist of biosphere-climate feedback interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may shed some light into the apparent inconsistency in temperature changes recorded in arid lands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to model predictions25, temperature has been shown to increase when removing vegetation there26,27, an apparent paradox that could potentially be explained by biocrust colonization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on estimates of the global biomass of cyanobacteria in soil biocrusts28, one can easily calculate that there must currently exist about 15 million metric tons of scytonemin at work, warming soil surfaces worldwide.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Site and sampling description', 'Biocrust samples were collected using petri dishes (6 cm diameter, 1 cm depth) in the Green Butte Site (38°4253.9N, 109°4134.6W, Moab, Utah, USA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were transported air-dry, and maintained in the dark under an atmosphere in equilibrium with LiCl desiccant until experimentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples belong to three different sets (M, T and A set) used for different assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subset M was sampled in July 2011 as a space-for-time maturity gradient in the field, with four replicate dishes taken at the same distance along the main axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three sets of biological replicates of the M series were used for the assessment of the microbial community using molecular methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each gradient level was sampled dry, then wetted and resampled twice over a period of 24 h. This was because microbes in biocrusts suffer a DNA damage while dry, but are able to repair their DNA in a few hours after wetting29, so we were expecting a better reading of the microbial community DNA upon wetting, but did not want to allow them to grow differentially by resampling later than 24 h. After bioinformatics data processing and taxonomic assignment of the 16S rDNA recovered, we tested the effect of the wet-up treatment on the cyanobacterial community structure; no significant effect was found through repeated measures analysis of variance (Supplementary Table 2), so we considered the nine DNA extracts within one gradient level as equivalent replicates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The last set of the M series was used to measure pigment content in the set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other two sets of samples (A and T) were collected in October 2012 and picked so that they would span roughly the same maturity gradient as the M series, according to their pigment concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A and T series were used to measure albedo and temperature effects, respectively, as a function of
