Genome sequence of the basal haplorrhine primate Tarsius syrichta reveals unusual insertions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Tarsiers are phylogenetically located between the most basal strepsirrhines and the most derived anthropoid primates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While they share morphological features with both groups, they also possess uncommon primate characteristics, rendering their evolutionary history somewhat obscure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the molecular basis of such attributes, we present here a new genome assembly of the Philippine tarsier (Tarsius syrichta), and provide extended analyses of the genome and detailed history of transposable element insertion events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We describe the silencing of Alu monomers on the lineage leading to anthropoids, and recognize an unexpected abundance of long terminal repeat-derived and LINE1-mobilized transposed elements (Tarsius interspersed elements; TINEs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the first time in mammals, we identify a complete mitochondrial genome insertion within the nuclear genome, then reveal tarsier-specific, positive gene selection and posit population size changes over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genomic resources and analyses presented here will aid efforts to more fully understand the ancient characteristics of primate genomes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Tarsiers are small nocturnal primates that were, together with their presumed sister family, the extinct Omomyidae, once widespread in Asia, Europe and North America, but today populate only insular Southeast Asia1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The family Tarsiidae contains at least ten extant species that are found in the Indonesian and Malaysian parts of Borneo, the Indonesian islands Sulawesi, Sumatra and Java as well as Greater Mindanao and surrounding islands of the southern Philippines3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Philippine tarsiers were recently ascribed the genus Carlito, while the tarsiers of Borneo, Sumatra and Java received the genus name Cephalopachus4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genus Tarsius was retained for the Sulawesian tarsiers and represents the most speciose of the three genera5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we adhere to the traditional designation Tarsius syrichta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Tarsiers occupy a key node in primate phylogeny between Strepsirrhini (for example, lemurs, lorises and galagos) and Anthropoidea (that is, monkeys and apes, including humans), and share morphological features with both groups1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, like strepsirrhines, tarsiers have an unfused mandibular symphysis, molar teeth with high cups, grooming claws, multiple nipples and a bicornuate uterus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, their postorbital closure, absence of a moist rhinarium, hemochorial placenta and retinal fovea are features shared with anthropoids1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, tarsiers are characterized by a number of features uncommon to primates, including dimensions of the craniofacial skeleton and exceptional anatomy associated with various sensory organs, and are the only extant primates lacking deciduous incisors, possibly due to genetic substitutions6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with all other mammals, tarsiers have the longest gestation period (178 days) relative to body size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Tarsiers possess the greatest number of chromosomes compared with other primates7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While there are no chromosome painting data available for tarsiers, Tarsiidae exhibit extensive inter-generic diversity in terms of chromosome number, given that members of Tarsius possess 46 chromosomes and members of Carlito and Cephalopachus possess 80 chromosomes4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their evolutionary history, as derived from both the fossil record and molecular characters, remained obscure, especially, as these characters supported all extremes of possible positions in the early divergence of primates: as the first split of primates8, in a close relationship to strepsirrhines (that is, prosimian monophyly)9, or in a closer relationship to anthropoids (that is, haplorrhine monophyly)10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Past molecular reconstructions mistakenly placed tarsiers on a common branch with strepsirrhines12, while most recent evidence supports haplorrhine monophyly, which places tarsiers as the sister taxon to anthropoids to the exclusion of all strepsirrhines10,11,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, unique molecular fossils (that is, mobile element insertions) from human and tarsier genomes demonstratedwithout conflictthe early Eocene activity of retroposons within the common ancestor of all haplorrhines14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dating posits that within Tarsiidae crown tarsiers shared their most recent common ancestor in the middle Miocene at the latest5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Tarsiers are arboreal primates characterized by large eyes and ears along with long hind legs adapted for vertical leaping15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These anatomical specializations allow tarsiers to effectively detect and pounce on prey items.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, as the worlds most carnivorous primates, tarsiers have extremely large hands and feet compared with their body size1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While tarsiers are generally insectivorous throughout their geographic range, some were observed feeding on lizards and small birds16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This dietary regime requires highly specialized optic and auditory adaptations for detecting insect motion and capturing cryptic prey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, tarsier eyes comprise a mass that is nearly twice the mass of their brain17, and the morphology of the skull reflects the modifications necessary to support a pair of hypertrophic eyes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to most nocturnal mammals, tarsiers lack a tapetum lucidum, and in contrast to most nocturnal primates, they possess dichromatic colour vision18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primary visual cortex (V1) of the tarsier brain occupies 21% of the neocortex19, the largest proportion among all primates, and this neural architecture is likely important for processing detailed vision in dim light20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the layered neural morphology of V1 displays a pronounced differentiation pattern that is most similar to that seen in diurnal callitrichids (for example, marmosets and tamarins), which also rely on insects as a primary nutritional resource21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distinctive pattern of V1 in tarsiers is in fact different from night monkeys, the only nocturnal anthropoids, and strepsirrhines, yet comparable to the pattern found in homologous brain regions of other visual predators, such as the optic tectum in birds16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we describe an improved genome assembly that highlights the distinguishing features of genome organization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Among primate genomes, an obvious novelty is the approximately one million primate-specific Alu retrotransposon insertions that are spread almost randomly over all chromosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These elements not only expanded the genomic space by  greater than 10%, but they also reshaped genomic structure, notably by influencing gene expression or by providing novel protein-coding cassette exons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are even responsible for various disease phenotypes due to insertion mutagenesis, splicing interference or recombination23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, most insertions and subsequent evolutionary changes were established after the earliest primate split of strepsirrhines, around 63 million years ago (Myr ago), which clearly predates the evolution of anthropoids, around 40 Myr ago24 (for dating see Goodman et al.10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With tarsiers emerging about 55 Myr ago, the formerly inaccessible period of 15 million years is now available for analysis with this improved genome assembly (for an alternative dating of primate divergences see Perelman et al.13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, since it provides the key to the most retrotranspositionally active time period in primate evolution, another goal was to better understand the mechanisms and frequencies of transposon insertion events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conjunction with the central phylogenetic position of tarsiers in the primate tree most of the critical changes in transposons took place around the divergence point of tarsiers on the lineage leading toand shaping the largest part ofthe human genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, a comparative and evolutionary assessment of the transposable element landscape, which comprises at least 44% of the tarsier genome, is central to our investigation, which we complement with analyses of another class of transferred sequences, namely mitochondrial nuclear insertions (numts).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our additional analyses of positive selection, especially for genes associated with the unique biology of tarsiers, as well as a derived historical analysis of the ancient effective population size of tarsiers, provides an impetus for using this updated tarsier genome to explore primate evolution and biology, including both shared and novel aspects within the human lineage.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Assembly', 'We sequenced a female tarsier to 44 × coverage using ABI3730 and Illumina technologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combined sequence reads were assembled using default parameter settings within MaSuRCA25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scaffold-level assembly, referred to as tarSyr2.0.1, is 3.4 Gb in size with an N50 contig and scaffold length of 38 kb and 401 kb, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This improved assembly is 13-fold greater in N50 contig length and adds 280 Mb of new sequence not found in the previous low coverage tarSyr1.0 version.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tarsier assembly contig metrics were comparable to previous non-human primate assemblies however, scaffold length is on the lower end of the observed range (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We predicted 20,820 protein-coding genes that, when aligned against a conserved eukaryotic gene set, demonstrated complete coverage for 97.6% (447/458) of core genes26 and alignments of predicted tarsier proteins to RefSeq proteins from other primate species (n=14,055) demonstrated an average coverage of 90% with an average identity of 82%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also provide annotation of the non-protein coding RNAs (npcRNAs), specifically snoRNAs and miRNAs (Supplementary Information; Supplementary Fig 1; Supplementary Data 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detected 223 snoRNAs (plus 150 isoforms/variants) in the tarsier genome based on the identification of human homologues27 (Supplementary Table 2; Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our list of expressed snoRNA and miRNAs show significant similarities to human, including the proximate mechanisms by which protein complexes are guided to specific positions in other RNA entities28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Putative alternative pathways of miRNA generation are also conserved between tarsier and human (Supplementary Table 3; Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, we contend the tarsier assembly is of sufficient quality to enable all analyses described in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Repeat elements', 'Three different strategies were used to examine the transposon landscape of the newly assembled tarsier genome: (1) a classical RepeatMasker analysis of the entire genome, (2) development and subsequent screen of a pairwise genome alignment of Homo sapiens/T.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  syrichta (hg19/tarSyr2.0.1) and (3) a transposition in transposition (TinT) analysis to delineate the relative activity periods of transposed elements over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This enabled us to differentiate between elements that were active before the branching of tarsiers (present in human and tarsier) and those that are tarsier-specific compared with anthropoid primates (active after branching point).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below we present an overall summary of repeat elements specific to the tarsier genome and discuss their emergence within an evolutionary framework (Table 1; see Supplementary Table 4 for family metrics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Repeat element landscape and selected pseudogenes of Tarsius syrichta (detailed landscape is presented in Supplementary Table 2).Full size table', 'To explore the Alu element history we sought to examine two key features of Alu SINE (short interspersed element) history; first, their enrichment within potential gene-rich (high GC-content) regions in an element age-dependent manner and second, their lineage-specific monomer and dimer element histories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While human LINEs (long interspersed elements) are strongly biased towards AT-rich regions, SINEs are typically found within GC-rich regions of the genome29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in human, Alu SINEs display an age-dependent accumulation in AT- or GC-rich regions; younger Alus are preferably located in AT-rich regions, while the older ones are slightly enriched within the more GC-rich parts of the genome29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the tarsier genome, and its comparison to human, we provide a distant reference point for age-dependent Alu insertions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we examined old ( greater than 30% divergent target site duplications (TSDs)) and young (identical TSDs) AluJ elements and calculated the relative GC-content within 50-kb windows surrounding each element, we observed a significant enrichment of young Alus within AT-richer regions compared with older Alus (F-statistics, P less_than 0.05; Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified the opposite distribution for young and old LINEs (F-statistics, P less_than 0.05), with the latter represented in more AT-rich regions (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we observed a significantly different distribution for Alus versus LINEs (F-statistics, P less_than 0.05), the latter were enriched in more AT-rich regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This tarsier result demonstrates a more general primate-wide phenomenon of Alu history29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that highly active Alu elements are selectively sorted out from the functional GC-rich areas of the genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: The Alu and DNA element histories of the main primate lineages.The key position of the tarsier between Strepsirrhini and Simiiformes (Anthropoidea) is depicted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA transposons (DNA; black line) and fossil left Alu monomers (FLAMs; orange line) were active at the origin of primates but became inactive sometime after tarsiers diverged from the anthropoid lineage, possibly during an intensive anthropoid population bottleneck.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alu elements were active in all primate lineages (red line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Young tarsier AluJ elements (with perfect target site duplicationsTSDs) show a preference for more AT-rich target sequences compared with older AluJ elements (with diverged TSDs), which accumulated in more GC-rich regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TINE elements evolved on the tarsier lineage (blue line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FLAMs (7,301) were detected on the tarsier branch and 6,324 FLAMs inserted in the common ancestor of anthropoids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Afterwards, the activity of FLAMs within anthropoid lineages was significantly reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only 367 elements were detected in the marmoset (Platyrrhini) and 595 elements were estimated for the lineages leading to human.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Drawings of animals are provided by Jon Baldur Hlioberg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Drawings for Tarsiiformes and Hominoidea have been reproduced from Hartig et al.14 with permission.Full size image', 'Given the ample evidence that the parallel activity of different Alu elements is restricted in time, it is likely that Alu dimers replaced monomeric elements during the early divergences of primates31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis, based on pairwise alignments (human/tarsierhg19/tarSyr2.0.1; human/marmosethg19/calJac3), revealed 7,301 tarsier-specific Alu monomers (especially Fossil Left Alu MonomersFLAMs) that were inserted in the lineage leading to tarsiers, compared with 6,324 that were fixed in the lineage leading to anthropoids and 595 within the subsequent lineage leading to human; yet, we detected only 367 New World monkey-specific monomers (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extreme reduction (by  greater than 90%) in the lineage-specific accumulation of monomeric Alus is difficult to explain by relatively rare cases of tailless retropseudogenes (internal priming of reverse transcription)32 or classical recombination processes33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that Alu monomers remained active after the divergence of tarsiers from the haplorrhine stem (Fig 1) and for a limited time on the lineage leading to anthropoids, where they then became nearly extinct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, within anthropoids, the lower number of detectable lineage-specific Alu monomers indicates inactivation with rather coincidental generation of only relatively few monomer-like tailless retropseudogenes (internal Alu priming generates monomer-like sequences34) or even recombination33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the high number of Alu monomers at the haplorrhine/anthropoid split correlates with a burst of LINE1 elements that can co-mobilize among other elements such as monomeric Alu SINEs (see Fig 1 of Pace and Feschotte35 for example).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In primates, the last observed intense activity of DNA transposons occurred on the lineage leading to anthropoids35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During that time, the tarsier lineage had already diverged, and we therefore hypothesized that it might reveal different DNA transposon activity patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reported pattern of mammalian DNA transposon activities comprised 284,000 elements inserted in the common mammalian ancestor, with 74,000 elements in the common primate ancestor, and 23,000 in the ancestor of anthropoid primates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an analysis of tarsier transposon insertions using the Genome Presence/Absence Compiler (GPAC), which screens for clear cases of presence or absence34, we determined from 29,966 full-length DNA transposons with clear presence/absence states (allowing for 20 nucleotide truncations; from a total of 126,481 full-length DNA transposons) that 87% (N=26,079) inserted in the ancestral lineage leading to Scandentia plus primates, 2.8% (N=849) inserted in the common ancestor of primates, 0.3% (N=91) in the haplorrhine ancestor, reflecting the short branch of haplorrhines, and 10% (N=2,930) in the ancestral anthropoid lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, only a few insertions (0.05%; N=17) were identified after the divergence of New World monkeys from the lineage leading to human.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hg19/tarSyr2.0.1 pairwise alignment revealed that 761 Charlie (hAT elements), 196 Tigger (Tc1/mariner elements), and 117 Mariner (Tc1/mariner elements) DNA transposons were restricted to tarsiers, which we consider a strong indication of specific activities on the branch leading to Tarsiiformes (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to LINEs, SINEs and DNA transposons, we also observed and examined TINEs (tarsier interspersed elements), repetitive elements specific to the tarsier genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TINEs accumulated in high copy number (see Supplementary Fig 3 for molecular overview) and were probably derived (that is, transcribed) from a tarsier-specific long terminal repeat (LTR77_TS) that was retropositionally silenced for a long time (there are no overlapping activity patterns with LTR77_TS and TINEs; see Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found 29,041 tarsier TINE1/2 copies (26,938 full length), previously described only as SINE-like repeats (www.girinst.org).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some investigators might suggest these are not necessarily SINE elements but instead ought to be classified as short retrosequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also identified 1,668 transposed elements representing another tarsier-specific repeat, which we refer to as TINE3s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These elements were likely derived from an inactivated MER83B-like LTR element that was also retropositionally inactivated for a long time, analogously to the mechanism suggested for TINE1/2-like transcription (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TINE1/2 and TINE3 elements on average exhibit 88 or 89% sequence similarity to their consensus sequences, respectively, indicating that TINEs were recently active, which is also supported by their TinT patterns (see below and Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Transposition in transposition (TinT) patterns of TINEs and SINEs over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Old LINE (L1) elements are displayed in dark green, younger L1s in light green.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TINEs and their proposed LTR_77_TS source gene are depicted in blue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The period of maximal activity is indicated as a central vertical line within the coloured ovals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flanking vertical lines represent the 75th percentile of the activity range;

this was further supported by overlapping TinT patterns (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also measured the activity ranges of tarsier SINEs, including some tarsier-specific Alus (for example, Alu1_TS), and determined that activity is both ancient and most likely ongoing (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cumulative TinTs represent the accumulated retroposon fixation probabilities over time37 and therefore provide more refined information about the historical patterns of these unique genome-shaping events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conducted such analyses for the genomes of tarsier and human in comparison to bushbaby and squirrel monkey, which identify the proportion of the tarsier TEs that inserted into other TEs arising from non-primates, the proportion that was active in prosimians, and the proportion that are tarsier- or human-specific (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analyses revealed that prosimians and anthropoids have different cumulative TE insertion patterns (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the observed bottleneck in tarsier populations that persisted over a long period of time resulted in a very compact cumulative pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Historical changes in population structures on the lineage leading to human are reflected by a more heterogeneous cumulative TinT pattern (that is, interrupted by many valleys within the graphical representation), which might reflect extended periods with larger effective populations sizes and comparatively lower rates of transposon fixation events (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although one might expect a greater degree of similarity between the tarsier and human patterns for the homologous, ancient elements (that is, the non-primate/non-prosimian area of the TinT), this zone differs due to more recent species-specific elements, each integrating independently into these silent elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These activitiesin species as distant as tarsier and humanreshape the historical (that is, shared) patterns in different ways, with the general shape of the patternsthe peaks and valleysproviding estimates about the occurrence of different insertion activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Cumulative likelihood of activity for DNA transposons and LTR retrotransposons.Cumulative TinTs are shown for bushbaby (Strepsirrhini Otolemur garnettii), tarsier (Tarsius syrichta), human (Homo sapiens), and squirrel monkey (New World monkey Saimiri boliviensis) genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patterns on the left show TinT genome scans for DNA transposons (red/blue;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Due to its unique phylogenetic placement among primates, as sister taxa to anthropoids, tarsiers are integral for understanding primate genome evolution, and these first analyses of an improved tarsier genome assembly reveal novel insights into ancestral features of our own genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically in this study, we better define the complex interrelationships among sustainment by adaptation (for example, positively selected genes), genome architectural changes (for example, by transposed elements), and epoch changes that possibly altered tarsier populations in pre- and post-modern times (for example, probable root in the Miocene/Eocene).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first focused on a detailed analysis of the genomic landscape of transposed elements (including subfamilies), which putatively include unique expansion events, given the expanded size of the tarsier genome relative to other primates49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous data, lacking information from tarsiers, indicated that DNA transposons were active at the initial split in primates but remained silent in all anthropoids35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results from our present analysis clearly indicate activity in the haplorrhine lineage leading to tarsiers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on this information and multiple pairwise genome alignments, we posit a narrower estimated time frame for transposon inactivation in primates, with its occurrence in the lineage leading to anthropoids after the divergence of Tarsius (between 58 and 40 Myr ago10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar inactivation pattern was observed for monomeric Alu elements, strongly indicating that Alu dimers and monomers were simultaneously active for millions of years until monomers became silent only in the lineage leading to anthropoids after the divergence of tarsier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different processes subsequently produced monomer-like, lineage-specific elements in anthropoids34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The cumulative activity pattern of TEs in the lineage leading to Tarsius also indicated a very different individual element fixation history compared with human.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tarsier pattern was less heterogeneous, which putatively resulted from comparatively higher rates of transposon fixation events due to extreme bottlenecks in tarsier populations that persisted over a long period of time compared with the human lineage (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primates are unique among therian mammals with the highest activity of the autonomous LINE1 retrotranspositional machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is illustrated by the extremely high retrotranspositional activity of LINE1 co-retrotransposed non-autonomous Alu SINEs29 (for the tarsier see Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LINE1 retrotransposons also co-retrotranspose more or less exclusively therian-specific retropseudogenes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of them are equipped, similar to LINEs, with an A-tail that increases the affinity to the LINE1 machinery50 (for example, mRNAs but also many other polyadenylated transcripts such as TINEs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the tarsier, an unusually high number of TINEs were derived from an ancient and otherwise defective LTR with internal polyadenylation signals and a functional RNA polymerase II promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detected tens of thousands of such tarsier-specific TINE copies mobilized by the LINE1 machinery and distributed genome-wide (Fig 1; Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to delineating the process of activation and propagation of these elements, we also found thousands of novel TINE elements, presumably derivatives of LINE1-mobilized MER83B partial transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Human LINE1 elements were reported to have a different distribution pattern than Alu SINEs, in that LINEs accumulated in AT-rich intergenic regions and Alu SINEs in more GC-rich, gene-rich genomic environments29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More detailed analysis showed however that older Alu SINE elements accumulated in more GC-rich regions while younger elements were relegated to AT-rich regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tarsier genome provided an opportunity to explore these patterns at greater phylogenetic depths, and our observations suggest the process is probably an ancestral feature in most primates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The transfer of mitochondrial DNA into the nuclear genome (numts) is common but varies in scope among species51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to insertions of transposed elements, we also examined the insertions of specific mitochondrial sequences in tarsiers, and to our knowledge, describe for the first time in mammals the integration of a complete mitochondrial genome into the nuclear genome (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In human, numts were estimated to have continuously occurred over a 58-million year period, mostly as a result of new events and not primarily through duplication of existing numts52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We contend this unique tarsier event offers a new perspective in comparing the evolutionary changes between the rapidly changing mitochondrial DNA and slowly changing nuclear sequences, both originating from the same source but evolving under very different selective constraints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, analysing the frequent phenomenon of nucleotide compositional changes in mitochondrial sequences and the duplication incidence of this intact mitochondria genome could provide new theories related to selection processes in the nuclear genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The evolution of the tarsier genome as a result of shifting repetitive elements and positive selection on the protein-coding regions represent some of the footprints of natural selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tarsiers are nocturnal insectivores, characterized as the most carnivorous primate, with morphological specializations of the visual and motor systems that render the species well adapted for leaping and catching prey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correspondingly, we detected tarsier-specific positive selection in several genes of the musculoskeletal and visual systems that are presumptively essential for this unique biology, relative to other primates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, FGF12, a member of the fibroblast growth factor family of genes, and genes that regulate FGF cellular levels (RGCC and WNT11) are all under selection pressure in the tarsier lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This FGF family has been implicated in supporting chondrogenesis and osteogenesis in a broad scope of studies53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If these gene pathways within a broader network are under evolutionary selection in tarsiers relative to other primates, perhaps these genes, as well as other yet unexplained contributors facilitate development of the unique musculature and skeletal system of the tarsier, such as their uncharacteristically large extremities compared with their body size1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, other members of this network, for instance IL1A, support a model of general hypertrophy (Supplementary Fig 6), suggesting putative underlying implications for the unique biology of tarsiers, including increased skeletal muscle mass54 to facilitate leaping behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, it may be partially responsible for the extreme orbital hypertrophy of tarsiers as an adaptive response for insect capture within a nocturnal environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we highlight a collective of eight genes associated with various eye development disorders, such as BFSP2, that in null mice display a deterioration of light scatter and lens optical properties55, providing further evidence for the adaptive importance of the visual system with regards to tarsier survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reported tarsier-specific protein alterations afford opportunities to refine our understanding of their role in differentiating the novel anatomical features of the tarsier; however, further molecular experimentation and more extensive sequencing of tarsier populations is needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Tarsiers were once a globally distributed phylogenetic group, but are currently restricted to Asias Sundaland region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the questionable future of various tarsier populations due to continued habitat destruction, their conservation is of upmost importance56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is apparent from our measurement of the effective population size, which is currently depicted as the lowest in tarsiers history (Fig 5), contrasting remarkably with many mammals, including human44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tarsiers unique position in the primate phylogeny, between the most basal strepsirrhines and the more derived anthropoids, including human, represents an exceptional link to understand and analyse our own evolution and to identify the ancient prerequisites for novel gene formation and disease-causing changes in primates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hope that the improved tarsier genome assembly will stimulate many follow-up studies of biodiversity and primate genetics, while also drawing deserved attention to this highly unique member of the primate order.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
