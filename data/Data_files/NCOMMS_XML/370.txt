Giant photoluminescence enhancement in tungsten-diselenidegold plasmonic hybrid structures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Impressive properties arise from the atomically thin nature of transition metal dichalcogenide two-dimensional materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, being atomically thin limits their optical absorption or emission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, enhancing their photoluminescence by plasmonic nanostructures is critical for integrating these materials in optoelectronic and photonic devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typical photoluminescence enhancement from transition metal dichalcogenides is 100-fold, with recent enhancement of 1,000-fold achieved by simultaneously enhancing absorption, emission and directionality of the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By suspending WSe2 flakes onto sub-20-nm-wide trenches in gold substrate, we report a giant photoluminescence enhancement of 20,000-fold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is attributed to an enhanced absorption of the pump laser due to the lateral gap plasmons confined in the trenches and the enhanced Purcell factor by the plasmonic nanostructure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work demonstrates the feasibility of giant photoluminescence enhancement in WSe2 with judiciously designed plasmonic nanostructures and paves a way towards the implementation of plasmon-enhanced transition metal dichalcogenide photodetectors, sensors and emitters.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Crystalline monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are direct bandgap two-dimensional (2D) material semiconductors that are promising as light-active materials for optoelectronic applications1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, TMDCs have shown great potential in ultrafast and ultrasensitive photodetectors and as ultrathin light absorbers and emitters3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, their application in photonic devices is limited by their low absolute photoluminescence (PL) caused by low quantum efficiency and weak absorption6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fortunately, significant enhancement is afforded by integrating noble metal nanostructures supporting localized surface plasmons7,8,9,10,11,12,13 and propagating surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs)14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Tungsten diselenide is a promising material in creating electrically excited light-emitting diodes1 and heterojunctions with MoS2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It proves to be a promising emitter at 750 nm wavelength with a quantum yield that is 2 orders of magnitude larger than that of MoS2 (refs 16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, PL enhancements from WSe2-plasmonic hybrid nanostructure have yet to be investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently reported enhancements in MoS2 are potentially close to the ultimate limit that can be achieved from this material9,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it is generally more challenging to achieve large enhancements from systems with a higher quantum yield, it is important to explore the ultimate limit in the PL enhancements that can be achieved in WSe2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report the surprisingly large PL enhancement factor (EF) of 20,000-fold from a single crystal monolayer of WSe2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WSe2-gold plasmonic hybrid nanostructures were created by suspending the monolayer over sub-20-nm-wide trenches that support lateral gap plasmons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By systematically tuning the gap plasmon resonances to the 633-nm pump laser, a close correlation was observed between the local near-field intensity, the Purcell factor and the measured PL enhancements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This paper sheds light on the utility of lateral gap plasmons in promoting excitation at the pump laser wavelength and emission at 750 nm, providing an effective way to obtain giant PL in TMDCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Distinct from previous plasmon-enhanced structures8,9,12,13, our hybrid plasmon-enhanced design provides full access to the top surface of WSe2, for example, for layering of other 2D materials, electrical top contacts, chemical doping or optical waveguiding.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

#@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, PL emission from WSe2 on unpatterned gold film is enhanced by sevenfold as compared with the emission from WSe2 on sapphire (Fig 2d), which might be due to the substrate-induced doping so as to reduce the non-radiative decay rates of the excitonic transitions26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the change in doping level could be induced from the downshift of

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Furthermore, the WSe2-gold plasmonic hybrid nanostructure allows us to conveniently evaluate a recent claim in the literature35, which states that suspended 2D materials are expected to have larger PL than the counterparts on a substrate, because the substrate depopulates the density of states in 2D materials through charger transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, as shown in Fig 5d,f, the gaps parallel to the pump laser polarization do not exhibit any stronger PL over its surrounding, although WSe2 is suspended here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it suggests that the suspension nature of WSe2 by the trenches contributes little to the PL enhancement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It should be noted here that the square geometry chosen has the advantage of being independent of the incident polarization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, if the incident polarization is either purely x-polarized or y-polarized, we will achieve the same PL EF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, for any other polarizations in-between, we always could decompose the incident optical field into the respective x-polarized component and y-polarized component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the PL emission intensity is linear with the excitation intensity, the PL EF remains the same.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Last, we would like to mention that there were no observable local heating effects in our experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In hybrid structure of MoS2-gold nanoantenna, an increased absorption of the laser light at the nanoantenna may cause local heating so as to red shift and broaden the MoS2 PL emission peak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simultaneously, the local heating might cause a reduction in PL intensity of MoS2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our experiment, the PL peak position and its full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of WSe2 on both patterned and unpatterned gold film have no power dependence (Supplementary Fig 8ad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, for the range of laser powers used, the integrated PL and peak intensity increase linearly with respect to the laser power (Supplementary Fig 8e,f), showing no signs of local heating effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, concentrating and manipulating the electromagnetic field in sub-20 nm trenches can achieve unprecedented PL enhancement of WSe2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tuning the resonance of lateral gap plasmons to match with the pump laser wavelength effectively boosts the lightmatter interactions in WSe2, thus enhancing the light emission efficiency of WSe2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A giant PL EF of 20,000 was observed in WSe2 when using the 633-nm pump laser.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect further PL enhancements to be achieved through the design of double-resonance structures with directionality control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work demonstrates an important method to enhance the PL of TMDCs since it could enable high-efficiency and high-quality photodetectors and sensors, where photon absorption and emission dictate the device performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incorporation of gold arrays with sub-20-nm-wide trenches onto WSe2 monolayers opens up a new platform for investigating novel electrical/optical properties in 2D materials, such as electroluminescence and second harmonic generation, speeding up the applications of novel optoelectronic devices.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Material growth and quality of WSe2', 'The triangular-shape monolayer WSe2 was grown on sapphire by the CVD method (Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This technique yields high-quality monolayer WSe2 with a crystal size of 4.5 m (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The typical PL spectrum of a pristine monolayer WSe2 (Supplementary Fig 2b) shows one pronounced emission peak at 768 nm (1.61 eV), that is, the A direct excitonic transition36,37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Raman spectrum excited by 532-nm laser is shown in the inset of Supplementary Fig 2b, where the two characteristic peaks for monolayer WSe2 on sapphire are at 248 cm1 and 259 cm1, which are from the degenerate  mode and 2LA(M) mode, respectively39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Fabrication of gold substrate and transferring of WSe2', 'The gold substrate consisting of patterned gold structure and unpatterned gold film was prepared by a template-stripping method (Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WSe2 flake was then transferred onto the gold substrate by a wet transfer approach (Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison with the direct patterning of metallic nanostructures onto TMDCs by EBL, transferring WSe2 on top of plasmonic nanostructure has several advantages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, it allows for direct incident laser irradiation on WSe2, instead of attenuated transmitted light irradiation on WSe2 through the plasmonic structures13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, it avoids the potential undesired damage or doping of WSe2 due to electron bombardment during electron-beam lithography process40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Last, the final structure will also be suitable for the direct access to the WSe2 flake, for example, for subsequent patterning or for contact to external leads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Characterizations', 'Atomic force microscope (AFM) images were measured by a BRUKER Dimension FastScan equipment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optical reflectance spectra of the sample were then measured by using a CRAIC UV-VIS-NIR micro-spectrophotometer model QDI 2010 (equipped with a × 36 objective lens with numerical aperture (NA)=0.5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, SEM images were measured by FEI Verios 460.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A confocal micro-PL set-up was used to excite the sample by using a 532-nm or 633-nm CW pump laser focused by a × 100 microscope objective lens (NA=0.65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PL emission was then collected by the same objective and detected by a nitrogen-cooled charge coupled device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spot sizes of the 532-nm and 633-nm pump lasers were 600 nm and 1.2 m, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PL mappings in Figs 2 and 5 were measured by the 532-nm laser as the smaller laser spot size of this gave a better PL mapping resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The background PL signals of pure gold nanostructures (Supplementary Figs 2e and 5c) were subtracted from all the PL spectra of WSe2 on patterned gold nanostructures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PL EF is defined by equation (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Numerical simulations', 'A commercial software package, Lumerical FDTD Solutions, was used to simulate the optical field distributions and Purcell factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Periodic boundary conditions were used along x- and y-axes, while perfect-matched layer was used along z-axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finest mesh size was set to be 0.5 nm in the structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The geometries of the metal nanostructures in the simulations were designed to match with the SEM images (Fig 3c), with a trench depth of 75 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fine adjustment in the geometry was done for every pitch, which explains the discontinuous jumps in the numerical data points (Fig 3b and Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulated EF of near-filed intensity is defined as the ratio of the simulated |E|2 on top of the trench to the simulated |E|2 on the unpatterned gold film at pump laser wavelength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To estimate the emission enhancement, we first calculated the Purcell factors for dipoles located on top of the trenches of gold nanostructures and for dipoles on top of the unpatterned gold film41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emission enhancement was then determined by the ratio of these Purcell factors, which can be obtained directly from the FDTD analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the classical calculations of Purcell factors do take into consideration both radiative and non-radiative rates for the dipole in the different environments42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Classically, the non-radiative decay rates are due to Ohmic losses in the metallic structures adjacent to the dipole.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
